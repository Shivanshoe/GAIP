hi today i want to talk about ignition systems [Music] these can be useful both for starting rocket engines as well as for starting fireworks and i'll start out with the warning we're going to be dealing with some extremely flammable materials and so if you're uncomfortable with the chemistry or with the techniques find somebody that has experience with this or don't try this yourself now a few weeks ago we went ahead and built some sugar-based solid rocket engines i went through the formulation of the fuels as well as the construction of the engines but we've only just gotten started we're going to be going to much larger engines as well as hybrid engines we're going to be going to more sophisticated fuels this fuel grain is based on an ammonium perchlorate htpb or rubber based composite fuel it's much more powerful than the sugar-based rocket engines it's much hotter and it's what the pros use now when we tested our engines outside we just used fuse in order to be able to get them started and fuse has the convenience of being super inexpensive and very easy to set up the problem is with fuses is first of all safety when you light a fuse you're committed and so even if you get a little troop of ducklings wandering across the field after you've lit it they're toast there's nothing you can do to stop it secondly the way a rocket engine is started is not optimal if you use a fuse because if you insert the fuse through the nozzle end like this what happens is the first combustible mixture that sees the advancing flame front is right down here near the nozzle and the best place to start the rocket engine is up at this end because when the flame initiates here the hot exhaust gases will travel down the central core and ignite the entire central core almost instantaneously providing you a very good start very reliable but when you initiate the flame here near the nozzle you create a bit of a vapor lock and so you're trying to get the fuel to be burned against the out floor the exhaust of the engine so it's a little bit less stable a little bit less reliable and furthermore if you're trying to start an engine that has a large internal volume a large engine the feeble heat of a fuse is not going to initiate the burn throughout the entire central cavity at the same time you want a lot more energy and if you get to hybrid engines you need even more energy than that so that's why we're going to get into using electric starters and augmentation of electric starters now the design of an electric starter most commercial starters is based on what's called a bridge wire if you see this thin gauge multi-stranded wire here you'll notice that i cut about a quarter of an inch to maybe i don't know centimeter centimeter and a half of insulation off of this end and i've bent most of the conductors away from the center right in the middle i have two thin conductors that are laying next to each other and if you put a little dab of solder on the far end of that and cut away the additional wires you have created what's called a bridge wire it's a resistive element sort of like an electric fuse and this resistor when energized by power through the big thick conductor here will get red hot very quickly and if you surround this with some very sensitive pyrotechnic material it will then burst into flame which will then start your engine and this is basically how commercial starters are built if you take a look at this electric match that's called what mjg firewire and you can buy these in quantity and they're based on the same sort of design which is a bridge wire with a small amount of pyrotechnic mix at the end there are other manufacturers that make different formats of the same sort of design but it's the same idea and in this particular case they also come with a little cap that when it slides over the end like this will direct the flame up toward the upper end of the engine so it's it's ideal now the thing is though you can make these yourself and the way that i've done this is rather than try to fabricate my own material i got a little kit from a company called quick burst and it's called hotshot and what this kit consists of is a small container with some carbon black a little bit of a binder which i believe is an acrylic resin and then a packet of oxidizer you mix all these together in a container like this and then you add acetone to it to create a slurry sort of a thin slurry that you can place on the end of your bridge wire now if you notice here this stuff has become very rigid very hard because the acetone even in a sealed container will quickly evaporate that's not a problem though because you can refurbish or essentially re-energize this as many times as you want by simply adding some fresh acetone so if you take a little dropper and this dried out mixture here and you add some acetone to it like this you can just stir this up now this takes a minute or two especially if it's gotten very very hard and if you've not added enough just add another dropper if you've added too much just leave it open for 10 minutes and it'll evaporate away so now that this is blended up you get to the point where the drop will tend to hang just like that then the way you use this material is you're going to take another thin conductor like this and you're going to strip a little bit of insulation from the end about a quarter of an inch half a centimeter or so and the trick to doing this is you're going to do it at right angles so that each of the blades will cut the insulation off the outside of this thin wire and we'll do that like this if i do it right not bad you'll see that you have the two parallel conductors right at this end like that then what you're going to do is you're going to insert this into the liquid like this and you're going to move it around a little bit so that there's no bubbles in between and you pull it out you can see you get a little bit of conductive material on there of the pyrotechnic material now if you wait about 10 seconds you can put it back in and get a little bit more in order to get a thicker larger spark now this stuff dries so quickly that with a within about 10 or 15 seconds you can actually touch this but something that you'll notice is i didn't create a bridge wire and the reason for that is because the carbon black in this material is conductive and so if we hook one that i've had sitting here for maybe about half an hour or so and we hook this up to the volt ohm meter like this and we'll turn this on so this has about nine ohms of resistance you want about six to 12 ohms of resistance so that if you put a 12 volt potential across here you're going to end up getting between 12 and 24 watts in that tiny little area so within a few milliseconds of connecting this up this will get red hot and it will burst and you don't have to make the bridge wire so it saves time now this kit is not cheap it's about forty dollars for one of these kits but because you can make hundreds of these and very quickly customize the amount of energy it's kind of a nice trick to have in addition to the commercially made units now the final issue is how do we get the flame big and we could theoretically keep dipping it into this quick burst but that's expensive and it's going to take a lot of time and that's why what i have over here is a setup to create an amplifier for our starters now the first thing you'll probably notice here is that i have an anti-static mat down here this is hooked up to the building's ground system and in the dry new england winters it gets very dry here and there's a potential to develop static charges which can create sparks which can ignite this very flammable fuel and so just like building a computer or electronics or lasers these are nice to have around when you're working with those in addition these come with little straps that you can put on your wrist in order to ground you so that you also won't develop a static charge furthermore when mixing this type of material you do not want to use plastic containers because when you create friction on plastic you have a chance of developing static electricity so a better material to use with these is glass and wood finally make up the least amount you need for your project you don't want to make up a huge tub of this and store it because as you'll see this stuff is extremely flammable now the materials used are very simple ammonium perchlorate aluminum powder and barium sulfate now these two materials come in different mesh sizes or granular sizes typically when you're building a composite rocket engine you'll use a 400 micron particle size it tends to control the burn velocity and it also allows you to pack a little bit more of the oxidizer into the the matrix binder for pyrotechnic mixtures 200 microns tends to be a little bit more common it's a little easier to blend and it's widely available you don't want to grind this up any finer because this will create a much more rapid burn you don't want that so the 200 micron is where you want to stick aluminum similarly size matters you want to be in the one to five micron range when the particles get too big the surface area goes down and it doesn't burn very well and if you get into the nano scale powders below a micron they become so unstable they can actually ignite in air so the optimal range is a few microns and five microns is what i found to be the best it's widely available it's inexpensive it blends well with the perchlorate and the formula is extremely simple equal amounts by weight of the perchlorate and the aluminum powder that's it the barium sulfate is an addition an interesting addition it acts as a catalyst to speed the reaction and it also changes what is sort of a white hot shower of sparks into a superheated gas i find that it starts the engines a little bit more reliably in addition it produces a beautiful green flame or superheated gas and so it's very pretty so i'll show you how to use this now what we're going to do is we're going to start out by mixing up a total of 10 grams of this material so we're going to use 5 grams of this and 5 grams of this so you're not going to be able to see the readings on the scale but trust me 5 grams is 5 grams so just mix that up right like this and it's not very demanding you could be off by about ten percent and the performance is very similar off by two percent that was quick and then the aluminum powder and once you start adding the second component remember you can't take it out so you want to go a little slow so we're going to go to a total of 10. good perfect now the best way to mix this is slowly by hand we don't want to use a coffee grinder or a ball mill or a blender because you don't want to develop high pressures high temperatures or any kind of static electricity so taking a wooden stick you just simply flip it like this just rotate and stir it only takes a couple minutes and i mean like two minutes and you get a nice blend where you can't see any of the white particles and any dark areas that are different in hue now what we're going to do is we're going to take five grams and put it back out back into this beaker here so what we're going to do is basically split the 10 into two equal amounts that's it now the barium sulfate this is added to the flash powder four parts to five parts so if we mixed up five grams here we're going to add four grams of the barium sulfate and then similarly we're going to mix this up the same way turn it on its side and just stir it now that they're mixed what we've got to do is we've got to get these to surround the starter because this is basically an amplifier so what we need to do is we need to get a starter to hold the material in a way that we can still insert it into the engine i've tried mixing this into pastes and wrapping it into little tubes but i found the easiest way to do that is simply a soda straw these standard flex straws even though we're not going to use the flex part of them or these straws that are made for malteds and milkshakes or if you're in a real hurry anyway by cutting these down to a segment that is two inches or five centimeters long in each case it creates a really nice starter you could certainly customize the length but this works well now in order to get this to work if we're going to use the commercial starter if we try to place this starter into the small straw it won't fit it won't connect and so if we take the little cap here and pull it all the way off what we're going to do is we're going to fix this in the end of the straw like this and i'll show you how in just a sec and in the case of the bigger straw like this one you'll see that we have a problem because it's so loose it won't fix in there so what i do is i take advantage of a bushing here made out of silicone rubber tubing this is a 3 8 od three thirty seconds wall thickness which is about nine millimeters and about two two and a half millimeters on the metric scale and i cut it into small segments so i've cut this into little 3 8 or centimeter long segments that act as bushings now if what you do is you take these and you place them on the end of the cap like this but not all the way so that you have a little bit of a taper at the end you can then insert this into the tubing like this except it's kind of tight it's hard to get this to insert all the way in and so you can use a little bit of a trick and that is isopropyl alcohol is an excellent very short acting lubricant for silicone tubing you can use it in the lab you can use it to put tight silicone tubing on glassware and metal tubes so what you do is you just dip the end of this into a small amount of isopropyl alcohol and now it just slips right in there like that and within about 30 seconds it's going to be dry and what you want is you want this to be inserted a little bit deep so that you have a little bit of a ridge here now i'm going to go over to the other table and i'm going to show you how we get these things fixed so that they're nice and secure okay so now what i have is a little vise here that i'm going to use just to hold this in a vertical position and then we're going to take a little hot glue and we're just going to put a small dab of the glue on top here not because we're trying to create any kind of watertight or airtight seal but this little flange effect will tend to keep this plug in under a little bit of back pressure when the burst occurs that's that's the only purpose of this then with respect to the small ones what we're going to do is we're going to put a small amount of the glue directly into the end of the straw like this just form a little glob and then while this is still liquid we take the starter and we're actually going to push it right through here right into here like this and we're just going to hold it there for maybe 15 seconds and while this cools and solidifies this will then stabilize and we have a starter now we have to fill this with the flash powder now we'll start out with the big one like this and we're going to fill this with the standard flash powder over here you can see it's a little darker than its partner and there's less of it because we haven't added as much powder and the trick to adding this is like really easy you simply use the stick to feed it in the end of the tube after you put a couple of doses in there then turn it vertically like this and give it a couple of taps just to make sure that the powder is in contact with the with the starter and you don't have any big gaps in there and then just continue on now when you get this to about a centimeter or so from the end you need to seal this now you could use hot glue i've actually tested the hot glue gun and even the tip with the flash powder it doesn't ignite it but it is getting pretty hot so i don't know that i would advise you to do that you could also put some silicone resin in there or some putty or even epoxy the problem with some epoxies is some formulations will react with the ammonium perchlorate and produce a lot of ammonia gas so you don't want to do that and i found that the west systems for example do produce a lot of gas and secondly you probably don't want a solid barrier here because when you do that and you don't give any way for the gases to get out it turns this more into a firecracker rather than a whoosh of hot gases or hot sparks and so the best thing to use i've found is simple cotton you simply take a piece of cotton like this and when you do about three or four of these you'll be able to estimate the size pretty well on a first take but you just roll this up into a little ball and you're going to push it into the end of the tube here like this now if you take off too much you can just pull this out and pull a little bit off if you do too little don't add a few extra pieces they tend to fall out just throw it away and get another piece of of wadding but you just push that in there like that and you're done now the little one is done the same way as the big one except it's a little bit more problematic to fill because of the small diameter but it is basically the same technique you simply take the little scooper and you feed it in here and then again when you get this to about a centimeter from the end just take another wad of cotton roll it up into a little ball like this insert it into the end like that and then press to fit like that and you're set you got two of them done now you could obviously do a dozen of these at a time now the question is how do you get this ignited how do you get this started now you can get starters online or at hobby shops which are basically just batteries and switches you can even get electronic systems that place a receiver and a battery next to the rocket and then a transmitter that you use remotely now i don't have anything to say negative about that type of design except i like the personal sort of visual of seeing wires connected or not connected and so i'm going to stay away from the electronics at least for now plus they can be very expensive so in looking into this i decided rather than just to buy something online i would go ahead and build it and let me show you the design i have for the starter that we're going to be using tonight okay you can see the layout of the starter we built is pretty straightforward we took one of our smaller 12 volt drone batteries and simply attached to this to the top of this base with a piece of very strong velcro this holds it in position but it lets you take it off and recharge it this has a lot of amp power capacity you could probably launch a thousand rockets with this particular battery now this attaches here and then it's connected up to a keyed switch we got this for like nine dollars on amazon very inexpensive and then we have an indicator tower over here which i also picked up on amazon for about fourteen dollars we'll put a link in the description below to these two particular items and the way this works is pretty straightforward we connect the battery up to the switch and you'll see that the green indicator light says that we have power in the system then when we hit the keyed connector over here you get both a visual and an auditory indicator that this switch is now live if we then hook this up to a 12 volt load like this and fire in the hole you can see that it works but if we hit the key you see that it doesn't so it's kind of a nice feature and the auditory is really nice to have when you're not looking at things and you're wiring them up it gives you a little bit of an extra safety feature now the other component here i'll turn this around just so that you can see this are these push to connect speaker posts simply by pushing this down you line up two holes that allow you to insert a wire and when you let go it securely supports this and these this probably cost a dollar you can get these things at any kind of a online shop and then finally underneath here you'll see i'm going to disconnect the battery power you see that we have mounted this on a couple of four anti-slip posts these little pads keep it stable on a table so that it doesn't slide off or rock and the way that i did the wiring for the inside of this is pretty simple i took advantage of this rigid pvc foam board that we use for so many of our projects because it's waterproof it's insulating electrically and thermally it's easy to glue and screw it's inexpensive it's lightweight and it it just works very nicely and it looks nice and then what i did is i simply hand routed a little notch into each of the two panels just to make some room for the hidden wiring between the two switches and then the wiring diagram itself is actually on the indicator light so this is like a no-brainer to construct and when you put this together again you have a nice stable mount that you can move in and out and works very well as you'll see in just a couple minutes now something else that you'll note here on these connector wires is i've done something that i do a lot in the laboratory and in the shop which is i cut the two conductors at a different length and then on each one of my starters i did the same sort of thing and what this does is it's another layer of safety it just tends to make it more difficult for you to accidentally short connectors and it's a nice trick you can always use insulating caps or cups or receptacles but it's just another layer of safety and it's a nice thing to do whenever you're going to be using exposed wiring so now what we're going to do is we're going to take this system outside and we're going to test both our homemade starters the commercial starters the augmented starters and we're also going to try to start some of our new composite rocket fuel so let's get going all right so let's hook up the electricity here okay so we have power this is the commercial electric match this is our homemade electric match fire in the hole all right this is the flash powder fire in the hole pretty good now this is the barium sulfate version of the flash powder fire in the hole notice how green it was okay this is going to be one of the bigger starters with the standard flash powder fire in the hole pretty impressive huh okay this is one of the larger starters with the standard flash powder fire in the hole okay this is one of the larger starters with the barium sulfate augmented flash powder fire in the hole wow okay so let's see if we can start some of this uh new composite rocket fuel with one of the starters fire in the hole [Music] admit it it's pretty good uh do you have another one or is that i can do another one boy that thing would have reached the stratosphere huh fire in the hole [Music] well that was a lot of fun let's try it again fire in the hole [Music] [Music] we're now nearly in orbit well while it's burning i guess i'll finish up [Music] so what we're going to do is we're going to use these starters to advance to more powerful engines obviously put some nozzles in these rockets so that we can get some real thrust we'll do some thrust measurements with our test sled and we'll be advancing both in size and in fuels so if you like what we're doing on this channel please subscribe and uh if you want to take a look at some of the other rocket videos that we've done you might find them interesting too please leave a comment if you liked what you saw or if you have any questions because i read them all and i try to answer any questions that you bring up and it gives us ideas for other videos and other subjects that we might be able to cover so thanks a lot for watching stay safe and we'll see you soon [Music] you
