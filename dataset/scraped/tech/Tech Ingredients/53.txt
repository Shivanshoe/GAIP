hi tonight what I want to talk about is alcohol how to obtain it and how to concentrate it and I also want to revisit something that I discussed earlier on how to sterilize or disinfect masks [Music] [Music] alcohol is the workhorse of most of the disinfectant solutions that you're going to find out there and we've covered how to modify it and enhance it by using either benzalkonium chloride or citric acid but the alcohol is because they're in such demand are difficult to obtain nowadays and so one of the things that we have to first eliminate is methanol as a potential option you can get this at auto supply stores for dehydrating gasoline and it is not a good disinfectant so we don't want to even look at methanol what we do want to do is look at either isopropyl or ethyl alcohol which are almost equal in their disinfectant capabilities the problem is that the optimal concentration for the alcohols is around 70% the point being that if you go to a lower concentration like 50% it's not very toxic to the microbes and if you go to a higher concentration like 90% it tends to sear the outer capsule and not penetrate quite as deeply it's not actually as lethal as the 70% concentration it's also becoming very difficult to obtain either of these concentrations although this is still pretty easily available if you go to ethyl alcohol you're basically going to booze and if you can obtain say Everclear which is a 75% solution of ethyl alcohol and water great but the problem is this too is becoming difficult to obtain and so you may be limited to say a high proof vodka and you at 50% it's still not high enough so what I'm going to discuss is techniques that you can use to increase the concentration of the alcohol now if you've seen some of our other videos I go into some detail not only about how to ferment and make your own alcohol from scratch but I also have a video that describes the process of distillation itself and it's an interesting process it's kind of fun and if you take a look at that I'll go through not only the principles and the mechanisms but the components of the apparatus and if you'd like that it might be something that you might want to get into because like I said it's kind of interesting however it does involve an investment and unless you want to do what I do when my wife say asked me to do some sort of a remodeling project and I use that as an excuse to buy hundreds of dollars worth of power tools you may not be interested in the process you might be just interested in the end result so you may not want to invest in this even though it is an interesting process you might just want to do something that's a little less expensive and a little bit easier now one of the advantages of distillation over any of the other techniques I'm going to show you is that it not only can draw the water out of the alcohol and concentrate it but it can also separate the individual alcohols from each other methanol from ethanol from isopropyl none of these other techniques do that they simply draw the water out but they're also a lot less expensive in terms of the initial investment one technique that you can use is what's called freeze crystallization or freeze concentrating and it's often done to say take hard cider or beer or wine and enhance the amount of alcohol by placing this low percentage concentration alcohol and water into a vessel or a flask inside of a freezer and as the surfaces of the container become cold you get these needle-like crystals of nearly pure water forming within the solution and therefore what's left still liquid is higher and higher in its alcohol concentration the problem with that is it only works to relatively low concentrating factors you can't get high concentrations of alcohol to concentrate that way first of all you probably don't have the ability to refrigerate up to a temperature that's going to freeze these you'd either need to use dry ice or liquid nitrogen and when you do that you tend to get sort of a slurry kind of a mush you don't get the fine crystals that you can then separate out in order to increase the concentration so it's not practical for this this application one technique that is available is what's called salt concentrating isopropyl and ethyl alcohol are completely soluble within water and if you sit a bottle of say 50:50 water and alcohol on a table it can sit there for years and you don't get a separation of the lighter alcohol and the heavier water because there's an affinity for the alcohol and the water the molecules actually have enough of an for each other that that affinity overcomes the differential densities of the liquid and that remain in solution forever however if you introduce an ionic compound like table salt sodium chloride the water which is very polar is very attracted to very highly polarized or ionic species like salt and so when you put the salt into a mixture of water and ethanol the salt will attract the water out of the isopropyl leaving behind a supernatant that has less water in it and a lower denser layer which contains saturated salt water so what I'm gonna do is show you how this works it's kind of neat I'm gonna take this jar ball jar and I'm going to fill it with 300 milliliters of 50 percent isopropyl and Walt water and then I'm going to blend into this a 6 to 1 by volume so 300 CCS and 50 cc's of simple salt this is kosher salt you can use any kind of salt you want and the quantity is not that critical as long as you use enough salt that not all of it dissolves you've essentially created a supersaturated solution 6 to 1 is a good ratio where you'll still have a little bit at the bottom anything in addition to that is simply going to be left or wasted but anything less than that in other words if you dissolve at all you probably haven't maximized the reaction now this takes a little bit of time to work I'm gonna let this sit for a little while but I'm gonna show you an interesting distinction between isopropyl and ethanol if I take 50% same concentration of ethyl alcohol in water and I add this into the jar to 300 milliliters and then I'm going to mix in the same quantity of salt in other words six to one or fifty CCS of salt into this and then we're gonna mix this up and let it sit for a few minutes now I want to shake this too much we'll just let this sit here like that now I'm going to show you how we measure the density of the alcohols this cylinder here I'm going to fill it with a 50 percent isopropyl and water and then I'm going to use a hydrometer to measure the density now this will float at different heights based on the density of the liquid it's in and then you'll see at the top the measurement of the amount or the percentage of the alcohol in the water it's calibrated for that purpose so we'll let it just sit down there for a second and stop spinning and we can see right here that this is running at about Oh 56% alcohol so it's a little bit they were a little generous in the concentration and if you take a look I don't know if I'm going to need to use the flashlight but you will start to see in the IPA or isopropyl alcohol right about here right about at this four ounce marker I'll see if the light helps us at all it may or it may not you can if I shake this a little bit you can also see that level kind of wiggling or moving back and forth this below here is the water and salt this up here is a concentrated solution of the isopropyl and ally cipro PO alcohol with a little bit of remnant water in it however you if you look at this this is the ethanol you don't get such a division now the reason this occurs is that isopropyl alcohol is a less polar molecule the water is the most polar of solvents it is very a symmetrical and it's electronic charge and as you get longer and longer hydrocarbons the liquids become less polar more oily less able to dissolve in water isopropyl has a rather weak affinity for the water Ethel which is a smaller hydrocarbon has greater affinity for the water so even though the salt will tend to pull hard enough to get the isopropyl separate from the water the ethanol is not so you can't use this technique in order to get the concentration the concentrating effect that you want with ethyl alcohol you have to use a different technique now just to demonstrate in fact that this worked what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this carefully I'm gonna try to remove the top without shaking this too much and over time this will continue to improve if I give this another half hour so I'm gonna actually gain a little bit more purification but this is gonna be enough for this purpose you remember that I demonstrated with this cylinder and with the hydrometer that I had about a 56 or so percent concentration if what I do now is I take a syringe now you can use a medical Toomey syringe you can use a simple 50 cc syringe if you're careful you can even use a basting syringe and what you want to do is you want to pull the liquid off the top without pulling this the concentrated liquid at the bottom out so as I draw this up I want to do it relatively slowly and right from the surface and as I do so I'm gonna primarily be pulling the alcohol off the top and leaving the water behind the slower the better and again the longer you wait the better this will work you could leave this overnight and leave this for days if you wanted to and you just get a little better result let's see if that's enough I probably should wait a little bit longer obviously I was being pretty quick but you can see that it already is concentrating a little bit more we're at about 62% and again if I wait about another half hour this will drop to about 65 and if I wait overnight I will get it to 70 we can't get this to work with the ethanol as I said it doesn't form any kind of a division and so in order to concentrate ethanol we have to use a different technique and that involves using what's called a molecular sieve now this is a very interesting material what they do when they form this is they take aluminum silicate and sodium silicate and they mix it with water and form sort of a paste and then they extrude this through what looks like a pasta maker into these long spaghetti 's and then they slice them up into these little prills they heat it to about 400 450 degrees centigrade dry it out and then the drying process causes small defects cracks and pores to form within the material as a result the surface area of this macroscopically might be say half a square meter but the surface area if you include all those little pores and cracks that form could be as much as a thousand square meters now surfaces all have a stickiness to them when you have a bulk material the atoms that are inside of the material have electrons that are attracted to their nuclei but they also are very slightly attracted to the nuclei that surround the the individual atoms and so there's a slight attraction in all directions isotropically around each one of the atoms but when you come to a surface the electrons are pulled slightly to their neighbors inside but the outside surface is somewhat needy and as a consequence there's a bit of an attraction to any other surface that may get near it all surfaces tend to attract each other and this force of attraction is called a Vander Waals force that force is useful because of the fact that on the nano scale it's it's powerful and it can actually pull molecules against a surface so when we form a molecular sieve the outer surface attracts molecules like alcohol and water but the inner surface because it has very small cracks in it will only attract molecules that can get inside of those pores when this is initially formed it has grooves and pores that are on the order of about four or five angstroms across but if they do what's called cation exchange they replace some of the sodium with potassium which is a larger atom some of those spaces narrow up a little bit and so instead of a 4 or 5 angstrom opening it'll have a 3 angstrom opening that's why this is called a 3 a 3 angstrom or 3 Pico meter molecular sieve water is one of the smallest molecules out there and has a diameter of about two and a half to two point eight angstroms it can get into the pores but the ethanol and the isopropyl is bigger three and a half to 4 angstroms it can't so when the surfaces attract the liquids the outer surface the macroscopic surface will be saturated by just a fraction of a milliliter of the alcohol but the inner surface can hold a great deal of alcohol as an adsorption and the water gets into the pores the alcohol concentration outside will increase versus the original solution and you can concentrate the alcohol by absorbing ad zorbing preferentially the water now what's interesting about this is that the process itself increases entropy and when you increase entropy create more randomness you mix things they tend to heat this process is exothermic so if I take the 50% ethanol and I add this to this desiccant in a one-to-one by volume ratio so if I have say 400 CCS of the molecular sieve I want to add 400 cc's of the 50/50 ethanol and water when I put that in here you're gonna see an interesting thing happen to the temperature it gets very very warm I'm going to turn on my little thermal monitor here put my probe in here you can see it's not even 20 degrees and when I pour this in here it becomes so hot it actually steams a little bit and you'll see that the temperature very quickly Rises and that is an interesting or useful endpoint because as the Coty's the temperature goes up obviously the adsorption process is continuing after a couple of hours all of the water has been absorbed this cools with equilibrium with the environment and this gets back to room temperature you're centrally done three or four hours is enough you can leave it longer but once it's cool the process is done let me show you how effective this is I'm going to take this and put it under a little filter a little coffee filter inside here to get rid of some of the fines the material if you abrade it or it around shake it around is relatively soft and you can get some of the material to sort of a braid off and you'll get a little bit of a foggy or a dustiness to it over time this will actually settle out if you wait overnight and the fogginess or the the cloudiness in the mixture will disappear and it will become crystal clear another trick you can use is to place this desiccant in what's called a sieve or like a flower sieve or a gold panners sieve that will allow you to take the entire disk shaped container and place it inside of a large pot pour your alcohol in there let it do its thing when you're done pull the alcohol or pull the sieve out and then let the material dry overnight to remove any of the organics that may be in it and then once the organics are done you can put the whole sieve into an oven at 260 degrees centigrade or 500 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours after that point you've driven all off all that absorbed water and you can reuse this over and over and over if you don't want to get something like the sieve in a pot you can do it the way I did and simply put it into an aluminum pan and cook it as I described making sure that you evaporate all of the solvent that may be on the outside because it's obviously flammable but once this appears to be dry the rest of it will be water now this was 50/50 alcohol and water pretty good now this will work with isopropyl this will also work with even low concentrations of alcohol like wines and beers and and apple cider but again as I said any method of concentrating ethanol is considered to be red a regulated business so as long as your government's remain intact and you don't want to get into trouble with local authorities this is just for educational purposes now while that's continuing to drain in here what I'd like to do is I want to get on to the idea of making a correction last video I had described a technique for sterilizing or decontaminating masks and I love the comments because when you're putting out videos that are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people inevitably there will be people out there that see the videos that know more about any topic that I talk about then I do there's going to be experts in every field and we got a lot of comments about my recommendation of the cleaning including a reference or a link to an article that was published by some researchers at the material science department at Stanford almost the same time that I had filmed that video they put out this paper and what they proved what they demonstrated is that the alcohol technique tends to inhibit or D functionalize part of the operation of these masks what happens is that a typical mask which has polypropylene fibers in it is made more efficient without making it super thick by putting an inorganic material on here which has a very strong surface charge in other words a very strong Van der Waals force and will attract particles like into the mask without making it super thick it makes it an n95 mask when you wash this off with either hydrogen peroxide liquid or detergent or ethanol what happens is you will neutralize some of that electrostatic effect now the the minerals are not soluble in the water or the alcohol but in fact it may mechanically remove some of them or it may actually bond to some of them reducing some of their electrostatic capabilities so you decrease the functionality of the mask even though it apparently doesn't change it they came up though with a better method and it turns out that it's easier because it doesn't use any consumables and what it involves is heating the mask in dry air 275 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes that's it you can achieve that kind of heating in a regular home oven I wouldn't recommend using that because a typical home oven is not very stable in its temperature their performance was rated on the fact that you get it 275 and you keep it at 75 for half an hour a normal home oven oven does this sort of up and down around the mean when especially a gas oven it heats it cools it doesn't maintain a very fixed temperature and secondly you might not want to take a skanky mask and put it into the same oven where you're cooking your food in a previous video that we had done I described very quickly touched on this small oven that you can make yourself for about 35 dollars out of very easily available materials that you use for curing epoxies and curing paints and I want to go into a little bit more detail about how you construct this because it's actually a very convenient device for cleaning the masks this fiber material is a resin bonded fiberglass that on its non metallized surface is good up to about 240 degrees 220 degrees centigrade so plenty hot it's also lightweight it's stiff it's easily cut with a box cutter and you can form it into a nice box shape of whatever dimension that you like a for maybe a half hours worth of work and about $15 using some alumina tape to adhere it so that it's not going to peel away or due to humidity this stuff is very good to resist humidity and temperature changes and because this is normally designed to work with heating and cooling systems to insulate ducts from outside temperatures retain the heat inside of ducting and a heating system it's made for this purpose once you form your box and you have the dimensions of the bottom you can then simply cut a square that is equal to the size of the bottom and then without needing any kind of fancy brackets or any kind of hinges you simply drop the container over the bottom and you have a sealed insulated box it's very easy to build in addition when you're done with this or you want to store this it's easy to put this on a shelf and simply slip this inside and you put it on a shelf super easy the heating is also very easy if you take some simple incandescent light bulbs in Europe I guess these are difficult to obtain but you can get them specialty for save the lights inside of an oven but a typical light bulb is perfectly fine with the temperature and an incandescent light bulb rated at a hundred watts produces a hundred watts of heat whether it's making it light or infrared it's 100 watts as one hundred watts if you wire these in parallel to each other each one is drawing a hundred and twenty volts as it does in the United States and if you use silicone based wire this is a very nice wire because it's a lot more flexible than the tipo typical electrical wiring that you use in your house and this is good 275 degrees centigrade this is up to one hundred and fifty degrees centigrade it's relatively inexpensive it's easier to work with and good for high temperatures and if you get the fixtures for the lights made out of ceramic instead of plastic a ceramic material this also is good for high temperature if on the bottom surface you're going to put these down on the aluminized surface you're going to want to cut a small circle and peel the material off so you don't have a grounding that can occur across the electrical contacts I discovered that the hard way and once you've attached these or place these on here then to attach them you simply take a couple of fender washers and some long screws to penetrate here into some small nuts and if you effectively tighten these down enough you can cause them to become flush with the surface so that you don't need any legs and it won't scratch a tabletop it's really easy and then finally to control the temperature on eBay or on Amazon you can obtain these thermostatically-controlled relays that you can adjust the temperature in one degree increments these can be obtained for maybe about twelve fourteen dollars up to about thirty dollars they'll work either on 120 or 220 volt and they have a little thermal probe so that when you build your box and you put the top down like this you can then either drill a hole in the top or you can drill a hole in the side and simply insert the probe down to about the height where you're going to be doing your you're heating because the box is so well insulated and the heat source is relatively low grade the differentials in the box are so small you don't need to use any kind of a cooling fan or distribution fan it's not necessary the differentials are very small so it keeps it very simple and when you're done with this you can use this obviously for epoxy work or curing work or you can simply take the box cutter and slice this up again and throw it away it's inexpensive it's very easy it's very convenient to use so I'd recommend doing this instead of the alcohol technique I appreciate the the advice from people about using these different sorts of techniques and what's interesting is when I had criticized the w-h-o and the CDC about the recommendations for the masks and went through the principles and gave some examples as to why it was an incorrect recommendation that people who do not have an infection should not be wearing the masks it turns out that they've turned around in their recommendations and have now agreed with us so anybody who thought about it thought through the process would have come to the same conclusion but a few weeks earlier than they did now that brings up another point and I want to sort of conclude the video with this and that is the safety measures that I'm showing you here our real-time safety measures how we protect ourselves kind of like getting a fire alarm in a house but one of the things that we do have to consider is the source of this virus is going to be something that we're going to have to at some point get a better handle on because it doesn't make a lot of sense to get a fire alarm but not take care of the oily rags or the bad wiring in your house if this can reoccur because we don't know how it occurred we're gonna have to deal with this again and again and again and the source and the agencies that have been dealing with this obviously have a vested interest in what's revealed because potentially with the deaths involved in this disease as well as the huge global impact there's going to be a lot of cover your rear end about what caused this virus so I don't want to touch any more closely on this rather delicate component of this whole issue I want to suggest that you continue to use your head don't panic because as I said before I really don't think that this is going to be turn out to be worse than we fear I think it's actually going to turn out to be less serious than we fear but again being more prepared is better than being less prepared so don't panic please don't worry just use your head stay safe subscribe give us a thumbs up and give us a comment and I'll try to answer as many of the questions as I get I'm sure there'll be a lot you have a wonderful night and [Music] you
