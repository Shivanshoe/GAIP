so let me show you how well this works [Applause] and so what we're going to do is we're going to refrigerate a real food load i've got a bottle of wine i have a dozen eggs a pie a couple of packs of hot dogs six pack of beer and a six pack of coke and what we're gonna do is i'm gonna place this temperature probe inside of the coat and we're gonna see how long it takes to bring this load down from room temperature down to about 37 38 degrees fahrenheit which is a good temperature for refrigerator waterproof hatch that allows us to store items so we can put tools and extra line [Music] supplies and fall weather gear [Music] but as i said this requires a lot of experimentation and we grew up it's usually a nice thing to know that you've got plenty of chocolate to work with so i'd always recommend ordering this by the kilo and because you probably will find that even if you do a good job and you like the result practice makes perfect hi we did it [Music] 100 000 subscribers [Music] [Music] uh [Music] the bulk of the material is going to come through this tube but by alex watching the end of the tube [Music] now we started off with about two gallons of water grams and uh out of that total amount [Music] and out of that i expected bananas that we should end up getting about two meters of fairly strong spirits [Music] so [Music] this is a desiccant-based air conditioning system [Music] and even within a few minutes you'll begin to see that color develop after about a week you'll see this this is some of the low temperature i believe this was 180 degree toast this was a 220 toast and within about a week you begin to get a very nice rich color here and you can begin to taste the flavors [Music] and as you can see the beam is about a third of the diameter of the strip if i introduce some turbulence into the beam you can see that not only does the beam defocus substantially and you can see that in the beam that moves across the room as well as the fact that you can see a good half of the energy doesn't even hit the strip [Music] one two three three no question this stuff works and it does make you smile you can't help [Music] [Music] fusion thermonuclear fusion energy [Music] it's to be firing in a few seconds here i've got it on a fairly low button if you saw the camera shake that was my cameraman being shocked a little bit by power levels [Music] so [Music] in any case i want to thank you very much for watching this was a lot of fun [Music] [Music] [Music] as well as an enormous number of batteries so we try to decide what's going to do with that and we came up with this [Music] happy building and have great attitude [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] today what i want to talk about is epoxy [Music] so for something completely different fog machines [Music] now as i said you can make these things bigger [Music] to begin with when we moved from the midwest about 15 years ago to new england we moved from a rather large house to a rather small and quaint timber frame home that had a lot of land associated with it but it did not have enough storage space it did not have a garage it did not have a shop or a laboratory and so what we did is we took a couple of acres cleared the trees took the trees to a local lumber mill had the lumber cut up stick stacked to dry for about a year and then it was then milled into the lumber that you see that makes up the inside of this room with the exception of the particle board and the plywood and the doors everything that you see in here was obtained from the trees that were harvested from this area including even the tables that are in this room were made from those very trees the underlying structure of this building is a timber frame skeleton and as you can see in the ceiling and some of the walls the very large posts and beams that make up the structure of the building [Music] i really think you're going to like this video today [Music] let's try it [Music] how can you not smile [Music] ah hi today i'm going to talk to you about boats [Music] [Music] you
