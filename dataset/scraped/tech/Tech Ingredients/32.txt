hi a couple of months ago we began a series of videos on rocket engines [Music] i started out with the formulation and fabrication of a sugar-based solid rocket fuel we went ahead and tested those engines outside and we then followed with a video on building your own ignition system as well as how to augment commercial ignition systems for larger rocket engines we're going to proceed with even more advanced fuels for example the next video is going to be on the htpb or rubber based ammonium perchlorate fuel which is basically the same formula that's used in the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle much hotter much more powerful but it involves different fabrication techniques such as pouring a grain and trimming and jigging for drilling and eventually the release of very neat compact fuel grains that can then be inserted into rocket motor casings of arbitrary size now i'm not quite ready to present that full video and go into the details but in the process of setting up for this video i had to build a lot more of the large igniters and i thought it might be kind of interesting to do a short video where we take these igniters back outside and re-film some of their ignition with the new high-speed camera we have dig a little bit deeper into the ignition process in addition i want to take advantage of an opportunity to correct a misunderstanding when we blasted those huge blow torches of flame into the sky a lot of people thought that what we were doing is actually testing rocket engines and we weren't as we won't be doing that today what we were doing is in cardboard tubes we were igniting fuel grains test fuel formulas to see how they would burn so you can imagine if you added a nozzle to one of these and made them fabricated them as actual engines how powerful those things would really be finally what i want to do is an experiment that i haven't even tried yet so you're going to learn along with me as to whether or not it works but we're going to take our 40 000 volt pulsed power supply and actually send that power into some of these fuel grains and see whether or not we can ignite fuel without necessarily needing to use a bridge wire igniter so that should be kind of exciting so we're going to go ahead go outside set up the cameras and fire off some of these and see what happens come on so this is one of our small augmented igniters with the standard flash powder okay three two one go three two one go [Music] this is one of our augmented starters with the barium sulfate mixture three two one go they're different three two one go [Music] okay this is going to be one of our larger augmented starters with the standard aluminum flash power three two one go three two one go okay this is the larger augmented starter with the barium sulfate mixture all right three two one go jesus pack that little touch yeah i'm not expecting that three two one go jesus [Music] okay this is one of the augmented starters with the uh barium sulfate mixture three two one go in three two one go [Music] okay this is one of our test grains with the iron oxide catalyzed htpb composite rocket fuel all right three two one go three two one go so this is one of our test grains of the non-iron oxide catalyzed http composite rocket fuel all right three two one go three two one go [Music] three two one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that was pretty cool as soon as we get the video on the advanced fuel finished we'll go ahead and post that and if you find the topic interesting you might want to take a look at some of the other videos that we've posted on rocket engines the channel covers a broad range of scientific topics and you might also find some of the other videos that we put up interesting as well if you have a suggestion or a question please post it in the comments below because i read all of them and i try to answer as many questions as possible and it also gives us ideas for other videos that we might want to pursue so i'll leave you with a warning to stay safe have fun and you have a great evening good night [Music] you
