I last week we did a video showing some of the things that you can do with a co2 or dry ice fog [Music] [Music] tonight what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through some of the principals and the assembly of the actual machine and then in the description below this video I'm going to link to some PDF files that give the actual dimensions as well as the components that we used and links to the sources for the components so by watching this video as well as taking a look at those files you could have enough information to be able to reproduce what I did here and if you want to modify it you'll have a great starting point for anything that you want to build based on a machine that you know works now if you take a look at some of the earliest videos that we've done on this channel I demonstrate some powerful laser projectors that I built for laser shows that we've done over the years both in clubs and outdoors and something that you learn early on is that a laser beam passing through perfectly clear air is invisible you can't see it and if you want to get that you know Star Wars kind of look - the laser beams you need particles or droplets in the air in order to be able to refract or reflect the beam now typically what's done is they use what's called either a fogger or a Heiser which is a hot source of tiny droplets that produce a very fine mist or fog in order to be able to reflect the beam now a more common commercial consumer-level device is usually based on glycerin that's called a fogger the higher-end DJ type systems are often based on oil and that's called a Heiser in both cases though they produce droplets of an organic liquid that's been heated and even though the liquid is heavier than air the vapor that's coming out of there is pretty hot and so it tends to be neutrally buoyant consequently it fills a room relatively homogeneous lee and so the the vapor will fill the room and there will be no sort of layering effect which is good for a laser show but if you want to control the vapor or to control the fog get more of a stratified appearance a co2 fogger is great because the fog that comes out of it tends to be heavy and hugs the ground so if you want that River dance look or that dancing on the clouds type of an effect this is a good alternative it's a good complement to the typical fogger and Heiser another disadvantage of these particular devices is because they're putting an organic vapor or droplets into the air eventually they will settle on two surfaces even though the glycerin based is water soluble they will both make a sticky film that will get everywhere it'll get on the floor furniture carpets it's a mess the advantage with the co2 fogger is that it's pure water droplets that are producing the fog so even though there is a little bit of an issue with that water as I'll get to in just a little bit nevertheless you won't contaminate anything so it's kind of another advantage one of the sort of disadvantages is is that it produces larger droplets so they don't tend to have the same persistence it doesn't last as long but as a complement to the hazers in the farmers it's a great tool to have if you're trying to produce that type of an effect now anybody who's ever taken a Halloween party and put a punch bowl on the table and put some dry ice into it in order to produce fog you actually are making a co2 or dry ice fog or one of the things that you'll notice is when you first put the ice into the water you get a great fog and it looks really good but then usually after a couple of minutes you look at it and it's kind of feeble even though when you look around you see that the ice is still there the reason that happens is because the fog that comes off of these these bowls is not actually the co2 it's the condensed water droplets from the humidity that forms over the warm water as the ice-cold co2 that's sublimating off of the dry ice rises through it it condenses the water droplets and so it's the water droplets you see as the co2 or the dry ice cools the liquid the vapor pressure of the water vapor above the bowl Croesus there's less humidity to condense and if you look inside especially if you're using those larger chunks of dry ice you'll actually get water ice shells that form around them insulating them from the water and decreasing the sublimation rate and again making the output lower that's why one of the big important things in these machines is you want a large quantity of very hot water to counteract that effect and so heating is going to be an important feature another nice thing about using a machine as opposed to say just a bowl of some hot water and some dry ice is you can turn it on and turn it off which is nice for a theatrical effect now the system that I've used here is based on the core which is a basket basically what this is is it's a stainless steel basket that holds the dry ice you can see it's pretty big this is able to hold about 15 kilograms of dry ice and you're gonna need a lot it goes through ice very quickly to fill a room like this and maintain it through a production you're gonna need about 15 or 20 kilograms of dry ice that's a lot it's cheap but keep that in mind when you buy it you're going to need to be able to fill a basket like this which can hold about 15 kilograms of dry ice and the basket itself needs to have holes that allow the water and the dry ice to be able to interact it needs to be strong and it needs to be something that you're going to be able to lift so it can't be so big that you can't manhandle it this is a parts washing basket and new will cost you about a hundred and fifty dollars but you can get these used on eBay like I did for about thirty dollars it came pretty nasty but after I cleaned off all the gunk it looks pretty good it's strong it has a good shape and this size which is thirteen by nine by six inches is sufficient to be able to hold 15 kilograms of dry ice if you can't get exactly this dimension you may have to modify some of the dimensions I give you in the box but this will determine what you're going to be using for the system now in a typical commercial system the cheap the low-end systems this thing will be raised and lowered into a reservoir of hot water by some pretty heavy-duty levers those systems are I think a little bit less efficient because of the fact that you need pretty robust levers to lift up 15 kilograms of ice inside of the box so you've got to be able to crank on it they have to be built pretty strongly in addition this system here it requires that you have to lift the basket out of the hot water and be able to lower it into the hot water and so it makes the box itself larger for any given capacity so what we decided to do is base this on a system like the high end units which is we pump hot water up through the ice and then we drizzle it down onto the dry ice and drop it through the dry ice that's really nice because of the fact that the hot water is easy to manipulate you can make it more compact and also gives us the ability of not having to manhandle this heavy basket full of ice now if you look I'll tip this down for the camera so that you can see this to make this easier inside of this box you will see that there are two metal brackets in there l-l shapes out of aluminum that I milled a couple of notches in so that they will hold the bottom of the basket without it sliding around and then they will also act to keep the heating elements that I'm using off the bottom of the box so if they get hotspots they don't melt into the material of the box it's a nice setup you may have to modify this a little bit from my drawings again depending on the shape of the basket that you're using but this isn't complicated you can basically take a look at this and see what's necessary in order to be able to hold it up now when this goes into the box and you don't really necessarily have to see it I'll show it to you a little bit later what you're gonna then end up doing is you're going to need to build the box and as you can tell from here from here from the ultrasonic cleaners that I've got over there I really like this PVC foam board it's got a lot of advantages for this project probably the most important is it's cheap it also is widely available it is electrically and thermally insulating it also takes glue well holds screws well it is waterproof and it's easy to machine and if I didn't mention it's cheap it's cheap and it looks nice it produces a nice finish and it's just it's attractive so I like using this now anybody aware of PVC knows that PVC has a temperature rating you're not supposed to use it over sixty degrees centigrade or a hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit one of the issues there is that that temperature limit is based on structural integrity if you have a pipe fitting it's guaranteed to a certain pressure at that temperature if you take boiling water here and you take some of this insulating foam board and you put it in the boiling water it won't melt the the foam board and it won't dissolve it but what it will do is it will make it spongy it'll make it weaker now you might think well then your box is gonna fall apart no it doesn't because this stuff is such a good thermal insulator that the inside of the box may get soft may get a little bit spongy but by the time you get to the outside of the box you can barely tell this is on even if there's boiling hot water inside of it so structurally this is perfectly fine even though the inside might get a little overheated because we're not using this at high pressure so the PVC foam is an excellent material for this and in addition to that the fact that it tends to be light makes the box a little bit more mobile and easier to use now as you can see the way I fabricated this is I simply built a square box structure with these butt joints here and if you look carefully you'll see that there's actually two layers of the material on the bottom I don't really need that for structural purposes but I wanted a thicker piece of material so that the wheels that are put on the bottom when I drive the screws into them they don't have to penetrate the box and they have a little bit more material in order to bite into so that's the reason for the doubling up nevertheless it adds a little bit of weight and it also makes the box a little bit stiffer and so that just makes things a little bit easier to move around you need the wheels because with 20 kilograms of ice 10 kilograms of water the underlying structure of this box you're talking about 40 plus kilograms 90 plus pounds you need wheels you don't want to be moving this thing around when this thing is completely loaded as you can see if you take a look at what happened here this has basically you know gotten like a dish sponge it's pretty soft it'll harden up and actually this is a nice way to be able to form this material in shapes if you ever want to do that but as you can see this is certainly not something that you're gonna want to build a box out if you're gonna heat both surfaces in the entire box is gonna get hot this is already starting to stiffen up so again a nice technique to have in your repertoire now if you look at the way that the box is set up you'll see on the back surface most of the action is happening on the back of this box I've hooked up a couple of these pumps I really like these pumps these are solar water heater pumps we have about a dozen of them I bought them for about $20 each in quantity but I think you can get these for about 28 30 dollars each on Amazon they are submersible 12-volt pumps that are good up to 50 degrees centigrade submerged but they will pump up to 100 degrees centigrade boiling hot water through here and at less than an amp and 12 volts they'll lift the water this high and move 8 liters per minute per pump so I have both pumps hooked up here to a 15 volt power supply it's intermittent it doesn't matter it works fine at that slightly higher power level but I get 10 litres out of each pump so I pumped 20 litres on to the dry ice every minute so it's a lot of water the module here that converts the line voltage into the 15 volts is then just interrupted on its positive side so I have this little switch that allows me to turn the pumps on whenever I want to pour hot water on under the under the dry ice the other thing that you'll see on the back here are these two large temperature controllers now I wouldn't necessarily recommend using the heaters that I'm using for this simply because these are really high quality I use them around the lab I use these in order to heat the die laser dyes for for the laser system so I had them so for me they were free but if you wanted to buy these things new they're about 130 dollars so you might not want to go this way even though it's convenient it has a nice temperature controller and limiter it's a nice setup but nevertheless you might want to try a different different method the way that I put these in if you do decide to go this way is they have these long totally immersive heating elements and what I'm going to do you don't really have to look in the box until a little bit later but I passed these through these large holes that are well above the water line put them all the way through here like this and then there is a protective sheath that goes on the outside of this screws all the way down here like this onto this fine thread a little bit like three days of The Jackal get my sniper right up rifle ready tighten that up and then I lay this across those two aluminum brackets down there and I repeat the same action over on the other side put this one through here like this then I put these crosswise onto the bottom of the box like this there and then with this small spring I use this to be able to compel the two units to sit away from the edges here so that they don't touch so there's nothing but metal or water that these two 1300 watt heaters contact and then what I do is I fill this up with some water and put the basket on top of it and this whole unit will take about 15 minutes maybe 18 minutes to heat up 8 liters of water right to the bottom of the basket then if you look back here one more time you'll see that I've taken these Stoppers I've split them and these Stoppers go around the feeds and then if I push these up into these large oversized holes again well above the water lines so we're not trying to get watertight but what we are doing is we're sealing this up against any kind of spray that may occur from the pumps just give that a little push in there like that it's tight and that way we don't get any water leakage now as I said one of the issues that you have with this is that these things are expensive there's another alternative to this if it turns out that you want to build bigger units and you want to make this a lot cheaper and that is a ten dollar hot water heater element these come in 120 and 240 volt to come all the way up to like five kilowatts per and the system to get these things to fit in a box like this is this metal plate that you see that I fabricated here simply as a large diameter one inch or two I think it's about 28 millimeter hole and then a little one-inch pipe thread nut here with an o-ring on the outside when you squeeze this down like this and then just drill an oversized hole inside of your box you insert this in here like this put some screws on here a little bit of gasket sealant and now you could just hook this up to your wall and for $10 an accord you got a 2000 watt heater now you could just do that it's very cheap one thing though is if you forget to heat fill this with water or it boils the water out what will end up happening is you'll cause a fire so you might want to have a controller and for this kind of power level the best way to do that is to get a little cheap eight dollar either an Arduino or a little eight dollar temperature thermostat it's a little DC voltage relay based on a preset temperature that you can set for whatever temperature you like it has a little probe that then can be adhered to the plate which is in contact with the water so if you run out of water or you it off or you didn't add it this plate will almost immediately heat up from the heat of the element here and turn the unit off or you could preset it if you don't want to run at boiling temperatures which would be the natural limit or if all you did is just took this up and let it boil and then this little DC power supply power is a crydom solid-state relay these come 120 240 volt all the way up to a hundred amps you could put 20 kilowatts through this little thing using this little controller cost you about sixty dollars cost you about eight or nine dollars and basically you could put 10 kilowatts into a unit like this or you know a much much larger unit and heat is important because the hotter you can make the water and the hotter you can keep it the longer you can push out the smoke with a the fog before the co2 or the dry ice has cooled it and you've lowered your your heating rate so now what I'm going to do is show you a little bit more about how the pumps are set up because I want to make sure that you have all the information not just overview not just theoretical the pumps go through a little penetration deep down low as low as I can get it half inch hole with a half inch NPT tapered pipe thread here with a little pipe thread tape on here I screwed this in until it got tight it does not leak even at boiling temperatures that's fine no gasket material no lubricant then a simple female half-inch over here to a large diameter hose barb and then soft silicone rubber tubing silicone rubber is nice because it's very good to high temperatures and it's very flexible despite the large diameter and then at this end I have a half inch NPT a type of thread to the right angle hose barb and then on the inside of the box what I do is I take a Forstner bit and I drill about halfway through the material here making this a little bit thinner and then with a CPVC high-temperature fitting and this threaded piece here I simply screw the two things together and squeeze the box between these things as they tighten down this gives me a nice fitting and then I just have a friction fitting here into which I can put the nozzle take a look at what happens here one two three pretty good now one of the problems with this as I'll show you is if you put the basket in here and you Center the basket and get it nice and love old myths everything is all good and then you hit the switch you'll notice that all the water ends up in two tiny little beams problem with that is you're gonna end up drilling holes through your dry ice and as soon as you get to the other side of it you're not gonna interact very well with the co2 now one of the things I tried to do is I replace these simple 45-degree angles with something that I put some interrupters in something to cause the the water to break up a little bit so compared to the one on the right I'm going to put this one in over here on the left like that and then you can see the difference in the effects on three one two three little better spray little better distribution but it still isn't good enough so then what I elected to do is rather than using this or a cap with little holes drilled into it which restricts flow I built this little tray I'm gonna show this to you over here I'm gonna come to the front and maybe this is the best way for me to show this to you I took a piece of 22 gauge aluminum you don't need any tools other than a vice and appliers and a hammer and I bent up the sides like this at a 90 degree angle to form a tray and then in the open end what I did is I cut a little notch as you can see and then bent it down to the bottom so that it acts as a standoff and this sits on the top of the basket and then the white is simply a piece of the PVC foam board that I cut and then I trimmed a little notch out here again to clear the handle on my particular cleaner and then drilled four millimeter or three 16 inch diameter holes in a square pattern and then putting this on top of the tray I'll show this outside of the box so that you can seal this a little bit better than inside the box like this this sits on top of the tray and now when this fills up with water you get a nice distribution of water all over the ice and you'll consume it all from the top down now because this box may not be on a level floor or this thing might sit a little bit crooked you don't want the sheets of water to be pouring off one side as it sort of oozes out through the holes it kind of drips down so you can see on the bottom here what I did is on the holes I caused them to pucker so that each one of the holes bulges out and forms a little nozzle so that the water will actually drip from the location that it penetrates the holes and the way I did that was actually very easy I took the tray after the holes are drilled put it on top of a piece of soft styrofoam then taking one of my armored balls for our body armor glued it on the end of this hammer handle and then just put it over each hole and tapped it with a hammer causing the Bulge whenever you cause a lot of dents on one side of a piece of sheet metal it'll cause a concavity a bowl shape so then I simply turned it over and between the holes I put the ball down like this gave it another tap and ended up producing a grid of dents in this side which then produces a very stiff layer at the same time it's flat so that it sits nice on top of the box this is very light because it's 22 gauge it doesn't have a lot of thermal inertia so that it gets cold on top of the ice but when the hot water pours on it it's not heating the aluminum before it drips through this is very easy very lightweight very inexpensive and you can do this pretty easily but you may have to again modify the shape a little bit if you've got to fit around your particular basket with your particular handles so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to put the pass get in there with some ice so I'm gonna fill this up with some ice I'm gonna put the drip tray on top of here and then we're gonna move toward actually demonstrating the unit itself this is called pril dry ice instead of the big chunks and you can get it in all different shapes and sizes but this I find the best because it seems to dissolve the fastest it's got a great amount of surface area like I said it'll take about 15 or 20 minutes and something to keep in mind with this system is that because of the fact that you're growing 1300 watts of circuit generally speaking you're gonna need to use dual circuits unless you're doing your unless you're doing your demonstration at a big facility that's got 220 volt high amperage lines or you know big phase current so that's why it's usually a good idea even if you have a high-powered system to divide it up into more convenient systems so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to add this to the top of the box like that and now I'm gonna talk to you about the top the top here is the same foam board I just sort of but glued these square frames around here so this sits inside of the box and tends to prevent spray so that we're not depending completely on the gasket because it gets pretty wet and a lot of spray going around on inside the box you need the gasket because you do develop some pressure inside of there when it's brushing to smoke out and if you don't seal this you'll get sort of spritzes of smoke coming out of the sides so this hollow tube a little adhesive here this shouldn't get wet so whether tight or whether quality is good enough for this and then on the back surface you can see the hinges which are removable hinges the pins actually come out which is kind of nice because it makes it possible to be able to remove this and then you'll also notice this lightweight PVC fitting that I have in here is located in a hole that I drilled with a hole saw a little undersized and just with five minutes of hand sanding and fitting I get a friction fit with a typical four inch diameter PVC fitting and then I made a ring in the bottom surface like this holesaw second hole saw two small that forms a little Ridge here as the bottom of the pipe so when I put the pipe in by just forcing it in it doesn't keep just dropping through makes it a nice fit so then when I put the hinges on I simply have to line this up like this and this sometimes a little tricky if I'm in a hurry but it's usually not too bad and you get the two holes in there like this taking the lid off as opposed to a permanent hinge makes it a little easier just to mess around with it but it's not really necessary it's probably overkill and then when you drop this thing down with these little eyelets on either side I then end up using this little hook and I can put a little pressure on here and force against the gasket this gives me an airtight seal on each side and then we're just gonna let this heat up for a little bit so give me 15 minutes we'll get this thing up to temperature and then I'm gonna demonstrate how this works see in a sec all right we're good it's been about 15 minutes the more heat you use the faster this thing will heat up and reheat but 2600 watts 10 liters gets you to about boiling in about 15 minutes so on 5 4 3 2 1 [Music] see ya [Music] off now it takes a little bit of time to dry off die off as the water filters through the dry ice but eventually this will go down to just seeping out a little bit in about a minute but you get a loft a fog and you can see it affects the floor and you get this kind of nice spooky look down here and if you put lighting down here it's kind of nice to actually have low level lighting that lights the fog differentially it tends to make the fog look even richer even though it isn't Richard ready give it another pulse [Music] [Music] [Music] miss you want dance doesn't now what are the things that you'll find with this is that sometimes you want to put this back where nobody can see it and then be able to get the smoke into a certain area get the fog into a certain area so that's the nice thing about having this press-fit connection and then put a fit connection with some dryer hose aluminum wire with some plastic material and this will allow you to route the smoke to another location this and that way you can hide this behind some chairs or underneath the table and that's kind of a nice feature ready that way nobody knows what's going on [Music] [Music] you want to see this and you can have fun with it too smells like I'm inside of some ginger ale but it's perfectly breathable now something to keep in mind with this with the smoke is as I said it doesn't leave any kind of a contaminating film behind but one of the things that it does do is it leaves water behind so if you're gonna do this in a facility that has say tile or marble floors and say the the newlywed couple has finished their dance quickly you want to take some towels and you want to wipe this up so that people don't slip because there is water this does put out a fair amount of water that will deposit on the floor so for safety reasons just keep that in mind but again it's clean and there's no aroma there's no odor left behind so it's kind of nice now as I said check out the description below because they'll give you all the information about the drawings and the dimensions and the components and in addition to that if you have a question about what I've done or if there's something that I didn't cover in enough detail for you give me a comment give me a thumbs up give me a comment I read them all and I'll try to answer your questions and make sure that if you do decide to build this it's gonna be a success if you like that what we're doing here please subscribe to the channel because it does help it helps us to grow helps us to spread what we're doing to a wider audience and if you do give us a comment and you do give us a thumbs up that again gives YouTube a better reason to try to promote what we're doing finally if you spread this information around to people that you think might find this valuable that also helps because it brings in new people who might not be aware that science like this doesn't always have to be high-tech and and difficult and electronic based it can be pretty much just an assembly and some engineering so I want to thank you very much for watching this is a great project that's a lot of fun and I'm gonna I'm thinking right now about a few great ways that we're gonna be able to use this you take care you have a great evening and thanks for watching [Music] [Music] [Music] you
