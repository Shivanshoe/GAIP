hi a few months ago we posted a video on hydrogen detonation and if you're interested in this general topic you might want to take a look at that video because I go through some of the formulas some of the principles we have a lot of fun and we do some pretty interesting demonstrations and today what I want to do is I want to describe another unusual type of explosive [Music] and before I get started I'm just going to reiterate the written warning that we give you at the beginning of the video even if you're comfortable with chemistry when you're dealing with high energies and very fast conversion speeds in other words explosives you have to be particularly careful and so I would give you the advice that I do not recommend that anybody try this at home now explosives in general can be divided up into several different types of groupings there are low explosives and high explosives typical examples of low explosives are gunpowder sulfur charcoal cell peter or potassium nitrate gasoline and air in your car engine these explosives are classified as low because when you ignite them the transition zone or the flame front moves through the material at below the speed of sound not necessarily 330 meters per second or 1,100 feet per second the speed of sound and air but the speed of sound within the material itself a high explosive on the other hand once you trigger it has a transition zone or a shock front that moves through the material at above the speed of sound supersonically and forms what's called a shock front or a shock wave now examples of that are TNT nitroglycerin RDX and the major difference with a shock wave or a shock front is that because the heat can't distribute through the material as its as it's burning or transitioning all of the heat is concentrated in that very thin micron thin shell of expanding reaction and so the pressures and the temperatures within that shock front can be an order of magnitude a factor of 10 higher than they are in a low explosive now low explosive can still produce a shockwave in air if you can't if you contain it in a strong vessel and it reaches very high pressures that vessel can rupture and produce a shock wave but the underlying reaction that occurred to develop that pressure occurred subsonically the faster a reaction is and a high explosive and the more powerful it is the more brilliant it is it's sort of a loose product of speed and energy and so for example nitroglycerin is very brilliant it's more shattering more cracking than say TNT now another way of dividing explosives is into the burning or the combustion type of explosive and the decomposition type of explosive again examples of burning types of reactions are gunpowder and the hydrogen and oxygen that we burned a few months ago this requires two components to get together react produce reaction products that are more stable have less energy in them and the resulting heat produces the energy of the explosion in a decomposition type of reaction all of the atoms that are needed for the reaction are contained within the one molecule when triggered they just reconfigure and shift into reaction products that again have less energy are more stable and as a result you get a lot of heat release because the decomposition reaction is a single step it tends to be faster than the burning types of reactions although there is some overlap for example ammonium nitrate all by itself can be detonated it can explode but has a very low detonation velocity around 2700 meters per second the hydrogen and oxygen burning reaction that we performed a few months ago actually has a detonation velocity upwards of about 4,000 meters per second so there is some overlap but in general decomposition is fast burning is slow a third way of dividing up explosives and that's what we're gonna talk about today are called binary explosives now you might think binary two parts they're not burning reactions the primary ingredient whether it is ammonium nitrate little prills or whether it is the liquid nitro methane both of these components actually can be detonated all by themselves they are in fact explosives but because they are so darn inert it's almost impossible to trigger them and as a result they are sold and and can be transported and stored as if in the one case it's considered to be an oxidizer and in the other case it's considered to be a flammable liquid like rum this is a big important difference with this type of explosive because until you sensitize it because they are not considered explosives the stiffest the tightest regulations the legalities of working with explosives are most restrictive on storing and transporting not so much on detonating or fabricating so as long as you leave them separate you can handle them much more safely as well as much more conveniently one of the most common are actually the most common explosive in the world is called ANFO a and fo it stands for ammonium nitrate fuel oil the fuel oil a few percent added to the ammonium nitrate prills sensitizes it to the point that it can be detonated the reason it is so popular or so incredibly prevalent is because first of all it's extremely cheap ammonium nitrate is fertilizer it's almost dirt cheap but the second reason it's very popular is because it has a combination of a lot of energy output twice as much as TNT but a rather low detonation velocity it's high enough to crack rock and break structures but it doesn't waste all the energy like TNT wood to send out a Mach 20 shock wave or shrapnel most of the energy available when it is detonated is available available for pushing and slumping rock so it's very popular in demolition and in mining applications now the material that I showed you here which is a commercial product called tannerite is familiar to anybody who's ever gone into a gun store or any kind of an armament distributor they will often have these at the cash register you can buy little packs of these ammonium nitrate and sensitizers that you can buy at the store you can put them in your car you can drive out to the range you add in the case of the aluminum powder which is the sensitizer for tannerite or sure-shot another brand name you put it into the container you mix it around for a couple minutes to all of the prills are nice and gray put it down range and then you can fire a rifle bullet at it and it will detonate it's so insensitive though even once it's been sensitive that you can't generally put this off or you can't set this off with something as slow as a simple nine-millimeter a handgun you often need the velocity of a rifle shell so sensitivity is sort of a relative thing now the reason you're able to do that is because it's a binary you can bring it in your car you can bring it to a location you can mix it and use it but once you've mixed it it's considered a high explosive so you either use it or you dispose of it but you do not put it back in your car you don't bring it back home you got to get rid of it because now it's a high explosive now what I'm going to talk to you about today we're going to spend our time demonstrating is a high-explosive based on nitro methane this is nitro methane and it comes in small bottles liter bottles you can buy it by the drum and anybody familiar with nitro methane probably has first come in contact with it because it is a common fuel used in Top Fuel dragsters and as an additive for a fuel in RC airplanes the reason it is is because it's a fuel it actually will burn in air but because it contains about 2/3 of the oxygen it needs to burn it you can use a lot less air to consume this fuel in an engine and because the energy or the output of an internal combustion engine is not limited by how much fuel you can squirt into it but by how much air you can draw through it so by providing two thirds of the air it needs to burn you can use a lot more of this even though it's got less energy than gasoline you can use so much more of it that you produce more energy for a given displacement that's why it's so popular now interesting material when I first saw it I thought wow this is like water it has about the density the viscosity the surface tension of water it's clear it beads and it has a relatively low vapor pressure so when you smell it it's a weak fruity smell it's not very potent because of the low vapor pressure and if I left this camp off of this flask and left it in the room for a week most of this would still be at the bottom of the bottle that's not true of gasoline or alcohols it's a relatively low vapor pressure liquid and as I'll show you later not a very impressive fuel all by itself now nitromethane all by itself is a high explosive but it is so inert it's almost impossible to set it off and there are several ways that you can sensitize it the classic way is to use this ethylene diamine this is the ingredient that was used in the Picatinny armory to produce a high explosive back during World War two this is why the name of this material is called plx or Picatinny liquid explosive by using a small percentage of this or any other basic or alkaline pH aiming diethylenetriamine Det a is another example this will create a high explosive and you're done and what's nice about that is it's a liquid I'll show you what happens when you add this material to this the nitro methane is pretty benign but the the amine is pretty caustic so you want to be a little careful when you're dealing with it but if I take a small quantity of the nitro methane I'm not going to be very precise in my percentages here but it's enough to show you what's going on and then I add a small amount of the aiming to this they both start almost clear but as they add a small amount of this to here you'll see that it becomes a bright yellow this is now a sensitized high explosive done that's one of the advantages of working with this material is that it is a liquid it will flow into containers it can be pumped flowed and you can build us you can have it conform to the size of the vessel that you're trying to explore it as a crack and the rock that you want to fill now the way this works is kind of interesting using picosecond spectroscopy in other words extremely fast spectroscopy what they discovered is that the basic a means will form and stabilize radicals free radicals of the nitro methane and they tend to absorb right around 550 nanometer just basically the same color as the sensitized material those free radicals are far more sensitive to shock than the base material and so this then becomes sensitive enough you could set this off with a high-velocity round or other methods that I'll show you in just a little bit now there's another way that you can do this and it's kind of interesting you can also sense a type as this material this nitro methane with aluminum powder now aluminum is very familiar to people who build rocket engine grains or people working with pyrotechnics because aluminum powder or aluminum produces an incredible amount of energy when it oxidizes and when you take powdered aluminum which in some cases is coated with stearate a waxy material or in this case graphite for the the German black these very small few micron particles will when suspended in the material because of their greater density will actually create little zones where when a a moderately strong shock wave moves toward the aluminum some of that wave will move backwards it will be reflected but because of its greater density it tends to focus the wave through the material and form a high-intensity shock wave just behind the particle and also the waves that are passing around the outside of the particle diffract and again focus to the other side of the particle waves is waves and it doesn't matter if it's light or it's sound or it's a shock wave they behave the same way and these concentrated zones millions or billions of them within the material provide little locale localities where the sensitization has occurred and that again allows this to be sensitized to the point that you can set it off there's a third method that's used and that is glass bubbles these are the same hollow borosilicate bubbles that we use to thicken the epoxy mixture earlier on when we were showing you how to fair boats or fiberglass structures to make a paste out of an epoxy glue or adhesive these hollow glass 50 microns spheres are very lightweight and the way that they work is interesting when a moderate shock wave approaches one of these fragile bubbles it crushes the bubble and the gas inside of the bubble is compressed now there are two types of compression one is called isothermal compression when you compress a cylinder and the pressure goes up and the heat is released if the heat can leave the cylinder and the temperature doesn't go up the pressure doesn't get quite as high but when you've got a very tiny little bubble and you're doing this process in a period of a few nanoseconds the gas inside doesn't have time to release its heat into the surrounding environment that's called a ateb attic compression and so the temperatures can reach thousands of degrees in the pressure thousands of atmospheres within these tiny little bubbles these voids and it's the same process that occurs in sonoluminescence where when a collapsing void or bubble that's created by an ultrasound wave inside of water collapses you can create plasmas you can create localizations of very high pressures and temperatures this again is a method of sensitizing the differences between these are that the highest velocity of the highest retaining of the velocity of the raw material is if you just use the aiming it's up around 6700 meters per second faster than TNT and far faster than the ANFO or the tannerite or the shor shot that's one of the major differences this is a very brilliant high explosive by adding the aluminum powder we lower the velocity a little bit but what we do is we add a potential combustible agent to it and so if this explodes in air that vaporized thousands of degree hypersonic velocity shockwave of aluminum vapor contacts the air and burns and so it's sort of a hybrid of a detonation and a burning type of reaction the net result is we double the amount of energy per gram by adding a small amount of aluminum to this so you can get more power what's interesting is it doesn't work if you put this in a borehole or in some container where it doesn't contact the air but it does work if you put it under water at a high enough temperature and pressure aluminum will burn in water and so this is often used in packages or bottles or sacks placed under water for underwater demolition or for producing sonic booms for mapping purpose the bubbles do not add anything to the velocity and as a matter of fact they rapidly decrease the velocity and so what you can do by using the bubbles and or the aluminum and or the em a mean you can dial in exactly what kind of explosive you want how much power you want what kind of velocity you want it gives you a lot of freedom to be able to control the type of explosive you're gonna build now one of the problems you've got though with the aluminum and the bubbles I'll show you right now if I take the nitromethane and I pour a small quantity into this beaker and I pour some in here too and then I add some of the aluminum powder to one and I add some of the bubbles to the other nothing precise about this operation and then I stir them up a little bit to get them to mix and I do the same thing with the aluminum powder and that I set these down over here for a short period you'll see a problem develop the problem is that you can see it more clearly with the bubbles and a little bit more less impressive with the aluminum is that because the aluminum is heavier than the nitromethane and the bubbles are lighter they tend to float out of solution obviously it doesn't dissolve the glass of the or the aluminum that's no good they're not going to function so in order to keep these materials in suspension we have to thicken the nitromethane and there's a couple of ways to do that the most commonly reported way to do that is to use acrylic poly methyl methacrylate PMMA lucite Plexiglas shavings from a drill or in this case small little beads of extruded for extrusion purposes for forming plastic components or if you're very secure you can go into a cosmetic shop and you can get the small little vials of powder that are used for strengthening and making beautiful nails like mine but in any case if you mix this in this will form a more jellied type of mixture if you look at this this is 8% PMMA in this left-hand vial and this is just the pure nitromethane it clearly becomes more syrupy but because of its low potency you have to add a fair amount of this before this will settle out and so another method that's very popular is to use nitrocellulose it will dissolve in the in the Metro methane and you'll get a nice jelly that will support these powders problem with that is then you have to form format or you have to have formulate another explosive and it kind of undermines the advantage of a binary so what I came up with which I haven't seen actually reported anywhere but it actually works quite well is food grade methyl cellulose this is the same sort of thing that you would add to meringues to turn them into marshmallows it can thicken icings and it's what we use in our secret sauce for our superduper bubble machine that we're going to be showing you in a couple months but this material will actually dissolve and create a nice jelly with a low percentage and let me show you how that works now over here on this little mixer I have some nitromethane and I have some of the methylcellulose right here and you'll notice if I turn on the mixer here and I place this powder in here you'll see that it forms sort of a milky suspension problem is you could leave this on room temperature leave this for days and this won't dissolve it doesn't dissolve in the pure nitro methane but it does dissolve in the sensitized plx or the amine sensitized material and so if you add a small amount of that to the nitro methane and the snow that you've sort of formed by adding the powder it will gel up now we'll give that about two minutes alright that's looking pretty good I'm going to go ahead and turn this off and we'll get the magnet out of here and now this is nicely thickened you can see it's jelly like one little trick though to keep in mind is that if you add the amine to the nitromethane first and sensitize it and then you put in the methyl cellulose the outside will lock up and you'll have a nice big dumpling rolling around in here and it'll take about a half-hour to 45 minutes longer to dissolve this than if you put the methyl cellulose in before you sensitize it now this material here I'm going to add to a little container and what we're going to do is we're going to mix in some of the other sensitizers so I'm going to turn on the scale and I'm going to add about 10 milliliters which is very close to 10 grams of this material into here if I can do it with this little very short dropper this could take a little while that's pretty good a little long but keep it there now I'm going to add to that some of the aluminum powder like this and I'm going to add some of the bubble powder Tripoli sensitized and then using the back of my spoon here I'm going to mix this stuff up and what you end up with is sort of a thick gray paint and as soon as I mix this up I'll show you what I'm talking about now you might think Oh be careful this is Tripoli sensitized high-explosive and it is however sensitivity is a relative thing I'm going to show you what I mean by sensitized alright now what I'm going to use is some of the double base powder and we're going to take 50 milligrams of this put it on a little aluminum foil tab and with this we can then get an idea of sort of what the baseline explosion looks like from a given quantity of just the triggering explosive tiny bit more that's close enough 49 milligrams now if I can be careful and set this here over onto the plate and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover this with a small piece of aluminum this seems to keep it from spraying out when I hit it and then this is not that impressive but if you do wear headphones or using headphones at a high level you might want to turn down the volume all right here we go so you can see it does explode this stuff does work now what we're going to do is repeat that but we're going to use some of the TI X okay close now before I set this down in that spot I'm going to add a little bit of the TI X to it just a couple drops and we're going to put this over the top like this okay and then to keep it from spraying once again we're going to use the aluminum same amount of smokeless powder and if you do have your headphones on now you'll probably need them okay one two three three you no question works and it does make you smile you can't help it now what's interesting about that is that it was a long-standing controversy for many years as to what actually explodes when you set a shockwave into a material is it the heat or is it the shockwave and the reason that was so difficult is because they're intimately related you release heat in a very short period of time you get a shockwave it a shockwave hits a surface you get heat so is it the chicken or the egg which came first and it interesting thing if anybody ever asks you that riddle which came first the chicken or the egg well the best answer I've ever heard for that is that it is an egg with a chicken in it because the greatest amount of mutation occurs during the formation of the zygote and so it was two non chickens that bred to form the first chicken in the egg but I digress the answer came when they developed femtosecond lasers and they were actually able to irradiated of high-explosive with such a short pulse of light that they could heat the individual molecules without allowing them the time to even move so shockwave was not part of it and regressing the amount of energy necessary it turned out that it was the heat that actually did it so if anybody ever asks you that question it's the heat it's not the shock wave but it because they're so intimately related and because this is the only way we can develop either one of them we develop them as a pair the question then is what if you want to set off more of this obviously if I'm going to put off a hundred grams of this stuff I'm not gonna do it with a hammer I'm going to need to step back and typically what would be used is what's called a blasting cap blasting caps are based on a high explosive called Penta erythritol tetra nitrate petn and it is relatively sensitive high explosive that a hot wire is able to trigger and then it's explosion then transfers into the medium to charge that you're trying to set off problem with blasting caps is number one they're very highly regulated you can't get ahold of them number two they are dangerous you could blow a finger off with them and blasting caps are also rated in terms of their overall force they're called say number six number eight number four and the number stands for the number of milligrams of the petn that's used obviously about twenty times as much as we used in terms of the smokeless powder and so when you hear an explosive that's designated as cap sensitive they mean a number eight cap that's sort of the industry standard for making the division between cap sensitive and cap insensitive now because I can't get a hold of those and I don't want to set off a large charge with a hammer we're gonna take advantage of high voltage and electronics to actually turn a very small piece of copper wire into an incredibly powerful explosive it can produce thousands of times more energy per gram than the most energetic high explosive it's actually intermittent intermediate between nuclear and chemical explosives and by doing that what's called an explosive wire detonation we can take advantage of having something that is entirely inert until you charge the electronic equipment but once you do you can then set off the high charge and so when we go to do that what we will do is we're going to be using a setup I'll show you a little hint of what's going on here that involves a capacitor high voltage system and an exploding wire behind a bulletproof laminated plastic shield the reason we're not going to do that today go outside and set this up is because we're waiting for the delivery of a very high-speed camera from a company in Canada and this newest model of their camera can record thousands tens of thousands of frames per second at high resolution and because of the fact that we think this is going to be much more interesting to see when you can see the actual explosion developing over time we thought it made that sense to wait for that until we get to that camera we're gonna hold off in the outdoor experiment so hopefully the information that I gave you here is useful again I'm not trying to give you a formula on how to make these things I'm just trying to tell you how they work and the information is obviously out there if you're that curious but again my warning is don't mess around with explosives at home even if you feel you're
