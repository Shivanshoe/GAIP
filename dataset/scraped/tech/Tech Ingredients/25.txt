okay so part three in our series on the hybrid rocket engine [Music] [Music] in the first video i covered the basic principle of operation of a hybrid rocket where a liquid oxidizer is pumped into a rocket motor tube that already contains a solid rocket fuel and when you compare this to solid rockets and liquid rockets there are a lot of advantages to this design in terms of its safety its simplicity and its performance three very important words when you're talking about a rocket engine i also covered how to work with the liquid nitrous oxide which is the oxidizer that is used for this type of an engine in part two i covered the technique of casting these paraffin-based fuel grains that are inserted inside of the rocket engine and i went through the design and the fabrication of this solid graphite material for producing rocket nozzles today what i want to cover is the ignition system how you get this candle literally candle ignited as well as covering the test setup that we have for testing the different types of rocket engines now when you're starting a solid rocket engine it's pretty straightforward you either insert a fuse or an electronic match inside of the combustion chamber to provide an ignition source and once you get the fuel ignited or the propellant ignited it self sustains it's easy schmeezy the problem or the difficulty with hybrid rocket is related to its safety until you put the nitrous oxide in here this is completely inert it's literally a candle in a tube so if you place a fuse or an e-match inside of here you'll get a little bit of heat and you'll get a little bit of smoke but you won't generate enough of the paraffin vapor to support combustion when you blast 1000 plus psi liquid nitrous oxide into here and if you end up using the nitrous oxide ahead of time in order to get the combustion going the pressure of that liquid going through here will blast any kind of ignition system you have right out the end of the tube it doesn't work so what i did is i built a two-stage system to get this to fire and it's based on a typical e-match which is simply a resistive wire with a little pyrotechnic material that produces a little bit of flame and then inserted or jammed in the end of this i have three parallel slow burning fuses these fuses burn at about one centimeter per second and are held in alignment with two short segments of soda straw drinking straw this parallel array can then be inserted in the end of a tube to provide a lot of heat inside of the tube but this alone still is not enough to get the engine to fire so what i then did is i teed into the main line that provides the nitrous oxide for the engine a little fitting with a high pressure check valve located here these check valves are used to prevent backflow of high pressure gases from the engine into the containers that hold the pressurized gases and liquids and after this smaller check valve over here there's a little hose barb which is connected to a flexible silicone tube this tube in turn is hooked up to a bottle of gaseous oxygen which the regulator brings down to about two atmospheres and then is sent through a low voltage electronic solenoid that allows us to remotely turn on the oxygen flow from the control table so if you listen carefully when i turn this on you'll hear a little bit of a click what that allows us to do is a few seconds before i begin the ignition sequence i begin flooding the plumbing as well as the inside of the tube with pure oxygen so that instead of taking about 10 seconds for this fuse assembly to burn down it burns down in about a second and a half with white hot heat and that heat in addition to the pure oxygen that's inside the tube allows the wax to liquefy vaporize and actually begin to burn and what you'll see out of the end of one of these engines is a little bunsen burner type flame coming out of the end once you see that you have enough paraffin vapor that when you hit the high-powered solenoids to these valves here now when the nitrous oxide flows in here it works every time it's tried it's a very effective method now one concern you may have is if you're building this rocket for a flight ready application you don't want all of this material to be carried with the rocket that's not a problem i set this up this way in order to make it easy for the test stand but for example you could take a very thin stainless steel tube glue a little bit of fused material along the side just a little hot glue and then insert this into the bottom of the rocket motor so that once you've got this thing ignited and it takes off it leaves all the hardware behind so basically the same principle just a different way to get this to work something else you may notice if you watch the first video is we've gone from one to two of these nitrous solenoids we found that with our largest engines one solenoid was insufficient to provide enough nitrous oxide to burn these much larger and more numerous paraffin grains inside of the engine and the end result is whoa as you will see it's pretty impressive now before we go outside i want to give you a little bit of an overview of what's going on with the test stand in order to build this stand what i did is i took a couple of pieces of plywood glued and screwed them together to form a thick pallet and then attached to the top surface i've screwed down a couple of linear bearing rails on either side of this rectangular aluminum tube these carriages then are cross bolted and attached to the tube to allow the whole assembly to slide almost frictionlessly in this direction but to maintain strong lateral and up and down rigidity so things don't move around from this point on the rectangular tube which is a six millimeter wall heavy duty tube extends way out to the side the reason this extends so far is it allows us to place different length and size engines into into the assembly by simply repositioning the brackets that hold the engines down these brackets are fabricated from an extruded aluminum l section and have been bored out to fit the diameters of the different engines so we have a number of different size brackets the back here is also bored out to the same diameter but not all the way through there's a little bit of a lip here so that when the engine is inserted into this holder this retains it against the thrust loads and this simply maintains an alignment and then the hole through the middle allows us to get the nitrous or whatever else we want to pump in through the back of the engine all the way from behind here where we locate the solenoids and that's pretty much it for this end if we go down to the other end over here if you see these little screws or trust me there are little screws here that bolt a heavy aluminum plate to close off the end of this rod this plate rests against this post which is the system that main that measures the pressure on the load for on the load cell and this small spring here it retains this in contact with the load cell the reason for that is because the friction here is so low that if we don't have this thing perfectly balanced the whole assembly can drift away a little bit from the load cell and with the very high loads and low inertia of this moving component if it were to drift away a little bit the engine would cause this to slam into the load cell potentially damaging it or even shearing it off so the spring just keeps them in contact so we don't get that kind of banging operation the output from the load cell goes over to this handheld meter this is a portable meter you can measure tension and compression from the meter and if you see right here i'm going to turn this off and go through an on off sequence see if we can see that okay now when i push on this you can see that this will read the force that i'm putting on very quickly it responds very fast and it's reading in newtons but you can also see that it settles down to 0.0 so the static load by the spring doesn't create a false sense of additional thrust it's zeroed out in the system that's pretty much what we have here on the stand and then from here the end of the meter there's a little usb connector here this usb connector is attached to an extender a 15 meter extended cable that allows us to send the data all the way over to to the control station where we have batteries and the ignition controller to allow us to operate this remotely the rest of this is going to be a lot easier to demonstrate once i install this on the trailer so i'm going to go outside get this installed and we'll go through the rest of the assembly come on okay so the reason i like using a trailer for this application is because it allows us to get everything up off of the ground but still be bolted down securely to a fixed surface yet we can maneuver this around into different locations depending on the type of engine we're testing or for example we're shooting a video and it does provide some additional mass or inertia but if you took a look at our first video on the composite rocket engines it isn't enough the trailer still moved and because these engines are so much more powerful what we did is i put a couple of blocks in front of the wheels and we also attached some chains to some stakes into the ground sort of a belt and suspenders type of feature to provide additional safety because the last thing that we want to do is have this thing rip the cables off of the end of the trailer and send the trailer over the hills and through the woods not cool the trailer also allows us to maneuver the trailer quickly say under cover if we get rain without having to disassemble everything and if we do get noisy nosy neighbors or we get other interested parties we can quickly hide this thing in the garage close the doors turn off the lights and hide under the tables because as you will see this is incredibly loud and i want to give you a little bit of a heads up the neighbors across the road are having a picnic with little kids and grandmas and so even though we're going to be doing some tests today we're not going to be doing the full power tests simply because i don't want to create some sort of controversial event in the area now another big feature you're going to see is this plate this is a seven millimeter thick or quarter inch thick armored plate that has been through bolted to the pallet which in turn has been bolted to the table or the trailer the reason for this is if a test goes completely pear shaped and a motor ruptures and we get hot debris or gas we don't want that to get over onto the test equipment or to hit the containers of the compressed gases in addition to that you will see the different lines that are coming from here we've got the nitrous oxide and the oxygen oxygen both bolted down to the trailer on these posts so that they don't wiggle around when this vibrates and the lines that lead from here go to the oxygen supply to the nitrous solenoids and from the load cell out off the trailer through the extended usb connector from here you can see we've got a small engine set up with an igniter and the cable that leads from the igniter and all of these cables together lead past this unusual table here to the control station behind me this table has a laminated polycarbonate sheet in the front here it'll stop a 22 caliber bullet we have this here because the high speed camera is our closest camera to the rocket and the person who's operating it need protection in addition you'll notice that this hole in the table isolates the camera from the table because despite the fact that this is fixed to the ground the sonic impacts from the rocket engines including sonic booms will cause the table to vibrate and we don't want the camera to vibrate and so we've got this isolated over here if we move back further past these lines this is the control station where i sit and i'm operating in the shadow of that screen for protection we have a big computer over here and the computer is what's reading the data from the load cell and you could use a laptop for this application it would be smaller and more compact and perfectly viable i really like the very large screen but more importantly when we do tests that involve more than just say the load cell which already has a digitized signal if we start measuring temperatures and pressures we may have to run analog cables over to the computer and install boards to be able to read that and get the data into the computer so we just used our lab computer for this application but again if this is all you're testing a laptop is a perfectly reasonable alternative this is the battery back bank with the 24 volts for the oxygen solenoid and 24 volts high current for the nitrous solenoids and on top of that is the ignition controller that sets the signal to ignite the rocket now a lot of people wonder why do you have to have a countdown whenever you're doing a rocket launch certainly if you're lighting a fuse there's no purpose at all but even if you're using say an electronic igniter sometimes just going three two one fire is useful because people can put their fingers in their ears and look up at the rocket but when you get to more complicated engines like this you actually do need the countdown because you're going to have a series of events that happen have to happen at carefully uh measured intervals for example the load cell here will record data into the computer continuously for hours it's not a problem but the graphic representation covers that entire period when the load cell is on so if i do an event that may last you know five or ten seconds i'm gonna see just a single spike in a two hour screen so it's kind of nice to turn the graphical function on a few seconds before we fire and off a few seconds after we fire which then gives me a much higher resolution hump that i can look at in real time to determine the function of the engine in addition i have to turn on the oxygen valve in order to get the oxygen flowing so when i get to about five or six on my countdown from 10 i'll turn on the graphical when i get to about four or five seconds i'll turn on the oxygen and then at about one or two seconds the camera has to be turned on because our very high speed camera at maximum resolution and maximum speed has such an enormous data flow that it can only store eight seconds of high-speed image before it has to transfer it over to slower memory so we want to start the camera just a second or two before the test so we can capture the entire test on the high speed camera so when i get down to one or two that's when alex will hit the record button on the camera and we'll begin recording if he doesn't hit the button right or he sees an error signal he'll give me one of these panic signals like stop and before we use up an engine and do a test i'll abort the the test and then we can set everything up and do it again if he doesn't give me these panic signals then at zero i will hit the igniter over here we'll fire the engine off and as soon as we see a little bit of flame meaning we're getting a good melt of the wax inside of the engine i will then hit the nitrous and then we will get the blast of the engine so in that case a countdown really is useful it's not just some sort of sexy thing that you do to make yourself look like a a rocket scientist so let me go through the test here and show you how we're actually going to do a test of one of the starters but without oxygen flowing to show you what the effect of the oxygen is on the augmentation of the ignition sequence so what we're going to do is i'm going to start out with the countdown and i will start the trigger or the ignition controller over here a few seconds before people in the in the past have complained because this sets off a loud beeping signal saying we're just about ready to fire and if you're wearing headphones it can be kind of annoying so i'm just going to warn you you're going to hear some loud beeps when this begins and then what i'm going to do is i will hit the graphic at about six seconds i will hit the oxygen knot this time at about five seconds and then we're going to trigger the igniter and you'll see what the effect is when we don't use oxygen so here comes the beeping ten nine eight seven six five four three two one meh it's okay but now let me show you what happens when i replace the igniter and we actually flow the oxygen so here comes the beeping again fire in the hole ten nine eight seven six five four three two one go so you can see there's a substantial difference when we run the oxygen and just at the first second of that flame that's when the nitrous oxide would be injected now what we're going to do is we're going to set this all up again and we're going to run the test tomorrow but then we're going to run the full powered test so if you found this part interesting and want to sort of get up to speed we will publish that in just a couple of days so you'll get to see what we're doing with the real engines but i want to thank you very much for watching and if you're interested in this please subscribe because you've got a lot more videos coming and if you have any kind of comments put them down in the comments section i try to read every single one i answer as many questions as possible but please don't put a comment in saying oh you should have just run the test anybody anyway nobody would care they would care as you'll see it's a pretty significant event so and other than that i want to thank you very much and we'll see you soon take care you
