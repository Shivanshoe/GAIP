hi if you're watching this video there's a very good chance that you own a computer and if you like the kind of material that we cover on this channel there's a decent chance that you've looked into overclocking that's a technique if you're unfamiliar with it where you can protect the computer components at the same time that you're turning up the speed basically you're hot rodding your computer and it's a valuable technique if you're doing computationally intensive operations like video processing or gaming and it really doesn't matter how much you spend on the underlying equipment because that establishes a floor you're able to increase the performance of your computer substantially if you can deal with one major problem and that's heat heat is the bane of any kind of computation because every time a transistor switches it releases a little bit of heat and when you have billions of transistors that are processing it billions of times per second you produce a lot of heat and if you try to increase that processing speed you're going to produce more heat and potentially damage the computer in addition to that there's almost no material known to man that doesn't increase its electrical resistance with heat so heat begets heat it's a bit of a feedback loop so in order to get the most out of your computer you need to get the most of the heat that you can out of the computer now i come at this from more of a physics or a laser background and typically when i think of cooling hot components i often think of using water cooling using a flowing loop of water to be able to extract heat from a temperature sensitive component and either dump it into a municipal supply or send it over to a remote radiator where it can transmit its heat to air now the reason for that is that most industrial type of equipment is compact and you're either in an industrial or a military environment and you don't have the luxury of a large case where you can place a direct air heat exchanger but in any case you have to dump the heat you have to get it out of the system and one of the problems is that heat flows from a hot source to a cold source it flows downhill and no matter how powerful the pumps or the fans in your system there's just so much heat you can extract if you have a limited differential in order to get even more heat out you've got to lower the temperature of your cold side in order to have a larger gradient if you have any experience with overclocking as we have you probably have your own horror stories and we have ours uh you can see that we have a lot of lab equipment around here and one piece of equipment that i really like and i've had for over a decade is this gelabo lab chiller this is a 750 watt unit and it's a very nice piece of kit because it has a reservoir for cooling liquid and a pump and is actually able to maintain a continuous temperature 24 7 to a tenth of a degree centigrade so it's a great piece of equipment and my son a couple of years ago was getting into overclocking and said would you mind if i use this i wasn't using it at the time i said yeah fine have a ball so what he did is he hooked up the output of this to a little cpu block that is attached to the cpu and plumbed into the chiller and that's where we discovered the problem of the phenomenon of dewpoint dewpoint is the property of any atmosphere whereby that is the temperature that the relative humidity will begin to condense if you lower the temperature to the dew point so in any kind of a room unless there's fog in the room you're going to have a dew point that is below ambient temperature but with a recirculating chiller that can reach those kinds of temperatures very quickly you will develop sweating on the lines and the cpu block that's inside of your computer unseen in the dark is dripping onto all of the components inside of your nice expensive computer so anybody who is doing sub ambient cooling with water cooling has to be very persnickety about the use of insulation to make sure that none of the atmosphere has a chance to touch any of the sub atmospheric temperature components now that isn't a problem that you suffer with an air cooler inside of a computer because you're dealing with atmospheric air but then you have the limitation of that small differential that i talked about now one of the things you could do is you could theoretically put your computer outside if you live in the north that might work but that's kind of convenient inconvenient and another alternative that some people have tried is to actually put their computer inside of a refrigerator or a deep freezer and it's a little kludgy because obviously you gotta open the lid in order to turn it on and you've got your cables hanging out of the container but a more fundamental problem is the fact that any kind of a refrigerator or freezer even big ones have a rather limited refrigeration capacity because all they have to do is maintain temperature against the slow leak of heat through well insulated walls there's a far superior method of cooling and that is a window air conditioner these things are neat because their capacity for cooling is far greater than any refrigerator they have to cool an entire room and they can work for 24 7 for years without any problems and the neat thing about this particular project is that there's a fair chance you actually have one of these laying around so you may be able to do this project for free in addition to that there's another property of air conditioners and that is related to what's called a getter in vacuum and in refrigeration technology getters can be thought of as gatherers they are either systems or materials inside of a closed system which has a high affinity for something you don't want in the system so in a vacuum system it's something that will absorb residual gases and in a refrigeration system it's something that will absorb water an air conditioner is not just an air cooler it is an air conditioner because it contains a getter the coils on any air conditioner act as a getter because any air that's sucked into the air conditioner and blown out has to pass through the coils which are the coldest point in this loop and so any air that this air conditioner is able to put out has already been cooled by the coils below its dew point so you won't get any condensation inside of the computer that you're using this air conditioner to cool but it gets better yet because not only does this air conditioner cool the air and dry the air but because you have a filter in front of here and powerful fans this will send filtered clean dry cool air into your computer system and because it will overpower or effectively slightly pressurize the computer system what it will do is it will keep any any dust that surrounds the computer from being able to get in through any cracks or any ports or any openings in the computer so your entire computer stays clean and dry and cold if you've ever opened up a computer that you might have had sitting on the side of your desk and it's been on the floor for a couple of years especially if you have carpet it's nasty inside all of the surfaces that you want to have good thermal contact with have a layer of dust on top of them that isn't going to happen with these computers that have been cooled by this air conditioning system but it gets even better because there is another property of any kind of a refrigeration system like an air conditioner and it's called cop or cop or coefficient of performance and it represents the ratio between how much heat a refrigeration system can move versus how much energy it uses and that ratio for common systems is up around three and a half four so this particular air conditioner one of the smallest you can find at 5000 btu has a cooling capacity of about 1500 watts while it only burns about 400 watts because of that the air that comes out of this air conditioner has so much over capacity in terms of cooling that when it passes through the little radiator that we've got mounted on the top that cools the cpu with the freshest coldest air out of the fridge out of the air conditioner the air that comes out on the other side is only a couple of degrees warmed it's still very very cold so that cold dry clean air then cools off the north bridge the south bridge it also is the source of cold air to cool off your graphics card the entire computer stays clean dry and cold which is kind of nice because then you're not overworking some other component while you're keeping the cpu protected the design of this system was built to be rough and ready we haven't even pushed this as hard as we can as i'll explain in a second but the way that we did this to keep this as simple as possible is this duct that i built for this particular unit took me an evening to build and in the description below the video we're going to list the components the frigidaire air conditioner i'll give a link to the drawing for this particular duct if you use this as well as all the components in there but what's important is that because of the fact that we have this thing sitting on top of the computer nothing about the computer whatsoever had to be modified we simply slip it underneath and so if you decide at the end of this project you're tired of it you don't want to do it anymore simply take this duct off put this thing back in your window put this on the side of your desk and you're done so no foul no harm finally lastly in terms of the design of this system is that i've got this air conditioner mounted on a stand in order to get it to the right height to be able to blow into the top of the computer but this can be made out of something a little bit less fancy than this you could make this out of plywood and two by fours if you wanted to one important component are these legs at the bottom these little adjustable standoffs right here because these legs allow you to elevate the entire unit and to tip and to tilt it you can fine adjust the height of this duct to the point where we don't have anything sealing this there's no gaskets there's no screws there's nothing it's just laying on top so if you need any components you need this you need this and you need this and all you're all ready to go so it's a very simple project very easy to do and as we're going to demonstrate it works pretty well all right it's time to look at the components that we used inside the computer oh whoops sorry we forgot about this that we were keeping inside the computer to keep it cool take those out sorry about that okay now you can see the inside the computer case here the mind the fancy leds that we have for some of the components most of them don't have it so what you'll see first is on top is the obvious radiator that we have in there hooked up to the cpu and the air conditioner obviously blows through that radiator through the fans and into the computer now we'll start with the obvious most important component which is the cpu the cpu is an amd ryzen 7 3800 xt and now its base clock is 3.9 gigahertz it has eight cores um so it's a fairly standard cpu nothing overkill nothing too extreme but it's a good cpu to use for basic overclocking like we're going to be doing and it's something that you all could afford it's not something super extreme that maybe only linus would have okay so you'll see next to that is the ram that we have this is the g skill trident ram that we have in here obviously it has the cheesy leds it's 16 gigs and its base clock is 4 600 megahertz now we have here on top you'll see that powering the cpu we have 16 pins normally you'd have eight or even four for lower end motherboards and for non-overclocking purposes however you can see it's 16 pins so we can supply a bit more power to the cpu now underneath here which is not important for what the video that we're doing today but it's the graphics card it's an older model because it was very hard and you can see now on newegg or any other computer sites it's nearly impossible to get the newest generation graphics cards they're all out of stock maybe because of the bitcoin price rising i don't know but we're using this older 1070 ti but still good graphics card okay now back to the motherboard the motherboard is an msi am4 socket motherboard with four ram slots plenty of pci express ports a chipset with a fan which i thought would be beneficial now the hard drive that we have in here is a solid state and vme m.2 samsung solid state that plugs into the motherboard right above the graphics card here okay now the intake fans that we have here are just for the regular use of the computer including the fans on the radiator now when we run the basic test of the computer without the air conditioner on we'll leave those fans going so you can see what it's like if you have this computer set up without any external air conditioner cooling it okay now finally you'll see the case that we're using is a fantex case with a nice feature of a swing open door that's magnetically closed so it's super easy to get in and out of it's the same on both sides and it also has if you can see here it also has a little bit of padding a little bit of insulation which will help to keep it cold plus it keeps a little bit of the noise down so when you have when you have all your fans running if you have a radiator with three fans up there it's a bit quieter too all right so now i'm going to close this up and we're do we'll do the basic test with no air conditioner running you can hear there's no air conditioner running and you'll see all the specifications and you'll see all the clocks and speeds and temperatures all on this screen here okay now before we get started you can see that we've moved the computer off of the air conditioner so it's not restricting any airflow to the radiators on the top and you can be certain that the air conditioner is not cooling it okay so now i'm going to show you the bio settings so you can see what settings we have the motherboard set to and then we're going to go into windows and run a few benchmarks so you can see what temperatures we get to okay you can see up here is the cpu speed of 3.9 gigahertz the ddr speed of 2133 that's the ram speed uh by default it comes at 2133 you've probably noticed that on your own motherboard or overclocking if you've done that the ram is built to go to 4600 but we're not going to mess with that right now we're just interested in the cpu to adjust the cpu under the overclocking menu you can see here under cpu setting there's cpu ratio apply mode so you can choose which cores to speed up or slow down there's cpu ratio which is what you want and then it tells you the frequency that it will be set at so if instead of auto you were to press the plus key you can then start increasing the ratio to higher and higher and higher as you can see 4 100 4200 megahertz and so on but we're going to keep it at its base of 3.9 gigahertz now there's also other advanced cpu settings like turning off cores certain cores we're going to be leaving all of the cores on all eight cores we're not going to be fiddling with any of that to try and fake some of the temperatures or speeds that we get to also the cpu comes by default with a thing called precision boost overdrive now we're going to be turning and turning that off because the computer will automatically adjust the speed of the cpu as long as it's within the proper temperature range we want this to be a very comparable test across the air conditioner and without the air conditioner and so we're going to be turning that off so it stays at its set speed of 3.9 gigahertz does not change doesn't adjust if it gets too cold or too hot so instead of auto we're going to be going to disabled so besides that we're going to be leaving everything else in the settings here exactly the same save yes okay now the computer is going to be rebooting and once we get into windows we'll be running some of the benchmarks so you can see the temperatures okay signing in tech ingredients all right now something i'm going to do is turn off windows defender so there's no virus protection running in the background because that theoretically could mess with the values that we get we don't want anything changing we want it to be exactly the same same base that we use to test the air conditioner and without okay now the programs that we're going to be using here one of them is called cpu id hardware monitor we also have this program that comes with the msi motherboard called dragon center it's a very easy simple way for you to be able to see the cpu core temperature obviously the fan is at full you can see the system temperature like the chipset you can see the graphics card temperature there you can see the ram voltage temperature cpu usage you can see is only at one percent you can see the frequencies at 3.9 gigahertz and if we go to task manager you can also see same sort of thing the same values on task manager cpu running at 3.9 gigahertz almost no utilization we haven't started the benchmark yet you can see it's eight cores all barely doing anything all right now on this side with cpu id hardware monitor it's a little bit more advanced except it's just a backup so you can see a little bit more specific temperature and just to ensure that dragon center is giving you the correct values so on this side on the left hand side with cpuid you can see system temperature chipset temperature gpu temperature m.2 temperature you can see down here this is the cpu temperature this is the main value that we're going to be watching everything else is just gravy having the system and the chipset and the graphics card and the hard drive and all that running cooler that's all nice and a nice bonus but all we're doing all we're overclocking is the cpu so that's really the value should focus on i'm going to be opening powermax which is a program also made by cpuid it'll allow us to benchmark the cpu you can also use it for a gpu timeout set for five minutes you can see the current temperature is 27 celsius zero or one percent cpu usage you can also see the temperatures over here so let's start let's take a look at it you can see instantly it increases to 51 52 it's going up cpu usage is at 100 still same base frequency that's never changing you can see the system temperature it does very slowly increase but it doesn't get that hot and nothing close to the cpu temperature all right you can see we're almost done we're at 99 percent almost done 58 celsius is the max it got up to 58.3 was the highest but now that it's stopped you can see zero percent cpu usage core temperature is dropping rapidly you can also see system temperature let's take a look at that you can see it's 28 celsius staying there now that the cpu isn't being used there's not really much of a difference there's no draw i guess when the cpu is being used it's not really changing the system temperature but you'll notice that temperature along with all the rest and the cpu temperature when we hook up the air conditioner it's they're all going to drop now we're going to put the computer underneath the air conditioner very easy you can see it's just sliding it on top still not on yet not sure if you can notice that change in sound but you can you can't hear the fans as well now yeah that sounds good okay okay you can probably hear that the air conditioner is now on what i'm going to do is unplug the fans that are normally in there and normally on for the base test like you would have a normal computer you normally have the exhaust and the front fans drawing in air we're going to be turning these off so that the air conditioner fills up the inside with cold air and doesn't really let any new warm air come in and doesn't exhaust the super cold air that's in there and you'll be able to tell if you were here that cold air when the air conditioner is running you can feel the cold air getting exhausted through the vents that would normally be in taking air you can actually feel cold air coming out of them so all holes in the computer are going to be expelling cold air but just because the air conditioner is running not because of any fans pushing it out [Music] okay now focusing the camera back on the monitor so we can watch the values again okay yeah i can see it so you can that you can see that that probe is in the air conditioner box on top that's just the temperature of the air coming out of the air conditioner this is the room here room temperature right what he has in his hand yep and this is the temperature and that on top is the temperature yeah negative zero zero zero point six so you can see as we leave the air conditioner going it keeps dropping so now that the air conditioner has been running for a little while the temperature coming out of the air conditioner is currently negative zero zero two point two negative two point two celsius so now we're going to run the same benchmark as we did just a few minutes ago sse for five minutes okay all right so it finished now and you can see that the temperature instead of staying at the 36 celsius it was before you can see now it's rapidly dropping zero percent cpu usage okay so now what we're going to do is close down everything and go back into the bios where we started to do a little bit of overclocking to see how fast that we can get it with the air conditioner running okay now we're back here in the overclocking menu and what we're going to do is adjust the cpu ratio here where we talked about before and we're going to adjust that instead of 3 39 we're going to adjust that with the plus sign and bring it up to the fastest we think we could probably do 4.6 so we're going to going to go up and you can see it turned red because it thinks that's too much don't do it and again this is not temporary overclocking it's not going to adjust it if it gets too hot it'll just shut down uh also this is for every single core and all cores are going to be running so exactly the same as last time except now we're running at 4.6 gigahertz instead of 3.9 save that okay so like last time you can see here on the left with cpuid hardware monitor and if we look at task manager you can see the speed that we're running at yes it's 4.6 you can see that up here cpu free frequency 4.6 gigahertz yeah you can see it's complaining that we turned off virus protection but i want it doing as little in the background as possible you can see all cores are pretty much doing nothing we just had that used for windows defender run it like last time cpu ssc for five minutes and let's see if this computer can handle the five minutes of this 100 percent cpu usage benchmark at 4.6 gigahertz okay you can see the temperature obviously shot up pretty high we're at 53 it keeps climbing cpu usage again like last time 100 and now we're at 4.6 gigahertz and you can see the system temperature isn't really affected too much too heavily by doing a benchmark like this you can see it started to jump up one degree but it doesn't change too much okay so you can see we're at 99 percent here you can see the temperature and the cpu usage just dropped now the temperature will start dropping here but at a max we got up to about 56 celsius so maybe you're wondering about this this is a thermal interface testing rig and we used this in order to be able to test the performance of thermal interface materials about a year ago we did a video on the fabrication of a thermal interface epoxy a thermal epoxy that actually performed better than the arctic silver's commercial material however a lot of people were concerned about using a an adhesive and wanted either a thermal paste or a thermal grease so we went ahead did a lot of experimentation and came up with a formulation that is actually just about as good or a little better than the arctic silver and so in the next video what we're going to do is i'm going to show you how this rig works to test the materials and then i'm going to compare this to a couple of commercial materials just to show you how well it performs we'll then send out a sample of it to linus tech and let them mess around with it and see what they think of it so you can tell the kind of videos we do here are not just rockets or speakers or lasers or boats or whiskey we cover a lot of different topics and if you find this kind of subject matter interesting please subscribe to the channel because we've got more on the way and if you have any questions about anything that we did here please put it in the comments because i read them all and i try to answer as many questions as possible so from both of us to you i wish you a great evening and you take care good night [Music] [Music] you
