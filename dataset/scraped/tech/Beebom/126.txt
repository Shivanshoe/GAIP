so [Applause] hey guys this is paige from viewer.com and of late oneplus has been in the news first came the announcement that oneplus is merging with oppo and then we got the news that oneplus is merging its oxygen os software with color os so here's what oneplus said in their forum we are working on integrating the code base of oxygen os and color os this is a change that you'll likely not even notice since it's happening behind the scenes well now oneplus has launched the oneplus not too this is the phone right here and this is a phone that contradicts the whole statement about oxygen os changes happening behind the scenes i mean apart from the fact that the oneplus note 2 is the successor to the very popular oneplus not deadline last year this is a phone that also shows you that oxygen os and color os merging is not just about the code base or updates there's actually changes in oxygen os that are straight from color os and not so behind the scenes now let me make it clear that the one oneplus note 2 actually brings a number of major upgrades over the oneplus knot and i will talk about them so make sure to watch the full video but first let me talk about the color os changes in oxygen os okay so this is the oneplus note 2 in action and it has the oneplus launcher quick settings and notifications are still the same but there are two things that are straight up from color os first up check out the camera app on the oneplus note 2 next to the camera app on the oneplus 9 pro see the difference look i'm someone who's always like the clean oneplus camera app so i don't like this change but yeah it is what it is i mean here's the camera app on the real me x7 max next to the not two's camera app and yeah as you can see it's identical it has the same ai features the same settings every single thing in this camera app is the same in fact they even get the same prompt when first opened up yep you must have seen this in real me ui and color os right so yeah this isn't exactly a behind the scenes change now that's not on another big change is the settings app so here's the settings app on the oneplus note 2 and the oneplus 9 pro and from the looks of it they look similar with the whole one-handed design but take a look closely and you'll see that the settings app on the note 2 is actually not the same to give you an idea just take a look at say the display settings it's not the same it's actually the settings app from color os here's the settings in real me x7 max and once again the not twos options the ui in the settings each and every option is just the same so overall it looks like i have to accept that oxygen os will become more and more like color os in the future i mean oxygen os 11.3 on the not 2 still does not have any bloatware no weird notifications or anything it's clean and nice and you know what i'm just hoping that it remains this way anyway the operation of the software aside what are the big upgrades in the oneplus note 2 over the oneplus note well the oneplus note 2 feels like the original not when it comes to the size and weight and the same gorilla glass 5 back but as you can see the cameras here have the new look like the oneplus 9 and the 9 pro also unlike the oneplus note c there's the iconic alert slider which is just you know good to see now one big change on the design front is the oneplus note 2 has dual stereo speakers which is an upgrade because the oneplus not did not have this so there's a speaker at the bottom and the other one in the earpiece and so far the speakers here sound really good but i'll be testing it more as for the front it has not changed a lot it's still a 6.4 inch amoled display with the 90 hertz refresh rate srgb and display p3 support and gorilla glass 5 now personally i would have liked a 120 hertz panel but i'll be comparing it to other phones and see if it's a big difference now the design and display apart the two major upgrades in the oneplus note 2 is the new chipset and the new main camera first up the chipset so the oneplus note 2 uses mediatek's dimension 1200 flagship chipset which is a six nanometer chipset with 5g there's also up to 12gb ram and up to 256gb non-expandable storage so the demand city 1200 is the highlight and i think it's an excellent addition i mean i ran a few benchmark tests on the oneplus note 2 and compared them to the not and the difference in scores of the demand city 1200 and the 768g are massive with attitude or as you can see geekbench so this is a powerful chipset and i've started using the note 2 as my daily driver and so far the phone just feels fast and snappy like your usual oneplus phone but yeah it's a bit too early to judge i've also been playing a lot of bgmi on this phone and the performance has been great top notch for those who want to know by default the graphics are set to hd and high but hdr ultra and smooth extreme are supported moving on to the cameras the oneplus note 2 has the 50 megapixel sony imx 766 sensor that we saw in the oneplus 9 pro as well now i took some comparison shots from the oneplus note 2 and the oneplus not and in daytime photos i did not notice any big improvements in the not too however in low light it's a massive difference but not to capture is way better low light shots as you can see i mean just look at these photos and you'll see that the note 2 shots are brighter and sharper every single time it's actually a big difference so even though i've only taken a few photos the note 2's main camera looks like an improvement especially in low light apart from that the battery and the charger has been upgraded too there's a 4500 mah battery with 65 watt warp charge supported so yeah it should last a little longer and also charge a lot faster and one more thing to note here is that unlike the nord or the north ce the not 2 is actually a 5g phone you can actually call it not to 5g because it has seven 5g bands which is just great overall it's clear that the oneplus note 2 actually brings a lot of good upgrades over the oneplus note faster chipset improved camera bigger battery faster charging way more 5g bands so it's a good upgrade as for the price i don't know it yet but with the nazi taking over the 25 to 30k segment i'm expecting the not 2 to arrive in the 30 35k anyway the point is that the not 2 seems like a good phone but the biggest talking point for me has to be the fact that oxygen os is changing to color os see i just want to say this dear oneplus or their oppo or dear bbk whoever is at the top handling this led oxygen os remain oxygen os oxygen os is good because it's oxygen os don't change it to something else so that was a sort of first look at the new one plus not two and yeah i have started using it as my daily
