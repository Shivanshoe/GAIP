[Music] so [Applause] hey guys this is paige from bio.com and along with the new renault 5 pro 5g oppo has also launched the oppo ncoex truly wireless noise canceling earphones in india and yeah this is the new oppo enco x and i think these are quite exciting because they're said to bring great sound and powerful noise cancellation so yeah let's take a look at the new oppo encore x so these are the new enco x earbuds along with the case and i'll talk about the noise cancellation and everything but let's take things kind of gradually first up the design i mean if you take a look at the earbuds you'll notice that it has a design that looks pretty good it's got the silicone tapes with the shorter stem and the earbuds design overall is nice too just like that these earbuds are light and comfortable at 4.8 grams each i mean ever since they arrived i've been using them for long hours and they've been pretty comfortable to use i think they fit really well also i asked akshay to do the head banging test and the earbuds did not fall off so this is great for anyone who jogs or works out also these earbuds come with three pairs of silicone tips and there's an earbud fit test in the opposed hem led app so that you can choose the best fitting ear tips apart from that these earbuds are ip54 rated for water and dust resistance which is great and these are touch sensitive stems which i will talk about in a bit as for the case these look slightly different because they have this sort of elliptical design along with the metal ring that gives it a nice look there's also the din audio brand name because oppo worked with the danish premium speaker manufacturer to tune these earbuds anyway there's also this pairing button and the usb c port and this case supports wireless charging now going back to painting the earbuds it was pretty simple i just popped up in the case and i got this prompt to pay the earbuds on the oppo render 5 pro now this works only with oppo phones but pairing it with other brand phones was pretty straight forward to using the you know traditional bluetooth way also on an open phone every time you open up the case you get this prompt showing you the battery left in the earbuds as well as the case to be honest the design of the 0.0x is definitely premium and nice but i want to talk about the important factors now so first up very importantly the sound quality which i think is great but let's talk about the specs first so the 0.0x have oppo's new dbe 3.0 sound system which comes with a dual coaxial driver design that includes an 11 millimeter dynamic driver for middle and low frequencies and a six millimeter balanced membrane driver for high frequencies so the specs are good but it's the sound quality that actually matters and i've been using these earbuds for a while now and i think sound experience is pretty good see i think these earbuds get really loud and the bass is thumping which is really good and i like that i can listen to music on full volume and there's no sound leakage here so people around me have no idea what i'm listening to apart from that the sound stage is wide enough and instrument separation while not anything extraordinary it's decent there's one thing i did feel the treble gets a little too sharp at times at high volumes but i think it's not a big deal and overall like i said the sound quality is pretty good apart from that when comes the codex the support for sbc ac but more importantly this support for lhdc now for people who don't know lhdc is an audio code that supports high resolution audio streaming via bluetooth to give you a better idea it has a higher bitrate wireless transmission when compared to other codecs ledc allows a bitrate of up to 960kbps compared to sbc's 345kps now the higher bitrate transmission means it can push more audio details more realistic high quality audio and also have lower latency see right now only a handful of phones like the oppo 5x2 and the 5x2 pro and only a few streaming apps like say titles support this but oppo has confirmed that more ford models will be updated to support this in the coming time moving on i want to talk about the features of the oppo and qx and with the highlight being the very powerful noise cancellation see i have used earbuds with anc before like say the galaxy birds live and i thought anc on that earbud was kind of average but on these it's very very good first up each earbud has three integrated mics and wind detection tech for anc as well as noise cancellation during calls and enabling noise cancellation is pretty simple you just touch and hold for a second to switch between the different modes i have set it to switch between the transparency mode and max noise cancellation but yeah you can choose now the transparency mode is pretty self-explanatory and in this i was able to listen to people with the earbuds on next there's noise cancellation mode which works pretty well in places like offices or at home when you don't want to listen to people then there's the max noise cancellation mode which is absolutely fantastic i mean when you turn it on there's just nothing it just blocks everything and it's pretty cool i think this is the mode that you'll find handy in say crowded or noisy areas like the airport or a railway station i tried it out on a noisy street corner and it just blocked everything i think you really have to try it out to experience this but it's really good as of course the earbuds did cut wind noise or my noise in the surroundings which is very good but i think the mic quality could have been a little better when it comes to audio recording or you know in heavy noise all situations apart from the noise cancellation there's weird detection which is a little slow at times but works so that's fine those are different touch controls there's double tap to control music playback triple tap to activate google assistant slide control to adjust volume which i really love there's also touch and hold gesture for different noise cancellation modes which i showed you earlier and there's the long touch and hole to switch between different devices so there are a lot of touch controls and i think they work fine moving on to the battery each of these earbuds have a 44 image battery and there's 535 image battery on the case now the earbuds are said to last four hours of continuous playback with max noise cancellation turned on all the time and five and a half hours with anc turned off with the case you can expect the earbuds to last 20 to 25 hours depending on how you use anc but in my usage with anc turned on all the time i got close to four hours which i think is right coming to the pricing now the oppo enco x is priced at rs 10 000 and at that price i think these are pretty good truly wireless earbuds with noise cancellation i mean the earbuds have a very premium design the sound experience is pretty good the battery life is decent and the noise cancellation is actually very very powerful plus their support for things like lhdc and there are all the features you expect like touch controls and wear detection so all in all the open qxr earbuds you can check out if you're looking for a good tws with anc anyway i'd love to know what you guys think of the new oppo encoex so tell us in the comment section below also give
