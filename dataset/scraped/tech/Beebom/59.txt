this is the new infinix zero 5g and this is launching that rupees 19 triple nine so the price is good and i'll tell you this this is a power pack smartphone see i'll talk about all of the aspects of this phone and i have some doubts on some of the decisions infinix has made so make sure to watch the full video but one area where the infinix zero 5g is really good is the performance why do i say that just look at the specs this dimension 900 very good for this price range lpddr5 ram i don't think there's any phone in this price segment with lpdt or 5 ram and there's ufs 3.1 storage again not something i've seen in this price range now these specs are very good for a phone that costs 20k to give you an idea the domincid 900 can go up to 2.4 gigahertz it has these capable cortex a78 cores the mali g68 gpu and this is a chipset that i've usually seen in the 25k segment so at this price it's actually great i mean just check out the geekbench 5 benchmark scores compared to the snapdragon 695 which is a chipset that powers the newest phones like the moto g71 and even the new vivo t1 as you can see the dimension 900 is actually ahead now here the attributes course and again the dimension 900 is just better it's a pretty big difference here page in terms of cpu gpu ux in fact you can also see the difference the speedy lpddr5 ram makes in this memory score the g71 with its lpdd or 4x ram is fine but it's nowhere close to the infinix zero speeds the ufs 3.1 storage is also a big deal in this price range here's a comparison of the storage speeds of the inference 0 which has ufs 3.1 versus the xiaomi 11i which has ufs 2.2 storage and again you can see the difference now these benchmarks are good and i've been trying out this phone for the past few days and this just feels like a very fast and responsive phone you know how when you start using your phone and you just know that this is going to be a nice snappy phone i got that feeling with the infinix zero it's still early to judge but there's no lag anywhere everything works nicely beat multitasking app launching gaming is great too the max graphics support in bgmi is hdr ultra you can also play it smooth extreme for even better frame rates but the point is gaming performance has been good so far on xero now i know what you're thinking are there any heating issues or is there any thermal throttling well i haven't come across any heating issues at all and as for tp throttling i ran the cpu throttling test app in the 15 minute desk we got this yes no thermal throttling detected that is great i also did a more intensive test with threads set to 50 and the time set to 30 and this is the result i got the infinix zero throttle to 87 of its max performance which is again very good look you know what i have zero doubts on the infinix zeros performance so far but let's take a look at the other aspects of this phone so the infinix zero comes in a black and an orange radiant and you'll notice the merged camera bump yeah this does remind me of the find x3 but that's fine now the back is plastic on both these phones on the black variant it looks like glass and it's a big fingerprint magnet however the orange variant has a leather-like finish and it's unique if you ask me in a world full of boring looking phones i mean this is a beautiful finish again zero doubt the texture makes it grippy and nice the golden frame goes with the whole look and all in all it just feels very premium in the hands i like this bird what do you guys think of this leather like finish good or may comment down below apart from that the fingerprint scanner is on the power button here and it works fine there's a dual simplest micro sd dedicated slot and the headphone jack and the single speaker at the bottom yeah there's no stereo speakers here on the front you get this display and honestly i would have liked an amulet over a 120 hertz lcd but i think infinix went with this to cater more to gamers anyway the lcd here is an ltps panel which is said to bring richer colors more contrast and be more efficient than usual lcds now this display is good here quality wise it's sharp and fairly vibrant and when it comes to display protection it uses any g's dynodex d2x one glass protection now there are a couple of things to note the brightest is not the best at 500 nits but the bigger problem if you ask me is the lack of wide wide l1 support yes as you can see the phone has the l3 license so there's only sd playback and apps like netflix and prime video which is definitely an issue especially on a phone at this price as for the camera setup the infinix zero is obviously not a camera-centric phone but as you can see there's the 48 megapixel main camera quad led flashes but i think the most interesting choice is the telephoto lens the zero skips on the ultra wide angle sensor and instead brings a telephoto slash portrait sensor with 2x optical zoom and 30x digital zoom now in my brief uses so far the main camera takes fairly good photos there is a slight yellow tone in some shots but other than that in good light it takes sharp and well exposed shots in low light it's kind of decent the details are gonna know but other than that the photos look fine as for the telephoto lens the 2x shots look kind of average i mean whenever i took a 2x i always felt it was over saturating things and it was not as sharp as i'd like even in the portrait mode there's lack of detail and there's just over saturation look if you follow b1 videos you know that i am all in for telephoto lenses but i think an ultra wide angle lens would have made more sense in a phone like the infinix zero the front camera is a 16 megapixel sensor and this too has a dual led flash hidden in the bezel here anyway here's some selfies from the phone to give you a better idea when it comes to software there's infinix's x os on top of android 11 and the device we have is still stuck on the november security patch and that's weird because it's february now now infinix has confirmed the android 12 update for the zero 5g but there's no word on the long term support anyway xos is a feature backdoor so you get all the functionality and there aren't any shady features but there are a lot of infinix apps a lot also the ui is in need of a revamp if you ask me especially with the outdated icons and colors all around and you get these notifications yeah and freaks needs to fix these the battery on this phone is a 5000mah battery and you get this 33 watt charger in the box lastly when it comes to connectivity the zero 5g has 13 5g bands making it a proper 5g phone and i also like the fact that this supports wi-fi 6 so it's great for future proofing also if you're wondering the phone does have camera aggregation support to conclude things it's pretty clear that the infinix zero 5g is a phone aimed at gamers and people who want solid performance in this price range i mean it's not always about the chips at the ram and storage matter a lot too if you want great performance and credibility's due infinix seems to have nailed down that aspect on the zero 5g yes there are some doubts in the phone there's no wide wind and license no steel speakers no ultraviolet camera and the software update situation is still kind of weak so i want to know from you guys does the infinix zero 5g make sense to you what will you pick performance or overall solidity comment down below also give this video like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me
