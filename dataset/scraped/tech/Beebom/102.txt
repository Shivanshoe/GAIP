[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bjorn.com and off late oxygen os has been changing it went through a big revamp with the oxygen os 11 update that moved it away from stock android and let's face it nobody liked that and then the oneplus note 2 arrived that brought color overs elements to oxygen os and i was kind of okay with it and now the oxygen os 12 beta has arrived and you know what let me put it this way this is probably the end of oxygen os yes rip oxygen os now i'm not trying to be dramatic here but when i installed this update on the oneplus 9 and then i started using it i was like did i just pick up an oppo phone yeah that's what oxygen os 12 makes you think now this is an update that just makes me sad so let me make it clear that i have nothing against color os i think it's been getting better and better every year and it's pretty good but i like the oxygen os for its own originality it's very simple and clean approach and that's just going away so this is the oneplus 9 running the new beta and the first thing to notice is that the oxygen os launcher is gone this is actually the color os launcher here's the oneplus 9 with the new launcher and the oneplus 9r with the oxygen os launcher side by side and you can see the difference right the app drawer is different oneplus font is weirdly bolder the launcher settings are different now it's not just the launcher the recent screen is the same as color os as you can see here it's a lot different than what we used to get in oxygen os in fact like color os when i'm in an app and i hit close on it kills all the other apps and not the app you're in it also says your phone is in the best condition which is not something you'd see in oxygen os the gallery app is also the same as color os corn is the oxygen oss gallery app with the big bold text the file manager app is also from color os now there's more actually the note 2 had the color of his camera app and the color of a settings page but now those have arrived on the oneplus 9 as well here's the camera app on the oxygen os 12 beta on the oneplus 9 and not just the camera even the color of settings app has arrived on the oneplus 9. now this means that with the new oxygen os 12 update all the new oneplus 4b the series the eight series the eighty the seven series not all of them will have the color os launcher the color of his camera and the color was setting that i'll be frank i personally don't like this because say i have the oneplus 8t now i bought the oneplus 8t for the true oxygen os experience but now oneplus is basically forcing me to use color os on my phone now if i wanted color os i would have bought novo phone or a readme phone not a oneplus phone this just feels wrong anyway that apart some of the new features in oxygen os 12 are also borrowed from color os there's dark mode customization which was basically part of color os 11 there's a private safe which lets you store your private fires documents etc security and this has been part of color os2 oxygen os 12 also brings a theme store that is straight from color overs i mean this is a theme store and has the same as color os it's basically the same thing now there are oxygen over specific features that have been improved with oxygen os 12. so there's the new shelf which you can access by swiping down from the right top corner and it's visually refreshed with newer cars that bring more information it also has oneplus scout search feature which was previously part of the app draw search the canvas aod feature has been improved too with more customization options zen mode has been improved too with more themes and more music options now there are a few more updates here and there but one thing i could not find is the option to disable cpu throttling that oneplus had promised with the android 12 update i mean this is beta1 so they might add it later on in the final build look i think this is clearly the last oxygen update that we are going to get from now on we'll probably get color os updates and that will change the way we look at oneplus honestly oneplus has never looked like your usual chinese brand it looks like a global company and that's mainly because it brought a premium experience with oxygen os oxygen os was its main usp and with that going away i think oneplus will have to play the whole who has the best specs game now i'm not saying color os is bad it's just that it's not oxygen os now usually i end these videos with the more hopeful notes saying df1 plus please fix this blah blah blah but i'm not going to do that today because i know oneplus has settled things are not going to change so let me just end it this way oxygen os it was good while it lasted but it's time to say goodbye [Music]
