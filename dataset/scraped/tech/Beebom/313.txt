[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a page from Viacom and the Poco f1 and I hey guys this is a page from p1 calm and the poco f1 arrived recently yeah and the Pope way phone and I'm calm and the poco a poco x2 poco X 2 poco X to the poco x2 arrived recently and I've been using this phone as my daily driver for the last few days and well this is a poco X to review but I'll be answering the big question should you buy the brand new poke or x2 now I will be answering this question at the end along with other questions that we got in a first impressions video so I watched the video to the end now let's get started so starting off with the review if you have seen a first impressions video you'd know that I wasn't particularly impressed with the popo X Tuesday sorry and well I'm still not but I can live with this for sure yes this phone is a little big and it's also pretty hefty when compared to the likes to read me x2 and this is also one of the most slipperiest phone I've ever used but I wouldn't say that I have this slide using this one I think it's fine I mean to be honest I think the redmi note 8 pro or the real me x2 look better but yeah this design isn't really a deal-breaker now one unique thing about this design is the side mounted fingerprint scanner something that's pretty rare but you know what I like it on the poco x2 might um naturally lands on the scanner and it's fast so no problems at all it's pretty seamless another thing I like on the poco x2 is this display obviously the big highlight of the poco X through the 120 Hertz IPS LCD display now if I tell you frankly I would have preferred AMOLED instead of the IPS LCD but you know what this is a good display it's as good as I face LCDs get in this price range it's decently bright outdoors it's sharp and this is a punch on which adds to the whole bezel s experience I mean sure the punch holes here aren't as seamless as they on the Galaxy phones with AMOLED but it looks fine the slight bleeding problem I told you about is not a problem really coming back to the display it is smooth as you'd expect me or xi has obviously been optimized for the 120 Hertz display so the experience is definitely nice every time I use the probe x2 is displayed had this really nice mood this about it while I was crawling or you know opening apps see the higher refresh rate is nice it's definitely nice but it's not something that fools my the poco x2 a truly taking full potential of I mean so the apps and games are logged at 60 Hertz and there were times when I felt a little bit of a starter in animations when I was switching between say a new UI app or a third-party app plus there's the fact that not a lot of game support this high refresh rate I mean it's clear that we are not really utilizing the 120 Hertz display to the max I did know ultras Odyssey and shadow and legends on the phone games that have one to any heard support and the experience was great but yeah it would have been very better had say games like pubsey mobile or Siri had support from wonder when he has disgrace plus the one to any hers refresh rate drains the battery a lot faster now in a first impressions video I did say that I'll be putting the 120 Hertz IPS LCD versus 60 Hertz amulet to test and well I did I played a YouTube video at 1080p on max brightness for an are on the poco x2 which is set to 120 Hertz and the readme X and the battery drain was higher on the poco the poco x2 lost 16% of the battery while they're healing me x2 loss just 8% so the poco extra point when he has lost double the battery also while I was doing this test I noticed how colors looked a lot better in the real me x2 display yeah just a blur things anyway I also played pubsey mobile at HD high graphic settings for an R on both these phones and again the poco x2 was set to 120 Hertz and when again the battery drain was higher on the Polk who acts to the poco x2 lost 21% battery was the readme x2 lost 30% so it's a big difference and again the AMOLED display on the Aryan me x2 looked a lot better so here's my preference when it comes to displace 120 Hertz AMOLED 60 Hertz AMOLED 120 Hertz IPS LCD and then 60 Hertz IPS LCD I hope that makes sense moving on to the speaker output the poco x2 single speaker is fairly loud and the quality is pretty good too there was a little bit of a distortion at maximum volume but that's what you get on most phones in this price range so I'd say it's good enough anyway I don't think I've been extensively testing on the poco x2 are its quad cameras it's a usual camera setup but the highlight has to be the new Sony imx6 86 64 megapixel sensor so I've been taking a lot of photos from the poco x2 as one thing for sure the 64 million purse is so nice it captures some impressive shots in good lighting they are two major points to notice the great details and the good color accuracy just look at this picture it's impressive and if it zoom in you can see all the details when he went preserve I mean the dynamic range in some photos could have been better like say in this photo but other than that the photos in good light are really good in Laura things are slightly less impressive I mean most photos are bright and fairly sharp and I'd he appreciate that but in some photos you can see a little green in the darker parts which is kind of a bummer now I did say in a first impressions video that I will be comparing the sony 64 megapixel sensor on the poco x2 versus the samson 64 megapixel sensor on the readme x2 and well let's check things out so here's a nice shot from both the X twos and I like the poco x2 photo here you can see that the poco x2 photo has better contrast yeah and it just looks better also details if you just zoom in here you can see the difference right here's another photo and this time booth the foods have taken very similar shots when it comes to the colors and though you know you are an exposure but if we zoom in on this text you can see that the poco x2 short is sharper and more clear in Lodi both the phones are very close and you can see these shots are very similar however in some shots like this one the poco x24 is just a tad bit sharper it's not a big difference but yeah overall I see the Pope h.264 megapixel sensor is definitely better especially in daytime with the purpose to Trump's real me x2 ends of the details and contrast comparisons aside when it comes to the ultra wide-angle lens the photos do look cool with the distortion correction on point and the photos are sharp all across the details aren't as good obviously and some photos don't have the same nice colors at the main camera but I'd suggest enough anyway also like the portrait mode of the poco x2 in most portrait mode shots I took the edge detection might not be perfect especially around the hair but other than that it was really good and the face smoothing that's been a problem in Xiamen phones is less prominence so I like it since I am talking about the portrait mode I also deported more selfies from the phone because I wanted to see if the tape sensor on the front as well and turns out it does fairly well the portrait selfies have these the accurate edge detection and the face details are intact - so yeah I like the portrait mode of the poco x2 but I don't like much is the macro lens which is I'd say fine I mean I don't like the macro lens in most phones so I wasn't really expecting anything from poco x2 so I guess it's fine but not something I'd ever use my order video is the folk at her DF pace videos from the poco x2 look good I mean you can see here that the video is sharp and fairly detailed and the exposure adjustment is pretty quick too so yeah it's nice the colors are a bit warm and there's no oh is so stability is only decent dish but overall it's good enough now the proko x2 does not have a super stable more like the real me x2 but it has this new vlog video which is a little gimmicky but a lot of fun so this mod has like eight presets with cool transitions and music to choose from and using these you can make videos like this one check out [Music] so overall the 64 megapixel Sony sensor on the poco x2 is really great I mean like any other budget smartphone the low-light performance is just decent but the good light performance is just freely played and it clearly beats the 64 megapixels Samsung sensor on the readme x2 plus all of the other cameras on the poco X to work fine so overall the cameras here are truly a winner another area where the poco X two is the winner is the performance I mean I've new Snapdragon 730 G phones in the past and they've all performed really well so I was expecting the book where to do well in day-to-day usage and do well it does I have been using this phone extensively and I can't really have any problems with this performance now obviously talked about the animation stutter in 120 Hertz at times but that's not really lag and overall I played the performance on the poco x2 very good even on the game in front the poco extra handles all the popular games without any issues I've played a lot of pubsey mobile on this phone and let me tell you there's not been a hint of lag or stutter not just publishing mobile I've also played some casual games on the phone and the other Cape is really smooth moving on the softer front there's new UI 11 based on Android 10 and the new I haven't updated is something I like specially combined with the pokken launcher but there are a few problems first of all these notifications are just annoying I have disabled them but I just hate seeing them plus there's the bloat with the poco x2 his Facebook gaana hello Amazon daily not and bunch of these games pre-installed yeah it's annoying I remember when the book where everyone arrived it only had Facebook and some office apps pre-installed yeah this is a little frustrating and having said that I haven't encountered any ads so far on the prope x2 which is definitely good news now see there's the battery the big 4500 mAh battery which i think is really good I mean when I started using this phone my primary router on the battery was when the phone last day with the screen set to 1 to any Hertz and you know what it does the Pokedex to just about managed to last me a day with the screen set to 120 Hertz and I got a screen on time of 5 and a half hours which i think is really good the battery performs even better when the screen is set to 60 Hertz and I got a screen on time of 7 hours which is just amazing when it comes to charging the 27 watt charger that comes in the box with the poco x2 is really fast it charges the poco extra from ten to fifty percent in just 24 minutes and takes only 54 minutes to charge his phone from ten to hundred percent I mean this is a 4,500 image battery we're talking about so this is some really fast fast charging speed in comparison the real me x2 with the 4000 mAh battery takes 72 minutes to go from ten to hundred percent with its 30 watt roof charger so like we said in one of our videos the watch don't matter it's the charging technology that matters about from that a lot of you guys wanted to know if the poco x2 supports voice over Wi-Fi and when it does support voice over Wi-Fi out of the box when it's time now for the word it should you buy the poco x2 well first let me get it out of the way that the poco x2 is not an unbeatable smartphone like the poco f1 I mean it definitely does not live up to the legacy of the poco everyone what with this being just a red Nikita did rebrand it anyway if you move past that which I did this is great value for money see the rupees 15 triple nine is just a three price tag for a phone that has a high refresh rate display brings great performance very good cameras and fantastic battery life I mean it's not perfect obviously it's definitely ambulant for me when it comes to 120 Hertz LCD or 60 Hertz AMOLED and the food is a little big and bulky but if you're all giving out of that the poco x2 is a phone you should definitely buy but if you're not okay with all of that the higher price dx2 is still a good choice with AMOLED and a more sleeker design well that was our review of the poco x2 but what do you think of this new smartphone tell us in the comment section below also to give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends were confused between the poke where x2 and the real me x2 lastly subscribe to our channel for more
