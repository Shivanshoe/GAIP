so samsung recently launched this in india the brand new galaxy a53 5g and i was actually interested because the galaxy a52s and the a52 were really good mid-range smartphones so the a53 should be better right well not really there's one small not really small problem exynos so this is the new galaxy a53 and there are a few changes here from the a52s first of all it comes with a bigger 5000 image battery which is great i'm all in for bigger batteries but there is a catch samsung has removed the charger from the box yeah this is not a trend i'm a big fan of i mean samsung is clearly going to do this for all of its new phones but i really hope that other manufacturers don't follow this trend what do you guys think of this no charger in the box train in mid-range smartphones comment down below now talking about removing stuff samsung's also went ahead and removed the good old headphone jack yes the a52 has had it but it's gone in the galaxy a53 anyway the biggest change from the a52s is the chipset the galaxy a53 comes with the exynos 1280 and i would have been okay with exynos if it was an upgrade the problem is it's not i mean the exynos 1280 is more efficient with the five nanometer architecture but the snapdragon 778g in the galaxy a52s is just more powerful here's what i'm talking about check out the android scores of the a53 with exynos 1280 and the galaxy m52 with snapdragon 778 g and you can see that the 778g is just way ahead in terms of cv performance or g performance yeah i was expecting this with a cp performance but the exynos 1280 is behind even on the gpu front i also ran some more benchmarks and the 778g is just better in every single one of those tests so clearly the 778g is the better chipset here now benchmarks apart the day-to-day performance of the a53 is good i've not used it as my daily driver but there's no real lag or any issues so far in fact the exynos 1280 does well in the cpu throttling test too as you can see in the screenshots however it still feels like a downgrade from the 778g why because for example in bgmi in the graphics settings the a53 maxes out at hd high or smooth and high so you can only play games at up to 30 fps in comparison here's the galaxy m52 which has the snapdragon 770 g and bgmi it can go to hdr ultra or smooth extreme so you can play bgmi at up to 60 fps it's a big difference also the 778g is made with tsmc's six nanometer foundry while on the other hand the exynos 1280 is apparently made with samsung's five nanometer foundry and you know what this means right i mean the galaxy a53 is fine to use at the moment but samsung's track record isn't that great when it comes to efficiency so i'm a little skeptical about that moving on to the next change in the a53 and this is something i actually appreciate the a53 comes with the latest one ui 4.1 on top of android 12 but more importantly samsung has promised four major os updates for the phone along with five years of security patches this means this phone will get android 16 which is just awesome see four major os updates is the absolute best you can get in the android world and it's really good because actually influencing other manufacturers will support the devices longer which in the end is good for us the consumers now having said that i would also like if samsung pushes more stable updates rather than quickly rushing a build with bugs like in the case of a52's recent android 12 update also one ui could be a little cleaner on phones like the a53 for 35k phone to have ads on the lock screen so many bloatware apps is a bit strange but yeah i definitely like what samsung is doing with the software updates on its phones now apart from all these changes the a53 is basically the same phone as the a52s so there's the similar plastic back design with the new camera style that reminds me of the oppo f5 and x5 you still get the ip67 ratings to your speakers the display is identical from the a52s same size same 120 hertz amoled with the same 800 nits of max brightness with gorilla glass 5 and you know what i like it it's samsung among panel and it looks really good and vibrant the front camera is the same 32 megapixel sensor and the quad camera setup is also identical with the main 64 megapixel sony sensor with ois now i'm okay with this because the 64 megapixel sensor with ois takes very good shots i'm yet to compare things but the cam performance seems good here look overall you know what i still feel that the galaxy a52s makes more sense than the galaxy a53 let's check out this comparison see the a52s is still available starting at rupees 29 triple nine which is almost 5k less than the a53's price tag and it's very similar to the a53 when it comes to the design the display cameras 5g bands plus it has the headphone jack and it comes with the charger in the box even though it's a 15 watt charger it has a smaller battery and only go up till android 14 but the snapdragon 778g is a big advantage over the exynos 1280. so yes i'd personally pick the a52s over the a53 but i'll also wait for samsung to fix the issues and bugs people are complaining about in one ui 4.0 on the a52s but i want to know what you think so comment down below give this video a like and make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos lastly signing off thanks
