[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient be boom calm and this right here is the brand new poco x2 yeah and there's a lot of hype around it because it comes after more than one and a half years since the poco f1 so does this phone deserve the hype well let's check out the poco x2 and find out well let me just start off by telling you that the poco x2 is not a flagship or flagship killer like the poco f1 it's a mid-range it's a new poco so what exactly is new so first off on the design front right of the bat yes all the guesses were true sadly so and this is indeed the red McGee 30 rebranded if the exact same phone with the exact same design and the same specs but instead of red me it just says poco in the back and in fact it even says designed by poco I mean seriously really the Pope where f1 might not have had a brilliant design but at least it was unique well to be honest so far I'm not really impressed with the poco x2 s design I mean this is according a glass fire bag but it does not does not feel like glass I mean this should be glass obviously but yeah it's not as premium as I'd like plus I'm not a big fan of the metered Hebrew like camera design and I think it looks pretty weird and the fact that this is a fairly big bulky smartphone being too ornate rocks look it's not something absurdly and you can obviously use it but it does mean a little taking hefty in the ads I will be using the phone as my daily driver in the next few days so I will have to see if I can limit this going on to the front which is one of the big big highlights of the poco x2 this new 120 Hertz display this is a six point six seven inch IPS LCD display with HDR ten to do a punch hole and most interestingly a high refresh rate of 120 Hertz now personally I would have lied AMOLED since delete me x2 brings it and if a poll is anything to go by a lot of people think the same so we will be doing a DD and comparison between sixty Hertz AMOLED versus 120 Hertz I placed NCD complaint the quality battery efficiency and mod in half full review Stadium anyway going back to the proko x 2.is display it is a smooth one to any hers display on the poco x2 and everything just feels really smooth and nice with the UI the animation different gestures it's all very smooth yes this shoe read up some battery and for that there is an option to set the display to 60 Hertz as for the games we all know not many games support this high refresh rate but I did play Altos Odyssey on the phone with suppose 120 Hertz so just get a feel of things and well the gameplay was super smooth I really enjoyed it so yeah I will check out some other 120 Hertz games to experience this display more now like I said there's also this dual punch hole and when it looks modern this is an IPS LCD so you can see a little backlight bleeding around the edges and we are if you notice also these are little two separate punch holes with a little UI patch in between to make them look seamless apart from that the cater I mean the poco x2 has the side mounted fingerprint scanner the hybrid dual sim micro SD slot the usual single speaker USB C port and the good old headphone jack anyway let's talk under the hood now we like the red maketo t fuji version the poco x2 comes with the Snapdragon 730 G chipset with up to 8 GB RAM and 256 gigs of u FS 2.1 storage now these are not out of the world extraordinary specs but that's probably the pope wave but for a meter and smartphone these are pretty good specs so let's check out the benchmarks when the benchmark scores are pretty good the phone easily beats the redmi note 8 pro and it is similar to what you get with the real me x2 which has the same chips and a ball anyway when it comes to actual day-to-day usage the poco x2 has been fast and snappy in my use it so far I will be using this as my daily driver like I said so I'll have a better idea slow my console game ePub t-mobile runs at high graphics settings on the phone and the experience is quite good I mean 70 G is a capable chipset we all know so not a surprise because the software the poco x2 comes with me UI 11 on top of Android 10 so it is the latest software what I mean it's not me you wife or pork or anything different but you do get the book or launcher with the app drawer third-party I can pack support different customizations so that's nice anyway vui 11 here has the usual set of apps installed and I was ok with it but I also noticed this games folder which has these game screen start I mean you can't uninstall these games but yeah it's not something I'd like to see on a brand new for next of the cameras the poke x2 packs in a quad camera setup featuring a 64 megapixel main camera and 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens our two megapixel macro lens and a 2 megapixel dead since now what's interesting here is that the 64 megapixel camera is the new Sunni imx6 86 64 megapixel sensor so inbreed doesn't see how it fails against the other 64 mega pixel senses of Sado noted pro or real me x2 anyway take a look at some photos I have taken from the x2 and in good light things look particularly impressive for us at pacheco does a pretty sharp and there's good detail yeah these photos look pretty nice in low-light photos are bright as a 64 megapixel sensor captures a lot of light but I did notice a little bit of an issue with lights so yeah I will take some more nor I chose to see if it's actually an issue I also took some ultra wide shots and some ultra wide-angle shots to have muted colors but I liked the fact that these shots have a lot of detail and a pretty sharp so yes it seems positive other than that the poco x2 has the macro lens which has autofocus unlike a lot of phones with macro lenses and so far it seems pretty good there's also the portrait mode which seems decent with the face having good details but the edge detection does seem a little off in some shots so yeah I'd be testing things out more on the video front there is no 4k 60fps support or oh is although it is too much to ask for in this price range anyway here's a faux get her the FPS video from the phone which seems pretty good considering I took this in the evening when the light was going down lastly on the camera front are the selfies there's dual cameras here a 20 megapixel main camera and a 2 megapixel depth sensor well the selfie is from the poco x2 look decent although focusing seems to be an issue and thanks to the depth sensor the portrait mode self is a fairly good tube but yeah I've only taken like five to six selfies from the phone overall the popo X twos cameras seem pretty capable but like I said time and again it's too early to judge and I want to compare these cameras against the Raimi X 2's cameras so yeah I will reserve my wallet for a full review next up is the battery the polka X 2 packs in a big 4500 mAh battery so this is the reason it's kind of a hefty phone anyway of the charging front it's great to see xiaomi or you know poco bundling the 27 watt fast charging in the boss this charger should be pretty fast and it will be interesting to see how fast it charges this big battery but that was a good look at the brand new poco x2 and while this is a decent new smartphone I don't think it's anything extraordinary and honestly I am a little underwhelmed maybe it's because I've been waiting for the next poco since a long long time or maybe it's because this is just the red Makita TV branded I don't know the poco x2 just seems a little less exciting and not as keener as I was hoping it to be I mean they could have just launched it at the red mackay 30 but they probably wanted the poco branding could get more high so yes I don't think the poco x2 deserves all the height that it's been getting having said that this should be a good smartphone for the price which I'm guessing will be in the lead me x2 territory at around 16 to 70 gig and that prize the poco x2 brings a smooth one to any hers display capable chipset cameras that seemed really good so far a big battery with 27 for fast charging however it's not all positive and I have my daughter on the phone and it'll probably compete with the real me x2 which has a sleeker design and an AMOLED display so yeah if you're wondering if you should buy this well I suggested to wait for a full review which is coming soon but it's time now to talk about a sponsors for this video blog point which is one of the leading brands when it comes to truly wireless earbuds the company has recently launched the bTW Pro earbuds which come with great sound and thumping bass doing microphones for noise cancellation and calls and support for aptX for high quality sound now these truly wireless earphones are ipx7 rated so you can use them during your workouts and not worry if they get close to water the BDW pro sticks have individual battery of 70 mah and the charging case has one of the highest rated batteries in the industry which is 740 image thus bTW Pro comes with the massive 36 hour battery life so you can go for days without charging them the earphones are Preiser 2p6 triple line and after the air pods these might just be the ones to buy so check them out from the link in the description but those are my thoughts on the poco x2 and our review is coming soon so if you have any questions
