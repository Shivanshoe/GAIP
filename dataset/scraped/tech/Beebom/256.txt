[Applause] hey guys this is from v1.com and samsung has announced the latest phone in its m series lineup the galaxy m31s now i know a lot of the specs a lot of the features of the phone have already leaked out and you probably know about them but there's a lot more to this phone that you don't know about and i'll be telling you everything new in the new galaxy m21s so let's begin okay so this is the new galaxy m31s and while there are upgrades almost every single front i think the major highlights of the phone are its design and its canvas the design is something i really like i mean there are a number of things that have changed as you can see there's a new gradient and even though this is still samsung's glass stick the silver and black give it a very metallic look the gradient extends to the frame and i think it looks really cool that's not all i also like the fact that the phone has a more boxy design and its corners are less curved here's what i'm talking about take a look at the phone next to the galaxy m31 and as you can see the m31s looks the more premium phone of the two both on the front and the back another change comes in the form of this the fingerprint scanner is now side mounted on the power button and it's very fast a good change here there are changes on the front too the galaxy m31s brings a beautiful 6.5 inch super amoled full hd plus display with gorilla glass 3 and the upgrade here comes in the form of the fact that this is an infinity o display yup you get this very small punch hole in the center and i think this whole almost bezel-less display looks really good apart from that the display is amoled so it does look vibrant and nice and like almost all samsung phones the m31s comes with the wide wide l1 certification and you can watch netflix and prime video shows in hd so that's no problem you also get all the important functionality in the rest of the design the headphone jack the usbc port the single speaker all around the bottom and you get a dual sim plus micro sd triple slot so that's sorted as well so the design has been updated on the galaxy m21s and you know what i like it even though it's plastic i like it i like the looking feel now another highlight of the m31s is the cameras you get a quad camera setup that includes the new 64 megapixel sony imx 682 main camera a 12 megapixel ultra wide angle lens and two five megapixel lenses for macros and depth so this is an interesting camera setup and well i've only taken a few shots from the phone and i haven't really done any comparisons but so far the 64 megapixel sensor seems promising because the photos are crisp detailed and have good colors i mean look at this shot it's beautiful the ultra wide angle lens is cool too because it has a nice 123 degrees wide field of view and the photos have really good colors and the dynamic range as you can see from these shots to be honest it's too early to judge the cameras on the galaxy m31s in fact i'm yet to test out the macro lens and the depth lens but yeah so far the main camera and the ultra wide angle lens look very good so i'm positive now on the video front there's 4k video recording support and there's the super steady mode well here's a 4k video i shot from the phone and well just take a look apart from that there are a lot of cool camera features here there's single take the feature that we first came across in the s20 and with this you can just hit the capture button and it will automatically take multiple stylized photos and videos here's an example so as you can see single take has taken a usual photo a photo with a very cool filter a hyperlapse video and a boomerang video how cool is that the 64 megapixel camera has also been dubbed in telecam because it tells you when you need to switch to 64 megapixel mode for more detailed shots like in the case of a landscape another thing i like is the fact that you can switch between the front camera and the rear camera while shooting a video like this and it's going to be super handy for instagram stories youtube stories so i like this feature there's also the very capable selfie camera and here are a few selfies from the 32 megapixel camera on the front and i like the fact that the selfies look good with good exposure and fairly decent detail when there's good lighting what's more interesting to me though is that you can shoot 4k videos from the front camera too and there's slo-mo video support now the design the cameras these are the highlights but the battery has always been top-notch on mcd's phones and the m31s is no exception to that the m31s packs in the massive 6000 mah battery so the battery life should be really good but the new here is the fact that samsung's finally upgraded the charger the m31s comes with a 25 watt usbc charger in the box now we did not get the retail box of the galaxy m31s but samsung says it's the same 25 watt fast charger that you get with the galaxy s20 and it's supposed to take the m31s from zero to 100 in just 97 minutes so that's pretty amazing and yeah i'll be testing it out apart from that the m21s also supports reverse charging via the usb c port so you can use it as a power bank and i mean you should because it's a 6000 mah battery lastly what's new on the hardware front though the galaxy m31s is powered by the exynos 9611 chipset with up to 8 gigs of lpddr 4x ram and 128gb of ufs 2.1 storage see i like the more ram and storage options but the processor hasn't changed it's the exynos 9611 the same chips at the part the m31 the m30s and a lot of other samsung phones so it's not new but if the performance of m31 is anything to go by the 9611 should be fine with day-to-day tasks and it can also handle casual pubg mobile gaming sessions but yes it isn't a chipset that can take on the competing chipsets in the same pricing but you know what i think what puts the galaxy m31s ahead is the fact that the software experience is very clean the m21s comes the latest one ui 2.1 on top of android 10 and there are no banned apps or anything in fact you only get a few microsoft apps facebook netflix and snapchat pre-installed and that's pretty much it plus you can uninstall them if you want to so that's nice too and since this is the latest when you are version you get all the features like navigation gestures auto dark mode and more to conclude things on the new galaxy m31s uh at the time of shooting this video we do not know the price of the phone and this is kind of a very early first impressions video so i'll deserve my judgment but if you ask me i think i like a lot of the changes that the galaxy m31s brings i mean the new design looks better the infinity oh amanda looks modern the cameras seem very capable the insane big battery is still here with faster charging you get the latest software on board with no banned apps or anything but yes the chipset is the same old exynos 96 11. well there you have it those are our first
