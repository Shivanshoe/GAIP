let's stop this [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and over the last few months i have been noticing a lot of these phone exploding stories poco x3 exploding while charging oppo a53 heating up in a man's pocket exploding redmi note 9 pro blasting after smoke starts coming out of it not too exploding while cycling well there are so many stories galaxy a02 galaxy a21 iphone 10 oppo f11 and a lot more now i know there are a lot of fake news as well when it comes to phones exploding but the truth is most of these stories are true phones are actually exploding i mean scary right because people are actually getting hurt so the question is why is this happening how do you protect yourself from your phone exploding well first of all there are a number of reasons why a phone can explode number one is overheating overheating is probably the biggest reason why a phone explodes now a lot of these phones have these fail-safe technologies to make sure the phone remains safe even at higher temperatures but not all phones do well when there's excessive heat constantly see lithium-ion batteries are volatile and too much heat on the battery can cause the battery to swell up compromise the structure and at the end explode see there are multiple ways your phone could overheat i mean gaming on your phone or calling for long hours when the phone is charging could you know do it having the phone in your pocket or in your bag with the power bank connected is another example also when you put our phone to charge on the bed there's not enough space for heat dissipation so make sure to place it on the side tip anyway it's not just charging leaving the phone out in direct sun or any hot environment for too long can also explode your phone same with the malware on your phone or just unoptimized software overworking the cpu resulting in overheating so the point is take your phones overheating seriously don't ignore it if you feel that your phone is overheating make sure to check the battery temperature in your phone i mean some androids can show you the battery temperature like miui does but on other phones you can use an app like accu battery which shows you the temperature or you can use battery protector i mean it's an old app as you can see but it lets you set alarms for when your phone overheats i've set it to 50 and if your phone overheats over 50 i think you should take it to the service center so point number one is overheating point number two is battery damage first up a little theory any external damage to the battery can change the mechanical or the chemical structure of the battery which might lead to short circuit or overheating and then you know explosion so imagine this maybe you dropped your phone really hard it's looking fine it's working fine but the battery isn't lasting very long the phone has suddenly started to overheat but in this case obviously the battery has been damaged and this can result in explosion do not this can also happen if you have managed to you know bend your phone see point number three is using uncertified charges see this is something that our parents or our non-techie friends do you know buying that 100 rupees charges just because it's cheap see this is bad because using non-compatible charges can really affect your phone's battery it can short-circuit your phone's battery leading to worse battery life and yeah in the worst case scenario ending in an explosion so make sure to stick with your phone's charger and charging cable don't mix and match charger and charging cables because a lot of these adapters have different wattages and a lot of these charging cables have different standards point number four is don't leave your old phone for a long time fully charged or fully discharged so your battery permanently dies if it's fully discharged and a battery can degrade faster if it's at 100 charge so you need to hit the sweet spot to give an example we have a couple of phones these batteries have sworn up take a look at this yeah the back of this phone is not removable but the swollen battery has forced it away here's another phone which has its back intact but you can see the big swelling now i'm not sure if i kept these phones inside charged or discharged but yeah this is not safe see the best thing to do when you're keeping away your phone for a long time is to just charge it to 50 and then store it in a cool dry place i mean this is the reason when you buy a brand new smartphone you start it up you see the phone is at around 50 60 charge because companies know that these phones could be in the shelves warehouses for a long long time so they just charge it to around 50 60 percent to you know hit the sweet spot also if you have a phone that looks like this don't charge it don't use the phone even if it's working just take it to a service center straight now apart from all that one thing you should always do is maintain your phone's battery health see smartphone lithium-ion batteries are at most stress when they are at zero percent or when they are at hundred percent so the key here is to charge your phone to eighty to ninety percent and don't let the battery go below fifteen to twenty percent also make sure to use the optimized charging or adaptive charging or any other similar feature that your phone has most phones these days have this feature and this feature makes sure that when you put your phone to charge at night it goes to 80 quickly and then kind of stops and slows down the rest of the 20 percent is charged right before you wake up this means the phone is not at hundred percent constantly and that results in better battery health as to how you can check the battery health on your phone some phones show it in the battery settings or you can install an app like ampere or acu battery to check the battery head look the bottom line is the chances of your phone exploding is very low but do make sure to keep these points in mind so that if there's anything wrong with your phone's battery you can take action quickly before something bad actually happens so yeah keep these points in mind
