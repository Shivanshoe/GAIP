[Music] [Applause] [Music] so hey guys this is a page from bbom.com and it's been some time since we talked about android apps and in the meanwhile a lot of cool new android apps have arrived so yeah it's time to talk about eight cool new android apps that i think you're gonna love i think this is a very varied list of android apps so yeah there's an app for basically everyone so watch till the end let's get started with the first app okay so i recently saw this video on twitter showing an app that lets you pick objects in the real world and paste it on your laptop and honestly this is the first time that i saw practical use of ar so i obviously wanted to try it well the app is called clip drop ar and it actually works so i have clip drop installed on my phone and on my laptop now i can just point the camera to save this the pikachu bobblehead and click a picture now as you can see it's automatically cropped and i can just import it here on my laptop and drop it as an object but this is actually really good and works i mean i've tried this out on multiple objects like tvs my cycle it works very well almost every single time so yeah this is pretty cool plus i like that clip drop ar works on apps like google docs powerpoint and even photoshop so that makes it very useful now clipdrop ar is not available in india but i'll leave a link of the apk down below so make sure to check it out because i think you will relate to this see generally custom skins give battery life more priority rather than performance i mean i've seen a lot of custom skins killing apps running in the background and i'm not talking about popular apps like whatsapp or facebook i'm talking about new apps and that kind of ruins the performance and it's very weird because most of our phones these days have 6gb ram ag with a minimum and if you want to know if your phone is killing apps in the background this new app tells you the truth see i'm talking about the new don't kill my app which is a benchmark tool you can run for a few hours to check if your phone is killing apps in the background i ran the benchmark on the pixel 4a and it got a 100 score which means it does not kill apps in the background and i think stock android does not as for other skins well they did not do very well in this benchmark as you can see miui 1 ui and real me you are there all below the 100 mark and have these wide spaces indicating that the kill apps running in the background honestly miui and real me ui are pretty bad as for oxygen os the oneplus 8t with the latest oxygen os 11 surprisingly did well like stock android with the hundred percent mark and it's surprising because there's even a ranking of manufacturers in the don't kill my app website which shows the companies who kill apps in the background most notoriously and it has one plus on top so maybe one person's fixed it maybe and yeah that's a good thing and i hope other makers do the same so the iphone's got a new feature recently back tap which basically lets you double tap or triple tap on the back to do an action like opening the control center or even do things like scrolling 911 also has a similar hidden feature which hasn't really made it to prime time anyway this new app called tap tap brings the same functionality to every single android phone it's a very simple app that just works not only the pixel 4a but even on xiaomi phones real me phones or even samsung phones so it's pretty simple you can just set an action for the double tap and the triple tap and then you can just do this to take a screenshot maybe or turn on the flashlight it's very cool and i like that there's even haptic feedback when you use this so yeah this is actually pretty useful so this one is for samsung users out there i'm sure you guys have used good lock because it's like the ultimate customization tool on samsung phones but recently i came across this video on twitter showing the samsung keyboard with this really cool almost rgb like effect well this is thanks to a new keys cafe module in good luck so i installed the keyscafe module and well this is the same theme and effect in action right here on the samsung keyboard this looks awesome and yeah i like this cool new effect but the module has a lot more as you see and i also like this effect which i think is very cool so these new effects add an rgb feel to the keyboard but there are other features too you can make your own keyboard here by customizing the keys and everything you can even style things so yeah if you have a samsung phone running one ui 2.5 check it out on the galaxy store i know i know every other screen and even stock android now has a screen recorder built in but this is a screen recorder app that i think you like so this is the screen recorder app i'm talking about and i know it looks like a pretty usual screen recorder app but there's a twist see as far as i know this is the only screen recorder that actually supports screen recording in up to 120 fps as you can see there's 90 120 option which is great because a lot of phones these days have higher refresh rate displays so the whole high refresh smoothness and animations can be actually captured via this screen recorder so yeah this is great so a lot of new launchers have arrived off late but i think this ratio launcher is something that deserves a mention so this is the ratio launcher in all its glory and i think it's minimal look is beautiful see what makes this launcher appealing is that it's aimed at cutting down your phone usage but it's not in your face about it see there are two pages here the root aka the home screen where you can quickly check things like news weather play youtube video jot on a note turn on the timer yeah there's a lot of functionality and there's the second page which is basically the app drawer with apps categorized you can search for apps move them around and you can even press hold on an app to see how much you've used it and get more customization options see this whole monochrome look takes some time getting used to but i actually find it interesting so you guys might like it so if you watched our ios 14 video you'd know that i really like the new features where the phone shows you these dots when an app is using the camera or the mic miui 12 brought a similar feature and i really like that but if you want this feature on your phone access dots is a new app right it's very simple it shows ios 14 like color dots whenever the camera or the mic is in you so the moment this camera is active this dot shows up same with the mic and since it is an android app there's obviously customizability you can choose the location of the dots the colors of the dots the size etc etc yeah just create android things so powershade is an app that i have recommended in our past videos because it lets you customize the notification shade completely with the tiles the theme basically everything and it's not exactly a new app so why am i recommending it again well good question see powersheet brings android 11's new media controls ui to any android device as you can see the app lets you add a dedicated media control ui to the notification shade just like android 11. now all of the android 11 features are present here but you can control the media playback and i like that there's this button to switch between different output devices so this is cool if you wanted the android 11 media control feature well those are some of the cool new android apps that i recently discovered and if you want to check them out i have added all the links in the description down below so check them out and yeah if you think there's a new app that we kind of missed out on make sure to comment down below give
