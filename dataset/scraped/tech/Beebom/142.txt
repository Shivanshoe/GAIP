[Music] [Applause] [Music] so hey guys this is from v1.com and when realme launched its first tv in india last year the 43-inch realme tv i kind of liked it but it also had a few issues going with it it did not have five years wi-fi support it was low on ram and storage and it was not a 4k tv well this is a new 43 inch tv from real me and this is actually a 4k tv so that's one problem solved but what about the other issues what are the new upgrades it brings well there's actually a lot to talk about so let's get right into it so this is the new 43-inch real me 4k tv in my living room and i think this is a very good looking team i mean look wise this tv is kind of similar to the first dmv tv but that's actually a good thing because this looks like a nice modern tv now obviously the big factor contributing to that is the very narrow bezel i think the side and top bezels are around two 2.6 millimeters the bottom bezel is a little bigger and it has the real me logo and there's also this sort of panel below which has the power status indicator and these four leds that light up when hands-free voice control is in action yes the realme tv has four far field microphones so you don't have to use the remote to activate google assistant this hands-free hey google detection and it actually works well hey google open netflix and play army of the dead okay opening networks let me give you another example hey google play the eternals trailer on youtube here's what i found on youtube now since this is google assistant you can also use it to control your smart home hey google turn off the lights all right turning two lights off so this is a great addition from realme and it's actually useful and as you can see it's also pretty fast so yeah it works i mean i have used hands-free google assistant in tcl tvs in the past but this is definitely more responsive now if you're wondering if there's a way to turn off these mice there's a physical switch at the back that does exactly that let's toggle this and that's it anyway going back to the design this is how the tv looks from the sides and here's the back panel now as for the ports there's an av port ant a couple of usb a ports three hdmi ports with the first one supporting arc a lan port and a digital audio port one thing to note there is no 3.5 mm jack here now let's talk about the two big factors in a tv the display and the sound so this tv is available in a 43 inch and 50 inch variant and we have the 43 inch one and let me show you the specs of this panel so this is a 4k led 60 hertz display with up to 83 ntsc and 90 dc ip3 coverage 320 nits of max brightness 178 degrees wide viewing angles dolby vision hdr 10 hdr 10 plus support hlg tuv rhineland low blue light certification real me's chroma boostek and if you're wondering about the panel type it's a usual d led panel now that was a lot of specs but talking about the picture quality i found the panel here to be fairly bright sharp and the colors look right with the display set to the standard mode as for the different modes there's vivid sport a custom mode and a movie mode now another important factor in a tv display i think is contrast because a lot of us like watching tv in the dark and this panel does well on that front the contrast is pretty good the blacks don't blow out which is important as for dolby vision hdr support netflix does show the 4k tag and the vision tag in supported shows and movies and i did feel those shows looking more crisp and nice on this panel amazon prime video also shows up the uhd and the hdr tag as you can see here i mean see the point is i've only used the tv for a few days but so far the display here seems right on point moving on to the sound quality there are quad 24 watt speakers here a full range driver and a tweet on both the corners and these fire downwards as for the frequency range it's wide the speakers can go from 148 hertz to 20 000 hertz there's also dolby atmos dolby audio as well as dts hd support i use the tv with 12b atmos always turned on and like the picture quality the 43-inch readme 4k tv also gets the sound right i mean i'm a sound bar with the tv guy because tv speakers mostly range from decent dish to average and the speakers in this tv qualify as decent it's loud in my living room 30 was always more than enough so the clarity is good the details are good and i did not notice any distortion at higher volumes and if you're wondering about the base it's a tv speaker so it's kind of fine let's listen to this it's around 40 the volume let me just increase it [Music] now that's loud [Music] now coming to the smart tv experience the realme tv comes with android tv 10 on board and it's a stock experience no launcher or anything on top as for the pre-installed apps there's quite a few of them netflix prime video live tv for dta setups speed channel which is basically an app to bring your recommendations and you can't install it there's also play store youtube music play movies youtube play games a multimedia player which can be handy for local files bluetooth audio app cosplay to control the tv via your phone how to cast guide app lean key keyboard and a browser as for the rest of the experience it is android tv circuit chrome cars play store google assistant the usual when it comes to the specs the real me 4k tv is powered by a mediatek quad core chipset with cortex a53 cores that can go up to 1.5 gigahertz as for the ram and storage i like that the tv isn't low on either there's 2gb ram and 16gb storage with around 11gb available for you now real-world performance of tv can only be judged in the long term because the tv is something we use at least for a couple of years but if you ask me my opinion so far i'd say the performance aspect of this tv is positive the android tv experience has been smooth apps open up fairly quickly and i haven't faced any weird lags or anything i mean an app like the prime video app stuck on every single tv so that's amazon's fault i mean seriously hate the prime video app on any android tv anyway the remote experience is pretty good too this is the remote you get and this is a nice bluetooth 5.0 remote the design is handy especially with the curves and the right size the buttons are clicky and there's also all the important buttons you get the mute button a button to get the picture and sound modes quickly for hotkeys for netflix prime video youtube and google assistant and the other usual buttons i also did not find any connectivity issues on the tv there's bluetooth 5.0 support and i like that both 2.4 gigahertz and 5g wi-fi supported and unlike a few tvs which show five gigahertz networks but really don't connect real me tv connected to my five gigahertz wi-fi network just fine lastly there are a few things that i think you should know so first up the tv comes with two aaa batteries in the box for the remote so that's good and uh when it comes to the power consumption the tv takes 100 watts and when it comes to warranty the tv has an air warranty with an additional air warranty on the screen and lastly if you're wondering about the wall mount the wall mount does not come in the box so that was all about the new 43-inch 4k tv from realme and at the time of shooting this video i don't know the price of this tv but it's clear that compared to the first 43-inch full hd tv from redmi last year this is an upgrade on all the fronts i mean there is a useful new feature in the form of hands-free google assistant the ram and storage has been increased there's five gigahertz wi-fi support now and so far everything else about the tv seems to be right the 4k panel seems pretty good the sound for the tv speaker setup is nice you get the stock android tv experience and the specs seem to be in line with what you get in other 43-inch 4k tvs so the new realme 4k tv seems to be a pretty solid all-around 4k tv but there's also a lot depending on the price so yeah let's wait for the price well i'll be paying the price of this tv in the comments down below so make sure to check that and also let us know what you think of this tv and yeah give this video like make sure to share
