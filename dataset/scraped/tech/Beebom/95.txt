[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is the page from viewer.com and a few days back microsoft released its first preview of android app support in windows 11. so how is the android app experience on windows 11 can you install play store on it can you sideload android apps on windows 11 how does it compare to say something like bluestacks well i have been testing things out and while this is a very early preview this gives us a pretty good idea of the whole android apps experience on windows 11 so yeah let's check it out so this is windows 11 beta build running on the laptop and i have the windows subsystem for android which is the coretech behind android app support on windows installed now i think you know that microsoft has brought android app support with the amazon app store so the microsoft store shows android apps but it sends you to the amazon app store to install these android apps which is fine but the amazon app store on windows 11 is in preview and right now it only has a few apps like kindle comixology etc and i was having issues logging into it in india because from the looks of it it's us only right now now what we did is we installed the google play store on windows 11. there's actually a way to do that see we have a step-by-step guide in the description if you want to try it out anyway as you can see i have the play store app pinned in the taskbar now to give you an idea all android apps that you installed show up in the start menu no matter where you've installed it from with the amazon app store play store or even if you've sideloaded them yes you can sideload android apps on windows 11 even though it's not as simple as downloading an apk and just double clicking on anyway apart from the start menu android apps can also be pinned to the taskbar and you can even search for them like this now that's not all you can even resize android apps for example here i am resizing the youtube app and the animation is a bit clunky but it sort of works i can even take it to the full screen and apart from resizing android app windows i can even snap them like this like your regular windows app and i also noticed that turning on the dark mode in windows turns on the dark mode in these android apps which is pretty cool now let me make it clear that not all android apps play well with resizing or snapping but hopefully when this arrives in a stable form things will work better anyway talk about the android app experience well here i am launching the play store and as you can see it shows starting windows subsystem for android and this is the play store yep this is the play store we all know from our android phones and like most android apps it works like it's supposed to and even works well with the laptop's keyboard and mouse i mean i have my account logged in which is not an issue i can search for apps like say whatsapp i can even install it and yeah it all works very well i mean super buggy and sometimes it's very unstable because it just crashes and not all apps are available especially games but yeah this works now i did not just check out the play store i obviously installed a lot of popular apps to you know check out the experience so first up i installed youtube which opens up like this in a sort of tablet mode i think and it works very well i can navigate around the usual ui i can play short videos which as you can see work fine i can even play a full-fledged youtube video and like or dislike a video but one thing is i could not see the comment section when the app was in this tablet sort of size or in full screen but you know what i can resize the app to a more phone like aspect ratio and well there's the comment section i also tried on instagram which in true instagram style remains in portrait even if i resize it or put to full screen now the scaling is nice so there's no weird distortion any browsing the instagram android app on windows 11 is almost flawless be the regular timeline or even the real section or even the explore page i can even like post view the comments and comment myself i can also send messages it's all good but there is one thing the android apps i think right now don't have access to the laptop's webcam or the laptop storage because as you can see the camera does not show up and there's nothing in the gallery too now i did try moving some photos from the laptop storage to the files app on the windows subsystem for android but that is not working apart from this i also did not get notifications from instagram which is something that might be fixed because i was getting these notifications from apps like prime video facebook play store google etc and windows 11's native notification center which is pretty cool anyway apart from this i also tried out whatsapp and it works so this is whatsapp and i was able to log in pretty easily and as you can see i can send messages even check out statuses although like instagram can't send photos from the laptop or access the camera for video calls but you know what the mic from the laptop is actually accessible by these apps which means i can make voice calls from right here in whatsapp so these android apps are getting mic access which makes me think they'll get camera access in the future stable version now apart from messaging apps i also installed some entertainment apps on windows 11 like netflix and prime video so netflix first of all did not work it's stuck on the netflix logo or sometimes this error pops up prime video on the other hand runs almost flawlessly it remains important while browsing but turns to landscape when i play a show or movie and video playback is no problem sound and picture both work fine and you get all the controls like subtitles zoom etc now moving on to games bgmi is not available on the play store on windows 11 and i sideloaded it but i got an error and i not recommend you to try it on windows 11 because i have seen that some accounts are getting banned so don't try that but yeah i tried out a few other games on windows 11. so first off i played dead trigger 2 which does not support keyboard controls but i was sort of able to play it with the mouse mimicking touch controls and as you can see it's just not a great experience but the game looks smooth and there's no lag i also played sniper 3g which does not support keyboard controls again and again i was using touch controls via the mouse anyway the game looks great visually and the performance was also pretty good beat while playing a landscape window on full screen lastly i also tried out s49 which does not support the keyboard controls even though it's stay in the settings as you can see i mean the escape key works fine but that's pretty much it now you can play it via mouse using touch controls but the game is extremely laggy and just unplayable even though the cpu and gpu usage are kind of fine now coming to the conclusion what do i think of the overall android app experience on windows 11 can it replace emulators like bluestacks we're answering the bluestack question first see bluestacks has been here for quite some time and it's still more refined better in terms of gaming and performance i mean bluestacks you can play games like asphalt without any lag as you can see the performance is really good and there's so many features that bluestack brings like game controls key mapping easy apk installation and there's so many options to choose from plus bluestacks is just more refined and optimized when it comes to performance i mean to give you an idea bluestacks takes up around 100 mb of ram with the play store running on the other hand the play store or wsa ak windows subsystem for android takes around 2 gigs of ram as you can see so that's a big difference when it comes to performance and optimization now i'll be honest it's not fair to judge the android experience on windows 11 just yet i mean this is a very early preview but one thing is clear android app support natively on windows 11 just makes windows more powerful i mean if microsoft can fix all the bugs the inconsistencies the unoptimized ram and cpu usage then this could be very very useful so if you ask me most of the apps i've tried are either through the play store which is not officially supported yet or via side loading so i'd say this is a good start to what could be a native android apps experience on windows left it'll probably take some time before microsoft brings a stable version of this but with the developer and user interest i'm seeing i'm hoping we'll see android apps running flawlessly on windows 11. well here's okay anyway what do you guys think of android app support on windows 11 comment down below your thoughts also all for guides
