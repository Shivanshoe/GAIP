[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and i know you've been waiting for the poco x3 video and well it's finally here this is the poco x3 indian variant and yes it does bring some upgrades as well as downgrades when compared to the very popular poco x2 and well i'm gonna tell you all about it so let's begin first let's find out what's in the box of the pogo x3 so in the box you get the usbc cable the 33 watt fast charger the transparent silicon case the sim ejector tool and that's pretty much it now this is the new poco x3 and this is the first poco phone after the legendary f1 to have its kind of own unique design yep it's not a rebranded redmi phone but i think overall the design is fine i mean you probably know that this is a plastic bag and i don't know why there's this new trend of plastic in the sub 20k price range the realme 7 pro has a plastic bag samsung phones have a plastic bag and now the poco x3 has a plastic bag i mean it looks fine in the shots it does look like glass but in person the poco x2 is still the more premium phone with the glass finish see if poco was going with the plastic bag on the poco x3 they could have gone with a matte finish because the glossy back here is a big fingerprint magnet as for the new style camera setup and the big bold poco logo i kind of like how it looks with the light falling in it but i think this is very subjective and not everyone will like this big logo when it comes to the in-hand feel it's even thicker and heftier than the poco x2 at 10.1 millimeters thickness and 225 grams of weight so that's something you should know the functionality is pretty solid though this whole design is ip53 rated so the phone should be fine with some splashes of water as for the ports and buttons it's kind of usual but there are a couple of key things to note there's an ir blaster on the top which is nice the dual sim plus micro sd slot is a hybrid one so that's something to note there's a tiny notification led on the top speaker grille and there's one upgrade in the design front that i really like a lot i'm talking about the fact that the poco x3 has 3d speakers and i like this new trend of steel speakers in the sub 20k segment the realme 7 pro has it and now the poco actually brings it and the speakers here seem pretty good so far they are pretty loud and i like the depth here just listen to this [Applause] so the speakers here are pretty good so far but i'll be comparing it to the real me centro in a full review so stay tuned for that moving on to the display which remains the same and that's not a bad thing it's a 6.67 inch ips lcd display with 120 hertz refresh rate and 240 hertz touch sampling hdr10 support and gorilla glass 5 on top so this seems to be another great high refresh rate display from poco and i like it so far the scrolling and the mio 12 animations on the 120 hertz panel look great and the display is pretty good too it's fairly bright especially in the auto mode and the contrast the colors look fairly good plus the phone has the white wine l1 license which a lot of red before still have problems with so that's a good thing i checked and full hd playback is supported on netflix so yeah that's good news so all that is good but i have read about some touch ghosting issues in the international variant of the poco x3 so that's something i'll be testing out now one upgrade that people have been confused about is the snapdragon 732g chipset well the poco x2 is obviously the first one to pack in the new 730 2g chipset so how is this an upgrade over the 730g what's new well not much let me show you so the snapdragon 732g and snapdragon 730 g have the same cryo 470 cpu and the same adreno 618 gpu but the 732g has a slightly higher clock speed on both the cpu and gpu not a big difference but yeah that's it both the chipsets also have the same spectra 350 isp the same x15 lte modem with wi-fi 6 support and the only difference here is the support for bluetooth 5.1 in the 732g now that's pretty much it those are the only differences so honestly the 732g isn't exactly a big or any meaningful upgrade over the 730g yes the slightly higher clock speeds result in slightly better benchmark scores as you can see but yeah the real world performance shouldn't be a big difference so like the 730g the 732g should be able to handle high-end games and usual day-to-day tasks now i have put in my sim card in the poco x3 so i'm testing things out but so far things seem positive when it comes to software there's miui 12 on board so you get all the cool new features and since this is me ufo poco i haven't seen any ads and there's the boco launcher so that's great however the very cool super wallpapers from miui 12 are not installed here so that's kind of a bummer as for any bloatware there are a few of them there are these apps amazon facebook wps office netflix etc but you can install each one of them there are also these weird games which can be uninstalled too so yeah you can uninstall them that's good news as for any privacy issues the phone does have the infamous cleaner app but it now only takes up the storage permission so i'm glad xiaomi has fixed this having said that there's the security app which takes up almost every single permission and there's no way you can deny the app just permissions as you can see so again this is weird and i don't think a security app needs all these permissions like the microphone or the location next up are the cameras where there are a few changes over the poco x2 you still get the 64 megapixel primary camera but it's now the imx 682 over the imx 686 on the x2 there's a 13 megapixel ultra wide angle lens which on paper seems like an upgrade over the x2 8 megapixel sensor apart from that there are the customary 2 megapixel lenses that honestly nobody cares about now the poco x2 had very good cameras for the price range and the photos from the x3 look good too i mean the imx682 isn't exactly a downgrade over the 686 the only difference i know of is support for 4k 60fps in the 686 but that's kind of irrelevant here anyway so the shots look good when there's good light and low light two things seem decent so far although i did notice a slightly warmer tone in some photos so yeah that's something i'll have to check as for the ultra wide angle lens the photos from it does seem fairly detailed and there's very good dynamic range so it definitely seems good for a phone in this price range on the front you get a 20 megapixel selfie camera and yeah there's no secondary depth sensor but i think that sensor was kind of useless anyway so that's okay overall if you ask me about the cameras i think it's way too early to judge because i haven't even compared it to say the realme 7 pro but yeah if you want to know right now i'd say expect similar performance to the poco x2 but yeah still too early to judge lastly there's the battery which i think is the biggest upgrade it's a massive 6000 mah battery that should last very very long and this is good because i know a lot of people who have bought the poco x2 and the big complaint has been the battery especially at 120 hertz so this this big battery should fix that the charger is faster too this is the 33 watt charger you get in the box and i haven't really tested it so far but it should be pretty fast so coming to the pricing now the poco x3 starts at rupees 16 triple nine in india and that's actually lesser than the current starting price of the poco x2 and i think that makes sense because the poco x3 let's face it is not a huge big upgrade over the poco x2 i mean the stereo speakers are nice and the big battery and faster charging are great additions but the rest of the phone isn't a whole lot different from the poco x2 there's the same 128 hours display the 732g is basically a slightly overclocked 730g the cameras don't seem very different in fact there's a downgrade too in the form of the plastic build now so yeah the poco x3 is not a perfect phone or a perfect upgrade too so if you're wondering if you should buy this or not well i'll suggest you to wait because i'll be using this phone in the next few days comparing it to other phones and then come to verdict so yes stay tuned but that was our first look at the new poco x3 and if you have any questions around the
