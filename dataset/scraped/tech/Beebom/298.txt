[Music] [Applause] [Music] so the galaxy m31 arrived in India recently and there are certain questions are on the phone how is the gaming performance how did the cameras compare against the redmi note 8 Pro and the poco x2 should you buy this well this is a galaxy m31 review so let's answer these questions so I've been using the galaxy m31 for a few days now and while my experience has been generally positive there have also been a few hiccups along the way starting off with the design here's the m31 isn't exactly the most eye-catching stunning looking phone but I'd say it looks decent especially this black variant that I've been using yes glass or metal would have made the phone more appealing but the plastic design means this can take a hit now one thing I really like about this design is the form factor now we all know that it's a 6000 mAh battery in there and considering that this is a fairly lightweight compact and failing comfortable phone to use also the four has a physical fingerprint scanner which is kind of getting rare now but since it's a physical fingerprint scanner it is fast and accurate another thing I liked about the design is this display right here this Super AMOLED display is I don't par with the competing displays in this price range if not better it's bright so I do not have any issues with it outdoors it's sharp and the colors look nice so watching shows and movies on this display was a good experience on the speaker front there is only this single speaker which gets decently loud and it's fairly clear so yeah it's very similar to other phones in this price range I do like the fact that it's placed on the right side so when you're gaming the sound does not get blocked now we all know that the Galaxy enter D was designed isn't exactly the highlight that cameras kind of are the cameras have been upgraded over the entire yes and I noticed that while taking photos with the m31 in day time the 64 megapixel camera made sure the details are really good and I like the overall exposure in shots most photos also have great dynamic range which is great in low-light things aren't as good but it is decent similar to other phones in the segment see low-light shots are decent too but sometimes you can notice a little bit of noise and the lack of details so yeah now I also compared the main cameras of the galaxy m31 versus the pork or x2 versus that I'd mean no retro so let's check it out now in daytime shorts I notice that the galaxy m31 compares really well against the poco x2 a noted pro for example in this comparison the empty one just highlighted the shadows better and it's just a better photo with the other two just pumping up the contrast a bit too much plus if we zoom in on this brick II wall you can notice it has better details than the noted pro now in this comparison it's a close call but again the shadows look better on the entirety one shot and the color too is more natural now this is not always the case sometimes the poco x2 and node it will do better when it comes to details or more punchy colors like in this comparison or in this comparison here but yeah the m31 does manage to play well in low-light things are a little different I mean the galaxy m31 has its issues and so do poco x2 and the North bro but yeah the poco x2 is just better in low light for example in this comparison the pork works to photos it's just a little brighter now here's another comparison and it's clear that the noted Pro and poco x2 are better in low light no doubts about that anyway moving on the portrait mode on the m31 is pretty good here are a few live focus mode shots and I really like the accurate edge detection on point bouquet and fairly decent details on the face this is one area where I think the galaxy m31 was really consistent I also tested the ultra wide-angle lens which does a really good job at color preservation the dynamic range I mean look at the shot now the details aren't very good but if you're not gonna zoom in which you probably aren't you will like you there is a dedicated macro lens too so I took some macro shots and well I'd say they're hidden miss sometimes you get a decent shot sometimes you get a well not so decent shot when it comes to videos the m31 has support 4k at 30fps videos and you can see in this video taken from the m31 that the quality is pretty good but the stability is it thankfully the phone does come with the super steady mode here's a video shot with super steady mode turned on and you can instantly notice how stable it is yeah the quality is slightly degraded but yeah the stability is very good going on the galaxy m31 also packs in this high resolution selfie camera which does a decent job I mean some of the selfies are really detailed and nice like this one but some photos to come are slightly fuzzy but overall I do think it's an issue and the selfie cameras are pretty good over all the cameras on the galaxy m31 are likable in good light the camera performs really well and even compares well against the poco x2 and the redmi note it pro in low-light things aren't as good but yeah it's decent for a budget smartphone overall I'd rate this camera good Oh another thing I have been testing on the m21 is the performance now I know the Exynos 96 11 here is the same as the mts but the RAM is larger and when in my uses the phone has been handling day-to-day tasks with these AB loading is fairly quick and thanks to the largest Ram the multitasking experience is better - there haven't been any crazy lags or starters so yeah good experience all in all when it comes to gaming I'll be honest with you the galaxy m31 isn't exactly the best phone for that but yeah you can game on this phone the food handles casual games like say then is clash with no problems at all when it comes to high-end games I've played a lot of pubsey mobile on the phone and as you can see the graphics can go as high as HDR with frame rates at Ultra or graphics set to smooth and frame rate set to extreme now in these settings the gameplay is a little choppy although it is playable however it said - HD and high the performance is much better so I will recommend the setting I mean I had a game bench test at this setting and I got consistent frame rates where the gaming performance on the in 31 is better suited for medium Bravo also if you're wondering about any heating issues on the galaxy m31 well the food does get a little warm when you're playing games for ours and ours but I wouldn't call it overheating so it's not a problem anyway I also did a battery test while playing babji when I paid pub jet HDR ultra The Fool lost 15% battery in an art which is decent now because that's high graphics and well this is a 6000 mAh battery so the battery performance is pretty good see the phone always took me to the second big even on heavy usage I mean I got a screen on time around seven to eight hours every time which is really really good so yeah you don't have to worry about battery life at all with the m31 when it comes to charging the 15 watt fast charger in the box takes around to ask a fully charged this phone which is well the price would pay for the humongous battery overall the entire one is impressive on the battery front now going back to the experience on the galaxy m31 the m31 comes with 1 uy 2.0 of Android tear on board and it's one of the most sorted Android screens out there so I don't really have any problems with it however I did notice that the m21 does not come with the native screen recorder which is surprising since when you buy 2.0 has a native screen recorder built-in I just hope Samson brings it with an update anyway if you're wondering about any ads in the one UI on the galaxy m31 well I did not get any ads on the phone and that's probably because I skipped them during the starting setup process so you can do that as well I did get occasional notification of the my galaxy app but i disabled them too so yeah it's pretty much sorted also I did tell you about the fact that you can uninstall pre-installed apps that come with the phone so that is nice when it's time for the wording the galaxy m31 starts at rupees 14 triple nine and this is the phone that brings four major highlights the cameras which are really good the battery which lasts really long the AMOLED display which looks really nice and lastly the Samson branding now these are the things that matter to you that the galaxy m31 is for you you wouldn't be disappointed however if high-end gaming or processing power is a priority then the m31 is probably not for you and you should check out other options so that was a galaxy m31 review and yeah how do you like it tell us in the comment section below also give
