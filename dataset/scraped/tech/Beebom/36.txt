[Music] [Music] so mediatek recently launched its new dimension 8000 and dimension 8100 chipsets and before that they launched their flagship demon city 9000 chipset and you know what i've been really excited to check them out because three reasons number one last year's mediatek density chipsets be the 1200 the 1000 plus or even the dimensi 800 were really good chipsets these are number two except for a few snapdragon 8gen1 devices all of them have had throttling issues and that's where all the eyes are on the dimension 9000 reason number three is that mediatek has been kind of on a roll lately similar tech became the number one smartphone chipset vendor back in 2020 and it has maintained that position with 33 market share in queue for 2821 now this is an important reason because mediatek has always been this underdog but now they're the leaders so it'll be interesting to see how they maintain this top position anyway these reasons apart new devices with these new dimension chipsets are all set to launch soon so this is the perfect time to take a more detailed look at the new mediatek dimension chipsets so let's take it one by one first is the brand new dimension 8000 and the dimension 8100 chipsets now both of these chipsets are very similar but the 8100 is a bit more power packed so here are the important specs of the diminishing 8000 and the density 8100 both of these chipsets are built using the tsmc 5 nanometer process which is already a big positive because tsmc chipsets have a way better record when it comes to efficiency and thermals when compared to samsung made chipsets anyway the density 8000 has four cortex a78 course clocked at up to 2.75 gigahertz while the dimension 8100 has them clocked at a higher 2.85 gigahertz both these chipsets have four cortex a55 cores that can go up to two gigahertz apart from this both of these chipsets have the mali g610 mc6 gpu but the density 8100 has a 20 higher clocked faster gpu both these ships also support quad channel lpddr5 ram and ufs 3.1 storage now one more difference between these chipsets is that the dimension 8000 supports up to 168 hertz fhd plus displays while the 8100 supports up to 120hz wqhd plus displays overall it's clear from the specs that these are fairly capable chipsets now we don't have a device with these chipsets to show you the benchmarks but recently i came across this leaked android score of the dimension 8000 and this score is good i mean if you go by this score the 8000 is clearly taking on the snapdragon 870 and it's doing well especially the gpu the gps score is very good because the 870 is generally in the 2 lakh 50 000 region now we don't have the benchmark scores of the diminishing 8100 but it's said to be taking on the snapdragon triple eight so it's going to be interesting when we actually have a device with the defensivity 8100 chipset anyway apart from these specs and details the dimension 8100 and the 8000 have some really cool features first of all both of these chipsets have the mediatek hyper engine 5.0 tech which uses ai acceleration to app up the visuals while reducing the gpu load to make sure games look better but power efficiency is also good both of the chipsets also have the new mediatek magic 780 isp that brings features like super fast noise reduction with hdr ai motion and blur and hdr video recording from two cameras simultaneously there also display features like mediatek intelligent display sync 2.0 hdr 10 plus adaptive support 4k av1 decoding and support for dual link true wireless audio when it comes to connectivity the density 8000 and 8100 have the release 16 model which is the same one that the flagship divincity 9000 uses and this supports dual 5g with dual standby support along with the latest standards like wi-fi 6e bluetooth 5.3 there's also the ultra safe 2.0 take for better battery performance on 5g and 2cc carrier aggregation support overall the dimension 8000 and the 8100 are obviously powerful chipsets but the flagship has to be the dimension 9000 chipset just look at the specs the dimension 9000 is manufactured in the new tsmc 4 nanometer process unlike most snapdragon 801 chipsets which are manufactured by samsung and it's got the powerful cortex x2 core clocked at 3.05 gigahertz the latest cortex a710 cores add up to 2.85 gigahertz and the cortex a510 cores at up to 1.8 gigahertz all cpu cores can together use 8 mb of level 3 cache and 6mb of system level cache the gpu is the mali g710 mc10 gpu with 10 suggesting the 10 cores although 16 cores are supported the 9000 also has support for lpdd of 5x ram which can offer speeds of up to 7 500 mbps so this is a proper flagship chipset no doubts about that and we've already seen the demon city 9000 in a number of phones in china in fact we have a device with the dementia 9000 chipset coming to office very soon so we will be doing a dedicated demand city 9000 in action video so stay tuned for that and subscribe and hit the bell icon if you haven't already and if you don't want to miss that video anyway we have seen the dim city 9000 benchmarks and from the looks of it it seems to be on par with the hn1 having said that what will be interesting to see is how the dementia 9000 performs in terms of battery efficiency and throttling i mean it is based on tsmc's fab so it should be better but i'll wait until i have a device with the demonstry 9000. anyway the dimension 9000 is also packed with some really cool new features so there's the same hyper engine 5.0 for smoother gameplay and better frame rates there's mediatek magic 790 isp which supports 18 bit hdr recording from three cameras at the same time 320 megapixel camera support 2x lossless zoom and more the demonstry 9000 also has faster ai performance with the new 590 apu look overall it's clear that mediatek means business with these brand new chipsets last year they did not have a chipset for the flagship market and this year they have a strong competitor in the form of the density 9000 which i'm honestly excited to use in a device now what they did have last year is a great lineup of mid-range and high-end chipsets and this year they're building on that with the dimension 8100 and the 8000. these chipsets especially the 8100 is something we will be seeing in a lot of phones i mean a lot of phones have leaked with the ships so yeah it'll be interesting to see the real world performance of these chipsets anyway i want to know which new media tech chipset are you excited for comment down below also give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one super affordable gaming controller we got from amazon this is a racing controller i got from amazon and i know [Music] you
