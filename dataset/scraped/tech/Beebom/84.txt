[Music] hey guys this is bishopville.com and this is the asus pro r studio book 16 h 5600 qr aka the studio book 16 oled now this is a proper high-end feature pack laptop aimed at creators and i've been wanting to try this out ever since it was announced because three things first the 4k oled panel second this and third the specs which by the way are really really good now we have been testing out this laptop and i think the studio book 16 oled is worth all of the hype it's been getting now first of all i personally think the studio book 16 oled is one classy looking laptop with its matte black square edge design and the minimal pro art logo and here's the laptop from all the angles and i like how elegant and stealthy this looks in fact this is military grade certified for durability and here's the bottom of the laptop which has these rubber linings the studio book text and the vents now the ports are important to creators and the studio book has two usbc 3.2 gen 2 ports with one of them supporting power delivery as well as display port two usb a 3.2 gen 2 ports and hdmi 2.1 for high-end tvs and monitors a 3.5 mm jack an ethernet port a kensington lock slot and an sd card slot which is not your usual sd card slot it is the cutting edge sd express 7.0 slot which supports speeds up to 985 mb per second with compatible cards now i know most cameras still don't come with hd express cards yet but yeah this is good future proofing anyway one thing to note the studio book 16 has this sort of cut in between which features led indicators and this also helps open up the lid with one hand easily now opening the lid brings me to the stunning 16 inch oled panel this is a sharp 4k oled 10 bit display with the 60hz refresh rate 16 aspect ratio a great contrast ratio we expect with oled's amazing color accuracy with 100 dc ip3 97 adobe rgb and certification from pantone and calman plus this is a vesa certified display with hdr true black 500 and yeah 550 nits of peak brightness so this display is actually packed and it's stunning in person it's very sharp very vibrant and i love the oled blacks on this big screen it's also pretty bright given that oleds are generally a little dim and i like the fact that you can always amp up the brightness even more with the display set to hdr mode now this is a glossy screen so it can get a little reflective but it's not as glossy as some of the other screens that i've used so i'd say it's pretty good i mean from a creator's point of view this is a screen that makes a lot of sense for color correction being in photos of footage i mean it is incredibly accurate now that apart though the screen is awesome for entertainment purposes as well i mean the new spider-man trailer looks awesome on the screen i can even see the other spider-man if you know what i mean now above the screen is a 720pi webcam with windows hello support and i like the webcam share that as part of design now moving below the screen you get the asus logo the power button with the fingerprint scanner in it the keyboard which is a backlit chiclet keyboard with numpad 1.5 millimeters of key travel two customizable keys and the best thing the textured arrow it's awesome and the keyboard is great but what's even better is just below the keyboard i'm talking about this the dial it's called the asus dial and this is another big highlight of the studio book 60. so here's how it works pressing or rotating the dial brings this on the screen as you can see i can use the dial to change the brightness volume scroll with it etc now i can't rotate the dial and press it to select a function say volume and then i can rotate the wheel to change it like this you can also go back and forward by clicking on the left and the right edges of the tile yeah it's cool and i love the feedback that you get with the dial especially with the textured edge so yeah that's how the dial works and i know it might seem a little gimmicky but it's actually not i think this can be pretty useful for creators right now it supports four adobe apps including photoshop lightroom after effects and premiere pro and there's so many things you can control with the dial in these apps for example in premiere pro you can zoom in and zoom out of the timeline with the dial like this you can also go back or forward 30 frames in the video now to give you another example in photoshop you can change the brush size the hardness flow etc you can even change the eraser size and you can also zoom in and zoom out of the layer now these are just examples but there's a lot you can do and once you get the hang of it it can actually be useful i mean here's the pro creator hub app and here's the asus dial section and here all the functions available for say lightroom yeah you can set it to whatever you use a lot plus i like that you can create custom functions and asus has confirmed that support for non-adobe apps will be coming in the future as asus partners with more companies and microsoft fixes the dial functionality in windows 11. so the dial is a good addition on the studio book and next to it is this big smooth and responsive trackpad with not your usual two keys there are three keys which does remind me of older pc mice now the left and right keys are usual and the center key is for panning rotating or it can be used as an orbit button in 3d workflows cad software you get the idea also this trackpad supports styluses so you can draw things annotate etc moving on to the hardware now the studio book 16 oled comes with some pretty good specs now the top variant we have has the 8 core 16 thread ryzen 9 5900 hx at 3.3 gigahertz with boost up to 4.6 gigahertz and a tdp of 45 watts on the gpu front it has the rtx 3070 laptop gpu with nvidia studio drivers then there's wi-fi 6 bluetooth 5.2 there's 32 gb 3200 megahertz ram and 1tb pcie gen 3 ssd now do note that both ram and storage are in two slots so they can be upgraded anyway the ryzen 9 plus 3070 combo is powerful and the laptop handles all of the creative workflows with a lot of ease now we mostly tested it for photo editing and 4k video editing and the performance was top notch in fact to give you a better idea we ran the budget bench benchmarks in the photoshop test the studio book 16 was absolutely brilliant scoring a total of 995 with the max temperature only hitting 36 degrees celsius now this is very good because thousand is the reference top score in the premier pro test which adds multiple sequences with 4k and 8k videos the overall score was 678 which is also pretty good i mean it does not beat full-fledged pcs with 3080s but this is good we also converted a 12-minute 6gb 4k 60fps video to 1080p 30fps using handbrake and the ryzen 9 did that in five minutes see the point is the studio book 16 only brings the performance that creators actually need and just to be clear you can game on it i mean we played far cry 6 and the performance was good so you can do that i mean gaming on 1080p and 2k was extremely smooth and we got 100 plus and 60 plus frames respectively also one thing to note is that we did not face any thermal issues or thermal throttling in this laptop in a lot of these benchmark tests the laptop cpu went to 80 degrees celsius but the fans in this laptop kept things under control the studio box 16 comes with asus ischool pro cooling system which has 102 aerofoil blade pants six heat pipes with seven intelligent sensors and it can go up to 140 watts 50 for the cpu and 90 for gpu now the cooling system is good here because i did not feel any overheating in the usual suspects like the keyboard or the palm rest you know now as for the fan noise it's not a problem even in the performance mode but it does get pretty loud when it's in the full speed mode so yeah the performance is good and as far as the software the laptop comes with the new windows 11 pro on board and it has a few apps pre-installed like mcafee myasus and the pro art creator hub which is actually useful it brings this nice dashboard that lets you point to performance set the fan profile color category the display create task groups etc on the battery front the studio box 16 only packs a 90 watt 4 cell battery with a big 240 watt ac adapter in the box now with the use case this laptop has it should be probably hooked to power all the time but if you do want to use this on battery you'll get around six to seven hours of battery life which is decent now i think i've covered pretty much everything there is in the asus pro r studio book 16 oled and i think you will agree when i say that this is probably one of the best laptops for creators in the windows ecosystem i will bring so many cool features for creators see the 4k on the display is absolutely stunning incredibly color accurate the asus dial is a fantastic addition for creators and this is a laptop that brings a performance you expect from a high-end premium laptop now everything else about this laptop is top-notch 2b the very cool trackpad with three buttons the keyboard the thermal performance or the design now coming to the price the asus pro art studio book 16 oled starts at rupees one lakh sixty nine thousand nine ninety and the model we have is priced at rupees two lakhs nineteen thousand nine ninety now obviously it's a premium price tag for a premium laptop aimed at creators but i want to know what you guys think of this laptop do you think it makes sense for creators let us know in the comment section below also give this video a like make sure
