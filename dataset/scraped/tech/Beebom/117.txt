[Music] so [Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from viewing.com and last year we made a video on the first me notebook that xiaomi launched in india the me notebook horizon edition and while it was fine it lacked a lot of features there was no usbc charging no fingerprint scanner no backlit keyboard no webcam now xiaomi has launched its new me notebooks in india and this right here is the me notebook ultra and i know a lot of you guys are hyped up to know what's new with these laptops how does it compare to the real me book does it bring all the features that the me notebook or ryzen edition lagged well i'm going to answer all of those questions so let's get started okay so the first thing to notice with the me notebook ultra is the xiaomi logo on the lid there has been news that xiaomi is doing away with the me branding and you can see it here honestly i like that xiaomi is at least put a logo here because the me notebook horizon edition had no logo and it just looked kind of too bland without any text or logo on the lid anyway that's just me now you probably know the inspiration behind the me notebook ultra's design right i mean it's clearly going for the macbook look and vibe with the series 6 aluminium alloy polished unibody design i mean here's the laptop next to the macbook pro to give you a better idea now there's obviously no comparison with the macbook pro because the me notebook is almost half the price but i'd say this the me notebook ultra is a laptop that looks and feels premium it's also pretty solidly built i did not notice any weird flex whatsoever the hinge is also pretty robust so no issues on the build quality as for the portability it's very sleek at just 17 millimeters thickness but the ultra is a 15 inch laptop and that means it's kind of big i mean it does not weigh a lot it's around 1.7 kgs which is fine but the footprint of the laptop is larger see i'm someone who is used to more 13-inch 14-inch laptops so i would have preferred the me notebook pro because that looks the same has similar specs but it's smaller with the smaller 14-inch display and is also lighter anyway probably the biggest highlight of the me notebook ultra is this display we are talking about a 15.6 inch ips display with a qhd plus resolution which is very rare in this price range it has 16 to 10 aspect ratio something that people like there's also 100 srgb coverage dc dimming support blue light protection filters built into the hardware and 90 hertz refresh rate now these specs are pretty good well this is the reason why i was so interested in this laptop but specs apart how is the display in the real world well i've been testing out this laptop for a couple of days and so far the display looks absolutely beautiful it's probably one of the best displays in this price segment first of all it looks color accurate and it's very sharp thanks to the high resolution the contrast ratio is good too at 1500 is to one and it's also bright enough now the max brightness of the display is 300 nits and the display does not have a glossy finish it's actually matte anti-glare which means outdoor visibility is pretty good now another big feature in the display is the 90 hertz refresh rate so you can switch between the 60 hertz and 90 hertz refresh rate by using the function plus s combo but i've been using the laptop with the screen set to 90 hertz because everything looks a tad bit smoother my use case is mostly chrome and web pages and there's a lot of scrolling so i like this refreshing plus the 90 hertz refresh it also means that the screen is a little more responsive which is also a little handy in some casual case now the display is pretty good but that's not the only upgrade from last year below the display the keyboard is better it's finally a backlit keyboard with two levels of white light plus the typing experience is quite nice the keys here are clicky they have enough key travel at 1.5 millimeter and the layout has full size arrow keys which is a big way there's also a macro key that you can just use for anything you want just press the key and you get this window where you can set things up the touch pad is better too it's a big windows precision touch pad so all the gestures work well and it's nice to use but i don't like the clicky sound it has down at the bottom it just sounds a little cheap don't you think there's also a fingerprint scanner knob which was missing last time it's built into the power button i mean here's the fingerprint scanner in action and yeah it works fairly well the webcam is here to another feature that was missing with the last year's me notebook it's your usual 720p webcam nothing too special but hey at least it's there when it comes to pause there's a usb a port along with the headphone mic combo on the right on the left you get a usbc port that supports pd charging an hdmi port a usb a port and a thunderbolt 4 usb c port that also supports charging now one thing i personally miss is an sd card slot but yeah that's fine i guess as for the speakers there are two two watt speakers here that are bottom firing and just listen to this [Music] now speakers here aren't anything extraordinary but they are decently loud which a lot of laptop speakers aren't so it's fine now moving on from the design the specs of the laptop are pretty interesting too now the me notebook ultra comes in both the core i5 as well as a core i7 variant the variant we have has the 11 gen core i7 tiger league chipset with four cores eight threads a max clock speed of 4.8 ghz with turbo boost tdp of 25 watts and it's based on the 10 nanometer process as for the gpu it has the integrated iris xc gpu when it comes to storage and ram our variant has 16 gb 32 megahertz ddr4 ram and 512 gb nvme storage also if you're wondering the ram is soldered here so can't be upgraded but the storage can be upgraded anyway if you look at the specs of the me notebook ultra it's pretty clear that the laptop has good computing power especially for the price it's looked at i mean the 11370 chipset is powerful and even though i haven't run any benchmarks the processor is good enough for my workflow which is a lot of browsing a lot of tabs a little bit of photo editing you get the idea the laptop is also pretty quick to start up from shutdown taking about six seven seconds the app launching is pretty quick and it can play 4k videos without any issues now when it comes to casual games we all know that the ios xt is a capable internal gpu unlike older gen intel gpus and it does handle casual games pretty well i played cs go at 1080p resolution high graphics settings and the screen set to 90 hertz and i was getting pretty good frame rates at around 60 70. now let me make this clear that the me notebook ultra is not a gaming laptop it's actually a proper notebook but yeah you can do some very casual gaming on it as for the thermals the laptop has a six millimeter heat pipe at the bottom with a large fan which isn't very noisy now i haven't really used this laptop enough to make a judgment on the thermals and i have slide down especially because the grilles look kind of small but so far i haven't noticed any overheating issues or anything weird also one thing to note you can switch between the quiet and balanced fan modes by pressing function plus k apart from that the laptop comes with windows 10 home and office pre-installed and there's no bloatware or anything which is really good now there is one xiaomi feature which is actually useful there's me share support so you can send and receive files from compatible smartphones i tried it and it works fairly well on the battery front the me notebook ultra has a 70 watt battery with a 65 watt usbc charger in the box now the battery here is rated to last 12 hours but i think 6 to 8 hours is a more practical number as for the charger it's a fast charger and it takes the laptop from 0 to 50 in around 45 minutes coming to the pricing now the me notebook ultra starts at rupees 60k for the core i5 8gb variant the core i5 16gb variant cost 64k and this the core i7 16gb variant costs 77k so the big question is is the me notebook ultra good value for money see in my brief usage it does seem like a good value for money laptop see the qhd 90hz display is just fantastic the specs of the laptop are pretty good the battery is fairly big and i like that it brings things like the webcam fingerprint scanner backlit keyboard usbc charging the things that were missing in last year's b notebook and all of that in a macbook inspired but premium design however do note that there's also the real me book slim which has a brighter screen at 400 nits faster ram and its core i5 8gb variant also costs 60k plus i want to check which of these laptops have better thermal performance so yeah overall the me notebook ultra looks value for money but i will be comparing it to the real me book slim to find out the best value for money laptop at 60k so stay tuned for that anyway drop down your thoughts in the comment section below on the menu book ultra as
