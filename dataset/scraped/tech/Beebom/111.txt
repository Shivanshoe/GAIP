[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is patimbio.com and i know a lot of you guys are always interested in proper work laptops laptops students and this the msi mod 15 a5m is exactly that an everyday laptop i'm personally interested in the whole modern series because it has options for both 14-inch 15-inch laptops options with both amd and intel variants and this the msi mon 15 a5m priced at 55k should give us a pretty good idea of the whole modern series so yeah let's check it out so this is the msi modern 15 and it comes in both intel and amd variants and let me tell you straight away that the one we have the msi 115 a5m is powered by ryze anyway i will talk about the specs but first i like how it looks i mean it's minimal it's sleek there's no unnecessary design elements and the whole aluminum finish looks elegant it's just a very understated looking laptop this is also pretty rugged design because it is mi lstd810g certified which means it should do well against drops and bumps apart from that the laptop is also very portable it's it weighs 1.6 kgs and in my usage so far i have had no problems carrying it around moving around so yeah portable i also like the hinge here i can open the lid with one hand and there's no weird flex in the hinge however one thing to note is that this whole metallic finish is a fingerprint magnet but other than that like i said i like how it looks now all that is cool but when you're considering a laptop for students or professionals i think the display and the processor are the most important aspects so let's talk about that so the msm 115 has a 15.6 in display and you can see all the specs right here fsd resolution ips panel matte anti-glare coating thin bezels anyway talking about the display first of all you can tilt the display like this 180 degrees and yeah that can be handy as for the display quality it's a pretty good band see the colors of the display are pretty accurate the contrast ratio is pretty good viewing angles are wide even though it's an ips panel and the blacks are something i noticed to be good to while watching movies and shows as for the brightness it's not the brightest panel but it's fairly usable outdoors also with the matte coating it's not very reflective which is nice for auto usage see overall i like this display i like that the bezels are fairly narrow and msi has managed to put in a 720p webcam on the top which like most webcams and notebooks brings oakish video quality especially when there's not enough light and as for the mic it's pretty average isn't this hey guys this is a video from the 720p webcam of the msi modern 15 a5b and let us know what you think of the audio quality as well as the video quality in the comments down below coming to the second big factor the performance the msi 115 a5m has some pretty good specs there's the ryzen 5 5500u processor which is a seven nanometer chipset with six cores and 12 threads up to four gigahertz clock speed and the amd radeon gpu onboard apart from that there's 8gb ddr432mhz ram which by the way is not soldered and there's an additional sort as well so you can expand it to 64gb and when it comes to the storage there's a 512gb pci ssd and like ram there's an additional m2 slot for more storage i mean graduates do the expandable ram and storage options are good because most of the notebooks i've tried offline don't allow this so this is good from msi anyway coming to the real world performance we all know how good the ryzen 5 is when it comes to the overall performance as well as the battery efficiency and you know what i've been using the modern 15 as my work laptop and this is a laptop that's been pretty solid and consistent all around see my workflow includes a ton of tabs slack open in the background and a little bit of photo editing and of course my work playlist was spotify and the modern 15 handles all of that easily i mean it's not heavy workload but this is the workflow of a lot of professionals and as for students i think the laptop should handle more student workflows and tasks pretty well moving on the thermal performance of laptop matters a lot and the msi 115 comes with msi's cooler booster tech and you can see the exhaust vents with two dedicated fans and three heat pipes now admire is the laptop has been very cool when it's idle or when i'm casually using it now when i'm using an intensive app there is some heat in this area below the screen and in as well as the bottom vents but apart from that i never felt any heat on the keyboard or the palm rest which is good now as for the fans they are usually quiet and they do pick up when things get a little intense and if you're wondering about the fan noise it's there but it's not something that will annoy see overall i'm positive of the performance of the msi 115 and talk about the software there's windows 10 home on board and as for pre-installed apps there's not in security and there's also a few msi apps like the msi center pro app that lets you adjust system performance charging profiles etc to talk about the basics of the msi 150 this is the keyboard that you get it's triggered keyboard with the white led backlight 1.5 millimeter travel and i like that there's a full-sized inverted tro key layout and i also like the overall layout because the keys are well spaced but one problem i felt is the feedback is a little flat see the keys here are not as curved as i'd like and it's not a big deal if you ask me but yeah it could have been better then there's this trackpad which is on the smaller side but it's responsive works well and it's a windows precision touchpad welcome supports on the right you get two usb a ports and a micro sd slot on the left you get the proprietary charging port hdmi port which supports 4k at 60hz external displays there's also a usbc port another usb a port and a headphone mic combo chat so the port selection is good but i would have liked a usbc charger in the box as for the battery there's a 52 watt battery that's rated to last 10 hours but practically you're looking at six seven hours of battery life the 65 or charger should be pretty fast though lastly the speakers well there are dual speakers one on each side as you can see and these speakers are decent in quality they're not very loud and there's no bass listen to this and that's the maxwell so to conclude things the msi modern 15 was launched in india at risk 67 990 but off late it's been available for rupees 50 for 990 which i think is a very good price for this laptop plus msi will be offering festive discounts up to 35 very soon so yeah you'll be able to get it at even better price see overall the msi modern 15 a5m is a laptop that i like i mean i've only used it for a couple of days so i cannot give a final verdict but from my brief usage this looks like a solid notebook with a nice minimal design the display looks pretty good the performance seems good so far and it gets all the other laptop features right anyway i want to know what you guys think of the msi modern 15 so make sure to comment down below also give this video like make sure to share it and
