[Music] hey guys this patient be wound calm and as you guys probably know I have been an Android user all along and what I love the features that Android beings the customization options it offers is a lot of fun yes on Android you can customize every single thing and today I'm going to talk about some really cool Android customization hacks tips and tricks that you guys are going to love and yeah these do not require root access so that is awesome also do note that I won't be talking about klw p or KW GT because you probably know about them already now let's get started so one of the things we used on our Android phones a lot is the volume panel so how about giving the volume panel a makeover well recently I've come across two new apps ultra volume and volume styles and both of these apps let you theme the volume panel completely I like warning Styles more because it brings a lot more themes and the UI is more cleaner there's the iOS theme 1 UI team a cool wave theme Mui color OS oxygen OS Windows 10 and not theme and more I mean personally I like the North team the most because just look at this it's so fun and looks so cool I also like the iOS style volume panel and it's not just the team's you can customize the slider completely we decide the position and more you can even add more functionality like adding a brightness toggle here now all of these options are free but there are a few themes and options logged in the premium version so you should check it out status bar isn't something we give a lot of thought to when using around red phones I mean yeah it's there but let me tell you that on Android you can totally revamp it I've been using super status bar for this and this is an app that lets you do a number of cool things first up my favorite feature is Tigger text this shows that notifications in the state as bar itself like the Corolla and AD versions as you can see here the app even let's have disable heads-up notifications via ADB so no annoyances there there are even gestures you can use in the status bar for example you can slide left and right to change the brightness and as you can see the app you can even add more gestures through the status bar this is probably handy for or backbones but yeah there are other customizations to make a battery bar different stages about themes including an i/o scheme although this and some of the options are loud in the premium version of the app either ways you should try this to customize the status bar on your around the smartphone so wallpapers are one thing that really changed the look of your phone and I know there are a lot of great wallpaper apps out there but you know what we need caught my eye me you are twelve super wallpapers yep they look really cool and thanks to XD you can install them on any smartphone you can just download the wallpapers from the link in the description and when downloaded you will see the different folders just extract them using a file manager and once done you will see the apk is to the different wallpapers just install them one by one and now just open up Google's wallpapers app yeah make sure you have an installer here if you go to the live wallpaper section you will see the cool masks and earth wallpapers for me you are twelve just apply them and that's it now check out the mask wallpaper in action yep that is cool now check out the artwork we put in action yep the animation isn't the same of the lockscreen but these wallpapers look beautiful quick setting Stoppers are super handy B to turn on Wi-Fi Bluetooth auto rotate you get the idea but you don't get a lot of options here so how about customizing it to get more options this is where tile shortcuts comes into play because you can create a quick setting shortcut for just about anything you just hit the plus button select the tile type now you can create a shortcut for an app a shortcut a website a shortcut folder or even an activity these are really handy options so say I wanted to add a shortcut up ATMs make payment paid so that I don't have to open up the app and then tap pay so yeah I can select activity here and add to ATMs payment activity this one but now I can just choose the icon for the quick settings toggle as you can see there are pay teams icons here as well and they're even options to add custom icons or an item from an icon pack now I can just hit done and that's it the tile is created now if we just it is the quick settings page and add this tile one shortcut and it's done the premium shortcut is here I can just tap it and it takes me to the pay page in Paytm how awesome is that [Music] always on display and edge lighting has become a popular feature and there are a number of apps that bring this feature but a lot of them are super confusing I've tried them out and I think the best app for this one always on amylin when you open up the app for the first time you just give it the permissions it wants and that's it now you can enable the always-on display with a simple tap and customized things like say the different teen stayed in time with the animation the apps you want to see and more here's the always-on display in action and yeah it looks sleek right there also edge lighting options and you can customize the style the mode adjusted based on the curves in your phone or if your phone has an arch it's very detailed and works perfectly that's honestly the best thing about it the second best thing it's free and while some features are paid you can watch an ad to unlock them and try them out see I'm not a big fan of 1ui in general but if there's one thing I like about it it's the notification shape I mean I like the fact that it's one-handed UI approach makes the quick settings so accessible well one shade is an app that brings a one hue I like notification shade that's also totally customizable once you've given the app the required permissions you will enable a notification shade that looks like this with the one UI like quick settings panel now in the app there are a number of cool options you can change the quick settings open shapes like this I'd brightness lied in the first swipe page itself change the colors in the app make things transparent for a more cooler look and there are a lot of more options the Reaver options to change the carrier name add a profile picture yep there are a lot of options here that you're going to love so check it out [Music] see not all Android phones get the latest Android updates and if you're one of those people lose phones are stuck on another PI or older and you want to taste of the Android 10 gestures on your phone full screen gestures is the app you wanna try the app lets you are gestures from the left edge right edge and obviously the bottom now I don't think the bottom gesture plays well with the navigation buttons but the side gestures work really well as you can see and you can even customize it for example I've set the swipe on the left edge for the back gesture and as you can see you can set a swipe bar gesture for a different action or even open an app to use often same with the swipe on the writer gesture you can even customize the sensitivity the size and the feedback on these gestures yeah this is awesome and this is a free app with a few apps so go ahead check it out well those are some really cool
