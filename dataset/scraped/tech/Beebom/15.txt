everyone knows that android gets one big major update every year but what people don't know is that android gets a lot of smaller updates why it's core apps that bring a number of cool new features so get ready update your phones because i'm gonna tell you seven new android features that are actually useful so remember when the pixel 6 launched last year it brought real tone to the pixel camera app and the google photos app to make sure that more diverse skin tones are captured more accurately it's a great feature but did you know that the real tone feature is now available in a lot more phones so in google photos just edit a photo go to filters and here you can see these new real tone filters there's playa made with real tone honey i love desert and clay i can also tap on a filter to adjust its intensity now this does make a difference here are a few photos with and without real tone and the difference in skin tones is pretty good now this feature is coming to google photos on all phones i'm using it on the s22 ultra but it's still rolling out so check it on your phone and comment if you have it the next standard feature that i'm gonna show you is very very very super useful so google announced locked folders in google photos last year but it's only recently that it has arrived in almost every single android phone with this i can just go to a photo that i don't want other people using my phone to see swipe up and move the photo to the locked folder now once you've moved the photo to the lock folder it won't be backed up it won't appear in the photos grid and it won't be visible in search or even when you're accessing the gallery via apps like say whatsapp or instagram so it's actually hidden from everywhere to access this log folder you have to go to the library in the photos app scroll down below and there it is now you can just use a fingerprint or pin or pattern and access your personal locked photos you can also add more photos to the lock folder from here take photos out of the log folder if you are being courageous delete photos yeah do a lot more i also like that the lock folder automatically locks up in a minute if you just leave it open accidentally overall not folders is a super useful feature for all the bros out there i know what you're gonna use it for so be a good bro and hit that subscribe button do not forget the bell icon for the bros beyond make grammatical errors it's fine but let's agree on one thing don't you hate it when people write your instead of you are you know who these people are the good news is android now has a native grammar checker tool this works in gboard so when you type something dramatically wrong like this gboard highlights it and you can just tap on it and fix it that's all reputation restored this should be useful to a lot of people especially when writing an email or something official now this feature has rolled out to everyone but if it's not working for you go to the gboard settings go to text correction and at the end enable these two options see nobody likes a grammar nazi but this is one feature that you need to share with your your typing friends they will hate you they obviously already do but at least they'll learn a new feature share this video moving on i'm personally not a big fan of stickers but this is something i like so i can just message akshay i can write hey idiot and as you can see i'm getting these custom stickers with the same text so i think this will get my point across really good so this is once again a gboard feature and this is very easy to use because i can just type anything add an emoji suggestion and gboard automatically creates multiple custom stickers this means i don't need to go to the stickers page and yeah that's the biggest convenience also i'm very lazy i also like the emoji kitchen features which has the new emoji combos for summer pride month it's cool solo card is a very useful accessibility feature android and it has this explore tab which lets you use the camera to detect the objects in the surrounding and let you know clothing couch table two people idiot couch table tripod television table and it's gotten better it's got a new image tab that is very interesting let me show you this mode basically lets you take any image from your gallery and this will describe it for you let me show you caption a view of the city at night details tree road light fixture modified at may 2nd 2022. yeah it's not absolutely perfect at the moment but it's a good new addition to android's accessibility features maybe the portrait mode on your phone sucks maybe you just forgot to take the photo in portrait mode either ways google photos now lets you add a portrait blur manually after you've taken the photo and it's actually pretty good at it just take any photo in google photos tap on edit and you'll either get this portrait suggestion which adds the blur automatically or you can go to tools and add the blur manually like this now it's generally very good but if you feel it's not very accurate around the edges you can use the depth option and set the blur perfectly now one thing to note here is that this feature is available for pixel users and also on other phones but with the google one subscription we just got a new live with android 12 and i'm not sure if third party apps are taking things seriously but google is making some good widgets so there's a cool youtube music widget the new battery widget but the coolest new android widget has to be the digital well-being widget i know digital well-being who cares hear me out the data well being widget is actually useful it has three different sizes and it shows your total screen time along with the top three apps you have used on the day this is nice because at least i don't have to check my screen time by going to the settings this way i have it on the home screen and i can tap here and see all the details quickly before i conclude
