[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is Batian be rom-com and this week is kind of vintage be bomb week and I'm gonna start this week with some really cool new apps that you are going to love now these are some apps that I have one on the Play Store through Reddit and a lot of other sources but these are apps you're definitely going to love so let's get started and return gestures are okay but if there's one thing I don't like about them is the fact that you cannot customize them I mean it is Android you expect things to be customizable anyway since it is Android you can always download an app for that enter gesture plus an app that brings exactly that with gesture plus you can just tap on the navigation bar to go back I mean a lot of people dislike the back gesture Android 10 so this is well definitely easier I can also long press on the navigation bar to open a shortcut or you know open an app I prefer to use this to capture screenshots because it's just easier anyway there are a lot of other customization options as you can see and well gesture plus is available for free but a lot of its features are available in the pro version which cost 150 rupees so is check it out [Music] the next Abita maniac is an app that is for all of us basically tech maniacs who love testing beta version of apps to maybe get hands on new features early or maybe to just live life on the edge so being a maniac once you've signed in with the Google account you use on the Play Store you will see your list of apps and the apps would be the version you can test the green tech shows that you already have the beat of that app and the blue tick shows the beat of this app is available you can just tap on an app with blue tick and become a beta testers right here right away how awesome is that plus the app or a scans for new beta releases or abs that get a beta version so yeah this is really great for all of us beta maniacs [Music] we have seen offensive and explicit deep fakes in the past but DubLi cat is an app that uses deep fake to create some super fun chips yes how about me as what's your candy from Django Unchained or how about Akshay as Harry Potter well it's pretty simple you just take a photo or two which the app detects your face then you can just choose a Jif you want your face in and tap reface after which the app will take a few seconds and then use deep fake to insert your face in the chips this is fun right plus you can add multiple faces to use different faces in different chips here a few gifs recreated and when it's not perfect as you can see but when it works it's a lot of fun ee cat is a free app so you should definitely try it out and share your photos with us on Twitter okay next up we have this crazy cool new app this is type wise keyboard which brings a brand new keyboard layout with big keys that said to design specifically for smartphones now I know this looks like a lot of work and honestly as you can see I'm still going through the learning curve but it is interesting no doubts about that and the developers claim 80% less typo stands of the bigger keys and this hexagon layout now I'm not sure about that but I do like the gestures here I can flick up on a letter to capitalize swipe left to delete and swipe right oh and do the same these gestures are great but there's no English support which is a bummer and yeah like I said this takes a lot of time getting used to but if you want to try something new go ahead check this out and try a new way to type [Music] Google has been releasing a lot of cool digital well-being apps including some create what we perhaps for example I really like the unlock cloth or paper well google recently leaves a new word paper app called activity bubbles like unlock laws this is what paper that aims to show you how much is using a phone so that you can cut down your smartphone usage now I'm not sure if will help me with that but I do know one thing this looks cool I mean you start the day with a clean black wallpaper which looks great on AMOLED phones and as the day progresses your screen is filled with bubbles and these bubbles are based on the amount of time dad used the phone for and the number of times you've unlocked the phone it's really interesting and I'm really interested we all know that Microsoft makes some great apps for Android I mean remember the good old SMS organizer app well Microsoft math solver is a new app by Microsoft to help you solve some maths yeah let me show you so basically with Microsoft math solver there are two ways to solve a math problem you can either scan a question from your phone's camera or just shut down a problem on the display like you usually would both of these methods work fairly well and I like the fact that the app shows step by step solutions and multiple ways to solve a problem so you get a better idea to solve a problem I think it's incredible max of math solver can solve problems in various topics including arithmetic algebra trigonometry that's stupid calculus yeah I hated it the app supports a lot of different languages which is definitely great and this is a free app so all your students out there check this out and yeah [Music] so whenever we do this video of cool new apps there's always one app that has one of the most beautiful you guys we've ever seen and memory key is this app on this list this is a to do reminders calendar and task manager app rolled into one and it looks amazing it's clean has a create Fulton textile and has some sweet sweet transitions plus its feature packed when you open up the app you get this nice my day page where you can add all the tasks you have for the name setting - for them shared with people pin it to the top you get the idea however you can just swipe down from the top reveal or the different pages like a tasks page a feature-rich calendar page and a progress page as you can see there are a lot of other lists here and you can always add more so this is a great app that you should try it memory is available for free but some of these features are limited to the premium version which is available for 250 PS per month [Music] the develop ESP land sign isn't exactly a new app it was launched I think in mid 2019 but this is an average super useful especially for people who have a lot of PDF forms to fit so I was recently filling out the Spain visa form for MWC 2020 which by the way was cancelled into coronavirus yeah check out our super informative video on that area so I was trying to fill out this form and I was facing a lot of issues some PDF editors did not load up the form correctly some did not have the tick mark option some amazing signature support and this is where WPS fill in sign came in so handy this app is just great for filling in PDF forms the interface is intuitive you can add tags takes and there's also support for signature you can create a signature on your phone just add it simply it's clean and there's also auto fill profile which makes feeling these forms way quicker yeah this is super handy so the next tab on this list is app notify which has to be the simplest app in this whole video but it also solves a big problem for Android users so our reducers have been unhappy with Playstore no longer showing notifications for updated apps now we thought it's a bug but as it turns out it's an intended feature yeah why is that a feature anyway if you've been missing this on your phone app notifier fixes this relation it brings your notifications for updated app so all of us tech geeks hit checkout to change lock what's the update all about the new features and water uh neural app notify is a clean ad free and an open source app that deserves a mention when those are some really new
