[Applause] [Music] so [Music] let's talk about something serious today so yesterday i opened whatsapp and i got this prompt about this new whatsapp privacy policy so i obviously went ahead checked it out at all the details and i was like what but today i'm gonna give you multiple reasons to delete whatsapp so let's start so basically there are three questions regarding the new whatsapp privacy policy that i'm going to answer in a very very simple manner first up what personal data is collected by whatsapp second what data is shared with facebook a very important question third what data is shared with business accounts on whatsapp first up i want to show you this so this is the previous privacy policy from december 2019 and it starts like this respect your privacy is coded into our dna since we started whatsapp we have aspired to build our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind now that sounds promising right but this whole promising start is gone in the new privacy policy as you can see from january 2021 yeah that does not look very good so talking about the first question what data does whatsapp collect so basically whatsapp still can't read your chats because it's end to end encrypted but here's everything else it knows so whatsapp knows what phone you're using basically your phone model the network you're using your os your battery status signal strength your time zone your ip address along with all the other whatsapp details like your whatsapp usage which basically means how you're using the app when you're last online etc whatsapp also has access to your payment details your transactions thanks to whatsapp pay status updates group details like group names picture description your profile picture and your about info and the last time you updated your about info so that's all the data whatsapp has about you and your phone so coming to the important question what data is shared with facebook well almost everything so as part of the new privacy policy all of the data that can be accessed by whatsapp will be shared with facebook as well as other facebook companies like instagram that's not all what you share on whatsapp can also be used by facebook to bring you more personalized ads offers recommendations content on facebook and instagram for example when you share a link on whatsapp about maybe a new phone you want to buy or say a jacket you want to buy whatsapp and facebook take this info to use it for ads and other services so don't be surprised when you and your friends see the same ads about that phone or that jacket so basically facebook now has complete access to all of your whatsapp data and unlike in the past when you had an option to not share your data with facebook there's no such option now now coming to the last question what data is shared when you interact with the business account on whatsapp so when you're messaging a business account on whatsapp you have to keep in mind that your data might be available to several people in their business and if the business is working with other third party services your data might be shared with them too so honestly if you're messaging a business account on whatsapp your data isn't really as secure or personal apart from all of those details in the new whatsapp privacy policy i also noticed a couple of really interesting and important changes that you should know about first up when it comes to as the previous whatsapp policy said we still do not allow third-party banner ads on our services that's fine but the newer policy adds a sentence to it that says we have no intention to introduce them but if we ever do we will update this privacy policy which i personally think is a hint that someday we will see ads in whatsapp now i might be reading into the lines a bit too much but it is facebook so i think it's valid another thing i previously did not know is when you delete your whatsapp account using the delete option in the whatsapp app not all of your data is deleted now most of your data will be deleted but your data related to the groups you created or the data other users have of you like your messages sent to them will not be deleted anyway overall the point is we are now witnessing whatsapp the facebook company it's obvious that whatsapp is no longer a privacy focused messaging app i mean it's clear that all of your whatsapp data will be used by facebook from february 8th whether you like it or not look i think it's the right time to switch to a more secure messaging app i know whatsapp is deeply integrated in our lives but i think this is the right time to take a step now there are two ways to handle the situation one we can wait for the government to bring up more strong laws when it comes to privacy and personal user data or second we can become more self-reliant uninstall whatsapp and switch to another app see there are two great apps you can switch to from whatsapp there's telegram and there's signal now telegram is already very popular in india and it's open source so i think it's time we moved to telegram asked our contacts to messages there so we can actually move away from whatsapp well what do you guys think do you think us indians really care about our privacy as much to move from whatsapp to another app comment down below also give this video like and it's very important that you share this video with your friends and family on whatsapp so that they can know about this new privacy policy in whatsapp exchanges and then take a well informed decision so yeah share this video well that's me signing off thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one
