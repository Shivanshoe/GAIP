[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the page from young.com and the new galaxy s21 5g series is here and this right here is the top of the line galaxy s281 ultra 5g now there are a number of things that excite me about this phone but i want to focus on three major aspects the design these cameras and then there's the big one the performance yes we have the exynos variant of the galaxy s21 ultra so how does it compare to the snapdragon aaa does it fix all of the exynos issues well we will find out so let's start so this is the galaxy s21 ultra in all its phantom black glory and to be honest when i first saw the s21 in league renders i did not really like the new camera style but in person trust me it looks a lot better see the camera bump is still huge slightly smaller than the note 20 ultra camera bump but still very big and the camera module now merges into the frame of the phone now this is something that's very subjective and out of it some of us liked it some did not so to each their own i guess as for the new black footage there's a lot of hype around it but honestly i get it because look at this phone i think it looks really classy see personally i always found the s20 is great glass back a little done but this is the way to go it's the same matte glass haze finish from the note 20 ultra and it just feels amazing in the hand and it looks great and talking about the in hand feel this is a big phone quite expectedly 227 grams 8.9 millimeters in thickness so this is a hefty phone but that's not taking away the fact that this phone is a premium flashing i mean apart from the new back design the display looks even better 6.8 inch of dynamic amoled with the qhd plus resolution 120hz refresh rate which now works with qhd plus gorilla glass victis which by the way is present in the back too s pen support 1500 nits of max brightness and a contrast ratio of 3 million is to what these numbers are amazing and the display no surprise looks absolutely stunning like every other samsung flagship recently now coming to what you have been waiting for the new exynos chipset here are the specs of the s21 ultra the brand new five nanometer exynos 2100 chipset with the mali g78 gpu lp ddr5 ram lots of it and lots of ufs 3.1 storage so the specs are good but the important question is how does exynos 2100 do when compared to the snapdragon triple eight quite frankly this time around the exynos 28100 is very close to the snapdragon triple eight in terms of specs here's a comparison so they both are five nanometer chipsets made by samsung they both have the same cpu cores as well as arrangement cortex x1 prime core cortex a78 and cortex a55 the exynos 2100 should have an advantage here because it has the higher clock speed on every single cord but other than that it's very similar now the gpu is different it's arm mali g78 gpu on the exynos compared to the adreno 660 on the snapdragon and from whatever the arduino 660 is more powerful but we'll get a better idea with the benchmark scores apart from that these chipsets are very similar integrated 5g modem same max display support 200 megapixel camera support and etc so from that comparison it's pretty clear that the exynos 2100 chipset is very close it competes very well against the snapdragon triple eight in fact they're very similar too but i had a few benchmark tests on the s21 ultra and turns out the exynos 2100 kind of falls short against the snapdragon triple a so here's the geekbench score and as you can see it's not a massive difference but the snapdragon triple h scores higher which is a little surprising since the cpu clock speed on the 2100 is higher and before you say it yes i ran the benchmark several numerous times really also i know the geekbench versions are different in both the screenshots but the snapdragon score is from the qualcomm's reference device from a few months back while the s21 ultra has the latest geekbench 5 version anyway i also run antutu and this time they are on the exact same version 8.3.4 and even here the snapdragon triple eight is ahead beat on the cpu front or gpu as you can see and it's a pretty big margin too again just to let you know ran this benchmark multiple times to be first i think i'll wait to get hands on a snapdragon triple-a device and then again compare the benchmarks to be really sure how much of a difference there is given how the specs of both these chipsets are so similar and yeah then gave my verdict on the exynos versus snapdragon debate anyway when it comes to real world performance i've only had the phone for a day like i said so that's something i'm testing on the s21 ultra and see the biggest complaint from previous exynos chipsets have been lag and heating issues so i'm going to test things out with those points in mind so far i've played a few sessions of cod mobile on the s21 ultra and the performance has been flagship date so i'm hoping it remains consistent and cool now coming to the third big highlight the cameras now this thing is literally almost literally packed with cameras and some of the cameras here are really interesting so there's the new hm 308 megapixel sensor first time on a phone and it's set to bring improved focus very low light and hdr performance i'll test it out then there are two telephoto lenses one a periscope lens with 10x optical zoom support the other a usual telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and there's also a 12 megapixel ultra wide angle camera and a laser autofocus sensor so this camera setup in itself seems very impressive and from the photos i've taken the new hm3 sensor seems to take some really good shots but the truth is i've only used the phone for only a day and while i will be testing the camera performance in the coming days there are quite a few camera features and changes that i noticed and i want to talk about first up there's the new director's view where you get two modes a vlog of you where you can use the front camera and any of the rear cameras in a split view or a picture in picture mode i think we've seen this in other phones in the past but the other mode is very interesting it's called live thumbnails i mean you can see all the thumbnails on the right here right these show you the different camera views from the main lens the ultra wide angle lens and the telephoto lens so that when you're shooting a video you can switch between lenses smoothly and you know more conveniently for a cooler looking video plus you can combine the vloggers view with live thumbnails to have all the five cameras working at the same time how cool is that space zoom is better too i mean the biggest complaint with the 100x space zoom was the shakiness that came with it and the new s21 ultra has a new zoom lock feature that kind of fixes things here's how it works see when you move past 20 x zoom the camera uses ois as well as the new ai stabilization to help you lock at a certain building or whatever it is you're zooming at so when you zoom at even hundred x the viewfinder remains locked on that subject and yeah it's not a crazy impossible to take a picture experience it's good moving on portrait mode is now called portrait mode not live focus mode so finally there are also different portrait mode effects studio backdrop color point mono and a few more single take is better to it now let's choose from the types of shots you want to capture in a single tape here are all the different shot types and i think the processing has gotten a bit better too the pro video mode now lets you record audio from both the s21 ultra's mic as well as a bluetooth earbud you might have so that you can capture better voice recording while also capturing better ambient noise 4k 60 fps now works on all cameras be the ultrawide telephoto or even the selfie camera super steady mode now works with 1080p 60fps so yeah there are camera improvements all around now to wrap things up on the software front the s21 ultra comes with one ui 3.1 on top of android 11 and if you're wondering about battery performance the s21 ultra has the same fairly big 5000 image battery from the s20 ultra but there's no fast charger here no charger basically this was kind of inevitable to conclude things there are only a few phones that get us all excited every year and the galaxy s 21 series is definitely one of them and this the new galaxy s21 ultra is the ultimate s21 flagship see there's so many exciting things about this phone being the design the display the crazy camera setup or the performance it just packs so much tech everywhere i know there are a few doubts around the s21 ultra like how does the camera fare against say the new iphones how is the long-term performance with exynos 2100 well these are things that i will be testing in the coming days but there's no doubt that the galaxy s21 ultra is the biggest and the best samsung flagship right now anyway i'd love to know what you guys think
