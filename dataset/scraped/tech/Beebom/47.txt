this is the redmi note 11 pro plus last it was pro max this is also called the redmi note 11 pro 5g outside of india and there's also a redmi note 11 pro plus in china which is called the xiaomi 11a in india the redmi note 10 and the redmi note 10 pro max were undisputedly the best phones under 20k last year no doubts now the redmi note 11 pro plus has arrived and from what we've seen in 2022 newer phones are not just about upgrades they are downgrades plus a price bump so i'm going to talk about the upgrades in this phone as well as the downgrades you need to watch this video so talking about the upgrades first the biggest upgrade is the chipset snapdragon 695 chipset is the new here and brings up more powerful cpu and it brings 5g there's also cad aggregation support if you're wondering about that now if you watched a moto g71 video you know that 695 is actually more of a seven series chipset beating chipsets like 750g i mean here's the add to score and the geekbench 5 score of the note 11 pro plus and if i compare it with the 732g you can see that the 695 is a lot better i mean the gpu performance is kind of on par but the cpu performance is definitely better so it is an upgrade when it comes to benchmarks and numbers when it comes to real world performance the phone also feels smooth and fast although it's too early to judge as for vga my settings it supports a maximum of hd high or you can go with smooth ultra now we generally played the game at smooth ultra and the gameplay was very smooth and nice no weird lag or anything however what's strange is the throttling the phone starts to go red quite easily in the cpu throttling test app and that won the default 20 threads 15 minutes test as you can see the phone throttled to 68 and we also checked the heating and was around 37 38 degrees which is fine so the throttling is kind of strange now i did this test a number of times both in balanced and performance mode and sometimes it did better but most of the times there was throttling as you can see in these screenshots anywhere apart from the chipset the battery is the same as last year but the charger is faster there's this 67 watt charger in the box instead of the 33 watt charger and this is fast it charges the phone to 100 in around 46 minutes which is like i said very fast now the chipset and the charger are the only real upgrades in the redmi note 11 pro plus and the design has also changed and i'll talk about that but first i want to talk about the downgrades so here's what i'm talking about these are the camera specs and first of all i don't really care about macro cameras but xiaomi went ahead and downgraded it the note8 pro max had a 5 megapixel macro lens while the note 11 pro plus comes with a more useless 2 megapixel sensor also i don't really care about 2 megapixel depth sensors but just to let you know that's also missing here another weird downgrade is that there's no 4k video recording support and i'm not talking about the front camera i'm talking about the main rear camera the 108 megapixel camera yes there's not even 1080p 60 fps now i shot a video with the phone and the video quality is very average if you ask me and i don't know what happened here now as for the camera performance the 108 megapixel sensor takes good shots in daytime most photos are sharp in detail the colors are good i like them in good light in low light i noticed that unlike the note 10 pro the night mode does not automatically kick in in the note 11 pro plus as you can see so basically the note 10 pro max takes a longer exposure while the 11 pro plus just takes a usual photo and it shows in the photos the note 10 pro max photos are just sharper in low light apart from this the ultra wide angle camera is the same and it works fine and so is the 60 megapixel selfie camera the selfies are good so i'm not going to go too much into detail here moving on the redmi note 11 pro plus comes with the new miui 13 update but it's still based on android 11. yes the phone is on android 11 and we are showing you about the software update situation on this phone i mean how many years of updates how many years of security patches and we have yet to get an answer for that anyway like i said the design is a big change you can see this new sort of pattern on the back the flatter sides i mean here's how it looks next to the note 10 pro max yeah looks are subjective but i want to know which one you like more comment below i personally am not a big fan of this pattern texture whatever you want to call it and apart from this new look there's all the usual functionality you expect from a redmi phone there's ir blaster headphone jack on the top a usb 2.0 usb c port at the bottom there's also loud steel speakers one at the bottom and the other one at the top there's also the micro sd slot but strangely it's a hybrid slot strange because the note 10 pro came with a dedicated triple slot now this whole design is also ip53 rated for splash resistance now the note 10 pro plus is fairly sleek at 8.1 millimeters although the flatter sides make it look a little thick as for the weight it's 10 grams heavier than the note 10 pro max at 202 grams on the front the display hasn't changed it's the same 120 hertz amulet from the note 10 pro and pro max and that's fine because it's still a very good panel it's bright and sharp the colors are good it's fast and responsive with 120 hertz and there's white wine element license the point is there's no issues with it i mean the note 10 pro's display was a big big usb that no other phone really matched last year so i'm fine with it using the same display in the note 11 pro plus now like last year the fingerprint scanner is still on the side in the power button see overall the redmi note 11 pro plus has upgrades and downgrades and then there's the pricing now we understand phones will get more expensive in 2022 we get it and you must suggest that the redmi note 11 pro plus will start at around 22k and go till 2425k and honestly i would have been okay with that price bump but there's just no significant improvements here see the chipset is faster here theoretically but it throttles sometimes so i would not call it a significant upgrade they also compromises when it comes to camera and they're still android 11 with no word on the update situation if you ask me i would honestly take the redmi note 10 pro max over this in fact a redmi note 10 pro max with android 12 would be a much better day look i want to know your opinion on this so make sure to
