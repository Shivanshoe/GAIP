[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and lg recently launched the lg wet weight here in india and this is the phone right here now i know lg has launched a number of dual screen supported phones in recent past but this is kind of my first dual screen experience so how is the dual screen experience is it fun is it useful well i'm gonna tell you all about it so this is the lg velvet and the dual screen accessory right here now let me just put in the phone in this case so uh that was pretty easy now let me just try taking this phone out which as you can see requires slightly more effort but i wouldn't say it's tough anyway this is the dual screen on the lg velvet all set up and i like the pattern on the case here i think it makes the phone more grippy and nice there's also the cover display on the front for the time the date and the notification icons and i like it now checking out the displays in first look it's pretty clear that the secondary display is the same here as the main display both of these displays are 6.8 inch p o led fhd plus displays of the same quality so they both have the same color reproduction the same oled blacks and they have the same brightness by default what i mean is when you increase or decrease the brightness on any of these screens it increases or decreases on the other screen too so yeah that's good now coming to actually using the dual screen as you can see on the secondary screen i have a number of multi apps set up that launched two apps in the two screens at once but first up i want to play some games on the dual screen so i'm just gonna launch asphalt in one screen and the gamepad on the second screen yes you can actually use the secondary screen on the lg velvet as a full blown gamepad as you can see here so here's me playing asphalt with the console style gamepad on the second screen and it's a lot of fun but trust me if you like racing games there's also the racing style dedicated gamepad option here with the steering wheel and everything so here's me playing with this gamepad on the second screen and well this is asked one as it looks i mean i'll be honest i'm still getting used to this but this is more fun than i thought it would be anyway how about some shooting games well i have sniper fury installed which supports gamepads and as you can see the touch gamepad on the second screen works well with this too although i'm bad at this because i'm still getting used to these controls also i can just use this button here to check out more gamepad options there's an arcade style gamepad a basic style gamepad and for games that don't support gamepads there's this option to create your very own custom gamepad so using this i can add different buttons to mimic the different actions and screens so this can be set up on most games so gaming is actually fun on the dual screens of the lg welder but let's see how good the multitasking is so i was talking about multi-apps i have set up let me just show you now so the first is the camera and gallery combo so i can just tap this and it opens up the camera on one side and the gallery on the other now this is helpful because i cannot take photos from the right screen while taking a look at the shot i just took on the left screen this way i can make sure that the shot i've taken is good enough or just take a photo once again the second combo is for chrome and youtube now this just opens up youtube on one side and chrome on the other pd office so i can just use this to watch a youtube video listen to music on youtube while browsing through different websites and articles on the other screen another useful combo i like is texting and video so i have said it to youtube and messages but you can obviously set it to netflix prime video and say what's up this way i can watch my favorite show or a movie while texting someone it's super cool and if i use the phone in landscape i like how the lg keyboard splits into two making it easier to type another multi-app group that i think will be very useful for a lot of people is sound recorder and quick memos the note-taking app from ng this can be used for a meeting and classes i mean i can record the audio from the left screen while taking notes on the right so these app groups are obviously great for multitasking you can also manually open up different things in the different screens if you want to and there's also this floating button which you must have noticed which has these different options swap screens switch apps between the two screens turn off dual screen and this wide view which stretches supported apps into the two screens i also like the lg's whale browser because just look at this it expands into the dual screen and it brings a great feature see what i can do is i can just double tap on a link to open it up on the other screen so this way i can have two tabs open right in front of me and yeah this is actually cool apart from this another great use case i can think of in the welvet is the tent mode yep this is actually a good way to enjoy movies and shows better especially with the nice display and the good stereo speakers with lg's 3d sound engine now there's obviously a lot more ways you can use the dual screen in the lg velvet and i'm gonna explore that in the next few days as for the rest of the phone i've only had the lg velvet for like 24 hours a little more than 24 hours and in my short time with the device there's one more thing that has really caught my attention and that's the design of this phone see i think it's a very cool looking phone i mean it has a curved glass design on both the front and the back with an aluminium frame in between and i think the back here deserves a special mention because it's just starting to look at no ugly camera cutouts no crazy camera bumps as you can see it has this water drop style cameras and i like how the two cameras are just flush in the body the back here looks great i think it's very minimal and very premium oh and by the way it's very durable too there's ip68 rating for water and dust resistance as well as mil std 10g durability certification now that's awesome and combine that with features like stereo speakers wireless charging support a microsd slot and the big one a headphone jack and you get a design that i think is overall lovely so overall it's pretty clear that the dual screen support is kind of the big usp of the lg welder now to be honest i've mostly been skeptical of these dual screen designs thinking they might be a little gimmicky but after using the velvet i did get an idea of how two screens can actually be useful plus add to that the very premium design and the flagship features in the design and this is the phone that can actually be appealing to a lot of people anyway there's also a lot of other things like the performance the battery the cameras and yeah i will be testing all of that in the lg velvet in the next few days but right now i'd love to know your opinion on the lg wellweight and the dual screen support comment below and yeah give this video a like if you enjoyed it make sure to share it around and
