[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient boom calm and after a lot of wait the galaxy s 20 ultra is finally here in India yes this is the galaxy Estonia ultra Indian variant and yeah this is Samsung's most powerful flagship ever so what are you waiting for let's check this out and yeah make sure to watch this video till the very end because I have some really cool hundred XP zoom shots now let's unbox this [Music] okay so this is the galaxy s 20 ultra and well in this indian unit you get this transparent silicon case the 25 watt fast charging adapter the USB C cable and these USB C AKG earphones now along with the galaxy s 20 hunter Samson also sent us these new Galaxy bucks plus earbuds which look like the Galaxy buds but bringing improved sound quality and an insane battery life of 11 hours on a single charge anyways to check out all the details on the Galaxy buds plus from the link in the description down below now coming to the galaxy s 20 ultra this is a beastly looking phone I mean yeah I went hands-on with it briefly at San Francisco during the launch event but I did not realize back then how huge this 4 was see this is a phone that's massive and it just looks like a phone that packs in a lot I mean just look at that camera module on the back it's insanely big but I'm not complaining because there is some serious hardware in there on the front there are some nice changes to the galaxy s 20 ultra features an enormous six point nine inch dynamic AMOLED display with one to any Hertz refreshing yep like most Samsung flagship this is a bold and beautiful display it's stunning and I think one too many Hertz makes things even better why do I just look so seamless and smooth on this display yes like a lot of you will know what do any Hertz is Kabat full HD resolutions so yeah you can't get UHD +1 to any Hertz goodness just yet but yeah this is a great display now part of this massive display the galaxy s 20 eltra has all the flagship features Gorilla Glass 6 on both the front and the back the ip68 water and dust resistance and very nice and thumpy stereo speakers now moving on to the specs this is the s20 ultra indian radiant so no snapdragon 865 here having said that you do get the flagship great X nos 990 chipset up to 16 gigs of ram and up to 512 GB of ufs 3.0 storage now since this is Exynos 990 there is no 5g support on the Indian weight anyway our galaxy s2 d ultra is a 12 GB 128 GB variant and that couldn't stop us from check out the bedrocks would it so here the benchmark scores and the is almost 990 is obviously a good performer but here its benchmark scores next to the snapdragon it's the five scores and yeah as you can see it's not beating the snapdragon 865 not 92 on each bench now obviously benchmark scores don't tell you the whole story and the Exynos 990 is a powerful chipset and so far the phone has been flagship like snappy and fast and smooth while gaming so I will be testing out the s20 hundra's performance extensively in the coming days well now let's talk about this yes this power-packed camera setup you get a huge hundred eight megapixel primary sensor with oh is a 12 megapixel ultra wide-angle sensor of 48 megapixel telephoto / various complaints with OAS and a 3d time-of-flight sensor now honestly I haven't been able to take a lot of photos with the Estonian because of the corona virus outbreak but yeah all of these cameras can do some really cool things I'm gonna start with the 100x pays oh okay so the periscope camera here supposed 4x optical zoom 10x hybrid optical zoom and yes the insane 100x hybrid zoom now I did not zoom into space but here's a one exhume shot and here you can see the entry gate far far away now let us look into that okay this is for exhume which look sharp and pretty detailed and now you can see the entry gate right now here's a 10x zoom shot and Samson claims it to be lossless and it's actually really good I mean telling zoom is enough for most of us but you can't go further so I did this is a Tati exhume shot and yeah the blood is kind of kicked in but it's not very bad per se still pretty incredible now take a look at the hundred eggs zoom shot yeah it's pretty average the text is blurred but look at the amount we've zoomed in it's pretty amazing and yeah looks fairly decent well that was cool right but I wasn't expecting great results from the zoom in low-light but you know what I was surprised so this is a 1x shot and see the logo on the building far far away in the dark yup let's zoom in there here's a 4x shot which is average I mean it's low light so I was expecting things to be average now here's a 10x zoom shot and again you can really see anything now the 30x zoom shot okay it's flooding and nothing now take a look at the hundred x shot yep you can actually read the text I don't know if it's a eye or what it is it's incredible yeah I won't be using a hundred zoom on a daily basis but the fact that you can do this is fantastic next up there's the insane hundred and eight megapixel primary sensor and by default it takes 12 megapixel shots and look at these shots the photos from the galaxy s2 dr draws one hundred and eight meter pixel camera are incredibly detailed have great colors and create dynamic range especially in good light yeah some of these photos are really good it's very impressive no lie - with a lot of detail and the shots are very well lit - now it's not perfect sometimes the shots are a bit over processed but overall the camera seemed very good and flagship you can capture hundred eight megapixel shots - like this one and zoom in all the way and you can see the DJ's are pretty good there's also the 12 megapixel wide-angle lens and when it sounds kind of usual I have been impressed with some of the shots I've taken after I chose from the estradiol to have super punchy colors and as good as details get from an ultra wide angle sensor then there's the depth sensor for portrait mode shots and I found do I focus shots to be fairly smooth and nice all wrong now there's one feature here that is pretty underrated the single take feature see what this does is you just hit the shutter button and wait for up to 10 seconds and this will take photos using different lenses and different modes and different styles yeah for example here's a short I captured with a single take and single take also captured this cool shot this cool video and this portrait mode shot yeah it's a lot of fun under the rhenium of the S radiant eyes power pack is on the video recording front there's 8 K 24 FPS support and stabilization works in 8k - which is pretty awesome now this is an 8k video from the phone and it's obviously not the same because this whole video is a 4k video but the quality is right up there and it's pretty stable - now what's exciting to me is how do the video capabilities of the s20 ultra compared to the iPhones yeah that's going to be fun and if there are a lot of other video features here like 8k video snap live focus video mode super steady mode and a lot more I'm moving on to the selfies which is no slouch this is a 40 megapixel camera and this is pretty capable first up it shows 10 megapixel selfies using pixel binning and in good lighting the selfies are very detailed and very sharp yeah there is some smoothing on the face indoors but that aside I like it so far now what's interest to me is the fatter you can shoot 4k 60fps videos from this front camera well here's a sample of that hey guys this is a front video from the Galaxy s2 in the ultra and it's been shown 4k 60fps and I think the quality's really great I've been shooting some stories with it and yeah it looks really great with the dynamic region also looking pretty good and the face took me very sharp and details so a 4k on the front camera is nice see like I said the core no virus outbreak has kind of put brakes on my galaxy s2 in the ultra camera exploration but so far things seem really good but yeah I'll be putting it against other flagships pretty soon anyway we are not done yet there's one more thing I want to talk about the galaxy s2 and I'll try and that's the battery yesterday ultra has a 5000 image battery and while it supports 45 were charging there's a 25 watt charger in the box which is a little weird because it's the ultra flat should be a talk about now come to the matter of performance the s20 ultra has a big qHD wonder when you has a minute so I'm not expecting all the world matric performance but it should be decent as for the charger yeah it's not a 45 watt charger but we've seen what the 25 watt charger can do on the note Templar so I'm positive now concluding things the galaxy s2 in the ultra is obviously a specs monster and it's price like that the full starter 2-piece 93,000 in India and your dad is premium flagship category but yeah let's have no doubt the galaxy s2 idea try Samsung's most outrageous flagship ever and I mean it in a good way see the galaxy a sturdy ultra is obviously not for everyone but for people who are looking for the absolute cutting-edge taking a smartphone should find the s20 ultra appealing however at this price the s20 andra competes with the iphone 11 pro and if you're wondering which one should you buy well that's a question that demands a separate video so see how it goes but those
