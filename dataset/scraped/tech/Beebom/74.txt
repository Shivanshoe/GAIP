[Applause] [Music] this is the new vivo v23 pro which has a couple of really unique features first up it has the notch but this notch has two high quality selfie cameras so the main camera is a new the over the high resolution 50 megapixel f 2.0 sensor with eye autofocus support and there's also an 8 megapixel ultra wide angle lens here plus the vivo v23 pro has these around the cameras hidden in the thin bezel yeah the dual spotlight leds now this dual spotlight feature was present in the v21 too but how well does the new 50 megapixel sensor combined with this dual spotlight work look first of all the light from these dual leds is brighter than it looks in the videos and you can change the hue of the light to make sure you have the best lighting on the face there's default there's warm yellow which i prefer the most because it looks the most natural and there's a cool white hue now it's interesting how the camera quickly shifts white balance for these different lights now coming to the big question gimmicks versus reality so i took a lot of selfies from the vivo v23 pro and i also compared it with the iphone 30 pro which i'll get to in a bit and you know what the new 50 megapixel sensor plus the dual led spotlight make a pretty good impact let me show you so here's a selfie i took in a super dark area without the spotlights you can barely see my face now look at the photo with the spotlights turned on that's a big difference i mean you can even see a lot of good detail on the face now this was the cool white hue but i also took the photo in the default mode and i also took the photo in the warm yellow tool here's another example here's the photo without the spotlight and again you can see how dark it is now check this out yeah the spotlight makes a huge difference it instantly makes the face a lot better and the 50 megapixel sensor captures the details the sharpness of the face very well now here's one more example this is a selfie i took in the car with spotlight off and it's kind of dark-ish not totally dark but look at the photo with spotlights turned on see the difference so yeah this does make a pretty good impact and like i said i compared the selfies from the vivo v23 pro against the selfies of the iphone 13 pro in low light and the results were actually kind of fascinating first of all let me make it clear that the iphone turns on the night mode automatically otherwise it takes photos like this yeah that's dark now here's the same photo from the vivo v23 pro with spotlights on and the iphone 13 pro with night mode on auto now you remember i said fascinating this is why the iphone has brightened things up but it's all washed up details looks like a color painting to be honest the v23 pro's photo looks way better sharp more detailed on the face hair and it has way less noise hit like if you're not expecting this here's another comparison and to be honest the iphone does well when there's some light to absorb but if we zoom in a little bit you'll see what a big difference there is in terms of sharpness and details see i've taken a lot of these comparison selfies and there are times when the iphone 13 pro gets the surrounding brighter with the night mode turned on but it's all mostly blurry and full of noise the v23 pro focuses on the face and it does a way better job of keeping the face well lit and sharp which is very important the dual led spot lights also work while shooting videos so here's a comparison video with the iphone now you kind of instantly know which is better right i mean both of them are dark but at least you can see my face properly in the v23 pro's video the iphone's video is also full of noise especially in the background so yeah the v23 pro actually does well here now one thing to note the dual spotlight led feature works in apps like whatsapp instagram facebook messenger but it only works when taking a photo not in video calls i mean video calls with this spotlight feature would have been nice right so i'm hoping vivo brings the support in the future iterations of this feature anyway the point is i did not use the vivo v21 and i'm not sure how well it worked but the vivo v23 selfie camera along with the dual led spotlight is something i can see being very useful i mean anyone who takes a lot of selfies or does a bit of vlogging will find the selfie cameras here very useful especially because there's also an ultra wide angle camera on the front which seems good in my brief testing and it has all the camera features you need beat eye auto focus 4k hdr video recording and some really cool portrait mode styles anyway if you look at the vivo v23 pro apart from all of these selfie camera features this also seems like a pretty well balanced all-around smartphone first of all this is the first smartphone in india to feature a color changing glass now this is vivo's color changing fluorite ag glass so it looks mostly gold indoors but when there's sunlight or any other artificial light with uv days it changes color to this blue and green gradient like this now some people will like this and some people will be like this is not a big deal so yeah it's very subjective but one thing's for sure this is something new something unique also i think this is a very premium design the glass back has this soft touch matte finish which feels very premium and the v23 pro comes in a black variant in the same matte finish which is something a lot of people will like this is also pretty sleek and lightweight phone at 7.3 millimeters thickness and a weight of 173 grams then there's the display a 90 hertz fhd plus curved amoled panel that's bright and vibrant i mean sure i would have liked a 120 hertz panel but this is a good quality amoled that vivo has used so not complaining a lot here the phone also brings high-end specs on board there's dimensity 1200 which as we all know is a fairly powerful chipset there's up to 12 gb lp ddr4 x ram and up to 256 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage so the specs are great and in my usage so far the v23 pro feels like a good smooth phone i mean there's no lag anywhere and even the gaming performance is what you would expect from a dementia 1200 phone all in all i've only used the phone for a while i'll just clear that out but i'm positive about the performance here now when it comes to the software there's new fun touch os 12 based on android 12 which does have its improvements i noticed lesser vivo apps and the lock screen poster feature is gone now there are these pre-installed apps but they can be uninstalled so yeah good the rear cameras of the v23 pro are also packed just like on the front 108 megapixel main camera an 8 megapixel ultra wide angle camera and a 2 megapixel macro lens now i've always found vivo phones to have good well optimized cameras and this too seems the same the photos from the 108 megapixel sensor have very punchy colors very good contrast and sharpness within daytime or even low light plus there are all the features too 4k 60fps video recording support different portrait mode styles including bokeh flare effects that let you change the bokeh to hearts stars and more and there's also stabilization modes and more moving on the vivo v23 pro has a 4300 mah battery with 44 watt flash charge and the battery charging is something i'm still testing out so no judgments right now lastly this is a 5g phone and if you're wondering about the 5g bands there are seven bands in the vivo v23 pro overall you know what there are two types of phones phones that are full of gimmicky features but are not good phones that are actually very good but they don't have anything unique or special now i think the vivo v23 pro is kind of the right mix of both i mean this is a phone that brings a good balance of unique features and specs say what you will the new 50 megapixel selfie camera with the spotlights do make a big difference like you saw the design is leaking nice and all of the other specs seem good all around so i will be testing things out more but so far the vivo v23 pro does seem like a good all-around smartphone but yeah i want to know your
