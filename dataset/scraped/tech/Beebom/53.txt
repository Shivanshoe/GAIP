[Applause] the ico 9 has arrived in india and this is a phone that's targeting the oneplus 9 rt how i'll talk about that but first let me make it clear that the iq 9 indian variant is very different from the chinese version of the phone there's no eight-gen one there's no wireless charging the cameras are different basically it's a different phone altogether now that's out let's check out the iko 9. so here's the iq9 and as you can see it has the matte gorilla glass 6 back with this pattern here signifying the bmw partnership and there's the camera module with the gimbal camera text the frame is aluminium and i like the power button with the blue and this pattern it's pretty cool now this design looks fine but just to make it clear the iq9 does not have the same finish on the back as the 9 pro i mean here's the 9 pro and the 9 side by side and the 9 pro is definitely the better looking phone which makes sense anyway coming back to the iq 9 on the bottom you get the usb c port which like on the 9 rt is usb 2.0 now there's no micro sd slot no headphone jack no ip rating no wireless charging but you do get stereo speakers there's a speaker at the bottom and there's a speaker in the earpiece on the top as for the size this is not a huge or massive phone which is something i like on the front you get this ambient panel with the 120 hertz refresh rate and it's a nice display i mean it's amulets so the colors the blacks all look great i also like the fact that this display is bright and nice and it supports the wide wide l1 license along with hdr in the netflix app i played some hdr shows on netflix and as you can see it looks really good so yeah this display seems good so far one thing to note iq9 does not have good idea glass screen protection but it does have scotch sensation up glass protection now i'm not sure if the gorilla glass is better or this is better but at least there's some protection so it's fine also the fingerprint scanner is here in the display and it's fast and nice when it comes to the hardware specs the iq 9 highlight is the snapdragon triple 8 plus and you get lpddr5 ram and you have a 3.1 storage so these specs are good and i ran some benchmark tests from the iq9 and as you can see the scores are pretty good and when it comes to day-to-day performance i haven't used this phone as my daily driver but the phone feels like a high-end responsive fast phone and gaming is good too in bgm i suppose the max graphics ultra hd and ultra frame rates and the gameplay was very good in the couple of sessions i played now i obviously tested the phone for some thermal throttling issues in the 15 minute 20 thread test the iq9 throttled to 83 percent of its max performance which is good but i wanted to put some stress on the phone so i also did a 50 threads 30 minutes test and in this test the phone did throttle a bit but it was fine at 71 i also did an extreme 100 threads test and the ico 9 here was decent dish throttling to 72 percent of its max performance so it's not very good when it comes to thermal throttling but it's not bad either anyway performance apart i like the fact that iq 9 comes with the latest android 12 update on board there's obviously fun touch os and all of its features and quirks but the fact that it has android 12 means it will get to android 14. this ico has confirmed two major android updates and three years of security patches as for the bloatway icon 9 comes with a lot of iq apps but when it comes to third-party apps these are the apps pre-installed and you can uninstall them moving on to the cameras here the specs yes the iq9 comes with the gimbal camera system with the imx 598 primary camera and for the photos i've taken so far the camera seems promising in daytime i like that the colors in photos are mostly natural not boosted or anything and most photos have good details good dynamic range in low light ico 9 almost always turns on the night mode by default with its gimbal ois system making sure there's no blurry photos and the photos are almost always bright and sharp which is very nice moving on to the other cameras in the iq 9 the ultra wide angle camera is kind of fine i mean here are a few shots from the ultra wide angle camera and i think it captures shadows and highlights well and even though it lacks the details like most ultra wide angle sensors the colors are good now you must have also noticed in the camera specs that the iq9 has a 13 megapixel portrait sensor that also brings 2x optical zoom but here are some 2x zoom shots from the iq 9 and it's not out of the world or extraordinary but it's kind of decent dish now this sensor is also used in the portrait mode but i did feel the iq 9 portrait shots have this unnatural color on the face i mean edge detection is good but the color is a bit strange anyway what i do like is the ico 9's front camera i think the selfies from the phone look very good with the camera capturing good skin tone and details on the face now one thing to note is that the iq9 front camera only shoots still 1080p yeah there's no 4k support which is something i kind of expect in this price range as for rear camera videos the phone supports up to 4k 60fps video recording and there's also the very cool gimbal system for better stabilization now here's a video i took from the phone while walking briskly and the stability is very good in fact it does not seem like i'm walking fast so that says a lot and i also like the video quality and if you like our video quality hitting the subscribe button will make us really really happy so do that right now moving on to the battery and charging the iphone 9 has a 4350 mah battery with the 120 watt flash charge on board now the battery something i will be testing but the 120 watt flash charger is insanely fast as you'd expect it takes the phone from 10 to 50 percent in a crazy six minutes and it fully charges the phone in 18 minutes yeah this is super fast now before i conclude things a couple of points on the iq 9 the phone has eight 5g pads which is pretty good and phone supports camera aggregation so no issues there coming to the conclusion now at the time of shooting this video i don't know the price of the iq 9 but i'm expecting it to be priced around 42 43k now for checking out the iq 9 it specs its features it feels like aiko has designed this phone specifically to take on the oneplus 9rt i mean in china the ip9 is a different phone altogether the indian version on the other hand is pretty similar and well matched with oneplus 9rt beat on the design the display cameras or even things like the 5g bands now i do like that icon 9 is on the latest software and it will go to android 14 i mean the 9rt won't so that's pretty good for micro also i like the ico has bundled the 120 watt fast charger in the box ci 29 or oneplus 9rt which is the better phone is something we'll only find out once we do a detailed comparison but this looks like aiku's strategy to replace oneplus in this whole 40 to 50k high-end smartphone segment anyway i want to know what you guys think of the iq9 versus the oneplus 9rt comment down below also give
