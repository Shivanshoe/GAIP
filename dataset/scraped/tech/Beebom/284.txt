[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient boom calm and yeah Xiaomi has announced to me what well update globally today and well we have it installed on our red meat k20 here now this is the EU version of the meego it will update and yeah that means it's going to be pretty close to the indian version so what are you waiting for let's take a more detailed look at the mirror it will update let's get started ok so as you can see this is the redmi K 2 nd running the brand new me you are 12 update and well it is speech packed and I think it looks great the most obvious and big change in me over 12 is the refresh DUI yep me hotel has a new more visual UI all across and it reminds me a lot of Windows Phone and iOS because the tab titles and the flat UI but I have to say it looks good now the first big change is the fact that the notification shade and the quick settings are now separate yes so I from the left side brings the notification shade and swipe from the right side brings the control center you have there even calling it the control center just like iOS now the animations here and the visual style is good but I haven't really got used to this separate thingy in definitely take some time but there is an option to turn off the control center and get the old combined notification share if you want that anyway this new visual style along with some really cool animations is something that's pretty much everywhere there's obviously the app opening and closing animation then there's the new cool looking storage page check this out yeah this looks sleek right you get such a beautiful visual interface with a really cool animation now check out the battery page yep this is cool see like I said you get this visual animating toggles everywhere with the different options and different settings pages the about page of the phone and yeah everything looks flatter and I definitely like it now if you're wondering about this really cool super wallpaper from the mere twelve update well it wasn't installed by default on there it'll be K 20 but yeah I side ordered them via XDA and it seems to work really well so check it out so this here is the mass wallpaper Xiaomi calls the Red Planet wallpaper and I think it looks pretty awesome now here's the super earth wallpaper and yeah this looks pretty good too now I've added the link to the apk in the description down below so go ahead and try it on your phone that you have now about from the new look another visual and functional change is the gesture muir trail uses android ten gestures so get this big bar at the bottom and yeah you get the usual gestures along with the slight left and right to switch between apps however the whole bear gesture to switch between apps that a lot of me you i uses light is gone yup it's no longer an option in me what well apart from that i noticed some interesting changes in the launcher as you can see in the launcher settings you now have an option to enable the app drawer now enabling this brings you a very poco launcher type abra which is nice yes i am not sure if they'll keep this option in the final release but they have been testing it out for quite some time now so I hope they do there's also an option to choose the Google discover feed instead of the app word on the home screen which is I think another great change now what are the features in me what well I was actually excited to check it out is free form windows so the feature is called floating windows in me were twelve and there are three ways to run an app in floating window you can just swipe up on an app and hold and bring the app to this icon to put it in a window you can even run an app in the floating window from the multitasking screen yeah you get a bunch of these apps and you can add your favorite apps here you can also run an app in a floating window from the notification directly yeah this works well and as you can see the apps work when in this window and almost all of the apps are supported and you can minimize the window to any of these corners like this yeah this is great next up new it'll also brings dark mode 2.0 which has the wallpaper dimming feature so you can turn on the dark mode and it automatically adjusts the wallpaper like this then there are a couple of new options here there's individual app so that you can turn on or off dark mode in certain apps specifically there's also add just contrast automatically which makes your dark mode in me were twelve adjusts colors and lowest score trusts automatically when brightness is reduced now since we are in the display settings you can see the new sunlight mode which adjusts the brightness to strong light when automatic brightness is off there's also the always-on display settings I know it's been here since me you are 11 but me what well brings a ton of different things including new me we're 12 specific teams and you know what I like the fact that Xiaomi has made this a team features so developers will be able to create more always on display themes that you'll find in the themes up that is pretty awesome move on near-term also brings a more feature pack and modern looking camera first of all the me you a12 camera have has this accent color yellow by default but you can change that also all of the options on top have a cool new UI I like also only the most used modes I here while the rest are in this mode option you can obviously customize things to get your favorite modes out in the open so yeah it's a good feature there's also new documents mode here but my favorite is the new quick snap mode now you can enable in the settings but this you can take a photo when your phone is locked here's how it works just open up the camera and turn of the screen after that press and hold the volume button for a while and it will take the shot with the shutter song yep should be handy when you quickly want to take a picture without unlocking your phone apart from that there are a few more customization options in the camera settings as you can see you can have the other camera modes in a more tab or a more panel available by swiping up you can also customize the colors and the sound effects of the camera look what these features are nice but me what will also bring some really important privacy features so there is a dedicated privacy protection page in the settings here and as you can see the first tab is permission stats here you can see the different permissions and you can tap on each one of them to see apps that are taking up that particular permission below there's an all apps button that shows you kind of a list of all the apps that have taken up different permissions in fact you can see every single time an app has taken any permission this is really good but also some of the listings marked red because that's when an app took a permission in the background you can even enable permission notifications here which will show you an icon in the left side of the status bar when an app takes the location camera or microphone information this is great and I hope Xiaomi also cuts down on the formation some of its very own apps what anyway then there's the manage tab where you can see apps that are taking up unnecessary permissions you didn't also manage your location access and check out the restrictions on camera access now if you go to special permissions it's also the mask feature that we have talked about in the last video yes virtual ID which instead of your real personal info will provide a virtual ID with kind of a black info to third-party apps this is great and in theory it should prevent app from tracking your behavior another important feature in me URL is the ability to back up things wire up computer it's pretty simple you can just use this option to back up your call logs messages apps and app data including third-party app data and once this is done a backup file will be created which you can just copy to your PC and when you want to restore it you can just connect your phone to the PC and copy the backup folder and just restore all the data this works fine but I'm not sure why does not backup the DCIM folder last but not the least is the new me health app that tracks the steps of workouts and even your sleeve without requiring a fitness tracker all you need is the phone as you can see here's my sleep data which I am not sure is very accurate anyway there's even a detects snoring and talking during sleep feature which record your sounds while sleeping through the mic now like I said I'm not sure if the features of the me hunt are very accurate but I will test it out once me what will stable bills rolls out in India now apart from one of this there are a lot of other minor changes in me you are 12 so let me turn them down really quickly in me hotel you can take a detailed look at Wi-Fi information which shows you details like the speed signal strength and more there's even test network feature and the security app which shows apps taking up data in real time there's also the really cool dynamic weather app which shows you really cool animations based on the current weather and yeah it looks pretty cool when the weather is cool me Sharon Newton also supports me computers along with Oppo real me and vivo force there's also the option to set a bedtime in the clock app which will remind you to go to sleep at that particular time lastly there is a new focus mode similar to Zen mode in oxygen OS alongside redesign screen time which looks pretty good but those are a lot of new features in the mere 12 update and yeah so far I really like this update I like the changes and the new features but what about you guys tell us your thoughts in the comment section below
