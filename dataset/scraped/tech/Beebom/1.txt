[Music] this is probably the most powerful smartphone in the world this is the brand new Rog phone 6 Pro and I know there are a lot of cool things about this phone I love how the phone looks but the focus is obviously on being the most powerful phone just look at the specs this is the first phone with the latest Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 chipset which brings some important improvements over 8 gen 1. it helps the clock speed of the CPU and GPU and more importantly though Qualcomm has used tsmc's phone animator architecture for this chipset so theoretically it should be more power efficient and also not throttle as much as the agent one I mean the biggest issue with hm one phones has been the poor terminal performance and this is set to fix that in fact Qualcomm says there's 30 better power efficiency in the 8 plus gen one the better chips are apart the RG phone 6 Pro comes with insane amounts of ram yes 18 GB and 512 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage so these are the best specs you can get on a smartphone out there and obviously the benchmarks are very good even better than the agent one I mean it crosses the one bench as well and what's important though is the terminal performance and the big question is is the 8 plus gen 1 actually better so we enable the xmod on the RG phone 6 Pro and the high performance mode on the agent one powered OnePlus 10 Pro and here's a basic 15 minute throttling test in action and you can see the difference in the end result it's a big difference now not just this we did the 30 minutes test and also the 1R 100 threads test and you can see how impressive the RG phone 6 Pro is I mean apart from the throttle link just look at the crazy performance numbers of the RG phone 6 Pro it's a huge difference compared to the OnePlus 10 Pro which is not even close so wow you also had the 3D Mark Wildlife stress test which checks how the GP performs under 20 minutes of continuous stress and pressure and the RG phone 6 Pro with 8 plus gen 1 Asus 2. there's no score on the OnePlus 10 Pro because it started overheating and the app crashed as for the xiaomi 12 Pro it had a pretty ability of 47 the rg46 probe 92 stability that is awesome and what a huge difference I mean we've been playing some Apex stations on this phone with the FPS enabled and unlike a lot of Flagship phones the FPS on the Rog phone 6 Pro is mostly stable and consistent and this is at the best settings Extreme Graphics Ultra frame rates not just Apex such as his bgmi to Ultra HD settings and the performance is really good we even played the crazy intensive gentian impact and the performance was lag free on medium graphic settings which by the way is the default setting the phone also does not heat up a lot unlike the previous Rog phones the maximum temperature of the Rog phone 6A R testing was around 45 44 degrees which is fine for a phone that brings powerful performance I mean 8 plus gen one obviously seems to have better thermal performance but it's important to take note of Rog phone 6's new game Cool 6 cooling system this has a larger Vapor chamber larger graphite sheets and there's boron nitride thermal compound injected to decrease throttling yeah it's an impressive setup plus Asus is not this new Aero active cooler 6 and this is just super cool first of all this now has four physical buttons that you can map depending on the game along with the air triggers or the RG phone six so yeah lot of buttons and this attaches to the USBC port on the side of the phone so no need for external part plus it looks super cool with these lights now there are focaling modes smart which automates the fans depending on the situation then there's cool Frosty and Frozen which only works when a charger is plugged in in fact you can plug in a charging even with a cooler Dash like this yeah that is pretty awesome as for how it works the cooler on the Frozen mode quickly makes a difference of around 8 to 9 degrees which is pretty good I mean here we are playing bgmi and this is the temperature without the cooler and this is the temperature with the cooler attached for a few minutes and the cooling mode set to Frozen here's another example this is gentian impact and this is the temperature of the phone without the cooler and now this is the temperature with the cooler in Frosty mode yeah this makes a difference in fact you can even feel the cool air flowing around your hands while gaming now apart from the new cooler the Rog phone 6 has all the Rog phone gaming features you expect from the rog4 this is obviously the ultrasonic air triggers which now has a new press and lift action along with the ability to aim via gyroscope using a trigger the game Gene is also improved and it now comes up from here and it has features like bypass charging which lets the phone take part directly from the charger so the battery does not charge and heat up now it did not make a huge difference in the temperatures in our testing but yeah it could be handy this is also the really cool armor create app which shows you all the details like you'd see in a gaming laptop and it lets you customize the performance the cooler the lighting the animations on the secondary display is the RG phone 6 pro has this OLED display on the back with 60 new animations to choose from you can even add custom animations and yeah it definitely adds the whole gaming Vibe and the back also has this day to play tags that lights up and can be customized the display is also an upgrade the difference it has been up to 165 Hertz with touch sampling up to 720 Hertz with 23 milliseconds of touch latency there's also HDR 10 plus support with DCI P3 and srgb coverage and there's going to the Las Vegas protection on the front now the display is super responsive at 165 words and not just that this Samsung AMOLED display also looks beautiful and bright plus the phone comes with very stockish Android 12 with absolutely no Bluetooth anything and Asus has incorporated features like what paper-based theming which is nice as for updates Asus has promised two major updates and at least two years of security patches the Dual front firing five magnet speakers are still here and they are even better there's better Center image so it looks like the sound is coming from the center of the screen is more immersion so when an enemy comes up from the left you get clearer sound of the footsteps from the left lastly there's better bass in these speakers just listen to this comparison [Music] the main camera has been updated to IMAX 766 and in our test in the camera performance was it a big Improvement which is okay because this is not a camera phone the battery is the same massive 6000 mAh battery but in India you still get the same 30 watt chargeable globally this will come with a faster 65 watt charger to conclude things the Rog phone says the RG phone 6 Pro is once again a feature packed Flagship gaming phone and it brings powerful performance with the 8 plus gen 1 which actually looks like it solves the terminations of the engine one I mean we'll get a better idea once we check out more phones with 8 plus gen 1 but its performance on the Rog phone 6 Pro is really really good the RG phone 6 Pro also brings upgrade so display camera speakers and design and I really like what they've done with the new Aero active cooler 6. it's one of the coolest smartphone accessories I have ever used as for the pricing at the time shooting this video I don't know the price of the Rog phone 6 Pro or any of its accessories but I'll add the details in the comments once I know anyway what do you guys think of the Rog phone 6 Pro and its insane specs and also this really cool cooler comment down below or to give this video a
