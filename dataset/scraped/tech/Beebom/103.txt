[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from youtube.com and this right here is the galaxy m52 5g that has recently launched in india and this is a phone that i'm excited about because this looks like a good all-around samsung smartphone so is it as good as it seems what are the pros and cons i know a lot of you guys have a ton of questions around the m52 5g and i'm gonna answer all of them so let's begin so this is the new galaxy m52 5g and i think the two big upgrades here are on the display and the processor front talking about the display first the m52 has a 6.7 inch super amoled plus display that's full hd plus and it has the high 120 hertz refresh rate now specs wise this is very good especially for its price and it's not just numbers i've only used the phone briefly but the display in the real world looks good it's a samsung amoled panel so it's nice and vibrant when it comes to colors the blacks and contrast look great and it's bright enough for our usage plus it has the 120 hertz refresh rate which is a very good upgrade and yeah the ui feels very smooth as for the screen protection there's gorilla glass 5 on board now the second big upgrade in the galaxy m525g is that it does not cut any corners when it comes to the chipset the m52 is powered by the six nanometer snapdragon 778g 5d chipset which is a good upgrade from the 730g on the galaxy m51 as for the ram there are 6gb and 8gb variants and as for the storage there's 128gb of ufs 2.1 storage now i know there's a confusion among people about the storage type and i have the phone and i can confirm it is ufs 2.1 as you can see there's also a storage speed test i did and these speeds are ufs 2.1 speeds not emmc so no problems here anyway as for the phone performance here the android 2 and geekbench scores from the phone a benchmark support it's too early to judge but the 778 g plus 120 hertz display combo means it just feels like a very smooth and responsive phone now when it comes to gaming the phone handles even an intensive game like bgm i like pro by default it's set to hd and high settings but the mac graphics support here is hdr ultra or you can even go with smooth and extreme now i've played a few classic games as well as some tdm and there has been no issues so i'm overall positive about this phone's performance also the snapdragon 778g is a 5g chipset and if you're wondering the galaxy m525g has 11 5g bands so this is a proper 5g phone anyway apart from the two upgrades the design has changed from the galaxy m51 first up here are the dimensions and weight of the m52 and the m51 side by side and as you can see there's a big difference the m52 is way thinner at 7.4 millimeters and it's way lighter at 173 grams now let me make this clear like the galaxy m51 the m52 comes with a polycarbonate back or glass stick if you want to call it that but yeah i like the fact that it's not hefty as the m51 now i know the m52 has cut down the battery from 7000 image to 5000 image and that's the reason it's so sleek and nice i also know that some people won't like this move but from a personal opinion i like the galaxy m51 it was a good smartphone but it was just too hefty to use so i'm glad that samsung has fixed the whole weight issue with the m52 especially because the 5000 image battery here should be good enough for most people out there now one thing that could have been better is the charging the m52 actually supports 25 watt charging but the bundle charger is a 15 watt adaptive charger which takes a couple of hours to fully charge the phone apart from this there are some key points to note on the design front but first off there is a micro sd slot in the phone although in a hybrid sort of design the fingerprint scanner is in the power button but it's fast and nice there's no headphone jack and there's no ip rating if you're wondering and as for speakers there's only a single speaker at the bottom which is fairly loud but yeah i would have liked stereo speakers also another thing to note here is that the galaxy m52 box does not come with a case on it so if you want to put a case you'll have to buy it separately moving on to the cameras they haven't changed much from the m51 and that's not a bad thing here the specs and i've been taking a few photos in both daytime and low light and as you can see from the camera samples the performance seems pretty good see i mostly like samsung's camera optimization of budget phones and mid-range phones and so far i like it here the photos have nice colors the dynamic range seems good and even in low light shots look very well exposed so yeah i'll be testing it out more but so far i like the camera performance here lastly there's the software the m52 comes with one ui 3.1 on top of android 11 and along with all the one you have features the m52 also has the ram plus feature which uses up to four gigs of storage as virtual ram the phone also has samsung pay support with nfc on board which is great there's the all z feature which lets you switch between your personal and public space with the double click on the power button then there all the privacy and security features with samsung knocks now these are all good features and as the pre-installed apps there's a lot of them as you can see which is not a good thing but you can uninstall each one of these so yeah apart from this when it comes to updates samsung has promised two years of major android updates and four years of security patches which is really good anyway coming to the pricing of the m525g the phone has launched in india at an effective price of rupees 23 499 for the six plus 120 gb variant and 25 499 for the eight plus 128 gb variant with the introductory price the bank offers and everything now if you ask me my initial impressions of this phone i'd say this is a phone that has some really good points i mean the display is good it's super amazing plus with high refresh rate the performance seems solid and consistent so far the cameras are good for the price range and it has 11 5g bands on the other hand the phone has a 15 watt charger in the box and it only has a single speaker now data part overall i think this is a decent mid-range smartphone from samsung that i think will make a lot of sense to a lot of people but yeah these are sort of my initial thoughts and i'll be using the m52 as my daily driver to get a better idea now in the meanwhile i want to know what you guys think of the galaxy m525g so make sure to drop your thoughts in the comments down below
