[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a page from vivo calm and Samson recently knowledge the galaxy is 71 it's premium easily smartphone and well we have it right here so what are you waiting for let's unbox the galaxy a7 1 and check it out so this is the new galaxy ace 71 and in the box you get the transparent silicon case the USBC cable the fast charging adapter these earphones and the usual instruction manuals now coming to the galaxy a 71 we have the prison crush Silver Edition and I think it looks striking there's this pattern we saw with galaxy a 51 and I think it looks beautiful on the galaxy a 71 as well there's also the rectangular camera module that's kind of become the trademark of Samsung phones this here be the s20 series or the a series or the MCS anyway the front is pretty good-looking too you get this near bezel list and big six point seven inch super amoled infinity or display that looks well beautiful thanks to the center punch hole it is immersive and since it's AMOLED it just looks really good the display here has got a class three on top for protection and if you're wondering The Fool has the wine wine elven license so Netflix and prime video HD shouldn't be an issue now since it is AMOLED you get the in display fingerprint scanner here which seems recently fast and accurate and there's also face and log in case you don't want to use the fingerprint scanner or if you wanna use both learning of the design is the dual same micro sd dedicated triple slot the usual buttons and the USB C port and the headphone jack on the bottom when it comes to the in hand field this is a big phone but thanks to its sleek design it's fairly comfortable and fits in the hand perfectly so no problems there talk about the cameras now the galaxy ace everyone packs in what seems like an impressive quad camera setup you get a 64 megapixel F 1.8 primary camera or 12 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens a 5 megapixel macro lens and a 5 megapixel depth sensor yea these specs sound pretty nice anyway here are some photos I have taken from the phone in my brief time and as you can see the 64 megapixel sensor is pretty good the photos look great in good line the nice colour sharpness and pretty good dynamic range plus there's a lot of detail let me just zoom into the shot see well let's just zoom in more well it's still pretty sharp so yeah it's definitely pretty impressive but here are some more photos and I like the photos here plus the 64 megapixel sensor combined with the wide aperture make sure that the low-light photos are also pretty good so things seem pretty good I also took some ultra wide-angle shots and to be honest I have been liking the ultra wide-angle camera performance from recent Samsung phones so the a 71 doesn't seem like an exception these photos look pretty good next up check out a couple of live focus shots and when the camera has a dedicated depth sensor so live focus photo should be pretty good the phone also has a macro lens and here are a few macro shots from the phone and I think the phone has done a pretty decent job now moving on to videos the e71 supports 4k video recording and it's also the impressive super steady mode well here's a video I shot for the super steady mode turn on and look at that stability even though I was walking really fast really fast yeah I was too tired to rely on the front the Galaxy a7 t1 has a 32 megapixels selfie camera and well I've only used the phone briefly I did take our time to take a couple of selfies from the phone so yeah check it out now selfies inside this one feature that you guys might be interested in and that slo-mo video support on the front camera yeah you can shoot 1080p at 120 FPS videos from the front camera and well take a look at her video I shot the tic-tock users are going to love this overall the quad cameras on the galaxy a 71 seem pretty good and honestly I am positive about the camera performance here no you want to under the hood the galaxy a 71 is powered by the fairly powerful Snapdragon 730 chipset with a GB RAM and 128 GB of u FS 2.1 storage well here are the benchmark scores from the phone which are in line with what you expect from 730 and I think these are decent scores anyway the galaxy a 71 in the real world seems pretty fast and snappy so yeah I'm expecting good performance from this phone now come into gaming Bob G mobile runs on high graphics quite expectedly and of sessions that played the in 71 handled all the intensity of pubsey mobile pretty well so yeah the game informer should be good all the software from the galaxy ace everyone comes at the latest 1uy 2.0 with Android 10 on board and that means you get all the good one UI features and like the a 51 you get these in your specific features like smart cropped useful cards in the messages app and a better Universal Search now one thing to note here is that the phone comes with NFC so there's Samsung pay support which is one features Samsung users kind of expect so I'm glad it's here lastly there's the battery the galaxy a 71 has a big 4500 mAh battery which should last long I mean an AMOLED display with the eight nanometer 730 gipset yeah the battery should be good plus there's a 25 watt superfast charger in the box and that means the phone should juice a pretty quickly well coming to the price now the galaxy a 71 has been priced at the peace 29 triple 9 in India and for that price the galaxy a 71 brings a premium looking design a beautiful infinity or AMOLED panel cameras that so far seem very good the latest sort of the latest features and a big battery with super fast charging item at this price you expect a flagship chipset and Snapdragon 730 is in one so as the galaxy a 71 is not perfect but considering the offer and market the Samsung branding and all the other great features it brings well I'd say it's a decent option however we'll test it out more in the coming days to get a better idea then those are my first impressions of the galaxy a 71 so what do you guys think of this phone tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and share it
