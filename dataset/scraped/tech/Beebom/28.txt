[Music] oh [Music] this is the oneplus 10r this is the real me gt neo3 and this comes in two variants available with 80 watt fast charging and a variant with 150 watt fast charging we have the 150 watt one and this has two exciting features one is obviously the crazy fast 150 watt charging and the second is the new powerful diminishing 8100 chipset so let's check it out before we begin i want to give a huge shout out to wondershare famisafe which is a powerful parental control app that lets you track your kids screen time so you can set limits and create schedules you can also use familysafe to track the real-time location of your kids and get alerts it also detects any inappropriate photos or videos on your kids device there are a lot more features in family safe and it's available on android ios windows mac chrome and kindle so check it out from the link down below this is the real me gt new 3 and i'll talk about the other aspects of this phone but i'm going to start with two exciting features so the image gt new 3 has a 4 500 image battery but that's kind of fine normal what's interesting is that this phone comes with a 150 watt ultra dart charger this is a big ass charger it's a usb c pd charger as you can see plus another interesting thing about this is that this is actually a 160 watt charger if you look closely you can see the 20 volt 8 ampere decks which basically means 160 watts the truth is this is a 160 watt gn charger but discharges at 150 watts now if you're wondering what gan is well you can read about it in an article down below but the gist is gan charges are smaller in size faster but more energy efficient anyway let's get to the point how fast is this 150 watt charger so i put the gt neo3 with this 150 watt ultra dot charger versus xiaomi 11i and it's 120 watt hyper charger now i started the test at 10 and after just two minutes the gt new 3 is already a 30 charge but what's interesting is that the xiaomi 11 i is also close at 28 with its 120 watt charger now really had claimed 50 in five minutes but after five minutes the gt new three is 46 percent still impressive but yeah falls a bit short now what's interesting again is that the xiaomi 11i is ahead of the gt neo3 at 47 battery now do note that i had enabled rapid charge in the gt93 and boost charging speed in the xiaomi 11 i have a charge anyway after 10 minutes the xiaomi 11i is way ahead at 75 while the gt neo3 strangely is quite behind at 65 now this margin cuts down to the end but the xiaomi 11 is 120 watt charger is just faster it charged the phone fully from 10 to 100 percent in 18 minutes while gta 3 took 19 minutes i know it's a difference of only a minute but i was honestly expecting the 150 watt charger to beat the 120 watt charger strangely i'm not sure what's happening here because we did the charging test again and the results were kind of similar now you must have noticed that this phone has a rapid charging option that you can enable but when i tested things the charging speed without the rapid charging mode was faster the phone took 19 minutes with the rapid mode on and it took 16 minutes to go from 10 to 100 with rapid charging off basically the 150 watt ultra charger is crazy fast i mean 16 to 19 minutes to fully charge the phone is still insane but the truth is it does not be the 120 watt hyper charger on the xiaomi 11 i hyper charge which is a bit weird as for the battery health and heating we did not come across any heating issues the phone was normal during charging and as for the battery health the gt neo3 has the tube weed island safe fast charging system certification and is also said to be 38 layers of safety and really says that the battery will keep 80 percent of its lifespan after 1600 charge in discharge cycles now this sounds better because i remember xiaomi saying the same 80 number but after 800 cycles with the 120 watt hyper charge now coming to the second big highlight the gt neo3 is the first phone we have tested with the new temensity 8100 chipset yeah the oneplus 10r isn't here yet now the density 8100 is based on the tsmc's five nanometer process and along with the new chipset there's fast lpddr5 ram and ufs 3.1 storage anyway the focus is on the dimension 8100 and when we ran the benchmark scores i found the performance of the diminishing 8100 to be very very close to the snapdragon triple 8 on the likes of ico 9se or the oneplus 9rt i mean here's the end of the score and you can see how close things are when it comes to the overall score and the cpu score the snapdragon triplet does better on the gpu front and this is noticeable in the 3d mark score too when it comes to geekbench the triple h scores higher in single core but the dimensi 100 is way ahead in terms of multi-core score we also ran the cpu throttling test i enabled the gt mode on the gt neo 3 and the high performance mode in the oneplus 9 rt and these are the scores after the 30 minute 50 threads test yeah both these phones performed very well throttling to the same 82 percent the performance numbers on the gt neo3 are higher both the max and the average numbers we also did the 100 threads 1r test and in this test 2 the phones did well the gt neo3 throttled to 79 and the 9rt was marginally better at 81 percent but yeah very close and once again the performance numbers of the gt new 3 are high i also checked the temperatures after the last test and the gt new 3 was around 44 degrees while the 9rt was around 42 degrees and as for the battery range the gt neo3 lost 27 battery in this test well the 9rt lost 31 battery both these phones have the same battery capacity as you know overall the point is the density 8100s performance is very close to the snapdragon triple eight which is very good actually as for optimization in games bgmi only supports hd and high settings on the dimension 8100 but other games support the max graphics pubg new state has support for 90 fps gaming like on triple eight cod mobile has a very high graphics and max fps options available but you can't choose both of them together this is something you can do in snapdragon triple eight i mean the density 8100 is still a newer chipset so i understand that not all games are optimized for this new chipset but i'm hoping mediatek works with developers to bring the highest graphic settings in games in these new chipsets these tests and numbers apart when it comes to using the phone the gt nu3 feels like a high-end phone it is fast and snappy when launching apps and multitasking gaming is good too especially something like new state which supports 90 fps gaming on this phone the phone also has a stainless steel vapor chamber cooling system and i did notice the phone getting cool after test more quickly moving on to the other features in the phone the specs of the display are good but more importantly the display looks beautiful the color accuracy is good saw the blacks it's also bright and the high refresh rate is noticeable here the phone also has td speakers which can get quite loud and the clarity is good too the phone has support for wide wide l1 license so there's full hd playback and netflix prime video and other apps although there's no hdr support in netflix the phone comes with real me ui 2.0 based on android 12 out of the box and this is also something that helps with the overall smoothness of the phone the animations the ui seems to be optimized for the 120hz screen and it's nice to use what's not nice is the amount of bloatware in this phone let me go on a rant here i mean first of all there's so many third party apps pre-installed on the phone and secondly there are a lot of bloatware apps from real me i mean who needs this browser when there's chrome installed that's all the phone also shows these ads on the lock screen which is insane i mean this is supposed to be a premium high-end phone but these things just ruin the experience anyway let's relax for a bit but not too much because i'm also not a big fan of this design i mean i get it looks are subjective so it's totally fine if you like this but i like phones which have a more cleaner look like the gt2 pro and do note that the gt neo3 does come in a black variant which does not have these lines that apart this back is a matte ag glass back and the frame is plastic and the phone is good when it comes to size and as for the functionality the fingerprint scanner is in the display and it's good but there's no micro sd slot no headphone jack no wireless charging and no ipad the camera setup is also fairly good imx 766 has proved to be good on real me phones and from the photos i've taken the camera performance seems good here too be it in the daytime or low light the front camera is a 16 megapixel sensor and here are some selfies from the phone now do note that the rear camera supports 4k 60fps videos so that's good but real me oppo oneplus they're still stuck with 1080p in the front camera when it comes to the connectivity this is a 5g phone with eight 5g bands and support for dual 5g there's also carrier aggregation in fact five ca as you can see which is really good there's also wi-fi six bluetooth 5.3 and there's nfc as well to conclude things i'm expecting the realme gt new 3 to be priced at around 37k for the base variant while the 150 watt 12 256 gb variant should be around 43k now i know the oneplus 10 is basically the same phone it's identically done the specs and features and we will be receiving that soon so i think we'll get a better idea on this phone and that once i've used the oneplus 100 that apart as of right now the real gt nu3 does seem like a good all-around package i mean 150 watt charging is not the fastest out there but it's still insanely fast the diminishing 8100 seems like a very solid chipset all around bringing performance on par with the snapdragon triple eight yes a phone in the sub 40k price segment should be more cleaner and there's my opinions on this design but the rest of the phone seems pretty good so far although i'm yet to use the phone as my daily drive anyway i want to know what you think of the real me gt neo3 and yeah drop that proper thoughts in the comments down below also give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos thanks for watching
