[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and oppo recently showed off its color os 12 update based on android 12 and from the looks of it it seems like a great update that makes color os overall a lot better well we have it up and running here so what's new in color rose 12 what are the new features and changes i'm going to tell you all about it so let's begin so this is the beta version of color rush 12 and the biggest change i've noticed here is the new ui which oprah is calling the inclusive design so this is the new color os 12 in action and you know what this new update makes everything cleaner with better spacing improved layout and more be the ui elements or even stock color os apps let me show you so here's the notification shade and quick settings on color os 12 compared to the notification shade and quick settings of color os 11 and as you can see the color os 12 version looks way more modern and very clean i also like this new animation part of color os 12 new quantum animation engine 3.0 it just makes this feel more smoother there's also a new media output button i noticed at the top of the quick settings anyway even the settings page has new colorful icons and a more cleaner layout for example here's a new personalizations page which is way more cleaner and same with the battery page and even the camera ui has a more minimal and more cleaner looking ui with more rounded corners and better text there's also the new volume ui which looks better the launcher options here have rounded icons and that's not all the color over stock apps have updated uis for example check out the new file manager which has a more visual info of the storage left the new calculator app is also cleaner as it does not list out all the options up front the color as browser 2 has a new improved ui i especially like the most simple approach to these options even the phone manager app looks better with two tabs now one for scanning and the other one for tools overall i think color os 12 makes color os look a lot better more refined i like the clean more flatter ui all around now coloros 12 as you guys know is based on the latest android 12 update and i like the fact that all of the useful android 12 features are present here first of all wallpaper theming from android 12 is supported here in the personalizations page there's this colors option where you can set the colors to wallpaper color picking now you can either choose the colors manually like this from the wallpaper or let the phone handle it so here i am setting this wallpaper and see how the accent colors in the quick settings the settings page changes here's another wallpaper that i'm setting and yeah it changes again as you can see now apart from this there are android privacy features there's privacy dashboard which shows you when and how many times apps are taking up your location camera and mic android 12's privacy indicators for camera mic and location are also here you can also now give apps approximate location rather than precise location which is a very handy feature there are also quick settings toggles to kill mic access as well as camera access so floating windows aka flexible windows has been present in color over since a long time but you know what color of s2l makes it way better thanks to a lot of new gestures first up you can still open apps in a floating window with the sidebar but now you can just hold an app like this and bring it to the top and release it to open it in a mini floating window like this and now you can also resize this windows by dragging from the corner like this pretty cool right you can also hide a window on the left edge or the right edge and access the window later i think this can be pretty handy now another cool thing is the ability to select files in a window and drag and drop to other apps like this yeah these floating window features are awesome the sidebar is another color os feature that has been present since quite some time but with color os 12 it's getting better first up it's now called smart sidebar and that's because it will not bring you apps and tools based on your usage so if you're someone who opens up say netflix at around 10 pm every day the sidebar will have netflix on it at this time so you can quickly launch it apart from this it has a translate feature which uses google translate to quickly translate whatever's on your screen it also has the background streaming support so when you play a video say on youtube it lets you run its audio in the background even when the phone is locked this is great for non-premium youtube users first of all the photos app has a new ui that looks clean nice like the other color os 12 apps but i like the new options oboe has added see when you open the app for the first time it now asks you if you want the newer photos at the bottom or at the top apart from that there's a new option in the settings that lets you remove privacy info of photos before sharing you can remove the geolocation tag of photos and you can even remove details like phone model aperture shutter speed etc there's also an option now to get these quick access buttons for videos favorites locations etc in the main page now this is actually a feature that lets you calibrate the display or an open smartphone based on your color vision the option i'm talking about is color vision enhancement where you can use this personalized option to take a color vision test that looks like this this requires you to arrange the colors by tapping the color that looks the closest to the last one and after you've done this the colors in the ui will be adjusted based on your color vision now this is a tool that's aimed at people with color blindness but it's pretty interesting the color 12 is not just about the looks or the new features it brings some really good performance improvements too first of all there is ai system booster which is said to reduce the memory usage by 30 tone down the background bar consumption by 20 and increase battery life by 12 there's also a new anti-aging feature which is said to ensure that a color os-12 device will operate as good as new even after three years now these are things that one could only test in the long term so i'll reserve my charger overall those are all the new color as well features and changes and i personally like this new update i mean i especially like the new cleaner more sorted ui and i also like the new features and the fact that brings all of the useful android 12 features
