[Music] oh [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bboom.com and when xiaomi unveiled the meat 10t and the meat10t pro in india i was actually quite excited to get hands on those devices because i thought in india the price was very very good i mean indians generally are inclined towards budget flagships in the 30 to 40k price segment and with one plus going upwards of 40k i think the meat nt and the meat nt pro could be like the budget flagships of 2020. well this is the meat and tea pro and while this is not a review this seems like a very balanced flagship phone so far but there's one thing that could either make or break this phone so this is the new me 10 t pro and i'm sure you've guessed what i'm talking about and i know you guys are probably aware of the specs too but how does the meat n t pro compare to the meat 10 check it out so there's a 6.67 inch lcd display with a 144hz refresh rate on the meat10t pro and a 90hz amoled on the me10 both of them have the same snapdragon 865 with 5g lpddr5 ram but the mi 10t pro has the faster ufs 3.1 storage as for the cameras both have the same main cameras 108 megapixel f 1.7 sensor with ois and the same 13 megapixel ultra wide angle lens but the mi 10 t pro actually has the higher resolution five megapixel macro lens and it does not have the practically useless two megapixel depth sensor now when it comes to the battery the meat nd pro has a slightly bigger battery and slightly faster charging but the mi 10 has wireless charging support and the meat and tea pro does not so these are the differences and considering the price gap i think the one big difference between these two me flagships is the discipline the fact that the m10 t pro has an ips lcd display i know it's a 140 four hours display but let's face it amoled is amoled i prefer amoled and a majority of people prefer amoled over ips lcds so why exactly did xiaomi put in an ips lcd in the meat nt pro well i recently came across this interview on tech radar where xiaomi's product marketing manager said this about the meat nt pro it's better to have a high quality lcd the best of the best lcd versus a middling sort of ammo so basically he means that xiaomi has used a very good lcd panel on the mi 10t pro so i honestly wanted to check how good is this display how does it compare to say an amoled display now i have two phones with amd displays right now the oneplus 8t and the galaxy s20 fe both of these have 120 hertz amoled so refresh rate wise 120 hertz versus 144hz isn't exactly a big difference so it all boils down to the display quality well i did three tests to check the display quality first i did a brightness test i turned off the auto brightness in all of three phones maxed out the brightness on all of them now as you can see the meter and t pro is actually the brightest of them i also wanted to see how dim they go because good displays generally get very dim for better viewing at night and turns out the mi 10 t-pro also gets the dimmest so this lcd display is actually pretty good having said that the major advantages of amarillo lie on the fact that they have more range when it comes to the colors and contrast ratio so i played some videos on all these phones to notice some difference now here's a nice vibrant video playing on all three phones and as you can see the mi 10t pro isn't lacking when it comes to the colors to be honest an ips lcd can't match the contrast and the blacks of amoled but when it comes to colors and the overall picture quality i think the me 10 t pro's display does very well that's not all i even compared the lcd on the meat and t pro to the lcd on the budgetish poco x3 to see the difference and yeah the meat and t pro display is actually better it's brighter as you can see in the shot and it's also slightly more color accurate and has better colors so the meat and the pro display is actually very good i mean like i said amoled is amoled but i think this is actually a very good lcd panel obviously it can't match amoled but it's not like you're using a cheap lcd panel on your flagship phone plus the 144hz refresh rate means the display is very smooth and responsive now one thing i did want to mention is that like the mate 10 the mi 10t pro is again quite a hefty phone see the size and weight of the mi 10 was like the biggest issue i had with the phone and it kind of remains on the meat and d pro 2. here's a comparison of the meat 10 t pro size and weight with the 80 and s20 fe and you can see that the meat and tea pro is heftier and also thicker honestly xiaomi i really want to know why you guys aren't making compact and sleek phones give this video a like if you agree with me anyway the rest of the me 10 t pro is actually pretty good i mean the size and weight apart i like how the phone looks when it's clean and shiny and does not have a thousand fingerprints on it and well it does look very premium as for the performance there's been no lag or stutter so far and the cameras are really good here are some photos from the phone and they look very good i mean the mate 10 did beat the oneplus 8 in a camera comparison video so with the mate 10 d pro featuring the same main camera the performance should be very good as you can see in these photos it does seem actually pretty good so overall i think the meat and tea pro is a very balanced budget flagship of 20 20. be it when it comes to price or beat when it comes to specs but yeah these were kind of my first thoughts on the phone and i'll be testing things like camera the battery and more in the next few days so let's see how it goes anyway i'd love to know your thoughts on the mi 10t pro and do you want us to review this phone tell us in the
