[Music] this is the new oppo renault 7 pro 5g that is just launched in india and i know what you're thinking what's new what are the new upgrades let's check it out so the new render 7 pro like most renaults in the past brings a new design first interesting design element is this yes the camera bump has this light surrounding it oppo calls it the orbit breathing light and this is actually interesting the light is kind of subtle soft not very bright so it does not look too flashy or in your face but it is noticeable and i think also useful this is sort of a breathing light that lights up when you get a call text or any other notification and also when the phone is charging do you guys want other manufacturers to bring a notification light like this drop your thoughts in the comments down below now these are the options for the breathing light and as for any battery implications it's a very subtle light but battery performance something i'll have to check also it only has this one color and i really hope opel brings support for proper rgb so that you can customize different lights for different notifications anyway the back has the oppo glow shimmering effect and this new pattern oppa has used a new ldi tech to etch the pattern here giving the back a really brushed matte finish i also like its black weighted which is a proper matte black phone the renault 7 pro also has good in and feel it is lightweight and it's very sleek and you must have noticed the flat edges that we also saw on the rhino 6. other points to note the renaissance pro has no microsd slot just this dual sim slot the fingerprint scanner is on the front in the screen and if you're wondering there's no ip rating or wireless charging support one new addition to the design is stereo speakers there's one speaker at the bottom right here and there's one speaker in the earpiece now this is good because the renault 6 pro did not have this so i'm glad oppa brought it in the render 7 pro 3d speakers means that the music and video experience on the 907 pro is good and that's also because the display is also pretty nice i like that there's no weird chain here the bezels are kind of unified and i like the display quality it's vibrated sharp as you'd expect on amoled and i would have liked 120 hertz but 90hz feels smooth too coming to the render 7 pro's cameras the front camera is actually interesting it's the first phone to bring the sony imx 709 sensor on the front which has rgb w which means white pixels which in turn means more light can be captured in low light situations it is also said to capture less noise and take clearer shots and it has dol hdr support which captures two photos at the same time a long exposure one and a short exposure one for better details and better backgrounds now we have seen this tech in rear cameras but it's interesting in the front camera because i took selfies with the renaissance pro in harsh backlight conditions and it always managed to capture details on the face as well as in the background when i was taking these selfies the background was always overexposed in the viewfinder the imax 709 also takes brighter shots in low light i haven't compared the renault 7 pro with any other phone but the shots are definitely bright and sharp in low light i also notice that the front camera switches from 85 degrees to a 90 degree angle when it detects more than one person one complaint i have here is that with a capable front camera like this they should have added 4k video recording support on the front anyway here are the rear camera specs with the imx 766 sensor headlighting things and all the cool camera features like the portrait mode where you can change the aperture the ai highlight video which now has better color tuning the dual video feature will let you use the front and the real camera at the same time there's also bokeh flair portrait which takes shots like this yeah it's pretty cool and there's also bokeh flair support in videos now here's a video from the usual video mode and here's a video in the same location with bokeh flame mode on see the difference the effect in the bokeh flame mode is pretty cool no doubt and i like it works in both daytime and low light now cool camera features apart the camera performance seems pretty good in most of the photos i've taken so far most photos look high quality beat in daytime or even in low light which is not surprising considering it's the imx 766 which we have seen perform well in other phones moving on the render 7 pro also brings good hardware specs as you can see here now i know you're wondering what's new in the demand city 1200 max well it's the same powerful mediatek demonstrated 1200 but the max version is a custom chip designed by mediatek and oppo for the renault 7 pro to bring features like aipq for better hdr visuals and aird blur for clearer selfies apart from that it's the same and that's fine i mean the renault 7 pro is a very snappy phone in my brief usage and i've used other dimension 1200 phones so the performance should be good in the long run bgmr fans the phone supports hdr ultra and smooth extreme graphics and the gaming performance in my usage so far has been top notch on the software front there is color of s12 and if you want to know all about its features you can check out a video from the card above as a pre-installed app there are quite a lot of them as you can see but most of them can be uninstalled one thing that's surprising here is the color os 12 on the renaissance pro is based on android 11 and not android 12. lastly these are the battery specs of the phone and the 65w super book charger is pretty fast it can take the phone from 10 to 100 in around 30 minutes which is actually great apart from that we asked you if you had any questions on this phone on instagram yeah follow us already if you haven't because you can get in your questions too so i think i've answered most of the questions but there are a few that i haven't so let me just answer them really quickly first up software updates so oppo has confirmed that the renault series will get two major android updates and four years of security patches the next question is is it metal in glass well the frame here is metal aluminium and the back is glass carrier aggregation support so i checked and the renault 7 pro does support it in fact as you can see it sports 4ca which is just really good is there any thermal throttling well i ran the cpu throttling test a couple of times on this phone and these were the results so as you can see it's not a problem also if you're wondering about the 5g bands the renault 7 pro has 11 5g bands now before i conclude things i know some of you guys also want to know about the opportunity seven this is the phone and also has some pretty good specs with amoled dimension 965 for charging and like the render 7 pro it's a very sleek and nice phone coming to the conclusion the oppo renault 7 pro 5g is actually a pretty solid phone with some really interesting features see the orbit breathing light is a really cool take on the notification lights and i like the upgrades from the previous genre beat the stereo speakers the new front camera the upgraded rear camera as well as the design so the phone looks pretty balanced now i don't know the price of the phone at the time of shooting this video and i think the price will give us a more clear idea so let's wait for that i will be adding the price of the renault 7 pro in the comments as well so make
