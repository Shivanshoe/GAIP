[Music] so [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from viewer.com and this is the new one plus not c that recently launched in india and this is a phone that i've been using for almost a week now as my daily driver and i was actually quite liking this phone but then the price dropped and i was like what the well that's when our direction for this video changed i mean the one plus not ce starts in india rupees 24 triple nine yeah there is a 22 triple line variant as well but let's not count that because that's not coming anytime soon so yeah 25k it is now at that price the biggest and i think the only usp of this phone is the oneplus oxygen os experience look first of all it's clear that oxygen os is no longer as stock as stock android but it's still way better than the likes of one touch os or miui or real me ui when it comes to the overall experience i mean let's do a simple bloatware analysis so this is a screen recording of the north seas app drawer when i first set it up without any accounts or data and as you can see there's only one third-party app netflix pre-installed and this is pretty good because almost every single phone comes with amazon facebook along with netflix so basically the oneplus nazi only has one bloatware app in comparison the ico z3 has 10 bloatware apps the meat and i has four broadway apps and the realme x7 max has five bloatware apps as you can see so that was interesting but now let's see how many unnecessary manufacturer apps these phones have so the oneplus not c has cloud service community oneplus store and oneplus switch four apps now i'm not taking into account the apps like clock weather gallery voice recorder file manager because these are basic apps that every phone has now to compare things the ico z3 has 10 unnecessary apps from ico the meat and i has eight of these apps that are part of miui and the x7 max has 15 of these apps from real me that's a lot now it's not just bloatware the oxygen os experience on the nazi is clean all round there are no weird permissions or ads or recommendations since the oneplus not c has the cleanest android experience in this price segment and that's definitely good but let's look at the other side see along with great experience value for money is also very important i mean at 25k there are a few things you expect from every phone and that's where i feel oneplus has made some cost cuttings to give you an idea the oneplus not series eight plus 128gb variant is priced at rs2409 and if you take a look at the first one plus not its 664 gb variant was also priced the same 24 triple nine now i know 128 gb in not c is better than not 64 gb especially when there's no micro sd slot but everything else about the nazi is a downgrade so the nazi is slightly slimmer and lighter than the knot it's not a big difference but it comes with a plastic back and plastic frame the nod on the other hand has a more premium gorilla glass 5 back also one more important thing the nazi does not come with the iconic one plus alert slider the nod has it both the phones do not have stereo speakers and both have a 90 hertz amoled panel and quality device seem to be the same but the not c does not have any screen protection the not on the other hand has gorilla glass 5. the not c comes with a snapdragon 750 g which is a good chipset no doubt but the nod comes with snapdragon 765 g which is the more powerful chipset i mean the 750g is good too but 765g has higher clock cpus faster gpu and it's a 7 nanometer chipset apart from that the north c has a 64 megapixel omnivision sensor and the node has a 48 megapixel sony imx 586 sensor now mega pixels don't really matter and sony sensors are generally better but one important difference between these cameras is that the nazi does not have ois i mean ois is an important feature because it helps in stable videos as well as low light shots and yeah that's missing in not see the nazi also lacks the ultra wide front camera that not has moving on the nozzy does have the bigger battery but the chargers are the same in both the phones look overall if you take a look at this comparison the nozzy clearly has some big cost cuttings when compared to the original oneplus not now honestly i would have been okay with the north seas compromises but for the one wrong decision oneplus has made i'm talking about the wrong pricing now think about it oneplus not c starting rupees 1999 we'd say the eight plus 128 gb variant costing 21 triple nine now that would be great pricing right i mean at this price this could have been a very different phone i mean this is the phone that brings a great software experience that i just talked about and i've been using this phone and the performance is very consistent with the 750g the phone does have a plastic build but the matte finish looks good i'll give it that it's also the right size and weight also i've been using the cameras which aren't extraordinary but the photos range from decent to good i mean check out a couple of shots from the phone yeah it's not perfect but i like the dynamic range and the natural colors because a lot of phones in this price segment just over saturate things the battery performance is good too i got a screen on time of seven and a half hours on light usage which is crazy and six hours on medium to heavy usage which is excellent see the point is the oneplus naught c isn't exactly a bad smartphone it's a phone with bad pricing at 25k oneplus is basically replacing the nod with the nord ce especially since node is out of stock everywhere with amazon oneplus.com but the problem is at 25k i kind of expect a phone to have things like stereo speakers a glass protection at least a more premium design also i don't like the fact that the nord c just has this one 5g band in india whereas the european weight into the phone has 12 5g bands that's a huge difference look of late oneplus seems to be going on a wrong track the oneplus 9 and 9 pro have had overheating issues the oneplus watch wasn't a success and now there's the case of the oneplus not ce and its pricing well i personally think that oneplus needs to go back to its basics it needs to bring phones that are actually value for money i mean oneplus already has a very powerful weapon in the form of oxygen os which is important because the biggest issue with mid-range smartphones in india is the software experience so clearly oneplus has a huge opportunity in this mid-range segment in india and it's important that they focus on bringing phones that have the perfect balance when it comes to features software experience and the price i mean i just hope the upcoming oneplus note 2 has this perfect balance
