the oneplus note 2t is in india and i know everyone's been saying that this is basically the same as the oneplus note 2 it's the same phone the truth is it's not this is not the oneplus note 2. honestly i'm really confused why oneplus has not this phone but first let's take a look at what has changed in the oneplus 2t look there are basically four differences the not two t's back now has a matte finish the processor is the density 1300 instead of the 1200 the not 2t comes with oxygen os 12 on android 12 and there's a faster 80 watt charger that's pretty much it and yeah these changes are not substantial in fact there's one big problem with this phone i mean the density 1300 looks like the biggest change in this phone right but when i checked its specs it's basically the same dimension 1200 with the mediatek hyper engine 5.0 tech instead of hyper engine 3.0 now if you don't know hyper engine is said to bring gaming related enhancements but is it a big deal not really the benchmarks of these two chipsets is almost the same too as you can see in this course so there's no real difference in terms of performance and the diminishing 1300 is basically the dimensional 1200 but with worst throttling performance at least in the note 2t in this test you can see the note 2 going well with the graph in the green and the 2t is already throttling it's going red which is not something i've seen in phones in this segment so 2t is throttling bad and when i check the temperature it's not actually too hot it's around 40 41 degrees which is kind of fine the north 2 on the other hand is actually hot at 44 45 degrees but it's not throttling the performance this makes me think that the oneplus not 2ts performance is capped to make sure it does not heat up too much because i've done this test multiple times and the moment this phone hits 40 degrees the phone starts throttle the performance to lower the temperature yeah the throttling here is bad this is kind of strange because oneplus has another one plus not 2t in europe and i have read some of the reviews and there's no mention of any throttling issues so maybe oneplus has capped the performance only in the indian unit i mean think about it not two's blowing up reports have only come from india so maybe one person to make sure that the not 2t does fine in the hot indian climate another change from the not2 is faster charging and it is faster but only by a couple of minutes i mean the battery remains the same but there is now an 80 watt super hook charger in the box the same charger that you get with the oneplus 10 pro now the 80 watt charger isn't exactly crazy fast both the 65 watt and 80 watt charger take the not duty and the not two to fifty percent in ten minutes yes it's the same and the two t is actually slightly faster two hundred percent reaching there in 27 minutes but it's only a difference of three minutes so like the new demand city 1300 the 80 watt charger isn't exactly a big upgrade now like i said the back has also changed it's a matte finished gorilla glass 5 back and i think this feels and looks nice very similar to the nine rt's matte black finish but i'm not a big fan of this camera model especially these big rings with tiny little cameras in them i do like the fact that the alert slider is still here thankfully everything else is the same as the oneplus note 2 there are stereo speakers but there's no micro sd slot no headphone jack and there's no ip 18. look if you ask me the only real actual upgrade in the oneplus note 2t is the fact that it comes with the oxygen os 12.1 on top of android 12.1 which is basically the latest software i mean here's the oxygen os 12.1 in action and there's no bloatware here no ads and as for updates oneplus has promised two major android updates and three years of security patches so basically these are all the changes that the north2t brings the display specs remain the same and this is a good display but the problem is every other phone in this price range offers a 120 hertz amoled while the 2t still has the same 90 hertz refreshing it's also said to be hdr10 plus support but i did not notice hdr support in the netflix app the cameras to remain the same in terms of specs and when i compare the photos from the not 2t versus the not 2 i did not see any major difference whatsoever be it in daytime or low light yeah the photos look kind of the same video quality is the same too but strangely i saw this weird jerk issue on the north duties video just look closely and you'll say too other than that it's all the same the front camera still stuck to 1080p videos so it's created the oneplus not 2d is not an upgrade over the oneplus note 2. i mean whenever a oneplus t phone launched in the past be the oneplus 5t 60 70 or 80 they brought significant improvements there is nothing like that in the oneplus not 2t this is basically oneplus trying to fix not those problems with the 2d honestly there is only one good reason why oneplus has launched this the oneplus not 2 was a good phone but there was a lot of negativity around it with reports of multiple phones blowing up this might have affected the sales so oneplus went ahead and relaunched the same phone with the fresh air around it the problem though is that in trying to maybe fix the heating issues they've created throttling issues on the oneplus not 2t and yeah this was just unexpected see it's been almost a year since the oneplus note 2 launched and i just wish that oneplus would have skipped this phone and instead not the oneplus note 3 with a bang do you guys agree with me on this hit like if you do and comment down your opinions in the comment section down below also subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos and
