[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bio.com and it's that time of the year again google i o is going on and that means a brand new android version aka the android 12 this year now the new android 12 update is all about the three big changes so i'm going to divide this video into three the new ui the privacy and the new features well i have the android 12 beta 1 build installed on my pixel 4 here so let's get started with the ui so first up let me make it clear that android 12 is by far the biggest revamp of android since lollipop amino 12 brings what google is calling the material uui and this ui is all about the more dynamic elements cool animations more rounded corners etc now the big change you'll notice first up is the new notification shade and quick settings panel honestly the quick settings here reminds me of miui but that's not a bad thing i think it looks better than your usual icons that we've come to expect from android quick settings anyway so the notifications now have rounded corners with app icons on the left more prominent and it shows you the number of notifications from an app in a better manner and the snooze notification option is now available right here now below the notifications are the two buttons for the notification history which looks good and manage there's also no support for multiple media players here as you can see swiping down brings the quick settings panel and you get these three options at the bottom the option to edit the toggles in quick settings switch or add user accounts and lastly settings the power menu is supposed to come here but it's not here in this first beat a bit anyway you get the new settings toggles in a new two-row design with the thick brightness toggle on the top now it's not just the luke's android 12 is also bringing a couple of very useful new toggles there are two kill switch toggles for camera and mic which will just disable them for any app there are also new toggles coming for google pay and home control but yeah they're not part of this build the lock screen has changed too it now shows you the weather details with a nice little lichen and i think it looks modern and very bold when you don't have any notifications whatsoever yep you get this huge clock on the lock screen which hopefully will be customizable in the future this is a thick new volume ui which i'm not a fan of but i've heard that this isn't fine another new change i've noticed is in the pixel launcher well it's the option to get app suggestions on the bottom row aka the dock of the home screen now these suggestions like the ones in the app drawer we've seen will change according to your usage and time so yeah maybe handy now like always there's also the brand new settings page which makes me feel like i've increased the phone size other than that it is when you are inspired with the whole one-handed focus ui and it looks good now talking about one-handed usage there's also a new one-handed mode which is very very similar to ios reachability feature so i can just swipe down at the bottom and the whole ui kind of comes down like this for better access to the top ui elements now it's a little clunky in the beta build but yeah this is how it works and works everywhere even third-party apps apart from these ui changes there are new animations almost everywhere first up there's this new pattern ripple effect which i really don't like just take a look at this yeah it kind of looks like a glitch to me anyway i do like the other cool animations for example this charging animation yeah i like how it smoothly goes from the bottom to the top i also like the smooth screen off and screen or animation i mean i like how the screen dims from the corner apart from that there are new animations almost everywhere for example in the app drawer see this yeah that is cool now obviously the big material you feature is the wallpaper based theming 7012 will create a theme based on the colors in your wallpaper it'll detect the dominant colors and the complementary ones and then create a theme that will extend to the whole ui beat buttons pages keyboard even third-party apps and also the new more dynamic widgets yep android 12 is also bringing a widget revamp in a sort of follow-up to ios's widgets but yeah both of these features aren't present in this build so let's wait and watch now moving on to the second big change in android 12 it's the privacy related changes so under 12 is going to bring a lot of privacy features and a lot of them remind me of ios i mean i've already talked about the new kill switch to disable the camera and microphone access but there's a whole lot more first android 12 brings private compute core which will be a separate partition in the os that will store personal info gathered from features like now playing smart replies etc on the device itself android 12 is also bringing a new privacy dashboard as you can see which will show you the number of times apps have accessed the camera mic and location in the last 24 hours it'll also show you this timeline of which apps have access these permissions and when android also brings the much-loved privacy indicators similar to ios so you'll get these icons when an app is using the camera or the mic also you can now give apps your approximate location as you can see this is available in this beta bin and yeah you can enable or disable precise location for specific apps now that's not all android 12 will also bring you these small pop-ups when you copy something to show you that the clipboard is being used now one ios feature that's still missing in android 12 is the whole app tracking permission which i think is a big deal so hopefully we'll see it in the final stable android 12 build now part of the ui and the privacy the third big thing of android 12 is obviously the new features now first up there's a super cool new fade audio transition when switching audio between apps listen to this yes it's true but the least we can do is protect also i got this when i first opened up the play store app install optimization which is basically google noting how you're using new apps now the good news is you can turn this off in the play store settings there's also a new accessibility menu floating icon which can be more convenient for some than the button shortcut now there are a lot of other new features that's not part of this beta but it's coming in android twin there's scrolling screenshots the new log folder feature in google photos a game mode and game toolbar which will let you see fps optimized gaming performance etc smart auto rotate which uses a face for more accurate screen rotation app hibernation where unused apps will be for stopped and their temporary data will be cleared so obviously a lot of these features in android 12 that we will see later on also if you're wondering google says android 12 brings improved performance it's set to reduce cpu time by 22 while improving power efficiency by 15 look overall this is my sort of first look and my very early thoughts on android 12 and yes there are new features but the focus obviously is on the ui and when the first beta does not bring in all the ui changes the theming but if you ask me i like android 12 so far i mean the last ui revamp came in 2014 with lollipop so yes it's high time and it got a big visual update and android 12 brings exactly that well i want to know what you guys think of the latest android 12 update tell us in the comment section
