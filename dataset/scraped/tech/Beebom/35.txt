everyone has been hoping that the mediatek dementia 9000 will be that one flagship chipset that fixes all the issues we have with the snapdragon 8gen1 but is it the truth [Music] this is the redmi k50 pro with the new mediatek dimension 9000 chipset and i'm gonna put it against the agent one to find out which is the best android flagship chipset right now first let's take a look at the specs now these are very similar chipsets when it comes to cpu but the gpu is different the 9000 has higher clock speeds bigger cache and even though both are built using a four nanometer architecture one is made by tsmc and one by samsung there are also differences in camera features display specs etc now the specs are fine but let's get to the point let's talk about the benchmarks which will give us a pretty good idea of the dimension 9000's performance so here's the add to the score of the redmi k50 pro the s22 ultra with agent 1 and also the h30 pro with hn1 yeah i'll be comparing two agent one phones with the k50 pro anyway you can see that in android 2 both chipsets are fairly comparable the dimension 9000 beats the edge and one in the s22 ultra on the gpu front and it beats the h30 pro on the cpu front now here are the geekbench scores and this time you can see that the higher clock cpus on the tendency 9000 do make a difference it beats the scores of both the agent one phones beat single core or multi-core and it does that quite easily really now here are the pc mark scores and once again the dimension 9000 scores higher so from the benchmarks it looks like the dimension 9000 has a faster cpu i mean i also noticed the redmi k50 pro finish the geekbench runs faster than the agent one phones and i also did a video encoding test where i converted the same one minute 30 seconds 8k 24 fps video to 1080p 30 fps on all three phones and the demonstry 9000 phone was the first to finish up the h30 pro was second and the s32 ultra was super slow kind of strangely so the cpu is faster but i also ran some gpu benchmarks on these phones and the agent one seems to have a slightly powerful gpu here's the 3dmark wildlife score of all three phones and you can see the agent one scoring a lot higher here's a 3d mark wildlife extreme test and in this test it's a lot closer but again the h30 pro with the snapdragon agent one is the best so cpu demand city 9000 gpu agent one anyway the big question is thermal throttling and things kind of get interesting here so as you guys know the dimension 9000 is built using the tsmc 4 nanometer process while the snapdragon 8gen1 is built using the samsung 4 nanometer process now tsmc is rated higher when it comes to throttling and battery efficiency but when i tested things out on the dimension 9000 things were slightly different at least in throttling so here's the first cpu throttling test 20 threads 15 minutes and as you can see the dimension 9000 started throttling quite a lot very early as you can see from the graph the end result was 56 percent and it's not like this happened one time i did a 15 minute test again too and again the redmi k50 pro throttled the most the remnants in 9000 did better in the 50 threads 30 minutes test but it once again throttled quite a lot in the 100 threads 1r test i know a lot of phones struggle in this test and the agent one phones have done similarly but a lot of people are hoping that the dimension 9000 would be better here but it's not the case the throttling performance is similar to the agent one one thing to note though in all these tests the dimension 9000 mostly had the best performance numbers so like i said it clearly has a more powerful cpu i also tried to do an antutu throttling test running and to do consecutively so i plan to do 10 antutu runs on the go but in the second round itself the k50 pro got the overheating prompt and virtually became unusable yeah it was very surprising and the temperatures were also high around 47 48 degrees i also did a gpu throttling test here i am running the 3d mark wildlife test 10 times on all three phones consecutively and this is the first score of the phones and after the last test this was the score so all of them throttled to get to a similar score overall it's clear that the dimension 9000 isn't better than the snapdragon agen one when it comes to throttling now one area with the defensive 9000 is clearly better than the agent one is battery efficiency i mean tsmc is known for better battery efficiency and it showed in our tests the redmi k50 pro and the s22 ultra have a 5000 image battery and the h30 pro has a 4800mah battery so i started the cpu throttling test with all the phones 100 and after all the three tests that we usually do the battery drain on the k50 pro was the least the s22 ultra dropped to 61 battery the h30 pro dropped to 56 battery and the k50 pro dropped to 67 so yeah it's pretty good i also did a geekbench throttling test where i ran the geekbench 5 benchmark 10 times on the trot and there was no throttling issues in this test i mean this is the first score and this is the last call but i noticed that the k50 pro only dropped to 92 percent while the s20 developer dropped to 85 and h30 pro dropped to 83 yeah that is a massive difference i did another real world test we played bgmi on all three phones around 15 minutes with the display brightness set to max graphics setting set to hd and high on all the phones now we started with all the phones set to 100 and at the end of the game play the k50 pro was at 91 percent yeah just lost nine percent battery the s1a2 ultra was at 82 and the h30 pro was at 86 percent so one thing is for sure the dimension 9000 is definitely more battery efficient than the hm1 which is kind of a big deal also to let you know i did not find any overheating issues in the redmi k50 pro i mean there was this one time where it went to 47 degrees as you guys saw but apart from that it was usually normal i mean i checked the temperature of the redmi k50 pro when the 100 threads test was ending and it was around 42 degrees i also checked things after the bjmi test and the phone was around 37 degrees so yeah it's fine now you must have noticed that we are playing bgmi on the redmi k50 pro and the other phones on hd and high because that's the maximum that dementia 9000 supports right now so check this out the maximum graphics the dimension 9000 currently supports is hd and high and even if i switch to smooth graphics there's no support for higher frame rates i know this is probably because phones with d9000 haven't launched globally and bgmi is india specific but the problem is i checked in pubg mobile which is available in china and it too has the same max graphics hd and high smooth and high i also noticed the same in pubg news state too agent one supports max frame rates and ultra graphics in pubg new state while dominicity 9000 right now supports very high frame rates and high graphics this is not the case in all games though demand city 9000 supports the same high graphics as the agent one in games like cod mobile and even in the super intensive junction impact apart from this a lot of people have doubts on mediatek chipsets in general when it comes to custom roms gcam mods but this phone hasn't launched in india or globally so can't judge that right now it's time for the verdict now demensity 9000 versus snapdragon 8gen 1 which is the better flagship android chipset look i think the winner is the mediatek demand city 9000 although the margin is quite thin if you ask me i mean the mediatek density 9000 is slightly more powerful when it comes to cpu the gpu on the agent one is slightly faster again not a big difference but the big deal is that a lot of people have been complaining about the agent one's battery issues and the density 9000 fixes that the battery performance is a lot better no doubts one problem the agent one it does not fix is throttling i'd want to test another demonstry 9000 phone before making a final opinion judgment on the dimension 9000 but if the redmi k50 pro is any indication it's very similar to the agent one when it comes to throttling another area where i'm a little skeptical about the dimension 9000 is game optimizations bgmi pubg are super popular games and on a flagship chipset like this you don't want to play on low frame rates the bottom line is the mediatek demand city 9000 is good and i like that mediatek is finally competing with qualcomm on the flagship and it's good news for future android smartphones but if you're expecting the dimension 9000 to be the ultimate best android flagship chipset it's not but i want to know your opinion on this comment down below also give this video like if you liked our
