let me start by saying that i'm not a big fan of what xiaomi has done with poco i mean poco started with a bang with the poco f1 but after that it's been all about rebranded smartphones weird marketing strategies buggy updates but recently poco launched this the poco f4 5g and this phone got my attention so this is the phone and let me make it clear that this too is a rebrand of redmi phone the redmi k50 but this looks like a value for money phone that people are interested in so i've been using it as my daily driver and i'm going to tell you if you should buy this phone or wait for the nothing phone one let me tell you straight away that the poco f5 is actually a good solid all-around smartphone but there are a couple of things in this phone that don't really make a very very good impression one of those things is the design the first thing that came into my mind when i saw this phone is that the glass back and the plastic frame with the flat sides kind of reminds me of the xiaomi 11i i know the two-step camera module looks a bit different but this color and finish kind of give off the same one i personally like that this matte finish is not a fingerprint magnet the chin is fairly small and the pancho camera is small too but if you ask me the design kind of looks bland to me i know i know the looks are subjective but my problem with this design is that this is a big and wide phone and the sharp flat edges don't exactly make things comfortable when holding this phone i mean yeah it's not exactly bad but things could have been better when it comes to handiness anyway the fingerprint scanner is in the power button and it's fast but yeah i would have liked an in-screen sensor better this phone is also ip53 rated like most xiaomi phones these days and that makes it splash resistant i did use it in the open with some light rain and it was fine another thing i like is the steel speakers here these speakers are loud and the quality is decent too similar to other phones in this segment now i think you already know this but this phone does not have a headphone jack and there's also no micro sd slot now there are two things in this phone that i like without any doubts the display and the performance the display specs are the same as the older and very popular mi 11x but unlike a lot of phones which have so called hdr support that does not show up anywhere this actually has proper hdr10 plus and dolby vision support there is all my vision spot in the netflix app hdr 10 support in the prime video app and you know what support shows and movies look fantastic on the screen honestly this screen is something i've absolutely enjoyed using in the last few days i even watched the last episode of the boys on this and that fight scene looks incredible this is also 120hz display and mostly things are smooth especially while scrolling but i did feel some jitter in some apps for example in the play store there was some weird stutter when scrolling and i feel this is due to the phone not switching between 120hz and 60hz smoothly i see this because other than this minor issue this phone actually brings top notch performance i mean you know the specs 870 lpddr5 ram ufs 3.1 storage and these picks are good but more importantly the reinward performance of this phone is pretty good too now benchmarks are in line with the snapdragon 817 this phone does not have any weird throttling issues and even though the foam does get warm and sometimes hot in these tests especially in a hot climate i did not get any of the me why overheating pop-ups and when i checked the temperature was fine so it's okay benchmarks and tests apart more importantly i did not find the phone to get crazy hot in day to day usage or gaming this is all fine but when it comes to real world performance we all want our phones to not slow down when doing trivial tasks like launching an app or clicking a picture unlocking the phone and that's an area where the poco f4 passes the test this is the 8 128gb variant just to let you know and i have put in my sim card i've been using it as my daily driver and usually it's lag free experience i mean when i was using chrome whatsapp or any social media app or even when i was watching shots the phone runs smooth i also tested games obviously bgmi as well as apex legends both on the highest frame rate settings and the game performance is really good the screen is responsive things do not get laggy or sluggish and i think you will like gaming on this now do note that there were some frame drops here and there when gaming for long hours but that's not a deal breaker if you ask me performance is good no doubt but the software is one area where xiaomi needs to do better yes this phone has miui 13 and on address of two os updates and yes there is the annoying glass lock screen which i turned off there's also the bloatware but these are things we already knew about miui what i don't like about miui 13 and this phone is that there are no android 12 features no android 12 widgets not even the redesigned widgets pane no wallpaper theming no privacy dashboard i mean honestly you wouldn't even notice if this phone came with android 11 because the miui feature set remains the same it is strange because other manufacturers are at least incorporating latest android features in their ui skins so it's strange why xiaomi can't do the same i really hope that at least there's good custom rom support in this phone another thing to note is that poker is giving two years of warranty with this phone which is good fine but i think poco needs to work on quality more i mean for quite some time we've been hearing about a lot of bugs in pocophones like cameras breaking motherboard issues and whatnot look nobody likes to go to the service center so yeah extended warranty is good but i really hope oh god xiaomi focus on the quality control part of their phones more moving on the cameras are not necessarily the highlight in poco phones but the f4 does have a 64 megapixel omnivision sensor with ois and it does take a good shot i've been taking a lot of photos in both daytime and low light and the photos are actually good colors are mostly accurate the dynamic range has been good and the details although not the best are good enough i mean i took some comparison shots with the h30 and daytime photos up kind of similar but in low light the poco f4 photos are definitely more pleasing especially with the colors the h3 does have the brighter shots and more detail but i prefer the poco f4 photos videos in daytime are pretty good with good stability thanks to ois and i also like the phone supports 4k 60fps videos but this is not the phone for low light videos because they come out really noisy the front camera is good too although i don't like that the phone is limited to 1080p videos now selfies are generally nice and sharp but the details are kind of lacking and i feel it's a bit over sharpened also here's a video from the front camera to give you an idea about the front camera video quality and the mic quality and if you're enjoying this video so far make sure to hit like when it comes to battery life the battery let's face it is not the largest out there and i'd say the battery life is decent too good on heavy usage with a lot of benchmarks throttling tests gaming and whatnot i got a screen on time for around five hours with the battery barely lasting a day on regular usage with some browsing some casual gaming some camera usage some match streaming i got a screen on time of around five and a half hours and the phone lasted for a day so yeah it's decent to good the charging speed with the 67 watt charge is pretty good the phone goes from zero to fifty percent in around 14 minutes and zero two hundred percent around 44 45 minutes in terms of calls and connectivity i did not find any issues with calling as well as network coverage in this phone and there's also support for cadet aggregation which is obviously good and in terms of 5g there are 10 5g bands which is good for future proofing and i also like that there's nfc and the ir sensor that you usually see in xiaomi phones now it's time for the big question should you buy the poco f4 which starts at piece 27 triple nine the answer is pretty simple see if you're okay with me ui and this design this big size and you want great game performance with a big bold display the poco f4 makes a lot of sense especially because it also brings fairly good camera performance basically it gets three big basics right having said that if you want a more handy phone and a phone that actually has android 12 features with a clean experience the h30 is a great option it does not have the best cameras or amazeballs battery but other than that i really like that phone apart from this i know the ico neo6 is also in the same price range with similar specs but again fun touch os although it does have a slightly bigger battery and faster charging lastly i know a lot of you guys are waiting for the nothing phone one honestly if you are looking for a phone with powerful performance powerful gaming then you shouldn't really wait because the poco f4 is the more powerful smartphone but if you're looking for a phone with a unique look and a better experience then you should wait for the nothing phone one and see what it brings anyway if you still have any questions on the poco f4 just comment down below and i'll be answering all your questions for the next one hour so comment down
