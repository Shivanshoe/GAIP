[Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bio.com and if you think about tablets there's only one name that universally comes into mind the ipad i mean yes there are samsung galaxy tablets out there but no matter what anyone tells you the ipads are what bring the best tablet experience but if you want to get an ipad you'll have to spend at least 27 to 30k which is not affordable for everyone and that's where budget tablets come in i mean if you ask me i've been waiting for xiaomi's me pads to arrive in india for a long long time now but that hasn't happened instead realme has launched its first tablet in india yes this is it this is the real me pad and this is priced rupees 16k if you consider the wi-fi plus lte variant and that's a pretty good price so yeah let's check out the real me pad so this is the new readme pad here's how it looks and i know there's the obvious ipad wide here with the same space gray sort of color aluminium back and frame honestly i like this design and i want to thank realme for not using the dare to leave text on this tablet because you know it's very simple i just don't like it i mean who likes it hit like if you agree well this is clean and minimal and much better looking anyway when it comes to tablets the weight is very important and this is very lightweight the readme pad weighs 440 grams which is pretty good for a 10.4 inch tablet and comparatively the galaxy tab a7 weighs 476 grams so yeah this is lighter as for the thickness this is also pretty slim at 6.9 millimeters thickness and apart from that there's a headphone jack here as you can see and you get the power button on the top and the volume rockers on the right when the tablet is imported more now all that is cool but if you ask me there are three most important factors when you consider a tablet for the display the performance and the experience so starting off with the display of the readme pad you can see the display specs here but in my usage i'll be clear it's not the best lcd i've ever seen but if you ask me i think it's pretty decent for a tablet at this price the colors look good it's pretty vibrant it's fairly sharp and the brightness is a little low but i did not feel it was a problem but yeah one thing to note is that the viewing angles are fairly average the moment you look at this display from an angle you can see the display sort of dimming fading out so yeah that's something we know now right apart i've been using the real pad to watch a lot of netflix youtube disney plus and the bigger screen is just great to watch movies and shows if you're wondering yes the tablet has wi-fi level license so there's no hd issues anywhere apart from that the dmd pad screen does get dirty quite easily with fingerprint smudges as you can see and one key thing here is that there's no gorilla glass i mean realme has said that it's using some sort of display protection and our realme pad does not have any major scratches so far but there's no good in the glass so i'll suggest you to be a little more careful with it so overall i'd say the display is good for the price and the good thing is it is also responsive and i've used a lot of budget tablets in the past and a lot of them have unresponsive displays which is not a problem here now another thing you should note is that there's no stylus support here officially and to tell you straight away there's also no keyboard cover keyboard case as well apart from the display i really want to talk about the speakers here because i think really has not cut any corners here so there are four speakers here two plus two on the opposite sides and there's dolby atmos and adaptive sound support now the speakers are something i like see i'll give an idea these quad speakers are decently loud not crazy loud but what really impressed me is the quality it's pretty crisp and clear and i did get to hear a little bit of bass in these speakers which is always a nice thing here listen to this [Applause] [Applause] now the next big factor in a tablet is performance so here are the specs and personally i would have liked a more powerful mediatek chipset or a snapdragon chipset because that would have made the really bad an ultimate deal anyway you guys pretty much know all about the g80 chipset on this tablet so i'm not going to go into the details of the g80 chipset but if you ask me about its performance on this tablet i'd say so far it's been fairly smooth and good see the g80 chipset is not a high performance or gaming chipset as a lot of companies claim it to be but for day to day usage regular usage it's fairly good i mean here's the readme pad in action and if you notice me just doing random things in the ui there's no lag or anything in fact in my usual day-to-day usage involving youtube chrome netflix etc the real me pad has been fairly smooth and responsive which is good because i'm generally very skeptical of the helio g80 now the tablet does start to struggle a bit if you really push it but it's not like the performance is bad here as for gaming the g80 handles casual games pretty well but i know you guys want to know about bgmi now i did play some bgmi on the tablet and the max graphics settings here are hd and high but at hd and high there are a few fame drops so i switched to smooth and ultra and the performance was much better i mean let me tell you this way i did not enjoy playing bgm on the standard because i'm not used to the big size of this thing but yeah it's playable if you really want i mean i'll still recommend this tablet only for casual games and i think you should keep your bgmi expectations in check but like i said you can still play it okay so the third big factor in tablets is the experience and the experience on the readme pad is fairly plain and simple which is a good thing or bad thing depending on what you want so this comes with real me ui for pad on top of android 11 but this ui is basically stock android with a few changes here and there first of all there's no bloatware whatsoever which is awesome i mean it's really good as you can see there's absolutely nothing not even facebook these are the apps that the tablet comes with you do get a few kids apps like youtube kids and there's support for google keep space which is basically a whole separate launcher for a kids account and it looks like this so the kids space is actually fun and colorful and that's great but when it comes to a tablet experience on this real me pad it's nothing special see the whole ui here is basically the phone ui expanded for the tablet i mean the split screen multitasking works better because it's a bigger screen but i would have liked the gesture to quickly snap a full screen app to the site instead you have to do it from the app switcher which is not very seamless apart from that you get the same navigation gestures for home reasons and back but weirdly you cannot switch between apps quickly by swiping left or right you have to open up the multitasking screen and switch apps from here now everything else is pretty simple too this is the home screen and the launcher here is stock android aosp launcher not even real me us launches so not a lot of options present the notification shade is the same and that works but even the settings app where i expected a dual pane ui looks the same as it does on a phone so overall it's a pretty simple ui and some apps do change the ui based on the bigger screen for example chrome looks like the desktop version of chrome and it's better to use on the bigger screen but most apps look like their phone versions expat now apart from all of this a lot of people are looking at tablets for video calls but the readme pad has an 8 megapixel 108 degree wide camera on the front and although it's not the best camera quality wise but for video calls it does the job it looks fairly crisp and nice and when it comes to microphones they're dual mics here and here's how this up hey guys this right here is a video from the readme pads front camera and i'm just testing out the mic but i think the video point is fine although the exposure changing is a bit weird as for the my quality i think the sound is pretty crisp and clear although there is a bit of noise coming in so let me know what you think of the dual mag mics in the readme pad in the comments down below there's also a single lonely camera on the back an 8 megapixel camera which again is just a pretty average camera that won't be good enough for you when it comes to photos but it's fine because not many people take photos from the tablets now cameras apart this is a wi-fi plus 4g lte tablet and that means there is a dual sim slot which is actually a dual sim plus micro sd hybrid slot which supports up to 1 tb of storage now i've used this tablet with a sim card and it works perfectly fine the tablet comes with the phone app so you can make and receive calls although you look weird doing it and it only makes calls in speaker mode so it's not very bright but that apart the network coverage has been fine in my use so far but one thing to note here is that there's no carrier aggregation support so you probably won't get the best speeds or coverage other key specs of the reading pad include a 7100 mah battery with support for reverse charging and there's an 18 watt quick charger in the box i mean real me's phones come with 65 watt or at least 30 watt charges in this price range so maybe they could have gone with a faster charge anyways for the battery performance i'm yet to you know really test things out note things down so i'm gonna comment on that later but it's a decently sized battery so i'm positive look the point is i've used the readme pad briefly and i feel it's a pretty simple yet solid tablet at rupees 16k i mean let me get this straight this is not a perfect device so i would have liked a faster chipset a more tablet friendly ui and a lot of the things on the tablet are plain decentish but overall this gets a lot of things right it has a good premium built-in design the display is good enough for the price the speakers are actually fantastic the cameras seem to work well for video calls and you'll be okay with the performance if you don't expect high end performance or gaming look there aren't a lot of tablet options in this price range and that's what makes the real me pad a good option well those are my thoughts on the brand new realme pad but i'd love to know your comments on this so make
