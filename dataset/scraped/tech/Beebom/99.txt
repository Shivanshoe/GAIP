[Applause] hey guys this is bashobium.com and if you've been keeping track we have made some really cool videos on alexa the alexa smart home setup and more but you know what today i'll be focusing more on lx i'll be talking about how to use alexa like a pro now before we get started i'd suggest you to turn off the mic on your elixir device because i'll be using the a word a lot so first up as you can see i'm using the echo.4gen and the first thing anybody should do after getting an echo is set up some routines now you probably know about routines like i am home which turns on all the lights in your house play some music extra but there are some other unique routines you should create for a cooler smart home experience one really handy routine i have set up with alexa is that when guests arrive at my home alexa tells them the wi-fi password because let's face it anyone who arrives at your home asks for the wi-fi password first up so i can just say welcome the guests hello the wi-fi password is akshay is the best without spaces anyway it's very simple to set up you can just set it up in the routines page where you can set the voice command and the action under alexa says another handy routine i've set is dinners ready which announces to everyone in the house that the dinner is ready here's how it works alexa dinner is ready announcing [Music] from rupaceous second echo dot it is food time so our routines are cool especially if you create personalized ones for you now apart from routines one thing that you really need to use when it comes to alexa is alexa skills now i know there are a lot of alexa skills out there and i think you probably know about the popular ones but i'm gonna tell you the alexa skills that i have been using so first up i'm using this remember aka memory palace skill which as the name says make sure you can trust alexa with something you'll probably forget so what i do is whenever i keep an important document at a specific place or my key somewhere i ask alexa to remember it alexa open memory palace hi you can ask me to remember your things remember that my passport is in my drawer i will remember that your passport is in your drawer i know travel passport have become kind of a dream but when i will need the passport in say 2050 i'll be able to ask alexa about it alexa ask memory palace where is my passport your passport is in drone so yeah this works and i think this is very handy and i think everyone should make this a habit because i know how frustrating things can get when you don't find something that you really need the next alexa skill i'm using is just watch which solves a big problem for me and i think you will relate to this problem i'm pretty sure you've thought of watching a movie or a show but you don't know where it's available so you check out different platforms one by one and it's really annoying now this is what just what solves check it out alexa ask just watch search for shaysha in india shasha 2021 movie is available on amazon prime video next up is not an alexa skill but an alexa feature that i find super handy so you probably know that you can set up reminders in the alexa app right well did you know that you can set up multiple reminders as well as recurring reminders in alexa to give you an idea i have created these reminders for my mother because she always forgets to take her medications on time and these are reminders that go off daily at the specified time so when it's 10 am alexa reminds her to take the meds like this [Music] here's your reminder take morning medication so this is actually useful and it's also even more useful if you have a dog at home now with this you can set a reminder to feed your dog so that even when you're not at home somebody else has an idea of when and what to feed the dog now usefulness apart time for a fun skill and one skill that i've really enjoyed is the amitabh bachchan celebrity voice kit see this skill is available for 99 rupees and this enables the amig wake word which means the echo dot lights up with amidji check this out amiji how's the weather what's the weather let's find out together i know all about atmospheric pressure right now in new delhi is 12 degrees celsius with clear skins today's forecast has partly sunny weather with a high of 15 degrees and a low of 80 degrees yeah that voice makes everything better foreign turn on the lights okay now the lights are at my home but i have checked and this works anyway there are a lot of other fun commands like this one amiji good night good night now that was fun but moving on from skills i also use a couple of if triple t recipes to control a few phone functions from alexa so there's this mute your phone with alexa recipe that i've enabled and that means even when my phone is away i can say alexa trigger mute my phone and that's it my phone will be quickly muted i can also do the opposite if you're wondering alexa trigger unmute my phone lastly one feature i use in alexa is voice profiles i mean in the family there are multiple members and it's important that alexa recognizes them individually so as to not mix up the news reminders etc so what you can do here is go to alexa settings your profile and then add your voice profile now mine is already added as you can see but you can do this for different members of your family just make sure to choose the name or add it via the i am someone else option when setting up the alex app first up well those are all the cool things that i'm doing with alexa apart from obviously controlling my smart home and i know there are a lot of new alexa features that i did not talk about because i think you know them already anyway there are a lot of other alexa skills a lot of other cool alexa routine ideas so make sure to comment down below what you are using so that everyone knows also give this video a like make sure to share it subscribe to our channel for more
