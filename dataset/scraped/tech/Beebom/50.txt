if you ride with me you can slide with me if you feel like 550 on the fast sticky come get high with me that's a deal right ride with me if you ride with me you can slide with me if you feel like 550 on the 5 sticky come get high with me that's a deal right [Music] this is the maybach gls 600 and this is the best car to start b-bombs auto journey because luxury car luxury tech and a luxury price tag now this is an insanely luxurious car just check this out [Music] yeah i can simply open the door and the running board automatically comes out it's super cool and this is especially useful for people like akshay because there's also an option to lower the car when someone is entering just about the maybach gls 600 is a car that's a beast when it comes to performance i mean the raw power is insane as you can see but this car is packed with luxury tech [Music] there's maybach mode off-road mode decliner seats with massages amazing driver features and a lot more trust me you will enjoy watching this video and after this video you'll be amazed with this car now let's start with my favorite feature the maybach mode this is the ultimate luxury experience the maybach mode uses the adaptive damping system along with the air suspension intelligently which lets every single wheel adjust to the road individually and that results in a smooth af experience especially in the back seat i mean in this mode the glas 600 just eats up bumps and speed breakers here's a video side by side of the car going over a speed breaker in maybach mode versus sports mode and you can see the difference and in maybach mode the experience of driving in indian roads is how do i put it amazeballs there were times i was driving at high speed and whenever i hit the brake before a bump i could feel the suspension adjust itself to smoothly soak in the bumps now this also works in high speed but there were times when i noticed that the car did not recognize the speed breakers probably because of poor marking and i was like oh oh now this is a proper luxury car and off-roading something i did not have in mind for this but mother of god it off-roads first of all when you put it to off-road mode it increases the height of the car to maintain the right ground clearance for off-roading and also lets you adjust the height of each wheel individually which is actually pretty cool i mean here's the car kind of off-roading and look how the suspension is working it's almost like the car is floating it's beautiful to watch in off-road mode there's also the free driving mode aka the jumping mode which i showed you at the start and this is meant to be used on sand snow or other loose surfaces or when you're stuck while off-roading but you know us this is how we used it like this video if you'd use it like this too there's also the curve mode which is actually useful in this mode when you take a fast turn the car adjusts its suspension and basically leans into the turn like a bike so you don't feel body roll and g4s in a big car like this we tried this and it actually works really well [Music] now when you think about mercedes the first thing that comes to mind is the back seat experience and here it meets stack which takes it to a whole another level let me just get to my comfort zone and explain what i'm talking about [Music] yeah never getting bored of that [Music] now you get proper recliner seats here as you can see [Music] and i really like these comfortable things because of the napa leather the soft cushioning and there's also a footrest [Music] now i like that all of this is electrically controlled you also get these displays in the rear two of the seats here and a samsung tablet in the center to control the music i can even change the ambient lighting to any color i want and i can turn on massages yes the seats even the front seats can give you proper massages there's so many options here back massages shoulder massages something called activating massage which kind of made me sleep yeah it's just so good in fact there's also a wave massage which pretty much massages all of you if you know what i mean i'm not kidding these seats are also ventilated seats with both heating and cooling and even the panels are heated if you want to be there's also electronically controlled sun blinds that is pretty cool and there's also a feature called energizing comfort which is basically a spa in your car [Music] and you can actually sleep in this car because the sound insulation is insanely good let me give you a feel so as you can see the endeavor is constantly honking at us and i can just close the windows and listen to this along with the comfort you also get the luxury features there's a fridge in the back technically for champagne and there are these holders for champagne glasses which are also called flutes you know in our exclusive maybach community and it's not just comfort the media experience on the maybach glitch 600 is actually again on another level just listen to the speakers [Music] the car has a 26 speaker sound system from burmester and it is super duper impressive i mean the sound is really good and nice there's even surround sound but what's cool is this vip mode where you can choose a seat and speakers focus all the sound on that seat it's a very cool experience moving on the driver's seat now there are two displays this is the infotainment system and you get all the usual features as you can see now one thing to note there's android auto and carplay support but weirdly there's no wireless support for them which is strange because this is an affordable car if you know what i mean you also get this multi-information display which is actually cool it has the maybach rose gold theme and it's totally customizable you can choose whatever info you want in these dials and in the center or you can go full screen with one feature like say the maps or the trip [Music] look there are a lot more features in this car the boot lures with the button like this the light effects are super cool especially this maybach logo projection there's also support for the mercedes me app which lets you control everything in the car from your phone now we did not have access to it but yeah it sounds very cool [Music] see i've never really driven a luxury car unless you count the bellino but my experience with the maybach gls 600 has been mind blowing i mean i'm not going to go into the hole is it worth 2.5 crores 3 crores because anyone buying this car would not really care about the price but if i had to sum up my experience i'd call this practically a great combo of luxury and tech i mean this car looks presidential the attention to detail is just amazing the driving experience of the maybach mode is just smooth and beautiful something i've never really experienced before and the comfort features are just out of the world so like i said at the start this is the best car to start
