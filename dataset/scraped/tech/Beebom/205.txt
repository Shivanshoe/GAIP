[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the page from v1.com and after all the wait i've finally gotten hands on the new micromax smartphones this is the micromax in note 1 and i know there's a lot of hype around this phone because the price to specs ratio seems pretty good so let's not waste any more time let's check out the in-note one and first let's check out what's in this box so here's the in note 1 box and inside you get the 18 watt charging adapter the usb to usbc cable the sim ejector tool some manuals and that's it there's no case or anything else anyway moving on to the phone itself there are two things that caught my attention when i first unboxed this now first is obviously this this flashy back with the x pattern i mean this is a plastic bag and it's fine for a phone at this price if you ask me i personally like the more subtle white variant the phone but i understand a lot of people will like this now the second thing i noticed first up is that this is quite a big phone i know it looks pretty usual in the photos but in the hand it does feel kind of big as for the weight it weighs in 195 drops so i wouldn't call this hefty but yeah anyway this big design makes way for a bigger screen this is a 6.6 inch ips lcd 1080p display with the punch hole design so it's a modern looking display and i like that micromax went with full hd unlike some makers who put hd displays in this price range plus the display looks good so far it's only been a couple of days but the display seems bright enough and it's vibrant so it's good so far as for any screen protection there's no gorilla glass here but micromax says there's some sort of hardened glass here and i'll be using this phone for the next few days so i'll see if it gets scratched pretty easily now apart from this another thing to note is that the phone does not have the wide wine l1 license required for hd playback and apps like netflix and prime video see youtube videos play fine at 720p or 1080p as you can see but there's no hd support in netflix you can only play videos in sd so yeah that's kind of an issue now coming to the design though it's got all the functionality you can expect a fingerprint scanner on the back which has been fast enough in my brief usage a dedicated google assistant key which is a nice touch the headphone jack usb c port and the single speaker at the bottom which i found to be very loud and decent quality wise there's also triple slot for two sims and a micro sd card so yes everything is kind of covered now along with the design another thing i was really interested to check out in the new micromax in smartphones is the software experience because i think that's going to be the big highlight of these phones so the 8.1 brings an almost stock android experience i say almost because there are a few changes and editions here and there but it's mostly stock android and it's a very clean experience i mean there's absolutely no ads and there's no bloatware whatsoever this is the app drawer in the phone out of the box and as you can see there are a few basic apps like gallery micromax's camera app fm radio sound recorder sim toolkit and that's it there's no third party apps here not even facebook the usual suspect so this is actually impressive and i like it as for these apps they are fine except for gallery so this is the gallery app right here and this is actually the same gallery app that we used to get in 2014 2015 or even older phones yeah this is honestly outdated a bit nostalgic but also outdated it's not a big deal because a lot of people use google photos and that's a pretty good gallery app but yeah micromax should update this now talk about the few additions to stock android it's android 10 here although 11 would have been nicer anyways some of the things look a little different like the quick settings page but it's not a big deal i also noticed this set of gestures here that you can use in the phone there's also this dual speed feature which is basically a booster feature from mediatek and there's a user guide in case you need it apart from that there's also face unlock here which works fine so yeah these editions are okay and honestly i like the software experience on the note one especially with micromax promising two years of updates so yeah solder experience is definitely the usb as of the specs i think you already know it the helio g85 the 4gb ram 64 or 128gb emmc storage so yeah good specs for the price definitely i've used the g85 in other phones and it's not a hardcore gaming chipset and at this price i think it's good and good enough for most things but yes i'm obviously testing out the phone and i'll be able to get a better idea on the performance later on anyway the camera specs are also pretty good for the price of 48 megapixel main camera 5 megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a couple of mandatory 2 megapixel lenses but you know what even the 2 megapixel lenses are fine because it shows that micromax wants to compete as for the features you get the usual set portrait mode night mode hdr aic detection pro mod etc in the camera which does seem a little clunky but it'll do as for the photos here are some of the shots i've taken so far and it's too early to judge but i feel like the main camera does a good job when there's good lighting yes there's some over processing at times in the trees but mostly the photos so far have looked good when the light goes down there's some struggles similar to a lot of other phones in the budget segment but i think the photos from the main camera are overall decent to good enough as for the 5 megapixel ultra wide angle lens here are some shots from it and honestly it has me a little doubtful so far because the photos let's put it this way they don't seem that good the details go away and the photos look a bit faded to me so yeah when it comes to videos there's 1080p video recording support and here's a 1080p video from the phone which i feel is plain okay because you can see the sudden exposure changes the stability isn't that good and the whole video has an over sharpened look as for the front camera it's a 16 megapixel sensor and here are some selfies from the phone and i think it does a decent job so no problems here overall so far i found the main camera to be fairly good all around but i'm not so sure about the other cameras but yeah i'll be testing things out more moving on on the battery front you get a 5000 image battery and from my use so far i think the battery performance should hold up very good as for the charging you get this 18 watt charger in the box which should be decently fast so again no problems here and yeah there's reverse charging support so you can use this phone as a power bank too lastly when it comes to connectivity there's 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi support dual volte and voice over wi-fi support bluetooth 5.0 and it has the whole bunch of usual sensors as well now coming to the pricing i think you guys already know the price the micromax in note one starts at a piece ten triple nine and let me make this clear that this is not my review these are kind of my first thoughts on the phone and if you ask me so far i think the micro max 8 note 1 seems like a pretty good well-rounded phone for the price the design is decent the display looks good so far and the fact that it has a bloatware free ad free stock android experience is a big deal because at this price you either get the specs or you get the stock android experience not the best of both worlds so that's good but i think i'll have a better idea of the cam performance once i've compared it to other phones from xiaomi and realme also the long-term performance the software optimization these are things that i will get clarity on once i've used the phone for at least a week so yeah i'm going to keep testing out the in note one and you know find
