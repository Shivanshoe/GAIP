um hey guys this is paige from beyond.com and asus recently launched this in india the brand new rog virus s17 2021 edition and this is a high-end premium gaming laptop that costs almost three lakh rupees yup three lakh rupees now that's obviously expensive so what does this bring for the price what are the specs well let's take a look at the new rog zapirus s70 so this is the new zephyrus s 17 2021 but first up if you guys remember the 2020 edition of the a17 was also a fantastic high-end gaming laptop but it was not perfect it had no lan port no webcam and it had this weird keyboard and trackpad placement well the new rog z5s s17 fixes all of that while bringing in so many upgrades everywhere else so many top of the line features so you know what let's divide this video into two parts the two most important aspects in the gaming laptop number one the hardware aka the cpu gpu thermals number two the design aka the display the keyboard the ports etc so starting off with the hardware the zapis s17 brings an upgrade everywhere like i said the laptop is powered by the powerful new 11 gen tiger lake series cpu core i9 one one nine double zero h to be more specific there's also the rtx 3080 laptop gpu with 16 gb ddr6 vram there's also 32 gigs of 3200 m ram with 16 gb soldered and 16 gb in an expandable slot there's also 2 tv of pcie gen 4 raid 0 ssd now these are great specs draw the line i mean i know a lot of people scoff at intel but this is a full power core i9 processor with eight cores 16 threads double l3 cache size pcie 4.0 bandwidth support and turbo boost max 3.0 which means the cpu can go up to 4.9 gigahertz now it won't beat the ryzen 9 in terms of efficiency because this is a 10 nanometer chipset and the amd chipset is a 7 nanometer one but apart from that i think it's on par when it comes to performance in demanding apps as well as gaming and that's where it matters the most especially in a gaming laptop like this the rtx 3080 laptop gpu here is powerful too i mean brings 140 watt of max graphics power with dynamic boost 2.0 which is awesome and this is at the end of the day at 30 series gpu from nvidia and that means it's built on the new ampere architecture and supports pcie gen 4 real-time ray tracing dlss 2.0 and nvidia reflex anyway this is a laptop that should handle pretty much everything beat intensive apps variating software triple a gaming titles but i focused on aaa gaming titles because you know that's more fun i mean i'm someone who's not a big pc gamer but the gaming performance on this laptop is so good that i've been gaming a lot in fact the truth is i've wasted a couple of days just gaming on this thing so i majorly played two titles hitman 3 and assassin's creed valhalla and the performance has been exceptional hitman 3 i played on 4k with the graphics set to ultra and the average fps was around 80 which is very very good and there was no lag no stutter when it comes to valhalla i played the game at ultra2 and the average fps was around 60 which is again great because this is an intensive aaa title now one thing to note here is that i generally spend 2-3 hours on the trot gaming and i found the thermal performance to be very good see the zafirus s17 also has asus upgraded as plus design which lifts up the keyboard here to an angle as you can see and this opens up a 12 millimeter air intake that increases airflow by almost 25 and also means that the laptop can you know intake more cooler air from above apart from this the laptop has four exhausts like this one for heat dissipation and each exhaust is lined up with ultra thin copper fins there are also six heat pipes that pull the heat from the cpu gpu and the vram and there's also two upgraded arc flow fans that you know have 84 custom blades and there's liquid metal compound from thermal grizzly to reduce the cpu temperature so that's a lot of things so asus has clearly focused a lot on the thermal performance in this gaming laptop and so far in my usage they seem to have gotten things very right so i noticed this panel below the screen going to 50 degrees and more but the keyboard the trackpad they remain fine which is very important because that means my gameplay was not happened with any heating issues as for the fans they are somewhat audible when you're gaming for long hours but i felt the fan noise was a little lower when compared to the last gen and overall it's much better than a lot of other gaming laptops out there now for anyone wondering there is armory grade with a number of operating modes so you can customize the performance according to your needs anyway let's talk about the second important factor in gaming laptops and that's the design and that's where i think asus has made some really nice changes in the zephyrus s17 2021 well this virus s 17 has the magnesium aluminium alloy body with diamond cut edges all round the lid also features this rg logo and this cut in between with this pattern on the other side and all of it i think looks really classy and premium now this finish is all around the laptop even the palm rest where there's also a sort of rubber finish which makes it very cool touch and by the way as you can see ages has moved to a more traditional keyboard and trackpad design which i think is the right move and you know what i love the upgraded keyboard here it's probably one of the best i've used on a windows laptop i mean the keyboard is an optical mechanical keyboard and the experience here is amazing made while typing or gaming and that's thanks to the tactile clicky feel and 1.9 millimeter of key travel now check out the layout and i like that all the keys are well spaced out they're full size even the arrow keys and they're all placed in the right location now one cool thing here is the volume wheel which is bigger and more responsive now and also has more functionality by default it changes the volume but you can press hold on it and change that you can use it for scrolling turning on or off mic changing the brightness of the screen and the keyboard use it to even switch between tasks so yeah this is pretty cool the keyboard also has perky rgb lighting as you must have noticed and there are different aura effects to choose from and the power button has a fingerprint scanner which is pretty fast as for the trackpad it's a large glass one with windows precision support and it's pretty good it's very responsive to gestures very accurate the clicks feels solid and it just you know is excellent overall now another important aspect when it comes to gaming laptops is the display and the rg fires seventeen gx703 comes in two display variants the one we have has a 17 inch ips anti-glare display with 4k usd resolution 120 hertz refresh rate and 3ms response time adaptive sync support 100 dci p3 pantone validation and dolby vision support now the other variant of this laptop comes with a qhd panel with the 165hz high refresh rate and it also has support for g-sync and advanced optimus so i think a lot of gamers might prefer that variant anyway the 4k 120 hertz panel on our unit looks great when it comes to picture quality it's obviously a very sharp and very well calibrated panel and i did notice that the colors look really good on this panel the contrast and viewing angles are also fairly good too and screen gets bright enough which is pretty good for a gaming laptop and as for the responsiveness the 120 hertz refresh rate makes sure that fast-paced games look crisp and smooth and yeah i noticed that in my gaming usage apart from that the display has very minimal bezels around the sides and the top but there is a webcam on the top here which is a good thing because the last version did not have that the chain is bigger but that's not a big deal then there's also this panel here below the keyboard that has the big status leds and this panel is visible even when you close the lid the chassis also has a set of six speakers powered by dolby atmos including four tweeters fighting upwards and two woofers fighting downwards there's also three mics for two-way ai noise cancellation as with the speaker quality the sound here is very clean even on higher volumes and i noticed a good amount of depth and bass which is pretty good but there's one thing i would have liked the speaker to be louder but overall above average speakers here then there are the ports the connectivity on the right you only have the sd card reader and a couple of usb a ports but the left is where the action is there's the charging port an hdmi port a lan port a usb a port a usb usbc port a usbc thunderbolt 4 port and a 3.5 mm audio and headphone jack as for the connectivity there's wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.2 support so yeah you're pretty much covered here lastly there's the battery there's a 90 watt battery with fast charging support and the laptop comes with a 280 watt power adapter that powers all the maxed out internals in the s17 and also charges the laptop from 0 to 50 in around half an hour also in case you're wondering there's also support for up to 100 watt usbc charging now asus claims that the 90 wattage battery in this laptop can last up to 13 hours on regular usage now that's obviously a bit too much i wouldn't expect that but it should be decent enough so that was a good look at the brand new rogs the fires s 17 20 21 edition and yeah i know this is an expensive flagship gaming laptop but clearly it has the specs the features the design to go with that three lakh price tag i mean asus has upgraded things all around i mean the full power core i9 plus rtx 3080 gpu makes up for a very powerful combo the design looks very premium all around and i like that asus has gone back to the traditional keyboard and trackpad design and also opted for a 4k usb panel this time while also bringing in a lan port a full-size sd card slot and a webcam which are all missing in the last gen s17 also the keyboard is now an optical mechanical one the speakers are upgraded and the battery is bigger so yes the new zephyrus s17 2021 does seem like an all-around high-end gaming laptop but what do you guys think of the newest 17 and the three lag price tag i want to know that so make sure to comment down below also this is very important give this video like if you enjoyed it make sure to share
