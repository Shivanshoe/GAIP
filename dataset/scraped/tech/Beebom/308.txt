[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys I am Akshay from Vavoom calm and by rubbish was in San Francisco for the galaxy s 20 launch we got a chance to check out the upcoming galaxy m31 so obviously I jumped on the opportunity I've used the galaxy m31 for a bit already and I thought why not share the first look of the phone with you guys but before we get started how about you hit the bell I came to get notified every time we post an awesome new video now that you've done that let's take a look at the galaxy m31 first up the display so we posted a tweet about the m31 a few days back and a lot of you were wondering if the rear mounted fingerprint scanner here meant that the phone will come with an IPS LCD display fortunately the answer is no this here is a stunning Super AMOLED panel which is great because well AMOLED panels are just better right I mean they have be black spongy colors great contrast the whole shebang and in my brief usage of the phone this display does look nice there's also the tear trough notch up front with the selfie camera that enables face unlock on the phone which is handy to have and the fingerprint scanner too seems to be decently fast what's even more impressive is that the galaxy m31 comes with a monster 6000 mAh battery yeah that is huge now I haven't really used the phone long enough to fully test out the battery here but come on it's 6000 mAh and I guess it should last a day a day and a half with ease also even with that massive 6000 mAh battery this phone it's pretty lightweight and that is pretty cool then there are the candles the galaxy m31 comes with a quad camera set up on the back with a 64 megapixel primary camera and ultra wide-angle camera a macro lens and a depth sensor thrown in for good measure well I took a couple of pictures with the phone so let's check them out take a look at this picture you must be thinking that this is probably a macro shot taken with the galaxy m31 and I don't blame you but let me show you a different perspective yeah that's the actual photo pretty cool right here's another picture and once again this is a zoomed in shot here's the actual picture clearly the 64 megapixel sensor here gets a lot of detail that's pretty great the 64 megapixel camera does get some good shots as you can see from these pictures and that's definitely nice I also took some ultra wide-angle shots as well as some macro shots with this phone and they look decent enough too I'm excited to test these cameras out more thoroughly over the next few days and I'll share my opinion on them in a first impressions video that we are working on like I said earlier I have only used the galaxy m31 for a short while but so far it looks like an interesting form the phone is launching on February 25th and we are expecting Samsung to price it somewhere under 15,000 rupees but it should be a decent price for the phone well that was your first look at the galaxy m31 so what do you think about this phone and about the 64 megapixel camera here let us know in the comments also give this video a like and share it with your friends lastly subscribe to a channel so you don't miss out on a galaxy m31 force impressions and all of our amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music]
