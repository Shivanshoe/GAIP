[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paigeboom.com and samsung frame tvs are something that have always excited me because they don't look like your usual tvs hanging on a wall they look like frame paintings or actual artworks so i was really excited when this came along this is the samsung frame tv 2021 edition so what's new in this new version what are the upgrades it brings well i'm gonna tell you all about it so let's start okay so this is the 55 inch frame tv in all its glory and this without any doubt looks absolutely beautiful on the wall now do note that this tv also comes with stands so you can actually set it up like this and what's cool is these stands are an upgrade and they're now height adjustable so you can even put in your sound bar or a flat gaming console like the xbox series s under the tv but you know what let's face it the frame tv deserves a wall yup it actually looks the best on a wall because this new 2021 version is just 25 millimeters thick which is almost close to how thick real-life art frames are i mean in comparison the previous gen frame tvs were around 45 millimeter sticks so this is almost half which is great because with the no gap wall mount it doesn't protrude much from the wall and it just looks more and more like art hanging on your wall oh and by the way you must have noticed this bezel with this wooden sort of finish right but this is actually samsung's swappable bezel and they are magnetic so you can just easily swap them like this now you can go with this stick wood bezel design or there's also modern white which i think would have looked even better in my house you can also go without any bezel for this black bezel look which i think looks cool in modern decors apart from that the frame tv comes with samsung's one connect box so it keeps things clean i mean it handles all the power and it has all the ports you need so there are four hdmi 2.1 ports with support for earc cc all of which means you can use the ps5 with it for the 4k 120hz experience there's also a lan port here an optical port av in and in along with a couple of usb a 2.0 ports on the side the bluetooth version has been updated to in this new frame tv there's bluetooth 5.2 and as for the wi-fi support there's 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi support so yeah you're pretty much covered the remote has gotten a really nice upgrade too this is the remote from the front and yeah it has this nice look and feel and all the features from the previous gen but what's super cool is that this is the new solar cell remote which does away with replaceable batteries all together now do note that this does not actually require the sunlight to charge i mean the solar cell tech make sure that it can be charged via your usual indoor lights as well so that's pretty awesome i mean there is a usb c port too if you want to charge it manually but yeah i don't think you'll require it now these upgrades are cool but the real highlight of the frame tv is obviously the art mode i mean that's the reason why people buy this tv so it's obvious that samsung has made some really nice upgrades first off art store has been upgraded with more artworks i mean there are arts from popular museums like van gogh and there are new cool artworks from sources like nava all of these are available with the membership which costs 2.99 per month or 2799 daily i also like that i can customize these artworks i can change the brightness and the color tone even set them to different mount styles and what's cool is that the tv now has a new brightness sensor which learns when you manually change the brightness and later on when the room's lighting conditions change it automatically adjusts green brightness as well as the color along with that there's also motion sensor which automatically turns on and turns off are more depending on any people around now another nice feature is the ability to use your own photos in place of the artworks so you can just use the smartthings app on your phone to send your photos to the frame create a collage and more for example here's our photo from youtube fan fest and i can also add different matte filters to it to give it a more artwork like feel now this is awesome and samsung has upgraded the storage for artworks from 500 mb to 6gb which means you can now store almost 1200 4k artworks so this is a good upgrade now all of the improvements to the art store and the art mode is kind of worth it because they look stunning on this led panel of the frame tv this here is a 55 inch qled panel with 100 color volume 120 hertz refresh rate and their support for hdr 10 plus hlg uhd dimming automotion plus a pqi of 3400 and more and for gamers there's free sync and variable refresh rate support also do note that the frame tv only offers 120 hertz refresh rate in its 55 inch models and above and yeah there's no dolby vision support anyway coming to the picture quality this q led panel on the new frame tv is actually an improvement over the last gen it's brighter at 600 nits and i also noticed better viewing angles now artworks obviously look amazing but it's a tv at the end of the day and i did use it as a tv and this panel looks great the blacks look great the contrast is outstanding as you'd expect from a q led panel now another big q led trade is great colors and that's very visible in this panel the colors just look great and i noticed the screen tones are mostly accurate which is something a lot of tvs struggle with see at the end of the day this is a high-end tv and the qled panel looks very good but i'll be honest with you i've only used the tv for a couple of days so don't take that as my final verdict but yeah so far looks really good as for the sound there are four speakers here capable of 40 watt sound output and the support for dolby digital plus but no dts or dolby atmos support now my brief uses the speakers here are very balanced and very clean even at higher volumes and the loudness here is decent and as for the base these are obviously tv speakers so don't expect extraordinary bass but they are decent enough for tv speakers now the frame tv is powered by the quantum processor 4k engine which handles all the video processing and brings cool ai features like the intelligent mode which basically recognizes usage patterns the surroundings around the tv be the distance of the wall or the lighting and then adapt the picture quality sound as well as volume now i personally haven't used it enough to see if it makes a difference but yeah all of that sounds cool moving on when it comes to smart tv experience the frame tv comes with samsung's design os platform and anyone who's ever used samsung tvs will be aware of this whole ui and all of its features like multi-view samsung tv plus smart things support etc anyway one thing new is support for multiple voice assistants you now have an option to choose from bixby alexa or google assistant which is pretty awesome for example i can select google assistant set it up via my phone and start using it on this tv as of the pre-installed apps there's samsung tv plus netflix prime video youtube apple tv plus samsung's browser and apps for google assistant and alexa and that's it now coming to the pricing here the samsung frame tv 2021 edition comes in four screen sizes a new 43 inch one 15 inch 55 inch and 65 inch and the pricing starts at rupees 61 990. anyway something's up i know a lot of people are fans of the samsung frame tv and with this 2021 edition samsung has actually made some really good upgrades all around i mean the basics of the frame tv remain the same but the design is now better the art mode is improved and there's new features there's a new solar remote the cool intelligence sensors support for google assistant and there's more so all in all the samsung frame tv 2021 brings some good changes all around but i want to know what you
