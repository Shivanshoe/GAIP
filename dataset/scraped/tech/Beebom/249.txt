[Applause] hey guys this is update from vmware.com and this is the new galaxy note 20 ultra and i know everyone's talking about this new color this new design and i get this looks beautiful but what i'm more interested in is the new features i mean the galaxy notes have always been great smartphones for professional users and the galaxy note 20 ultra brings new features that i think are very thoughtful especially during this lockdown season when all of us are using our phones for our work as well well let me just show you what i'm talking about so one of the key things that separate the galaxy note series from other flagships is obviously this oh it's actually on the left side now and i'm still getting used to it anyway this is the s pen and on the note 20 ultra it can do some really useful things first off the s pen is more responsive on the note 20 ultra as the latency is down to 9 milliseconds and that means writing on the new note with the s pen feels very natural and smooth here's a side-by-side comparison of me writing with the s pen on the note 10 plus and the note 20 ultra now i'm not sure you can see the difference in video but i did feel the writing on the note 20 ultra had a more paper pen feel because there are some really cool gestures on the s pen so that's amazing there are also new anywhere actions which kind of lets you use the s pen as a wand of sorts to do different things all you need to do is press the s pen button and do different gestures i wish there was an award of a button okay so as you can see you can do this gesture to use as the back button this gesture to go home from any app this one to open up the multitasking page this one to take a screenshot and this one to open up the camera quickly now all of these gestures are customizable in a sense that you can choose to start an s pen feature with these gestures or you know open an app so yeah you have the choice i would have liked an option to create my own gestures too but that's something we might see next thing now one new gesture that i actually think is very useful is this the ability to create a new note anywhere it's pretty simple i can just press hold the s pen button and double tap on the screen to create a new note be it inside any app any game or any page this should make note taking even faster so the aspen has improved but what makes ds pen even better on the note 20 ultra is the new updated notes app the new notes app brings features that make a lot of sense i mean there's a feature called voice notes replay which i'm going to talk about first and that seems very useful see what this does is it lets you do a voice recording while you are jotting down notes and once you're done you can play the note and listen to the discussion going around in real time here's an example so i have an opinion about the note 20 ultra so i can record that while writing down some notes the note 20 ultra is a brilliant flagship but in india the chipset is the same exynos 990 which is fine but honestly the 865 plus or an upgraded exynos 992 would have made the phone more appealing but that's just what i think now as you can see i've written down some notes while recording the voice and i can just play the recording and it highlights the text according to the voice note this is very handy also you can now straighten any text with just this button which is great because i can never write straight plus i like the fact that notes on the note 20 ultra are no longer stuck in the notes app you can now export any note as a word file powerpoint file or even a pdf file how awesome is that now you can also import pdf files and you can annotate on pdfs highlight things that you want to and most importantly you can sign any pdf document using the s pen i mean this is great because you don't need to take printouts to just do a signature so yeah notes are pretty noteworthy on the note 20 ultra not it one of the biggest problems of android devices is that they don't really work very closely with pcs or laptops like how close the iphones work with macs well microsoft and samsung have partnered to kind of fix that so with the note 20 ultra the link to windows and your phone feature on windows fixes a lot of the issues now i can just copy a text or link on the note 20 ultra and paste on my windows laptop and vice versa that's not all i can even run note 20 ultra apps on the laptop so i can open apps like instagram on the laptop and check out what's going on i can even pin apps to the taskbar for faster access right now you can only open one app at a time but come november there will be multiple app support which should make this even more useful so probably aware of the note 20 ultra camera specs which do seem pretty interesting on paper but i have been playing around with the note 20 ultra and i came across a new feature in the pro video mode that's actually handy as you can see there's a new mic option set to omni by default but with this you can change how the audio is recorded in your videos i mean generally when we shoot videos say vlogs from the phone the audio has a lot of noise but with this feature you can actually use your tws earphones as your mic so that your voice is you know more clear it's a very nice feature for pros and it should come in handy well here's an audio recorded from the galaxy note 20 ultras mic but thanks to the new audio control feature in the pro video i can record this by the galaxy buzz live so let's see now this is the audio from the galaxy birds live and this is more clear and crisp also more importantly this has less noise so that's pretty handy yes this is a pretty handy option apart from that i also like the fact that samsung has realized that the 100x zoom on the s20 ultra was kind of a gimmick i mean nobody was actually zooming into space so the note 20 ultra brings 50 x zoom support and i think this is closer to what's actually useful when it comes to zoom as for the rest of the cameras here are some shots from the note 20 ultra and in typical flagship fashion they look very good but if you're wondering how it compares against other flagships well that's something i'm here to test out so stay tuned so another big feature in the note 20 ultra is this beautiful display the phone comes with a 6.9 inch dynamic amoled qhd plus hdr 10 plus support display and there's 120 hertz support here now the display like any other display on a samsung flagship looks fantastic but the new here is the 120 hertz refresh rate on a note now strangely the phone does not let you lock the display to 120 hertz you can only choose it to be adaptive which is more like auto so the phone will crank up the refresh rates to 120 hertz wherever possible also 120 hertz is still something you can't use with a qhd plus resolution apart from that the note 24 feels super smooth and nice so that's good now there's one more thing when it comes to display on the note 20 ultra it's that it's the first phone to come with the new gorilla glass of victus aka gorilla glass 7 both on the front and the back now it's said to be better at resisting scratches and it's said to survive drops from 2 meters which is around 6 feet so yeah i tested it out so i dropped the galaxy note 20 ultra twice once from five feet and one from six feet screen down and well it has managed to survive with no scratches or anything so yeah that sounds pretty promising okay the samsung deck is the feature that turns any display to a sort of a pc with all the apps on your phone while your phone works as a track pad and keyboard well it sounds super handy especially during this time anyway with the note 20 ultra samsung dex can now work wirelessly so you can connect it to any tv or monitor but only if there's mirror car support now most android tvs these days only come with chrome cars built in and while i tried some apps to get miracast working on my tv apparently miracast has been disabled in android since audio so yeah i couldn't get it to work but if you have a fire tv stick those support mirror cars so you can get the wireless decks working with them anyway those were the new galaxy note 20 ultra features that are super exciting i personally like the new notes features a lot because those really make sense in this day and age anyway which is your favorite feature
