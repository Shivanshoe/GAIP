[Applause] [Music] hey guys i'm akshay from bomb.com and microsoft has been working on the new version of windows windows 10 x for quite a while now and the good news is a pretty much final build of windows 10x has leaked well i have it installed on this laptop here and it has quite a few changes there's a whole new ui a few new apps security improvements and a lot more so let's check out what's new with windows 10x before we talk about that i want to give a huge shout out to our sponsors for this video wondershare pdf element which i think is a great tool if you work with a lot of pdfs i mean it has all the important features you need you can edit pdfs add text in them watermarks images objects you can even crop pdf files this is also the ability to convert pdfs to other popular file formats like word excel html etc search for text ocr functionality and their support for batch processing with most features plus i like that pdf element works across devices with a single account be it windows mac ios or android there are a lot more features and it's much cheaper than adobe acrobat so check out pdf element from the link in the description below so this is windows 10x and let me make it very clear windows 10x is not an update for windows 10 devices in fact microsoft won't even release an iso file for it windows 10x is basically a separate platform designed to take on chrome os and it will only come with new devices anyway i have windows 10x running on an emulator here and even when i put it to full screen it still shows up like this so i'm gonna show it to you via screen recording okay so the biggest change i've noticed in windows 10 x is that everything is simplified first up the new setup experience is a big change it's cleaner and there's no annoying cortana voice control here which i'm really happy about and second the whole ui is cleaner and less cluttered let me show you so this is the new windows 10x desktop yeah this looks nothing like the windows 10 desktop there's this new taskbar with center line tiles you get an all new start menu here which also looks so much cleaner than windows 10 start menu see in windows 10 the start menu shows all these live tiles and just too much clutter but in 10x you get a clean layout with apps and a universal search bar up top which lets you search for apps files and even the web i really like this i've also noticed new cool animations you get this really cool animation when clicking on the start menu as well as on the app switcher plus app icons bounce when you minimize windows which is also a neat touch one thing i really like here is that on tablets you can swipe anywhere on the taskbar to open the start menu that's really important because the start menu is in the center now and that would be difficult to tap on for large touchscreen devices so yeah that's nice there's also the new action center with quick action tiles like do not disturb location rotation lock etc you will also see your notifications here and also control music and the volume apart from that you can drag apps to the left or the right edge to snap them and this way you can run apps side by side i mean there's no way to resize app windows right now and i don't think that's coming because there's only two buttons here minimize and close lastly on the ui front is the wallpapers so you get these two new wallpapers with windows 10x but it will reportedly also come with dynamic wallpapers similar to those in mac os as well so i am excited about that now apart from all the cool ui changes there's one thing i noticed see even though this windows 10x build is running on an emulator it's really smooth and responsive which is important because windows 10x is supposed to be a lightweight version of windows sort of like a chrome os competitor i mean sure this is a leak build so there are a few bugs but those will be ironed out by the time of release hopefully overall i think microsoft has done a remarkable job with the design here and i'm really happy to see a clutter free ui i mean it was one of my biggest complaints with windows 10 and windows 10x seems to have fixed it moving on let's take a look at apps so as you can see here edge is pre-installed and there's also this new files app here as you can see this is much cleaner than the file explorer in windows 10. it's less cluttered and looks better also as you can see there's only one drive showing in the files app here and that's because windows 10x is a web first os just like chrome os so all your files will be saved to onedrive you can connect external drives but there's no way to save files locally in windows 10x in fact you can't even create a local account in windows 10x it has to be a microsoft account apart from edge and the new files app here there's nothing but that's because windows 10x doesn't support x86 apps yet which means most of your desktop apps won't really work it only supports pwas and uwp apps from the windows store i mean here's the windows store which right now is kind of buggy on this build but yeah if you use apps from the store you will be fine apart from that you can install progressive web apps for example i can just open spotify on edge and then i can just add it as an app on windows 10x and i can even pin it to the taskbar if you're someone who wants to use traditional desktop apps on windows 10x well microsoft will be adding support for x86 apps in the future but there is a way right now see windows 10x does come with this remote desktop app to connect to windows 10 pcs and use legacy apps there if you absolutely need them now i know what you must be wondering wasn't windows 10x supposed to be for dual screen devices like the now delayed surface neo and yes you're right but microsoft has decided to first release 10x for regular clamshell laptops and the next year or so we'll finally get to see it in action on dual screen laptops folding laptops etc that said we have a pretty good idea of how windows 10x will look on dual screen devices thanks to microsoft's own emulator check this out so this is how windows 10x will look on a dual screen device you can rotate this in different orientations open app side by side and yeah it's a little buggy right now but you get the idea right i'm definitely excited to see windows 10x in action on dual screen laptops well that was all about design and visual updates but what about improvements under the hood well windows 10x has a lot of those too for example windows updates will be improved with windows 10x in fact you won't even notice windows getting updated for the most part windows will install the updates in the background exactly like chrome os and then a quick restart will get it all ready that's so cool because right now windows updates are a pain and i constantly try to ignore them then there's the security aspect as well i mean we all know windows laptops are very prone to getting viruses and malware etc i mean we all remember wannacry right anyway with windows 10x microsoft is making windows more secure unlike regular windows 10 versions where you have access to all files be it system files or os files etc windows 10x will keep users limited to a user partition and apps will be sandboxed in their own containers that means even if you do get a malware on your laptop it won't be able to access files outside of its sandbox and even if it does it will still be limited to the user partition which is great because your os files will remain safe at all times so yeah windows 10x definitely seems very interesting and it's clear that microsoft wants to take on chrome os with this it has a similar web focus approach a clean and minimal ui which honestly just looks way more streamlined compared to regular windows also so far i have found it to be quite responsive plus there are things like the new files app and faster updates see overall in my usage so far i think the windows 10x experience is very similar to chrome os i mean there's still a long way to go for windows 10x because app support is kind of lacking but i think we will get a better idea when we get hands-on with new devices running windows 10x laptops with windows 10x are expected to come out in april may 2021 so the wait won't be too long so yeah windows 10x is right around the corner but if you want to try it out right now we have a detailed guide on how to set it up so check it out anyway what do you think about windows 10x let us know in the comments also give this video a like and
