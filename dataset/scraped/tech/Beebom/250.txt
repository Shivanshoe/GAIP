[Music] dude [Music] hey guys this is bishopville.com and the brand new galaxy note 20 ultra is here and so is the galaxy z4 2 and so is the galaxy watch 3 but i i want to talk about this the new galaxy birds live now these recently arrived to us and honestly i found it to be more interesting than i thought it would be so what are you waiting for let's talk about the galaxy buds live uh no i'm not proposing to you i'm proposing to you maybe to hit the bell icon hit it okay so this right here is the galaxy birds live case and the galaxy birds live earbuds and this looks quite different i'm honestly bored of all the airpods clones so this is unique i mean i'm not much into jewelry but these do look like one in the ears anyway i'll be honest with you i did not quite like the new bean shaped design of the earbuds when the first renders leaked but in person these look much better and quite surprisingly and very importantly super comfortable now when i first took out the galaxy buds live out from the case i was confused on how to put these in but it's simple wing tips on the top that's what i remember so let me be frank the galaxy birds live have a design that's something new something unique and they go right inside your ear so when i was first wearing them i kind of felt a little weird but after a while they're so lightweight so snug i did not even notice they were there so that's good see these fit in perfectly in my ear and i gave these to a couple of more people to try and the buds life fit them perfectly too now honestly if you have very small ears tiniest to be honest then maybe these won't fit you but i don't have anyone here with tiny ass so wasn't able to check on that don't worry we'll get akshay to try these someday plus these just don't fall off i did the trademark b bomb head banging test and the earbuds never even got loose in my ears see i'm someone who does not really like the air paws or basically any other earbuds which don't have a silicon tip because no matter how much i try they just fall off or they don't fit in perfectly now whereas this the galaxy buds live they just fit in and they're super comfortable as well so i'm really impressed with the beam design that samsung has implemented here these buttons also pack in a lot of functionality and each of these buds has two contact points for charging and there's a wing tip around it for better fit oh and by the way there are a pair of bigger wing tips in the box so in case the buds don't fit your ears you can use them coming to the sound quality the galaxy buzz live has 12 millimeter drivers and a base duct on each bud and they are akg tuned and well if you ask me they sound powerful i mean i've used the galaxy buzz plus as well and these definitely have better audio quality these are louder the bass is very good and i like the sound quality here now i'm sure you know i'm no audiophile but i've enjoyed the sound quality on these earbuds as for the different sound modes the galaxy wearable app has different equalizer modes as you can see so you have options and you can also see the other big feature of these earbuds anc aka active noise cancellation now according to samsung the anc here does not completely tune you out of the surroundings instead it can cut down some noise while making sure you hear important announcements or when somebody talks to you but not everybody likes that but in my uses the anc on the galaxy birds live just does not make a big enough impact i know it's not supposed to totally tune me out of environment surroundings but in my usage there wasn't any big difference on rough i could hear the surroundings when it comes to latency or performance while gaming the birds live work fine for me i mean i did not come across any latency issues and in the samsung wearable app there's a gaming mode that's supposed to make things even better however this feature is only present with samsung phones on the oneplus note the app does not have this feature now even without the gaming mode i did not come across any latency issues but while playing on the knot i did notice that the galaxy buzz live have a few connection drops once in a while i mean i was gaming so the phone was close by but there were connection drops and brakes which were a little annoying i mean the galaxy bus live has bluetooth 5.0 and there were no connection drops whatsoever on the s20 ultra or the note 20 ultra so maybe it's a bug and hopefully samsung will fix this with an update apart from that the birds live also has a good mic setup there are three microphones on each butt one inside two outside and a voice pickup unit as well but this is me talking from the galaxy buzz live and i think the audio is pretty clear and let's compare it to the galaxy birds plus to see if there's a difference hey guys this is me talking from the galaxy birds plus and i think the audio quality from both these earphones is pretty similar and uh the galaxy buzz live does do a little more noise cancellation but it's very similar anyway talking about other features you get the usual touch controls along with an option to customize the press and hold there's an option to hear your notifications aloud and the support for bixby voice makeup and other bixby voice command features to be honest google assistant would have made way more sense here i mean who even uses bixby these days as for pairing it's pretty seamless you can just open up the case and on samsung phones you get this pop-up for fast connect on other phones you can pair these parts via the bluetooth settings in the traditional way but it's easy nonetheless i also noticed something really nice that the bird supports swift pair on windows so you can get this pop-up to pair quickly on windows laptops which is pretty awesome lastly there's the battery so the galaxy bird's live case has a 472 image battery while each of these earbuds have a 60 mah battery now i haven't noted the battery performance yet but with the anc and other samsung features turned on the earbuds are set to last 6 hours turn them off and they're supposed to last for around 8 hours with around 21 hours from the pretty compact case now the battery life is obviously nowhere close to the 10 11 hours mark of the galaxy birds plus but i think it's not too bad i think it's decent plus i like the fact that the case here supports wireless charging so charging is it pretty easy especially if you have samsung phone a high-end one look at the end of it all i'm not aware of the galaxy buds live india pricing right now and i think a more prolonged use would be fair to you know make a judgment but if you ask me personally i find these earbuds very compelling and that's mainly because of this new bean like design see the bean design of the galaxy birds live has paid off it's super comfortable very easy on the eyes and it fits plus i like the sound quality on these earbuds it's just the way i like it the microphones are pretty good too and the battery while not extraordinary it's decent enough now things aren't perfect active noise cancellation just does not have a big enough impact and i noticed some connectivity issues with non-samsung phones although this is something i'm gonna test with more phones so yep if you're planning to buy the galaxy birds live i'd say let's wait for the price because it all depends on which earphones it competes against well those are my thoughts on the new galaxy birds live and i'd love to know your opinion on the same so comment down below also our
