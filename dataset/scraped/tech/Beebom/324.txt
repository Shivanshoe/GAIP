[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys I'm moksha from b-bomb calm and well I am finally back from my road trip to China from where I got some cool car gadgets just kidding I didn't actually drive all the way to China but I do have some cool Xiaomi car gadgets to show us five of them actually so let's jump right in but before we do that how about you hit the bell like and to get notified every time we post an awesome new video now that you've done that let's get started first off I want to show you this really cool wireless car charger from Xiaomi I've been using this for quite some time and it's really amazing like the name suggests this is a wireless charger for your car but the coolest thing about it is that it comes with sensors that lets it do this yeah see that's cool right it's almost like that scene in Harry Potter where Harry says to his uncle it was like magic except this is an attic it's just sensors and motors doing their thing it can charge your phones wirelessly at up to 20 watts which isn't really something I could use on my iPhone thanks Apple but I did test it down on the galaxy s 10 II with suppose 15 what fast wireless charging and it went from 15 percent to 53 percent in just around 40 minutes which is pretty good what's more the charger uses USB C to connect to the car which is something I personally love and I also really like this blue LED light ring this just looks really cool to me the xiaomi wireless charger is priced at 169 new ones in China which is around 1700 rupees I don't know about you but I usually snack a lot when I'm driving it's just a lot of fun but it also means that there are crumbs everywhere if you are in the same boat as I will take this up this is the clean fly portable vacuum cleaner and I mean just look at it it's minimal it's matte grey it almost looks like something out of a Men in Black movie [Music] anyway it's not just cool looking it's also very useful you can easily clean your car with this vacuum cleaner thanks to a small design that lets it get into places a regular vacuum cleaner will have trouble getting into plus it comes with this brush attachment that's great for cleaning out the foot mats the vacuum cleaner charges through your car's charge a port in a round one in the hafez and lasts almost around 15 minutes more or less which is long enough to properly vacuum a small car like mine if you have a big car the 15-minute time might be a problem though the clean fly vacuum cleaner is priced at 199 yuan in China that's around 2,000 rupees which is an amazing price for this then there's this for a long time this thing was just kept at her office and everyone kept wondering what it could be I mean it looks really cool my best guess was like it was a smart because of some sort or maybe a walkie-talkie turns out it's a tire inflator yeah that's one cool looking tire inflator from Xiaomi now personally I've been using one from amazonbasics for a long time but this Xiaomi tire inflator just makes me want to steal it I mean look at it it's so small and perfectly portable true it charges over microUSB for some reason but it's downright adorable looking it's also very sturdy built so I can throw it in the trunk and not worry about breaking it it has a 2000 mAh battery inside with Xiaomi claims can inflate five car tires and one charge and it does easily inflate two to three tires in a single charge although I haven't used it too thoroughly there is one issue though it takes a very long time to inflate tires which can get annoying it's great for emergencies though and honestly that's what it's for it can also inflate balls bicycle tires and bike tires with preset recommended values similar to the vacuum cleaner this is also priced at 199 yuan in China which is rupees 2000 which is the same price as that amazonbasics inflator I have and that just makes me sad before we move on let me tell you that this video has been sponsored by bull bull shop and online video shopping app that brings quite a twist to shopping see in the bull bull shop app you get a live product demo video for every single product for example this is a budget tripod from bull bull and thanks to the video demo you can get a good idea of all its features before you buy it thus you can comment on these product videos ask questions live get exciting discounts and more we have the same tripod here with us and it's pretty good for the price and as you can see it works exactly like we saw in the video demo then you can find the link to it in the description and also install the app for more such products and your bull bull offers a discount of 55 rupees on the first purchase so check it out have you ever gone on a long road trip with your friends and ended up arguing over who gets to use the car charger to charge the phone well I have and that's exactly why this xiaomi car charger comes in handy for me it has two USB ports both of its support Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 and there is a USBC connector here as well but it's not a USB C port this is actually a main USB C port which means you can't plug in your smart phones charger into this instead there's a Xiaomi access 3 which plugs into this and expands the charger for rear passengers it's a normal idea but I'm sure that could have been done with the USBC female port as well this is probably just so people have to buy that Xiaomi accessory anyway the charger itself is really good it has a metal build it's very solid and it's surprisingly heavy for its size the LED light ring around the edges is a beautiful touch and the best part it supports QC 3.0 on both the port simultaneously so you can fast charge two smart phones at the same time awesome right Xiaomi sells this charger for 69 new ones which is around 700 rupees [Music] lastly there's the me dashcam bonus which is pretty much what you'd expect a dashcam to be and just like every other xiaomi car guys if you've seen so far this too is classy and well designed this is a large three inch display on the back a lens with a 140 degree field of view on the front built-in speaker was controlled and a battery built-in as well you just put in a micro SD card in there and it keeps recording continuously which is great since you don't have to worry about deleting older recordings manually the problem is that it's in Chinese and there's no way to change the language to English so you're gonna have to use Google Translate a lot to first start using the dashcam after that though you can connect it with the me home app and view all the recorded clips and even control the camera with your phone it's pretty nice but the biggest issue I have with the dashcam is that I need to wire it all the way from the fin screen to the side all the way down to the 12-volt outlet in the center it's just a lot of wiring and it's the sole reason why I am not going to use it any longer the me dashcam furnace is priced at 299 new ones which is around 3,000 rupees and if you don't find the vining you can go ahead and buy this [Music] I'll drop the links to all the products in the description down below but keep in mind that a lot of these products are priced higher in Indian rupees and they may take a long time to get delivered here in India us took around a month so make sure you're prepared for that anyway those were the five Xiaomi car gadgets that I've been using and I really really like them especially the wireless car charger and the vacuum cleaner which are my personal favorite there's also this car inverter which is great for road trips because it brings a power socket that you can use to charge your devices but you need an adapter to use Indian plugs with it because it's a chinese-style socket so which gadget did you like the most let me know in the comments also give this video a thumbs up if you liked it and share it with your friends who are looking for cool and useful gadgets for their cars lastly subscribe to a channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music] you [Music]
