hey guys this is patient B all calm and I'm pretty sure you have heard about the Indian government banning 15:9 Chinese apps from the Play Store in the App Store and these include some really popular apps now these apps have been banned as per the press release for engaging in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrative India defense of India security of state and public order now that sounds serious now according to tick-tock statement this is an interim order and the banned apps will be given a chance to respond to the government's concerns before a committee but there are a lot of questions right now I mean tick-tock is not available if you search on the Play Store but if you search on Chrome and go through the link it's still on the Play Store so it's clearly not a permanent ban but yeah it's confusing see a number of these apps come pre-installed on a lot of foods so how about that a number of people are actually using these apps on their phones so will they stop working will they continue to work yeah there's a lot of questions and we should get the details from the government soon but if you want to move ahead stop using these apps altogether when it's time to talk about some great alternatives now you're talking about the alternative to actually some really useful and popular apps and not apps like CF fujita Mobile which are actually something you should never use so if you have them just get rid of them already now let's talk about the alternatives to popular Chinese apps [Music] okay the camScanner is something a lot of people use and it has had its issues in the past I mean last year Kaspersky found a Trojan module in the app and it had gone away but it came back and now it's banned again but there are some alternatives you can use so there's Google Drive which has a simple scan feature that not many people know about and there's Adobe scan and Microsoft Office lens both of which are feature packed like camScanner now Adobe scan is something I prefer because I like the fact that it can detect the document is scanning be the ID card or resaved or a whiteboard or your usual documents it also has different editing tools OCR support and scanned images don't have any watermark on them so it's great so in the whole list of these banned abs there are a lot of Chinese browsers the CM browser APIs browser and of course the infamous UC browser which in the past has been in the news for taking unnecessary permissions showing spammy ads so yeah you shouldn't be using these browsers anyway but if the browser you should be using is Firefox I know there's chrome too of the sleeve but I am recommending Firefox for its privacy focused approach first of all Firefox brings a clean and blood-free experience unlike UC browser and like I said it's focused on privacy and security I mean it blocks a lot of trackers automatically so that's great plus it has all the great features like visual tab truly secure private browsing etc so Firefox is a great alternative to basically any browser out there so share it and Zenda are another really popular apps on this whole band list but of late they have become kind of spammy and bloat especially share it now I personally used to use Zender a lot to transfer files from a phone to my PC but offlane I've been using something really cool and really easy called Sinatra now snap drop isn't an app it's a web-based service so it works on basically any platform so say I wanted to send files to my Mac from my phone so I can just open up snap drop dotnet on both the devices on any of the browsers and as you can see the other device shows up I just tap on the device and send any file I want how easy is that and I like the fact that snap drop is open-source and just clean all wrong now I use snap drop for the phone to PC file transfer but you can also use files by Google if you want to send files between Android devices [Music] so ES File Explorer is another infamous app that has had its issues in the past the app has been reported to you know share app recommendations at spyware Android devices and beat shady engendered now lot of Android skins almost all the Android skins come with the old fine manager apps but if you want a third-party fire manager app there are a lot of great options I mean if you want a simple free file manager this obviously files by Google and if you want to create paid option there's solve Explorer now I personally prefer FX file explorer because it's privacy focused there are no ads it's free version because the most handy features like multiple windows support for most archive formats and I like the parents Android TV app works well too so yeah just try out FX File Explorer [Music] so tick-tock has been banned and no it's not the only video sharing platform from China that has been banned this also like and ye I'm not sure how do you pronounce it but there are some good alternatives to trick talk that you can use so as there's trailer from a california-based company and this is already a pretty popular rap I mean I tried out the app and it does not take any unnecessary permissions and I came across a number of celebrities posting videos on the platform so that's good plus it brings tectonic features as you can see you can create music videos and there are different tracks to choose from like tic toc and you also get the feature where you can collaborate with other users now apart from tinder I also tried out India based apps like chingaari and repor so now ching god it just doesn't load up for me and raposo is in as feature-rich a stick talk bard even give these a try [Music] viva video is a video editing app that has gone really popular in India now this is an app that was banned back in 2017 as well for spying on Indian users so it's obviously kind of shady but there are some great video editing apps you can use on Android now that's in short if you want the same port at UI or the tools similar to what you get in vivo video or you can use kind master which is more feature pack I mean it has got features like multi device timeline all the video editing tools different textiles effects transitions so yeah I think you should be fine with kind master now if you want a free video editor that does not add watermarks at all you can check out a list from the description down below [Music] hello the social media app that got really popular India because of its original language support has been banned too and you can use share chat instead which also brings the same so share chat is an app based out of India and it offers content in 15 region languages which is great I mean there's no English support and when I tried out the app I basically saw people posting memes quotes whatsapp for words and things like that so yeah I'm not a big fan of the app I mean why would people want to use this but people use hello so I don't know do you recorder is a screen recorder lab that also got pretty popular but it's been banned now but you don't really have to worry because there are a lot of great screen recording apps on the Play Store my recommendation is the screen recorder no ads yeah painting simply first of all this is ad free like the name J's and it brings all the features the support for different resolutions different frame rates and an Android 10 devices this for parental audio recording which is awesome if you want to record a gaming sessions so this is a simple great alternative that just works when compared to do you recorder what hide is a photos and videos hider app that was flagged recently for its privacy issues and now it's been bad now there are a lot of alternatives to hide photos and videos but one app I like is keep safe keep safe uses cypher aes-256 encryption which is the same protocol used in many banking apps and it's an app that lets you protect or hide apply with documents videos and photos it also has great features like phase down auto lock encrypted backups trash recovery and breaking alerts so yeah it kind of brings everything you need so yeah I use this instead of all type well there are a lot of other apps with these privacy issues and if you want alternatives for every single one of them we have an extensive detail list on Chinese apps alternatives so check it out from the link below also if you have any of these banned apps pre-installed in your phone we have a how-to on how you can remove these bloatware apps so go ahead check that out too also what do you think of this whole band tell us in the comment section
