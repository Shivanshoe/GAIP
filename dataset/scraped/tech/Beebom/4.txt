there are a lot of interesting smartphones under 20k yeah that's a lot and that means a lot of confusion but i'm going to clear everything today i'm going to tell you which phone you should be buying under 20 000 rupees let's go so first of all clearly there are a lot of phones under 20k but let's clear some of these phones all of these phones cost between 15 to 20k but some of them don't offer the performance that makes sense for this price range so we're gonna skip them next a couple of these phones are just not good enough because tft lcd in 2022 in this price range and also no wide vine l1 license at 20k yeah let's skip them some phones also don't have the ultra wide angle camera which i'm not very happy about but we'll let them stay for now so these are the phones we're going to consider and let's start with the best phone for performance now most of the popular smartphones in this price range come with either snapdragon 695 or the diminishing 810 or 800u but there's one phone that really brings powerful performance in this price range the redmi 9 speed edition with the snapdragon 778g which is just more powerful than the 695 or the timing city 810 or even the division 900 just look at the benchmark scores of all the chipsets now i've used this phone and this is definitely a great phone for gaming and it also has a 144hz display although it's ips lcd having said that only consider this if you're focused on the performance because let me highlight the cons because everyone knows the big us piece of the phone so this phone is kind of lagging on the camera front with no ultra wide angle camera and it does not have stereo speakers and it comes with android level yeah this is not the best all-around smartphone but performance is just top notch on the 9-speed edition next the best phone for the experience now there are two things that matter here the clean experience and updates now updates on android phones is like you kind of never know you might get them you might not get them so i'm going to prioritize the clean software experience in this budget segment now for that you have two options the oneplus not c2 lite which comes with android 12 and there's the moto g71 which comes with android 11. there's another moto option actually the h20 fusion from last year which recently started receiving the android 12 update and if we go by moto's promise for edge phones it should also get android 13. now oxygen os 12 has been known to be quite buggy lately so i will prefer the moto phones for the software experience especially because they're also well-rounded good smartphones i'll personally go with the s20 fusion because it brings a clean software experience and it's the better phone when compared to the g71 [Music] when it comes to camera phones i'm not going to consider phones that don't have an ultra wide angle camera i mean come on anyway most of these phones bring fairly good camera performance but if i had to choose the best camera phones among these i think two phones stand out the redmi note 11 pro plus and the moto h20 fusion now if you ask me the h20 fusion's camera performance is good if you consider moto standards i mean we all know that motor phones don't have the best camera optimization but the h20 fusion is fairly good again considering motor standards the redmi note 11 pro plus on the other hand has good camera forms but there's no 4k support and i'm not convinced it's the best camera phone under 20k that is actually the redmi note 10 pro max from last year this phone is still available to buy and the camera performance is just better than any other phone even the redmi note 11 pro plus i mean maybe it's because of snapdragon 732 g is better isp or maybe it's just better optimization it just takes better photos plus it shows 4k videos and i remember seeing in a note 11 pro plus video i would still take the redmi note 10 pro max over the new note 11 pro plus yes there's no 5g and 732g isn't the most powerful chipset anymore although it's decently good and there's obviously miui but it's still a great phone for its cameras and a beautiful display now what if you want the best all around smartphone under 28000 rupees a phone that brings the perfect balance of experience performance and cameras so here we have five of these options which are all good smartphones all of these have the same battery size very similar performance numbers but my choice for the best all around smartphone under 20k is the moto h20 fusion i mean it has a 10 bit 90 hertz oled in this price range which is awesome the device 810 is a very good performer and it has the clean stock android like experience from moto plus it has a lot of 5g bands which helps i know there's also the moto g71 but the h20 fusion will get an extra android update it has a micro sd slot and it brings better cam performance now no steel speakers is a little sad but overall this is my choice for the best phone to buy under 20k now if you have a budget of under 15k there are some good phones some decent phones but i think there are two options that make a lot of sense under 1500 rupees these are the two options and one is an all-around balanced smartphone under 15k and the other has its cons but brings good performance and gaming under 15k so the first phone is the moto g52 which is i think a great all-round smartphone that brings a very good 90 hertz p oled display in this price range it has a very sleek and lightweight design plus the super clean android 12 experience it brings is not something you'll find in this budget segment and i like that motorola has promised the android 13 upgrade for this as for the cons it's not the best phone for hardcore gaming and the cameras are okay but it's a budget phone at 15k it's a well balanced option for most people the second option i like is the redmi note 10 s from last year especially for its performance first of all the redmi note 10s is better than the newer note 11 the helio g95 is more powerful when compared to the snapdragon 680 and the cam performance of the note 10s is just better yes it's on android 11 and there's mini ui which we all know can get buggy but that's a compromise you'll have to make now one thing you must have noticed is that i've skipped a lot of 20 22 phones and instead chosen older smartphones from 2021 and that's because 2022 has been kind of bad for smartphones especially in the budget smartphone segment so when you're buying a new phone make sure to check for 2021 smartphones in the same price range because you might get a better option and a better deal this is the big takeaway from this video anyway comment down below if there's any other older phone option under 20k that we might have missed out on and also comment below if you still have any confusion on which phone you should buy under 20k yeah comment below and give this video like if you found it useful and share this with your friends and
