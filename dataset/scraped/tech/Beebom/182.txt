[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and this is it the galaxy s21 ultra 5g arguably the most powerful android smartphone right now yes the s21 ultra is good and it's probably the best android flagship right now so let's get into detail this is a galaxy s21 ultra review okay so i'm not going to go into all the specs and design details because everyone knows that already i'm going to share my experience my experience of the s21 ultras cameras the exynos 2100s performance the battery everything so yeah the galaxy s21 ultra is a big phone and that's something you will notice even after a few days but this is the phone that's very well made i've been using this without a case and very roughly if i'm being honest throwing it around in my car on my bed everywhere and there are no scratches at all not on the front not on the back oh and the matte back looks awesome even after a week no fingerprints no dirt nothing although as the aluminium frame does attract some smudges now another important thing here is that the fingerprint scanner is larger now compared to the s20 and it's faster and more consistent it also works when you have oily fingers or when there's water on the screen so this is a big improvement in my opinion now design apart the display here is without a doubt the best i have ever used so far i mean samsung flagships always have great amoled panels but this one's just brilliant so this is the new ltpo oled display tech that supports 1500 nits of max brightness as well as 10 hertz to 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate and well this display is amazing i mean i was also using the iphone 12 pro with the galaxy s21 ultra to compare the cameras of both these phones and while using them i did feel that the galaxy s 21 ultra display was even better than the one on the iphone 12 pro it's that good so your display is very bright crisp the color tuning is great and since hdr10 plus is supported compatible shows on apps like netflix look fabulous on this display especially with the stereo speakers sounding great i did not have the s20 ultra to compare the speakers with but i did feel that the s21 ultra speakers were more richer when compared to say the note 20 ultras very good speakers anyway going back to the display i like that wqhd plus finally works with 120 hertz and i've been using the phone on that display setting and the battery performance does not take a hit so no problems here another thing the s21 ultra display supports the s pen and you can use any of the older s pens with this display now i have tried the s pen on the s21 ultra and most of the features work out fine but the bluetooth functionality like the air gestures don't work you need the upcoming s pen pro for that but yeah most of the note taking the writing features work fine so as you can see air command is available with the s pen so you get the list of actions and features you can use screen off memo to jot down notes on the lock screen there's smart select to take manually cropped screen shots you can use it with the very handy notes app and you can even draw things in pen up so most of the s pen features are here however you have to get an s pen case to use in s pen with the s21 ultra because there's no way to pouch it now i know the big deal about the s21 ultra is the new exynos 2100 chipset i think the cameras are a big deal too but first i want to talk about exynos because that's what people want to know about so i showed you exynos 2100 benchmark scores against the snapdragon triple eight's official scores but i still don't have a snapdragon triple a device to compare so you'll have to wait for that comparison now comparison part when it comes to the exynos 2100 performance so far i have found it to be very good i mean it's a big improvement over exynos 990 as you can see in the benchmarks here but real world performance is better too app launching and loading is faster app switching is a lot smoother and games run very smoothly on the phone anyway one thing a lot of you guys wanted to know is if the galaxy s21 ultra overheats while gaming for a long duration well i did check that so i was playing cody mobile for long durations on this phone and it did get warm and i checked the temperature it was around 38 39 after an hour and a half which isn't overheating or hot i think that's fine really overall the galaxy s21 ultra has been a fast and smooth phone and feels like a flagship if you ask me about the performance now coming to the other big highlight of the s21 ultra you already know the specs the new 108 megapixel sensor two telephoto lenses and an ultra wide angle camera so i've been taking a lot of photos from the s21 ultra and i've uploaded them in a dry folder below if you want to take a look at them at full resolution but let me give you a bottom line straight away this is by far the most complete camera system right now photos from the main camera are remarkable and honestly they have surpassed my expectations as you see in these shots the hm3 camera sensor captures a lot of detail the dynamic range is excellent and there's no over saturation or anything these photos have the right color tone the camera is great in low light too there's auto night mode and that helps in taking photos that are brighter and sharper now apart from that i also took some 108 megapixel photos from the phone and the really cool thing about these photos is that 108 megapixel allows you to crop photos within photos without losing any significant detail here's an example of that and as you can see the cropped in shot looks detailed and nice so the camera is definitely good but i wanted to get a better idea and i took a few comparison shots with the iphone 12 pro and i like that the s21 ultra actually does very well against the iphone as you can see in this comparison the s21 ultra photo is definitely the nicer looking in fact some of the s9 ultra shots are just more sharper in detail now it's not all s21 sometimes i like the iphone 12 pro photos because sometimes the s21 ultra shots are a bit over processed but i think both of these flagship cameras take some incredible shots and that's what matters really anyway as for the other cameras the ultrawide camera is good it matches the color tone of the main camera while also bringing very good dynamic range although yes the details could have been better anyway i did like the ultra white sensor does well in low light too i think thanks to the auto night mode moving on the telephoto cameras on the galaxy s21 ultra are incredibly useful one can do 3x optical zoom while the other can do 10x optical zoom to be honest both 3x zoom shots like this one and 10x zoom shots like this one look fantastic i'm in at 10x it's not as clear as the 3x shot but it's very very good for a 10x zoom shot now 100x space zoom is still present and it's easy to capture with zoom lock but i only use the telephoto lenses to take a maximum of 30x shots and i think the results are very good now moving on to video quality they are still 8k 24 fps support and you can still take out high-des photos from an 8k video with the video snap feature it's super interesting i mean you can even take video snaps after shooting a video so here's an 8k video i shot from the phone and i can just use this button to capture a photo from the video which by the way as you can see has great quality apart from 8k what really excited me about the galaxy s21 ultra is that you can shoot 4k 60 fps videos from all five cameras here including the front camera plus you can shoot videos from multiple cameras using the director's view and here's a very simple video i shot using director's view check it out i'm shooting from the director's view on the s21 ultra and right now the selfie camera as well as the main camera on the back is in action as you can see but i can seamlessly switch to the ultra wide angle lens like this yeah it's very seamless i like that and i can also switch to the telephoto lens like this and by the way that's george the product manager of b phone so director's view is pretty cool so that was good right especially the smooth switching between the different lenses and that is what makes director's view incredibly useful because you can see these thumbnails so you know what you'll be shooting from say the ultra wide angle lens or the telephoto lens beforehand anyway when it comes to selfie camera i think the 40 megapixel sensor does a great job with selfies almost every selfie i took they all looked very good color wise detail wise and even exposure wise plus 4k video quality of the front camera is really good as you can see the exposure the details everything's pretty good and yeah overall i like the front cameras photo quality as well as the video quality now fantastic cameras apart the s21 ultra's battery performance is something i found decent the phone almost always lasted me for a day and a little more and i almost always got a screen on time of four four and a half hours i mean here are three screenshots of my battery usage and one is with the display set to wqhd plus and 120 hertz the second one is with fhd plus and 120 hertz and the third one is 60 hertz and fhd plus and as you can see the difference isn't massive at all as for the charging speed you probably know that there's no charger in the box of the galaxy s21 ultra but if you have samsung's 25 watt usb c pd charger you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 percent in around 68 minutes which is pretty good so all that is good and i did not mention one ui but let me tell you that one ui 3.1 on the s21 ultra is very consistent and i did not come across any weird bugs or anything lastly a lot of you guys have asked us questions on the galaxy s21 ultra on twitter so let me just answer the questions that i haven't already answered because how many 5g bands does the s21 ultra sport with the galaxy s21 ultra exynos variant has support for these sub 6 gigahertz and memo 5g bands are the top and bottom bezels uniform ah no they are not the bottom bezel is slightly thicker but it's a very small difference does the galaxy s9 ultra have a balanced stereo sound with the bottom speakers seem slightly louder than the one in the earpiece but i think it's a very small difference so i'd say it's fairly balanced how's the battery life and the idle battery drain on the new exynos chip see the battery performance is something i've already talked about as for the idle raid i noted down the battery drain over nine and it was three percent which i think is fine overall if i have to be honest with you the galaxy s21 ultra is a flagship phone that i've thoroughly enjoyed using and i think it's for people who want the best of everything in the android world design premium classy display the best i've ever seen on a phone high-end camera quality and flagship grade performance see the galaxy s21 ultra is a phone that's definitely one of samsung's greatest flagship phones ever and to sum things up in a sentence the galaxy s21 ultra is a refined finished product that i personally think does justice to the whole ultra branding but that's what i think i'd love to know your thoughts on the galaxy s21 ultra and yeah if you have any more questions on the phone just make sure to
