[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the page from b1.com and asus has launched its latest zen book 13 and zen book 14 laptop here in india and well this right here is the new asus zenbook 14 and this is one beautiful crazy thin laptop with a lot of interesting features so what are you waiting for let's take a look at the new zenbook 40. okay so the zenbooks have always been thin and light laptops but the new zenbook takes it to the whole new level just look at how compact this laptop is you can easily hold it in one hand i mean the side profile is just 13.9 millimeters thick and the zenbook 14 here weighs just 1.17 kgs so yeah this is a super portable laptop and to think about it even with the sleek design the laptop has almost all the ports you need on the left you get these two thunderbolt 3 usb c ports and an hdmi port on the right you get a usb a 3.2 port and a micro sd card reader now as you must have noticed there is one thing missing the headphone jack yep the new zenbooks don't have it but in the box you do get a hydra certified usb c to 3.5 mm dongle along with the usb a to lan connector anyway coming to the design and bay like previous generation zenbooks you get the aluminium alloy lid and there's the concentric circle design as well and i think it looks pretty premium i mean this is a laptop that's all around classy and i like the fact that you can open up the lid like this with a finger and you're presented with this beautiful display this is a 14 inch ips lcd full hd display and as you can see the bezels are narrow especially on the sides which does make the laptop look very very modern see this gives the laptop a screen to body ratio of 90 which is awesome as for the display it has 100 srgb support and 300 nits of max brightness and as you can see it looks really good i mean i've only briefly used the laptop but the display here looks top notch so far now on the top of the display you can see this camera here right well it's not your usual webcam the camera here has a four element lens and it's also an ir camera this means that the camera here works with windows hello to let you unlock the zen book with your face and in my usage it has worked really well and really fast plus since it's ir it works in the dark too the webcam quality is pretty good too i mean i like the webcam position on the top and asus claims to have added a new algorithm for better image quality and i think the quality is definitely more sharp moving on to this this h2h backlit keyboard and edge to edge means that even though this laptop is super sleek the keyboard here is not a compromise i mean the keyboard here has keys that are well spaced and these keys have a decent travel of 1.5 millimeters so far my time experience on this has been good although the arrow keys are a bit too small for my liking but other than that i like that you get almost all of the important keys here including dedicated keys for home page up page down and end there are also very cool hotkeys here which are very useful as you can see there are keys to turn on the webcam bring up the screenshot tool just for the button and launch the my asus zap as well then there's the touchpad as you can see from the iphone this is asus number pad 2.0 touchpad which means i can just press this icon to bring up the number pad which is handy because compact laptops don't have the num keys as for the icon on the left you can use this to toggle between two brightness levels or swipe from it to launch the calculator app quickly now the number pad feature aside i like the size of this touch pad and my short time it has been very smooth and responsive and there are no weird sounds alongside a touchpad you also get these stickers which is weirdly not aligned properly and this is a premium laptop arp will hopefully remove these apart from that you get two harman kardon certified speakers here at the bottom but thanks to the design here the sound doesn't really die down i mean it's not very loud but the quality of these speakers is really good with good clarity and i noticed a lot of depth in this so you know what i like the overall design and build of the new zenbook laptops and even though these are sleek and cool looking laptops these are military grade certified laptops so they should be pretty durable as well now let's talk under the hood space the new zenbooks come in a core i5 and an i7 variant the way that we have features the 10 gen intel core i7 processor built on the 10 nanometer process with intel iris graphics coupled with up to 16 gb of lpddr4x ram and up to one tv of pcie gen 3 ssd now do note that the ram here is soldered so you cannot increase the ram manually also you don't get a variant with the dedicated gpu so that's something you should know but for the people it's aimed at this is a laptop with some very good specs okay so i ran a few benchmark tests on the laptop and as you can see the scores are pretty good and what you can expect from the islay core i7 chipset plus in my usage of the laptop it's been very smooth and responsive so things are positive but yeah it's still very early days as for the software there's windows 10 home on board with all of its features and there's the my asus app with some really handy features as you can see it has different options for battery health you can choose the fan profile from here set the color of the screen enable true to live video enhancement feature and more in this app you can also check out any driver updates contact customer support and link your phone to the laptop with the link to my asus feature this is pretty handy and it's a lot like windows 10's your phone app but with this you can send files across your pc and your phone share links make calls get all your phone notifications on your pc mirror screen extend your screen and more lastly there's the battery the zenbook 14 comes with a 67 watt hour battery that's rated to last up to 22 hours which means even on intensive use the laptop should last you eight to 10 hours you also get the 65w usbc charger which supports fast charging and takes the laptop to 60 in just 49 minutes apart from that the new zen books have most of the modern connectivity standards there's wi-fi six the latest wi-fi standard which is great for future proofing and there's bluetooth 5.0 so connectivity is kind of covered well to conclude things the new zenbook once again has the design and build as its highlight i mean just look at the new zenbook 14 it looks stunning and it's crazy thin and light it's a fantastic feat of engineering because it gets almost everything right ranging from the display the keyboard to the touchpad and the specs are high-end now at the time shooting this video we don't know the price of the new zen books but i'm expecting it to be priced like the previous gen zen books at say around 70 80k and at that price the new zenbook could be a great option for people looking for a work laptop or students looking for a highly portable laptop but what do you think of the news netbooks tell us in the comment section below also give this video a like if you enjoyed it and make sure
