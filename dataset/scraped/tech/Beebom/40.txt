and i have to have a window always on top and i have to get quick actions on selected text an app to customize all of windows an app that fixes everything that you dislike about windows 11. yeah it's been some time since we talked about the must-have apps on windows so let's do that today now before we get started i want to give a huge shout out to video candy our sponsors for this video videocandy is an online video editor that's super useful if you want to do some quick edits to your videos first of all it has a fast minimal website with no ads and i like the tools it has you can trim videos merge crop them add music to them compress them convert videos to gifs and do a lot more the great thing is video candy is free to use with no watermarks and it can process videos that are up to 2gb so check it out from the link below so starting off who doesn't like toys i mean i do and i'm sure you do too but let's get serious so does your windows laptop and that's where i'm sure you've heard about microsoft power toys but what you haven't heard about is that microsoft power has recently got a bunch of new tools first is always on top which is where i like to be i mean in the whole world in the workplace you know anyway always on top is simply let's pin a window to the top for example i have the calculator app open and i can just use the shortcut windows plus control plus t and you can see this window get highlighted and there's also a sound to tell you that a window has been pinned now no matter what i open the calculator window will always be on top second power toys run which is a spotlight like search feature on windows now lets you do a web search like this there's also a video conference mute tool which is super handy because you can quickly use these shortcuts to mute the camera or the mic or both next up is pantheba cool name right i mean i love the name panther bar also love the icon and this app is basically the context menu on steroids so generally when you select some text you right click on it and you get these options there are two things wrong with this first you have to right click second just these options with panther bar you select the text and this menu automatically pops up really quickly and here you have all these useful options no copycat paste is usual but you can also translate a text really quickly you can search for it on amazon create a new note in notepad and so much more plus there are ton of extensions to do a lot more now there's one thing that panther bob can not do and that is subscribing to a youtube channel which is why you should do it yourself just go down below subscribe hit the bell icon because you know we love it now what everybody hates though is the windows 11 start menu probably due to the lack of customizations the whole recommended section that doesn't leave you in peace and in this pin section i don't remember painting these apps i mean who pins mcfee in the start menu the point is if you are annoyed too start 11 is the app for you first of all this fixes the windows 11 start menu the biggest feature for me is that with this i can go to all apps and then go back but just swiping on the touchpad no need to use the tiny back button it also lets you customize the start menu for example you can have the start when you show up all programs you can hide folders from the recent documents you can create a shortcut of any folder that you want now it's not just this start level lets you go back to the whole windows 10 style start menu the windows 7 style start menu and even customize them completely now this is a paid app with a free trial so yeah it's definitely worth a shot moving on windows has a notepad you already know about that but what's better than a notepad notepads plural sorry i mean sorry notepads is a lot like notepad keeping things simple but it's also more feature-packed first of all it has tab support so you can have multiple nodes open like this and switch between them easily the app also has support for smart copy which automatically trims empty lines spaces etc but what's actually super useful is session snapshot which basically ensures you don't lose any data even if you accidentally close the app or windows i mean it's windows so you know it can happen now there are a lot more features but i also like the fact that there's markdown support along with live preview which is pretty handy windows 11 is all about the curves but the windows 11 taskbar is just straight lines all across the good news is rounded tv is an app that makes the windows 11 taskbar all curvy just the way i like it you can set the corner radius and the margin and click apply and this is how the taskbar looks now this is fine but i like the dynamic mode mod which brings a mac dock like experience to the windows taskbar it looks like this and it adapts according to the number of apps you have open if you want you can even hide the system tray for a more cleaner look see a lot of people have problems with windows 11p the new file explorer ui not being able to change the taskbar position the background is being annoying and even the new context menu win arrow tweaker fixes all of that and a lot lot lot lot more i mean look at all these options man i dare you to use all of them yeah yeah so this is not a new app but like i said it fixes the windows 11 issues you can get the classic context menus disable background apps enable the driven ui in file explorer change the taskbar size and position yeah there are a lot more options and once again i dare you yeah yeah i double game microsoft microsoft had to screw up a lot of things before pushing out a final stable version of windows 11 and one of those things is no drag and drop files in the taskbar which is super annoying if say you are editing a photo and interestingly the app to fix the windows 11 drag and drop to taskbar is called the windows 11 drag and drop taskbar fix okay now whether you find this useful or not you gotta admit that the aim is on point anyway you need to set up windows 11 drag and drop trash bar fix and once you've done that you'll be able to well you know drag and drop to the taskbar and jokes apart this is actually useful and you know what if you have any such more useful app that will make our life everyone's life on windows 11 a whole lot easier i'd love to know about this app so make sure to comment below yeah do not forget to comment down below also give this video like make sure to share it and yeah thanks for watching i will see you in the next one the car gadget you really need this is the motorola ma1 and it can convert your wired android auto into violin
