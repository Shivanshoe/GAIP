this is the new xiaomi 12 pro and i have two words for this phone game over yes game over now i'm sure you're wondering why i'm saying this why am i making the statement for what seems like a perfectly good flagship phone well i'm saying this because of this graph serious yeah this is what i'm talking about i mean if you thought the snapdragon triple eight was bad the eight gen one is [Music] first of all let's quickly have a look at the specs of the xiaomi 12 pro as you guys know it comes with the latest and greatest from qualcomm the new agent one chipset that's built on the four nanometer architecture it comes with the new cortex x2 cores that go up to three gigahertz along with the new a710 and a510 cores and there's the new adreno 730 gpu so yeah it's all powerful no doubt here's the android score and just look at it almost hit the one million mark even the geekbench score is very impressive but there's one big problem the throttling remember the graph i showed you well i'll be testing out the performance of the xiaomi 12 pro and i'm not gonna means words it's a mess so here i've got three phones the xiaomi 12 pro with the latest eight gen one the mi 11 ultra with snapdragon triple eight and the me 11 x with 870. all xiaomi phones with miui and they're all at 100 and first i wanted to check the cpu throttling with default settings 20 threads 15 minutes and in this first test itself i was amazed to see how zigzag the graph goes in the xiaomi 12 pro with the gen1 i mean it goes red in a few minutes now this is the end result of the test and see how the graph is on the 12 pro there's yellow there's red and that means the throttling is kind of bad here as you can see throttle to 70 percent of its max performance the performance numbers are better than the 888 or the 870 but the average is not very high because of the dips the triple eight on the meal and ultra did better than the agent one in throttling at 82 percent but its performance numbers are not good i think xiaomi has capped the triple h's performance in the mi 11 ultra for better consistency and you know what surprise surprise the 870 was the best in terms of throttling it throttled to only 90 of its max performance while bringing in better performance than the 888 and it's not too far behind when compared to the new eight gen one look i did another test to get a better idea thread set to 50 and the time set to 30 minutes and in this more intensive test the agent one was once again pretty bad throttling to 69 once again the triple eight was good but its performance numbers are kind of oakish the 817 the mini 11x was the best beating both the triple eight and the agent one in throttling and in fact if you look at the average performance it's higher than both the triple eight and the agent one newer more powerful chipsets yeah good job qualcomm look i've done these tests a lot of times and it's clear that the agent wants throttling issues are real and if you're thinking is this the agent one that is the problem or is it the xiaomi 12 pro well it seems like the agent one is the problem because i've seen the same thing happen in the moto edge x30 which also has the hn1 now you must be wondering what exactly happened with qualcomm i mean this was a company that was the leading name when it comes to smartphone chipsets everyone was like we want snapdragon chipsets not exynos not mediatek in fact i see a lot of people saying this even today well what happened well actually things are changing see mediatek is now the world's largest smartphone chip maker with its lead ever increasing i mean it had a market share of 40 percent compared to qualcomm's 27 percent in q3 2021 not just market share media tech is now giving statements like only one company has heating issues and it's not us that is clearly aiming towards qualcomm so why do things change what has gone wrong with qualcomm now first of all you need to understand this there are only two companies that make these modern day flagship smartphone chipsets there's taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company aka tsmc and their samsung electronics both of these are the only companies that have the fab for four nanometer five nanometer chipsets now of these two tsmc has always been known to be more efficient when it comes to thermal performance samsung not so much see in the past most qualcomm flagship chipsets were produced by tsmc beat the snapdragon 870 865 855 and they did not have any throttling issues exit our ship sets were made by samsung and they have always been known for their thermal issues now the latest qualcomm flagship chipsets are having the same issues because the a gen1 chipset has been made by samsung instead of tsmc basically the agent one exynos and the tensor chip on the pixel 6 are all made by samsung and you know it they all have throttling problems i know you're thinking qualcomm probably knows all about these issues with samsung's manufacturing process so why did it not go with tsmc for all the snapdragon 8gen1 chipsets well actually the answer is they have no choice ctsmc is running at full capacity because apple called dibs yes apple has already partnered with gsmc to literally get 100 of its shapes made by them be the new mac chipsets or the iphone ones not just apple even the new flagship media tech chipset with the same specs as the agent one is being made by tsmc so qualcomm had no choice but to go with samsung qualcomm knows this too because there have been reports saying the company has moved part of its agent one production to tsmc because they're not happy with samsung made chipsets this basically means that there will be two variants of the snapdragon 8gen one in the market there will be a tsmc variant and there'll be a samsung variant now an average consumer wouldn't know which one is which and this is bad because some phones with a snapdragon 8 gen 1 will be good while some others not and the xiaomi 12 pro is the example of the latter see the xiaomi 12 pro is actually an out-and-out flagship with a problematic flagship chipset i mean just look at the phone it looks like a flagship with its matte glass back its metal frame the symmetrical stereo speakers which have this really cool sound wave sort of design i think this is really cool the display is amazing just look at the specs it's the new second gen ltpu amoled that's said to be fast at switching refresh rates and it can go as low as 1 hertz for increased efficiency plus it's a sharp uhd panel with dolby vision support the cameras are also top notch three cameras or 50 megapixel sensors two samsung jn150 megapixel sensors one for ultra wide shots and one for 2x optical zoom shots the main camera is the sony imx 707 50 megapixel sensor with ois and this is a large sensor and you know what it just takes beautiful vibrant shots i mean look at this shot it looks like it's taken from a high-end phone it's just very good and these are photos from the main 50 megapixel sensor but let me tell you the other 50 megapixel sensors are also up there when it comes to quality the xiaomi 12 pro also comes with the latest miui 13 on top of android 12 which we will be doing a separate video on so stay tuned make sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon as well the 12 pro also has the 120 watt charger in the box which we have seen in action in the 11i in india and also supports 50 watt fast wireless charging look my point is the xiaomi 12 pro is a cutting edge flagship xiaomi is putting the latest tech everywhere but you know what it's all pointless because of the snapdragon 8 gen 1's issues honestly i'm not sure how qualcomm can fix this mess do they cap the performance of the agent one to fix throttling issues do they make less chipsets but only make them with tsmc i'm not sure honestly this makes me think the whole qualcomm era is coming to an end i mean media technology has the biggest market share and its dementia 9000 flagship chipset has the same specs as the agent one and is being made by tsmc which is promising i mean i'm here to test it on a phone but mediatek seems very confident about it overall you know what the game over is not exactly for xiaomi it's for you know it well i want to know what you guys think of this whole qualcomm situation make sure to comment down below also give this video a like make
