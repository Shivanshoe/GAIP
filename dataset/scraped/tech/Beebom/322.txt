[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient boom calm and really UI has arrived yes the real me lab did based on Android 10 has started to roll out on some real devices and are real me actually has the real me UI on board and you know what there's a lot to talk about but before we get going I suggested hit the bell I can do get notified every time you post an awesome new video now that you've done that let's talk real me UI so when I first installed will me UI on the real me XD here the biggest change I noticed are the visual changes obviously the elmia does not bring an overhaul UI but I'd say it's more defined first of their three cool new live wallpapers that change as for the time of the day and I especially like this one anyway the big visual change comes in the notification shape here's the notification panel or leave me UI and color os6 side-by-side and as you can see the real me you wide notification shade is better and a mix between stock Android and one UI I like the family does not take up the whole screen now another visual change is the new defined icons all rocks which all have a similar shape giving it a more cleaner look there's also a new icon style option in the launcher settings and well you can select the different styles choose from the different shapes change the size yeah I like the customizability and it's not just the app icons items have been defined everywhere check out the settings page they are the new icons the search bar is finally here and options have been reordered in certain pages for a better cleaner look apart from that there are quite a few minor visual changes toggles look much better now the recent screen looks modifying even the minor elements of the UI like this app shot that menu has been improved so yeah there are quite a few visual refinements and even the animations are smoother and well more cleaner to browse it's like color or 7 rather than stock Android but I like it because it's an improvement over color over 6 another thing real me UI improves over color OS 6 is the launcher the launcher here brings quite a few new features that have always wanted the most important to me is the option to swipe down on the home screen to access the notification shape I always used to swipe down on color OS to get at iOS inspired search page and I hated it well you can now choose class as the notification shade so yeah I'm glad another option in the launcher settings I like is the option to DoubleTap to lock the screen it's super handy apart from that this obviously the new icon style option I talked about an option to have the Google search bar at the bottom displayed dots on apps that have been updated recently and there's the smart assistant changes yeah this page has a new look and I don't necessarily like it that much moving on the dark mode is here I mean karo has recently had got the dark mode but the readme UI brings the dark mode in the display settings so you can show you the dark mode for sunset to sunrise or set a specific type there's also an option here to force the dark mode on third-party apps that don't have a dark mode and when it works this duster what's abducts so yeah I like it plasmic mostly before is coming with AMOLED displays the dark wood is an important feature and well it looks great on XTS display with real vu i anyway one feature that real me UI has that color 7 does not is dual mode music share this is the feature that's available in the real me labs page and it's pretty good so this feature lets you use a pair of wired earphones and a pair of bluetooth earphones at once so you can watch a movie or listen to a song with that special someone or if your forever alone with your friends you can even take a call while someone is listening to music from your phone yeah these are the use cases and I'm not sure how handy this is but yeah it's a good addition another feature that really you have brings is clean lighting effects which is similar to edge lighting effects on samsung phones and also similar to the same feature present me why as well there's also really shared which now works with Oppo Xiaomi and we were phones thanks to that alliance deformed now I use it to share a photo that I'd be Kade really pro and it worked great so yeah in me share works nice anyway so real me UI is based on Android 10 and that means you get the added 10 gestures but I like the fact that the gestures here are a mix between the arrow 10 gestures and the color OS gestures so you can still swipe from the edges and whole to switch between apps or you can switch apps and return styles by swiping from bottom so you basically have both of these options and you can go with whatever you like there's also one added gesture you can now swipe down at the bottom to quickly enter the one handed mode yeah like this which is very similar to iOS but hey this is handy right now there's one more super cool gesture that's been improved so the three finger swipe to take screenshots has always been present but really UI makes it way cooler you're gonna love so now you can just press hold on the screen with three fingers for a couple of seconds and then take a partial screenshot like this yep this is super cool but wait there's more you can also take a screenshot and quickly swipe down on it to share it or swipe up on it to take long screenshots yeah that is nice I mean and eleven you know which really UI free to the copy so taking partial screenshots is amazing but really UI also improve the screen recording feature this finally the option to record the system sounds so you can now finally record your games publish sessions with the internal sound this is also 1080p support and game streamers can also use the front camera simultaneously yeah nice so here the screen recording has been improved next up the camera you guys see I was never really a fan of the camera UI in Carneros devices and really UI brings a new camera UI that fixes that kind of first of all the UI looks different but more importantly the option to switch to the ultra wide-angle lens has moved here yeah that annoying butter on the top has been replaced with something that's usual on most phones but makes a whole lot more sense now these features are cool but there's one important feature that really UI brings and this is a feature that was introduced in color over seven I'm talking about personal information protection which i think is a really good feature now what this feature does is when apps try to read your person in for like all history contacts messages or even events this will provide them empty information instead of your real personal info for example say you don't want to give an app like true corner access to your contacts when you can just enable this toggle here and that's it yeah I'm definitely using this feature then there's the focus mode which is similar then more in oxygen OS you can enable it from the quick settings and this will hide apps block notifications and show you an inspirational code with some ambient noise if you want or if you want to focus you can exit at any time though unlike the Zen mode so yeah there's a writing mode as well for bikers which mutes on alerts except for calls and has a different UI for call so that he can answer easy about from that real me UI is said to optimize gaming performance and the overall smoothness of the phone now I did not really notice a huge difference but yeah I haven't tested things out extensively so I'll have to wait and see lastly I'm sure you're wondering what about the option to disable the ads in real UI so the ads that were recently introduced after all that talk that heal me wouldn't introduce ads ever while they were testing it out the whole time real me XD with real me UI does not have that option to disable the ads in the additional settings page so I don't think the ads have rolled out with the dreamy UI on the XD so far overall if you ask me how do I like the New Deal me UI where like say quite like it I mean it's a good improvement over color OS 6c the UI is more defined and some of the new features and changes are amazing but you know what it's not a whole lot different from color OS 7 in fact this is color OS 7 with a few changes here and there now I don't mind that because it's a good update but I hope you it does not remain color OS with just a different name overall real me you it does not leave am the software experience of readme phones but yeah it's definitely a more refined experience yeah defined is the key word here but that was a good look at the brand new real me UI and like I said I'd like it anyway what are your thoughts do you think give me you I can take on me UI and other platforms tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share the difference who have real devices lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech
