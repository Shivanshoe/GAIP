the new moto g52 is here and this is actually quite an interesting budget smartphone because two reasons number one this is actually priced a little lower than the moto g51 it rupees 14 499 and reason number two this is better than the moto g51 in almost all the aspects almost because there's one area where i'm a little doubtful let's get straight to the point a lot has changed in the g52 compared to the g51 and the first point is obviously the design the g52 design is better in a lot of aspects first i think it looks better here's the g52 next to the g51 and i think you'll agree when i say that the g52 looks more premium the back is still plastic but motorola has used a pmma finish now what's pmma well i did a google search and got this pmma also known as acrylic or acrylic glass is a transparent and rigid thermoplastic material widely used as a shadow proof replacement for glass now this does look a lot like glass and i also like that the frame also looks nicer see i personally like the looks of this phone but what i like more is that motorola has made the phone smaller when compared to the g51 this is basically the slimmest and the lightest phone in this segment i mean look at this comparison it's 7.9 millimeters thin and it only weighs 169 grams which is almost 40 grams lighter than the g51 now this is interesting because the phone has the same 5000 mah battery the point is the moto g52 just feels better in the hands if you like lightweight and compact phones you will like this and yeah you should also hit like on the video shameless plug hit like the design is also more functional the fingerprint scanner is in the power button it's still ip52 rated it still has the headphone jack the same micro sd plus dual sim hybrid slot but what's new is the steel speakers this is something the g51 and even the g71 did not have so thumbs up to motorola for this there's a speaker on the top and a speaker on the bottom and the sound quality is loud and fairly good i also like that the speakers here use the qualcomm soundtech and this dolby atmos support so you can tune the sound the way you want the display is another area where the g52 is just a lot better it's a p only display which has its advantages i mean p oleds are thinner and lighter than jio leds or amoled panels and that's the reason g52 is sleek and nice police are also better at managing heat and pure let's also enable manufacturers to keep the bezels low on the devices and this is something i noticed with the g51 none of us like big chains on these new budget smartphones and i like that the g52 has a very narrow chin with unified bezels all around it looks great here's the chain on the g52 and the g51 see the difference it's better than the competition too here's the chains of g52 redmi note 11 and realme 9 and yeah the g52 clearly has the smallest chip now i know earlier player displays were not known for great display quality but the technology has evolved in fact the h20 series and the s30 pro have a good view on it panel and this pioneered panel on the g52 is also great it has the same oled qualities punchy colors deep blacks and overall it just looks fantastic i'll honestly take this polar display any day over the 120 hertz ips lcd on the g51 the brightness is good too it's not the brightest display seven on its max but i did not have any issues with brightness in outdoor situations or welded situations it's also a 90 hertz display so android 12 animations just look smooth and nice the phone also has the wide vinyl and unlicensed so netflix shows and movies play on full hd without any issues on the phone as for screen protection the phone has ponder glass on top of the p punit panel and this screen protection is equivalent to the protection good in the class 3 bricks one change in the g52 that is a little debatable is the processor the g52 has the snapdragon 680 chipset and i like that there are higher ram and storage variants this time the snapdragon 680 when compared to the snapdragon 480 plus on the g51 has its advantages it's a six nanometer chipset so it's definitely more power efficient it has the higher clock speeds but the snapdragon 480 plus is a 5d chipset and is slightly more powerful just check out the benchmark scores and you can see that the 480 plus actually scores higher it's not a big difference and i think motorola went with the 680 for better battery efficiency and also the fact that competition phones like the note 11 and realme 9 have the same chipset also just to be clear the snapdragon 680 is a 4g chipset so this is obviously a 4g phone as for day-to-day performance this seems like a fairly smooth phone so far but we only received the g52 yesterday so it's too early to judge when it comes to bjmi it only supports these graphics settings no hd but i did play the game at smooth and the game was playable talking about the other changes the g52 comes with the same android 12 experience we saw in the h30 pro so it's very pixel-like with the same material ui the widgets and it's just a lot of fun to use this is a great experience plus they're all the useful motor gestures and features as for updates motorola has promised the android 13 update and three years of security patches and when it comes to pre-installed apps there's facebook but i noticed a couple of more apps pre-installed josh and daley hunt you can install this it's not a big deal but this is the first time i've noticed the motorola phone come with these and i'm hoping it's not something you continue with because you associate clean experience with a moto phone the rear cameras haven't changed from the g51 it's the same triple camera setup and one thing motorola recently confirmed to me is that they're working on improving the camera ui on motorola phones this is something i've always complained about some glad motorola's listing as for the camera quality here's some photos from the phone and in daylight things look good in low light there is a bit of struggle but i'll have to test things out extensively to get a more clearer idea the selfie camera has changed though it's a 16 megapixel sensor compared to 13 megapixel on the g51 now the selfies from the phone look good so far and on the video front there's only 1080p support in both the front and the rear cameras when it comes to the battery like i said it's the same 5 000 image battery but the charger is faster this time there's this 33 watt turbocharger in the box which i haven't tested but it should be faster than the 20 watt charger in the g51 lastly on the connectivity front this phone has all the important sensors there is carried aggregation support 2x2 mimo support and there's nfc to conclude things the moto g52 has launched in india rupees 14499 and that becomes 13 499 if you include the hdfc bank 1000 rupee discount offer and the 6 128 gb variant of this phone has been ordered to be 16 499 now in this price range i think the moto g52 brings some good features see the design is very appealing both in terms of looks and the in-hand feel and i think it looks a lot better than most phones in this price range plus the 90 hertz purely display with symmetrical bezels and stereo speakers are just great addition for this price then there's the faster charger and the stock android 12 speed is out of the box which is just a big usb the chipset isn't an upgrade this is not a 5g phone and i'm yet to test out the cameras but yeah this looks like a solid phone for this price what do you think of this phone when compared to the competition from redmi and real me and oppo comment down below also give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to channel for more amazing tech videos that's me
