[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is praise from you.com and off late we've been talking about gaming laptops flagship laptops chromebooks but what about mid-range thin and light laptops well this recently arrived the asus z5 with the intel evo tag so what are the features that make this laptop interesting what are the specs what does the intel evo tag mean well i'm going to talk about all of that but let me start with my favorite aspect of the a65 the design and the display so this is the asus f5 in all its glory and the design here is specially interesting because acer has used a new green color scheme with gold accents which i think looks good and there's magnesium aluminium alloy here making the swift 5 an extremely light and portable laptop to give you the specifics this is a laptop that just weighs 1 kg and yeah that's very lightweight and you can feel the light form factor of this laptop when you're just carrying it around another cool thing about the swift five is that it has a silver ion anti-microbial coating all around with the lid the keyboard palm rest etc and it said to reduce the microbial rate against different bacteria now that is something i can't really check but i like the fact that this whole design is fingerprint resistant and that means i don't have to clean it up every single time i'm taking it short that is good but while the laptop feels and looks good i did notice some flex here in the keyboard and the palm rest it does not seem like a big deal but it's something you should know moving on the display is also one of the big highlights it's a 14 inch 1080p ips touchscreen with the 16.9 aspect ratio 100 srgb coverage 340 nits of max brightness which is pretty good for a laptop screen and it's all protected by corning gorilla glass so the display specs are good and i like how narrow the bezels are on the sides and the top the screen to body ratio here is 90 and yeah that's cool as for the display quality it has really vibrant colors good blacks very wide viewing angles and it's also very bright and the touch too is responsive so yeah overall it's good but one thing i don't like much is that the screen is very reflective and it's highly noticeable even when the display is so bright so apart from the few quirks the a65 is a top-notch laptop when it comes to design and the display but it's the performance that matters the most and that's where the intel evo tag comes into play now i know a lot of you guys are thinking what does intel evo mean well a laptop with the intel evo branding has a specific set of high-end features and there's no way a manufacturer can compromise on that first up all intel evo laptops will have either the 11th gen intel core i7 chipset or the 11 gen intel core i5 chipset with intel iris xc graphics and intel turbo boost 2.0 now apart from that all intel evo laptops need to instantly wake up in less than a second they should have at least 8gb of dual channel memory at least 256gb of pcie nvme ssd storage 9 plus hours of battery life on a laptop with a full hd display they should also have support for usbc fast charging and they should have the latest connectivity in the form of wi-fi 6 and thunderball 4. there's obviously a few more standards that laptops need to have to get the intel evo certification but these are the points that really matter see when you buy an intel evo certified laptop you're guaranteed to get this set of features and specs and the asus 5 brings all of that for example the asus f5 comes in both core i7 and core i5 variants and there's also different ram storage configs but the unit we have is powered by the intel 11 gen core i5 1135g7 chipset which is a quad core processor based on the 10 nanometer architecture it can go from 2.4 gigahertz to 4.2 gigahertz and i like that acer has configured the tdp to reach the max performance of the cpu apart from that this is the intel iris xc graphics 8 gb of lpddr 4x ram and 512 gb of pcie gen 3 ssd now we all know that the new core i5 chipset is fairly powerful and it makes sense for an ultrabook i mean for someone like me the performance in this laptop is just right i mean i've been using this laptop in the performance when it comes to day-to-day tasks where i open a lot of chrome tabs transfer files do some photo editing the laptop has been smooth and nice there's no sluggishness anyway when it comes to thermals the bottom of the laptop does get hot after extensive usage but i think it's normal it's not a problem as for the fans they mostly remain silent and when they did pump up they were still pretty easy to ignore so no problems here also like that i can just use the function plus f combo to switch between different fan modes like this now one interesting thing with intel evo is the laptop should have similar performance when on par and when on battery so i checked that i ran crossmark with the laptop connected to par and with the laptop on battery and as you can see the scores are not very different is the scores are high on power but it's fairly close apart from the performance aspect the a65 has all of the other usual laptop features first up it has a backlit keyboard with keys that are crisp and offer a good feedback i mean the typing experience is important in ultrabooks and the swift 5 does well on that front then there's a touchpad which supports windows gestures and it's a well sized trackpad that's responsive there's also the fingerprint scanner here which is fast and nice then there are two speakers here with dts certification and they are not very loud but the quality is decent dish the webcam is a usual 720p webcam and it's not bad not amazing kind of in between when it comes to battery the asus 55 comes with a 56 wattage battery that's rated to last up to 17 hours now i'm yet to test things thoroughly but i think realistically it should be around 9 to 10 hours which is still excellent for charging the laptop comes with asus proprietary 65w ac adapter which acer claims can offer 4 hours of use with just a 30 minute charge now do note that aces 65 watt charger that comes in the box is the proprietary charger so it's not a usbc charger but thanks to the intel evo certification this laptop here does support usbc fast charging i mean i checked and the thunderbolt 4 usbc port supports fast charging so yeah anyway when it comes to pause there's the power port here along with the full size hdmi port the usbc thunderbolt 4 port and on the right there's a kensington slot a couple of led indicators a usb a port and a headphone mic combo jack lastly when it comes to connectivity there's wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.0 support so that was a good look at the asus 5 and in my time with this laptop it does look like a well-balanced solid notebook i mean the intel evo certification is great and it's important because it guarantees that laptop will have the latest intel 11gen processors which are fast and capable plus intel evo also guarantees a great user experience when it comes to responsiveness along with the latest connectivity options like wi-fi 6 and thunderball 4. see the point is if you see the intel evo sticker on a laptop you can be assured that it has the latest processor the latest connectivity standards and the latest features and the a65 is a good example of that now coming to the pricing of the laptop the asus 5 starts at rupees 68 nine and it's available in amazon flipkart so you can check it out but let us know in the comments what do you think of this laptop and also the whole intel evo platform comment below also give this video a like share with your friends and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos but that's me signing off thanks for watching and i will see
