so [Applause] [Music] hey guys today i'm going to talk about okay i get it hey guys this is page from bboom.com and this is the new oneplus 8t and this is the galaxy s20 fe also pretty new now both of these phones have sleek designs great 120 hertz amino displays and a lot of you guys have been asking us which is the better camera phone of the two i mean the oneplus 8t has improved cameras but can it take on the more flagship like cameras of the galaxy s20 fe well i've been comparing the two so if you want to know the verdict stick to the very end let's begin now first up everyone knows the camera specs in these phones and the oneplus 8t kind of has the upper hand on paper at least when it comes to the megapixels but i've never cared about that and i'm sure you guys don't too so it's all about the camera performance and talking about that in my experience with these phones one thing was pretty clear that they don't have any weird bugs or issues when using the camera app which is also a big factor sometimes so now let's compare the main cameras okay so i've taken a lot of different shots from both of these phones speed indoor shots shots for building shots of landscapes etc to give you guys a better idea so starting off this here is a landscape photo comparison and on first look it's pretty clear that the galaxy s20 fe photo is the more attractive looking with just more richer colors more contrast and in comparison the 80 photo kind of looks dull to be honest also i took this during the golden r and the galaxy s20 fe has captured the whole yellowish tone quite perfectly here's another comparison at this time both the phones have captured very similar photos with similar exposure and very good details as well but the difference lies in the slightly more contrast in the s20 fe photo honestly this is the case with almost all of the photos i took in good lighting see the oneplus 8t almost matches the s20f when it comes to details and the dynamic range as well but the s20 fe almost always has the more pleasing shot and it's not like it's over saturating things it's a very balanced approach i mean just look at the trees in the more shots see how the trees in the galaxy s20 fe shots look more natural and clean and it's not just that i notice when there's harsh lighting the galaxy s20if handles things better especially the shadows for example in this comparison see the lamp post in both the shots see how well exposed the galaxy s20 fe photo is here's another comparison that shows the same so yeah the oneplus 80 is good but in daytime the s20 fe is no doubt the better phone i know that though it's a very close call see most of the time both of these phones take very similar shots now one thing that's important to note here is that the oneplus 8t camera it automatically turns on the night mode when it senses that it's dark which means that sometimes the oneplus 8t takes a couple of seconds to take a shot but it comes up with brighter shots with slightly more details like in this comparison just check out the building in the background or check out this one where the oneplus 8t photo is brighter when it comes to background again so that's the one thing with the oneplus 8t but other than that i think both of these phones are just very close in terms of low light sometimes the s20ft does better with better exposure and sometimes the oneplus 80 takes photos which have a slightly yellowish tone but i wouldn't say it's a massive difference between these two in low light now coming to video quality both the phones support 4k 60fps videos and both the phones shoot good videos which are stable because they both have ois but if we dig deep in the video quality there are some differences i mean this is a 4k video from both the phones and i think the s20 fe video just looks more pleasing and you know more rich just look at the exposure all around be the trees or the cars the s20 fe video just looks more detailed and more flagshipy okay so the ultra wide angle lens now there are a few things that are noted while taking ultra wide angle shots from both of these phones first the galaxy s20 fe has a slightly wider field of view when it comes to ultra wide angle shots as you can see second both the ultra wide angle lenses on both these phones do a very similar and good job when it comes to the details and exposure so that's great but third the biggest difference lies in the colors so talking about that difference i'm talking about the fact that the s20 fees ultra wide angle lens just preserves the colors better to give you a better idea here's a photo from the main lens so just notice the color here in both of these photos now here's the same location with the ultra wide-angle lens so notice how the 80s ultra wide angle lens kind of slightly dims the color yep that's the difference see like i said both these phones do a good job with the ultra wide angle camera but the s20 fe has samsung's flagship feeling color grading and honestly that kind of makes the difference in the end but it's not on s20 fee i generally don't take low light shots from the ultra wide angle lenses but i did it with these phones and turns out the 80 is a lot better in low light as you can see the s20 airfield wide angle shots in low light are kind of messy with noise so that's one better aspect of the oneplus 8 now coming to other cameras in both these phones the oneplus 80 has a macro lens as well as a depth lens and i find both of them practically useless i mean the galaxy s20 fe on the other hand has a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom support and i think you'll agree when i say that having a telephoto lens is just way better than having a depth sensor or a macro sensor comment below if you agree with me i mean the telephoto sensor makes a big difference when you're zooming let me give you an idea so here's a one x zoom shot where both the phones do well because it's pretty usual but now take a look at the 3x zoom shot i see the difference in exposure now i'm not sure what happened to the oneplus 8t i mean yes the s20 fe has 3x optical zoom so it definitely does better but the exposure in the 84 is just gone for a toss but it's not about this i think it's more about the clarity when you zoom so here's a 10x zoom shot now see the difference in clarity this is what the telephoto lens brings and there's also the fact that you can zoom in 30x on the s20 fe and only 10x on the 80s so yeah the telephoto sensor is definitely better than having a micro lens or a dip sensor now there's only one camera section left the front cameras which are important these days because video calls work from home so yep a 16 megapixel sensor versus a 32 megapixel one well first of all it comes with selfies here's a comparison and honestly i like the s20 fe selfie more because it handles the overall exposure better including the background better i also think that the 80 tries to brighten the face more which results in over exposed kind of whitish shots also i did notice that the s20f is selfie camera has a wider field of view like the ultra wide angle lens and that you can see in this photo as for the videos and the mic quality i found the 8t to be slightly better check it out hey guys so here's me recording a video from the oneplus 8t and the galaxy s20 fe simultaneously to check the audio quality from the mic so let me know in the comments which audio you like better i personally thought the oneplus 8t was slightly better but i'd love to know from you guys so comment down below now do note that that was a 1080p video and the s20 fee supports 4k recording from the front camera so that does up the video quality as well now if you're someone who cares about the camera features in devices well both of these phones are pretty feature packed they have the pro mode things like hyperlapse super slow motion portrait mode portrait mode video but yeah the galaxy s20if it does have slightly more features like the single take feature or the pro video feature so yeah that's there so i think that pretty much covers up the important aspects of this camera comparison so time for the verdict which is the better camera phone here the oneplus 8t or the galaxy s20 fe well i think you know the answer it's the galaxy s20 fe see the oneplus 8t cameras are good but the s20 fe is still the better camera phone because it performs like a flagship smartphone from samsung to put it simply it just takes better photos and unlike the oneplus 8t which has gone for the marketing hype with its depth and macro cameras the galaxy s20 fe has the quite useful telephoto lens which actually makes a difference so you have the galaxy s20 fe is the better camera phone for me and i think it's also more of a flagship phone with things like the ip rating wireless charging i know the oneplus 8t has a snapdragon 865 so what do you think of these phones tell us in the comment section below also give this
