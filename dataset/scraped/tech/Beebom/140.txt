[Applause] [Music] so hey guys this is ambient.com and the first developer beat of ios 15 just arrived and i have been trying it out on the iphone 12 pro here and you know what as an android user actually some great features in ios 15 that i really want to see in android well here's what i'm talking about [Music] so first up let's face it android has kind of been lagging behind ios when it comes to privacy features i mean last year we made this video which made a lot of sense and then android 12 ride which sort of bridged the gap but it still has the very useful ask app not to track feature now ios 15 has arrived and it brings even more useful price features first up ios 15 brings app privacy report which is similar to android 12's privacy dashboard feature so i can go to privacy settings on ios 15 and enable record app activity after which this will save a seven day summary of when apps access my location or my it'll also show if any third parties or websites are accessing my info via apps now i enabled this last night but i think it'll show a report after a day or maybe seven days but here's what the report will look like yeah this looks useful right anyway there are more privacy features the mail app has new privacy protection features so when i added my email account i got this prompt with the option to hide my ip address and load emails privately the highbay app at this part is pretty clear but load emails privately means that it'll prevent email tracking so when i open up an email the sender won't get notified that i have opened the email next up safari already has some great privacy features like the privacy report which shows the trackers or website but safari 2 now has an option that lets you hide your ipaddress from trackers which i think is great [Music] i'm talking about safari safari is actually cool now and it's something that i hope google takes inspiration from for you know future chrome updates i mean safari does something that chrome has been sort of confused about since a long long time it brings the address bar to the bottom now how awesome is that as you can see there's now a floating address bar at the bottom which even goes in the background when you scroll down on a website it's pretty cool there are also a number of cool gestures i can swipe left on this bar to open a new tab on the right like this and i can also switch between the tabs by swiping left and right and yeah it's very seamless i know chrome has a gesture too but it's on the address bar on the top making it almost impossible to use anyway i can also swipe up on the address bar to get to the tab switcher like this yeah it's nice now apart from that all the important features are present right here like the reading mode the read later list privacy report and more now one big big feature that safari is bringing on is 15 is extension support yes another feature we have been wanting on chrome now right now most of the extensions on the app store are about ad blocking but i think we'll see a lot of desktop extensions ported to ios when ios 15 stable arrives apart from that i also like the safari start page customization options especially the options inside a background image it's nice [Music] so we all know that google assistant is better than siri yep it's the truth but you know what there's one cd feature in ios 15 that really caught my attention it's the ability to work offline so with ios 15 all the audio requests to siri will be processed on the device and that means it's faster and now also gets a lot of tasks done without the internet watch this open photos open calendar turn on airplane mode yeah that is fast and that's working on airplane mode now i haven't got this working in the beta but this is cool right i mean right now google assistant needs internet to work even for things like timer alarm etc so an offline google assistant for timer alarm changing settings etc would be super handy right anyway another city feature i've come across is the option to share things on the screen for example there's a photo on the screen and i can say hey siri send this to akshay and it will open up this prompt to send it this is cool and when it can't detect a photo or video it'll send a screenshot and i think that's super useful [Music] so ios 15 brings a new live text feature which is basically ocr and yeah it's a lot like google lens but you know what it's implementation in certain areas is what makes it so cool for example i can press hold in a text field anywhere be it messages whatsapp or anywhere else and use this the text from camera option to quickly point the camera to a text and just see how quickly it recognizes the text it's fantastic now i can move the camera around to change the text selection and it does all of that really quickly and i can also tap to copy the text i want either ways this is very fast and very cool so yeah i would love to see this feature on android especially since google lens is also pretty good [Music] sample has made its find my feature even better with ios 15. see in ios 15 an iphone's location is still traceable even when the iphone is turned off yep that's pretty cool and that's due to the new find my network option look it seems that with ios 15 the iphone stays in a low power mode even when it's turned off and it sort of acts like an air tag allowing any nearby ios devices to pick up the bluetooth signal and send back its location that is awesome really because the first thing a thief does is you know turn off the phone plus according to apple the location tracking will even keep working when an iphone is reset to factory settings with activation lock enabled honestly these are features that we really need on android's find my device feature [Music] lastly apple is also introducing some really useful features with icloud plus first up there is private relay which is basically apple's vpn feature this will make sure all traffic from your iphone gets encrypted and not even apple can read them second great feature is hide my email which will basically let you use random disposable email addresses to sign up for things and yeah even send emails without sharing your real email address icloud plus will also let you personalize your icloud mail address with a custom domain name now all of these features are really cool and maybe google can bring something like this in google one i mean the vpn feature and the hide my email feature especially useful so yeah i'd love to see that on android nokias15 brings a lot of other interesting features for example share play looks pretty fun but you know what i was most impressed with the features i just talked about i mean i like the new privacy features which again make android not look so good this offline cd if it seems fast and very handy safari is cool and it actually brings some really great improvements and then there are features like focus and icloud plus yes i'll be honest i really want android to copy these features from ios 15 but i want to know which ios 15 feature do you want on android make sure to comment below also like this
