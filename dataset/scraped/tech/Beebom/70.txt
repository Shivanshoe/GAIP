this is the galaxy s21 fe 5g and this is the indian variant of the phone now i will talk about my first impressions the specs and the features of the s21 fe 5g and also the one important change that the s20 fe 5g indian variant brings so yeah make sure to watch this video till the very end so first of all this is the galaxy s21 fe from the back and as you can see it carries over the same design language as the other s21 phones with a similar contour cut camera module but there are a few minor differences first of all the frame here does not extend to the camera bump and second the camera model has the same finish as the back here are all the s21 fe color variants that we have the olive green the graphite black and the lavender and you can see how all of them have the same color finish on the back as well as the camera module now the frame of the device is aluminium which looks premium and the back is the same matte finish plastic from the s21 but i'm not really complaining because first the finisher looks and feels really good and secondly i like the lightweight nature of the phone i mean the s31 f5g is a little bigger a tad bit bigger when compared to the galaxy s21 here i bought the phone side by side and you can see the fe is bigger but there's no doubt that the s21 fe2 is a compact and lightweight phone apart from that the whole design is ip68 rated for water and dust resistance so you can actually take it for a swim on the front the a21fp has samsung's dynamic amulet 2x display with the 120 hertz refresh rate 19.9 is to 5 aspect ratio 1200 bits of peak brightness hdr 10 plus support and gorilla glass pictures so this is a proper samsung flagship display and it shows in typical samsung style the colors on the display just look really beautiful really vibrant and with the loud stereo speakers the experience of watching movies and shows is great plus the display is really smooth thanks to the 120 hertz refresh rate anyway going to the back once again we have the triple camera setup of the s21 fe and compared to the s21 there's only one change the telephoto lens which is an 8 megapixel sensor instead of the 64 megapixel telephoto camera on the as21 and this change i think is not a big deal because the 8 megapixel sensor here has a ys and it can take 3x optical zoom shots and you can see in these shots that it does a pretty good job the s20 f5g also lacks 8k video recording support which i personally don't really mind i mean 4k 60 fps is more than enough for most of us and the fe supports that anyway the main rear camera remains the same and the 12 megapixel dual pixel camera with ois takes flagship grade photos i mean i have tested this extensively or compared it but from whatever photos i've taken with the fe so far look really good i mean i've been most impressed with the colors in the photos especially in this gloomy cold season so yeah this is promising plus there are all the other high-end features like the dual video feature which lets you record a video from the front and the rear camera at the same time in this pip style or in this big screen style yeah should be good for vlogging the selfie camera is a 22 megapixel sensor instead of the 10 megapixel camera on the s21 series so on paper it's actually upgrade and from the selfies i've taken it seems like a very good selfie camera the exposure is great and i like the details on the face with the 32 megapixel sensor next up the s2d fe packs a 4500 image battery which is a 500 mah pump from the s21 now this makes sense because the fe does have a bigger screen too as fast charging like the s21 the fe has no charge in the box as you can see here but it does support 25 watt fast charging along with fast 15 watt wireless charging which is expected in the flagship phone apart from all the specs and features like i said at the start there is one important change in the s21 fe in the 18 radiant see unlike the s21 fe in the us the indian went into the phone comes with exynos yeah it's true the india variant we have has the exynos 2100 chipset with eight gigs of ram and 256 gb of storage i know a lot of you guys were expecting the snapdragon version but even the s20 fe came with exynos first and then came the s20 fe 5g with snapdragon so yeah i was kind of expecting this anyway it is the exynos 2100 in india and say what you will it is a flagship chipset the same five nanometer chips that samsung uses in the s21 as well as the higher priced s21 ultra so samsung isn't really making a compromise here i mean i can't comment to the long term performance of the s21 fe so early but so far this is a phone that runs like a flagship would it's fast and responsive the gaming is top-notch you get the idea and you know what i'm not gonna complain about samsung not using the snapdragon triple eight because that's not a chipset that has received a lot of positive reviews in fact it's evident from our testing as well as various reports that a lot of triple-a phones have thermal issues apart from all this one thing i like is that the s21 f5g comes with the latest one ui4 update on top of android 12 and that means you get all the new android 12 features like the privacy indicators or the privacy dashboard which samsung has tweaked a bit you also get these new widgets like this clock widget or this calendar widget and there's also teaming based on the wallpaper so i can set this wallpaper and see how the icons change along with the ui elements yeah this is cool we also did a video on have for if you want to check out all the features so yeah there's a link in the description one of your features about samsung has been doing great when it comes to android updates and this is another phone that's promised to get three years of major android updates and four years of security patches which is just great so all in all the galaxy s 20 fe 5g brings all of the s21 features plus a bigger screen a bigger battery and a different telephoto camera now at the time of shooting this video i don't know the price of this phone but you know what a lot depends on the price see i say this because the s20 fe was planned for 2021 but due to the whole chip shortage issues it has arrived now a little late but if price right it can still get ahead of a lot of other android flagships especially because this is a true flagship phone it has a flagship design with features like ip68 water and dust resistance fast wireless charging dual ois a telephoto lens now these are features that a majority of these budget flagships lack be the oneplus 9 or even the upcoming 9rt or even the lower price mi 11x pro or the gt you get the idea plus the s21 fe 5g is a flagship all around it has cameras that seem very very good there's a beautiful 120hz amoled the latest one ui4 on top of android 12 with samsung's four years update promise and there is x-rays which at the end of the day is still a flagship chipset so the galaxy s21 fe is actually a good flagship but like i said a lot depends on the price now i will be adding the price down below so make sure to check it out and also let us know your thoughts on the s21 5g in the
