[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient boom calm and if I had to pick the most exciting gaming phones out there it has to be the ROG phone series well the brand new ROG phone 3 is here and like the previous two ROG phones it packs in some fantastic gaming features its power pack and well there's a lot to talk about so let's get started first up in typical first impressions custom let's see what's in the box ok so you get this cool case and I really like it because I hate those transparent silicon cases there's the Tony Award hyper charge or adapter the USB c2c cables are 3.5 mm the USBC dongle and obviously this the new ROG phone 3 now design-wise let me be frank the RG phone tree is very similar to the ROG phone - if you just look at it I mean it's still a big and hefty phone at 240 grams and that's justified because this way it's still compatible with all the accessories from last year and this way it still packs in all of the crazy ROG phone tech having said that it does have some functional changes first as you can see the RG phone 3 has slightly different patterns on the back but it still has the gaming phone why with the ROG logo that lights up so it's all cool you still get the two USB seaports one on the side and one on the bottom but this time there's no headphone jack yeah that's the reason the phone has the dongle bundled in the box anywhere on the right you have these a triggers and these are air triggers three and they are much better see in the Origin phone one and two these ultrasonic buttons worked as two usual shoulder buttons with tap and slide functions but in ROG phone 3 it's way more functional and you can use it for five more actions let me show you so I'm in the pub t-mobile's controls page so I can just bring up the air triggers function like this and as you can see there's now an option to divide these two buttons into four buttons so they can work as l1 l2 r1 r2 that's all there's also swipe functionality on these buttons so you can swipe left or right to trigger different touch points lastly there is a new motion control feature where you can shake the phone like this to trigger a screen touch as you can see I have said it to reload my gun in the game and I think it's awesome apart from that you can also use these triggers as usual shoulder buttons and the feedback and everything it works really well this is definitely my new go-to pugsy mobile phone and I'm going to try out different control combos in these air triggers to see what works best and if you have the suggestions and that make sure to comment below moving to the front it's similar to with the dual front firing speakers which by the way are even better now because this time there's a seven magnet steel speaker and in my brief time with the phone the speakers have more depth more bass the audio experience is just super impressive there's also a new audio wizard feature with different profiles tune by direction anyway the big change on the front is the display this is a 6.5 inch F HD Plus AMOLED panel with HDR 10 plus support Gorilla Glass 6 but the highlight is the fact that this is an insanely fast 144 Herz display with 2 and 70 Hertz touch sampling rate and everything else has been improved to be the touch latency or the slight latency now this is my first time using a 144 Hertz panel on a smart phone and it's a beautiful experience trust me you have to use it to believe it the UI here is just crazy smooth I mean I'm sure asus has optimized the UI for the 144 has a refresh rate because the phone seems crazy responsive and every animation is just buttery smooth and you can feel it now to be honest 144 Hertz is probably overkill because popular games like pop G mobile asphalt or C or t-mobile don't support it but interestingly ezel sent us a list of more than hundred games that support the 144 was refreshed it including some public games like Altos adventure beach buggy racing modern combat shadows and legends dead trigger 2 and more you can check out the full list from an article in the link below now it did play some beach buggy racing and Altos adventure on the RG phone 3 and when the gameplay was smooth and the game looked beautiful on the screen so yeah at least the 144 hours display is fun when the game is supported either ways like I said I'm sure popular games aren't supported yet so in that case there is an option to conserve battery life by setting the refresh rate to auto 60 90 or even 120 as for the quality of the AMOLED panel it does seem great with very accurate color rendering and it's very bright so I'm positive apart from that you still get all the tech here like the for Wi-Fi antenna four microphones with noise cancellation the game cool three heat dissipation system which is said to have a six times larger heat saying redesigned copper 3d vapor chamber and a large a graphite film well I'll definitely be putting the cooling system to test here in the next few days oh and yes it also has this notification LED which is very rare these days and I love it moving on to the under the hood hardware the ROG phone 3 is quite possibly the most powerful Android flagship right now just look at the specs so it's got the updated snapdragon 865 plus chipset up to 12 GB of lpddr4 RAM and up to 256 GB of u FS 3.1 storage all top-of-the-line specs now if you're wondering what does the 865 plus ring was as the 865 well let me just show you so the snapdragon 865 plus is cry of 585 cpu can boost up to a maximum of three point one gigahertz clock speed compared to two point eight gigahertz on the regular 865 now cpu 2 has been overclocked the adrenal 650 GPU has 10% faster rendering in the 865 + apart from that the 865 + has the more updated standards like Wi-Fi 6 see compared to Wi-Fi 6 on the 865 Andrew to the 5.2 compared to bluetooth 5.1 well that's pretty much all the difference between the a 65 + n8 65 and I know to be honest it's not a big deal as everyone makes it out to be but yeah it's the new cutting-edge platform so it's good to have on the lg phone 3 now we aren't allowed to show you the benchmark just yet or do any comparisons you will have to stay tuned for that as a pub demobilize the graphics options the a 65 plus supports a maximum setting of HDR graphics and extreme frame rates and add this setting to the game runs smooth and nice as for the software onboard the phone has Android 10 here and other than the optional rog team the UI and apps are mostly from stock camera and I love the fact that there's absolutely no bloatware whatsoever Jesus does add handy features like water dock mode support different tools like to in apps a one-hand mode a screen recorder and more but that's pretty much it plus there's the amazing armory create app where you can see the GPU and CPU speed the temperature of the device and more widely export the performance boosting mode is turned off and also customize different things including the air triggers game genie the order lighting on the back of the phone and more movie monitoring comes to the battery the ROG phone tree keeps the massive 6000 image battery which is awesome and the good news is that the phone will come with the 30 what hyper charger in the box with every single radio now I'm honestly positive about the charging and the battery performance of the ROG phone tree but what's also exciting are the advanced battery customization features in the software as you can see there are different battery modes here and you can create a custom battery saving profile there are also new battery saving options where you can stop unnecessary apps mean I have from auto starting and hibernate apps there's also battery care you can turn on slow charging or a dual charging at nights so the battery span is longer these are pretty interesting features I think next up I want to talk about the cameras now I know the cameras are never the highlight in ROG phones because these are proper gaming phones but hey the RG phone tree brings an upgraded camera setup that sounds pretty capable on paper well it's a triple camera setup including the 64 megapixel Sony imx6 86 sensor 13 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens and a 5 megapixel macro let's the cameras here are also pretty exciting on the video front because the ROG phone tree has support for 8k video recording yes 8k support is here and there's a pro video mode as well and I'm going to test out coming to the pricing now the ROG food to last year launched at a crazy good price but with the GST increase the cost of the 865 plus with 5g I'm not expecting the ROG phone 3 to be priced as low as the ROG phone - in fact if you ask me I think it should be somewhere around 45 to 50 thousand apiece considering all of the top-of-the-line specs and features the phone comes in and even though it's too early to judge at that price - I think the food could be an interesting flagship point yes the gaming phone is not for everyone specially because of a beastly look and feel and I'm yet to truly test this phone extensively but if you're excited for the ROG phone 1 & 2 like me you would find the ROG phone to the exciting as well well those are my first thoughts on the new ROG phone 3 and if you're wondering about all the accessories that you get like the cool fan the twin doc those accessories have been
