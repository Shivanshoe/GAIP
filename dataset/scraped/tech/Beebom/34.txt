windows 11 takes up 27 gb of storage windows 11 lite takes up 5 gb of storage windows 11 has 43 apps pre-installed windows 11 lite has 5 apps pre-installed windows 11 needs at least 4 gb of ram windows 11 lite 256 mb ram pretty cool right i know see windows 11 is good i like the modern look the cool new features but let's face it windows is too heavy now and it shows even on brand new budget laptops where the experience just goes out of the window the moment you open the box i think you'll relate to this i mean this is the primary reason why i like chrome os flex so much but most people i think just pray for windows over chrome os or anything else it just feels like they are in the natural habitat this is where the lightweight build of windows 11 comes in so windows 11 lite is a build based on windows 11 21 h2 and it's created by a developer called nil carpa majumdar and this build is actually great just check out the minimum system requirement 64 64-bit cpu and it does not require tpm or secure boot and as i mentioned earlier it can run on systems with as low as 256 mb ram this is a big difference compared to the minimum system requirements of full-blown windows 11. in fact there are other custom builds of windows 11 and a lot of them are aimed at power users or gamers and the windows 11 light builds out there can't match the no system requirements of this build and some are just heavily skinned now there is tiny windows 10 which is popular and also very good but it is windows 10 not windows 11 so i'm gonna skip that so coming back to windows 11 lite we installed it on this laptop which has these modest specs yeah this is the same laptop on which we installed chromers flex and you know what windows 11 lite makes a good difference to this laptop so as far as user experience goes all the basic things work fine like the wi-fi bluetooth speakers and mic the start menu is here and you do get the standard windows 11 features there's the windows 11 search the windows level task switcher i also noticed that windows 11 multitasking features work too here i am switching between apps why are all tab video snapping works too but the ui is different probably because the usual windows level snapping ui is too intensive it's fine i think because snapping works and that's what's important you also get most of the windows 11 settings like the new dark mode themes the new wallpapers you get the idea so windows 11 lite takes up only five gigs of your storage space and that's because it only packs up the essential apps that you really really need in your day-to-day usage here's a list of the apps in windows 11 lite and yeah there's only these apps and these tools that's all and yes they work absolutely fine exactly like you'd expect on windows 11. now there's no microsoft store or edge office apps or even windows defender although you can install these separately there's also no android app support on linux support but you can add the functionality if you need to you do get firefox and an antivirus along with a bootable file so you can quickly install and get browsing which is a plus in my opinion another reason for the low storage usage of this light build is compression windows 11 light by default takes up 8 gb of space but the developer recommends that after you install windows 11 lite you run this compressor that's available on the home screen you can also run this compressor after windows update but i would suggest you to just disable windows updates altogether now after the compression the developer also recommends to turn off file paging and after doing this the storage used is less than 5gb which is great so the performance right i mean that's what most of us want from my laptops to just work in a non-laggy way so how does this build perform first of all the difference in startup time is huge regular windows 11 takes up two minutes 10 seconds to boot up after shutdown on this laptop and windows 11 lite took one minute 30 seconds now that's a difference of 40 seconds which is big windows 11 light also uses less cpu and ram this is windows 11 the regular one and even on idle the windows 11 cpu usage easily is 70 80 percent in fact cpu jumps 100 at times with random windows services popping up on idle i don't know what's going on the ram usage is as you can see 59 compared to that in windows 11 lite on idle cpu usage is less than 10 and the ram usage is around 40 percent that's a big difference now what's interesting is that since it does not have any extra apps and services from regular windows 11 there's no strain on the cpu does the low cpu usage i also check the cpu on ram usage with multiple apps so i have five chrome tabs open and then there are apps like paint.net file explorer notepad task manager also open now in this scenario on regular windows 11 the cpu usage goes from 45 to 80 percent the ram usage is somewhere in the 80s now in windows 11 lite with the same apps open the cpu usage is in between 10 to 20 while the ram usage is 70 i know the ram usage is not very less compared to regular windows 11 but the cpu usage is way less and that's what makes a big difference on low end laptops the stress apart in my usage i just felt that windows 11 lite on this laptop was just more responsive see generally it just feels a bit more smoother on the windows 11 light build apps open a bit quicker and i noticed that windows 11 lite does not have any animations which really in your brain makes it feel faster too in fact i also installed some third-party apps like chromepaint.net and these apps just felt a tad bit faster i mean i had chrome with 10 tabs open and six images and paint.net open in the background and the performance is good enough as you can see all in all i think this light version of windows 11 is somewhere in between a proper windows 11 build and chrome os as far as user experience goes it doesn't really make a big difference in benchmarks and even the battery performance where it does and will make a difference is for users who have a budget laptops or the ones about to throw away their own laptops just because you know they take forever to do simple tasks from windows 11 see overall windows 11 lite is a little bit better on performance it's better on privacy and it's obviously a lot cleaner anyway there's one last important thing to note before installing any unofficial windows 11 build you should make sure that the build is free from any malware so without a standard malwarebyte scan and it just found these two registry modifications now these are modifications to stop another microsoft service called microsoft malicious software removal tool from running once in a month now i'm assuming that the developer has made these modifications to make sure that this lightweight build isn't bogged down by another microsoft service but if you have doubts you should instead debloat the windows 11 build you have i've added the links to both how to install the windows 11 lite build or how to deep load windows 11 completely so you can check out both the links from the description down below well it's common time ask away any questions or doubts that you have in the comments down below and we'll try to answer them also give this video a like make sure to share it with all your friends who have budget old windows laptops and are suffering with the windows experience they need this this is off but they need this thanks for watching i'll see in the next one hit like each one of these have a spy cam in there yeah all of these i will show you the smallest and the most dangerous [Music] you
