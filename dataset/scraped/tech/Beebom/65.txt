[Music] ever since kovit we have been using our laptops a lot more and you know what today i'm going to tell you some super useful laptop gadgets that will make your life a whole lot easier now actually 10 gadgets and fourth one is my absolute favorite but they're also a couple of gadgets that are just super useless and you should stay away from them so yeah let's begin [Music] [Applause] [Music] most people are working from home these days and chances are you have set up a monitor a mechanical keyboard you know a proper work setup and in that case a laptop dock can come in really handy i mean you can close your laptop put it into this and continue using a laptop while saving space on your desk pretty cool right plus if you have one of those thick laptops you can just adjust this into whatever size you want for a perfect fit i also like the solid aluminium alloy build of this dock and the non-slip silicon mat inside as well as the base the price 1200 rupees [Music] are you guys tired of your mom coming to your room and yelling at you to clean up the god damn room and get rid of the messy wires well i'm not sure about cleaning the room but you can fix the goddamn wires see this wire bin is great you can put in the extension board here plug in all your wires and just close it and voila you're more mainstream no more i mean here's a before and after of my desk and as you can see it's clean and nice as for the price you can't really put a price on your peace of mind but you can't put a price on this and i just 800 rupees hit like if you like this [Music] there are times when you need a secondary screen to keep track of the cricket math scores your to-do list your bitcoin investments loan a dual screen laptop would be cool for that but for all of us who cannot afford a dual screen laptop which is basically all of us the next best thing is this yeah this is a magnetic laptop phone holder you stick it on your laptop here and then just pull this out and place your phone right on there how does it work magnets yeah you need this on your phone too now this is great because i use it to take work calls check scores you get the idea the price around 500 rupees [Music] when you're working from home there are times when you get into these weird seating situations you know what i'm talking about and in that case enter the lab desk this is pretty cool you can carry it along like a briefcase and feel all professional jokes apart it has this soft cushioning on the back so you can comfortably rest it on your lap then you have the space for the laptop a mouse pad is there next to it and you even get a sort of phone holder thingy here now this is actually useful because it's a flat surface your laptop rests easily on it and you can work on your couch for long periods as of the price this is around 800 rupees and yeah i like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] the next laptop gadget is for times when you can't really charge your laptop this is when you need this power bank it's a 20 000 mah usb pd 3.0 50 watt power bank from xiaomi that could charge usb c laptops at 45 watts i tried charging akshay's macbook air and it took the laptop from 10 to 40 in 30 minutes which is pretty good because a power bank is something you'll use as an emergency charger so yeah this is good plus this power bank looks good has multiple usb ports and it comes with a usb c2c cable in the box when it comes to price it costs 3700 rupees you must have seen all kind of stupid weird laptop cleaner thingies right well check this out this looks good it has a super soft brush on one side and a microfiber pad on the other side so it's basically a two in one laptop cleaner that's actually a two in one waste of your money i mean this cost three thousand rupees and it can't clean sh trademates do the brush kind of works fine for cleaning the crumbs of your keyboard but if you have a macbook i'm pretty sure your screen looks like this and if you want to clean it off with this yeah good luck with that so don't buy this [Music] laptop webcams suck i mean no matter if you have a budget laptop a cheap chromebook or a high-end premium laptop all the webcams suck i mean a good webcam is a must these days with all the video calls meetings we attend this is the lenovo 300 fhd webcam and it's pretty good this make sure you don't look like this in a video call instead this makes you look like this yeah this is way better in terms of sharpness details and colors it's a plug and play webcam that works with both windows and mac and it has 2 megapixel 95 degree wide sensor with 1080p support and has dual mics for better audio quality i also like that you can mount it anywhere tilt it around and there's also a privacy shutter in there to be honest there are better webcams at higher prices but this is pretty good at 2000 apiece a lot of laptops especially gaming laptops are pretty hot and not in a good sexy way i'm talking about throttling issues heating issues and whatnot and if you have a laptop like that you need a good cooling pad like this see this one has five fans one big one in the center and four smaller fans surrounding it and actually cool things this is a laptop without this cooling pad after 3dmark benchmark and this is the laptop with the cooling pad as you can see from the red zones it actually makes a difference the cooling pad also has these blue leds and you get the small screen and buttons using which you can control the fan speed the lights and more this whole cooling pad is also height adjustable with multiple angles that also help in heat dissipation and it has two usb ports the price 2000 rupees [Music] if you have a budget laptop with no fingerprint scanner and the only reason you're planning to upgrade your laptop is because you want a fingerprint scanner well first of all you dum-dum and second you can instead buy this 2000 rupees fingerprint scanner you can just plug this in your laptop set up the software and then add your fingerprints in the windows hello settings then you can unlock your laptop like this you can also use it to lock your folders and files but the software here just plain sucks so maybe not if you don't have the patience [Music] this is not exactly a laptop gadget but trust me it'll help you use your laptop i mean you know how annoying it is when the power goes off the router goes off and then the backup generator starts and the router restarts and then the power comes back so the generator goes off again and then the router starts yeah you know what i mean i mean in this whole story you're just sitting with your laptop on the lap desk waiting for the internet i know it feels like eternity now if you relate to this you should buy this power bank for the route at rp 1600 this makes sure your router keeps running without any lag even when there's a pocket it's basically a ups for routers and it supports most routers from different brands so yeah pretty good well i know what you're thinking these laptop gadgets are super useful i should share this video well i like the way you think also for people thinking about
