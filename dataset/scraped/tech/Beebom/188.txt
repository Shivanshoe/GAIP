[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bbm.com and another indian smartphone brand is making a comeback i'm talking about lava with its new z series smartphones which by the way are customizable and upgradeable yeah i'm going to talk about that but right now i want to talk about this the new lava z6 this is the one and ever since love and all these new cc smartphones i've been wanting to check them out so yeah let's check this out so here's the new lava z6 in the aqua blue radiant that we have and the back here is plastic which is kind of expected at this price but i like this color there's also this sort of a pattern on the back which makes the phone more grippy and hey no camera that is nice there's also fingerprint scanner on the back here which is very fast so that's good and now moving to the front this is the display that you get the z6 has a 6.5 inch hd plus ips lcd with gorilla glass 3 and as you can see there's a teardrop notch and a chain at the bottom as for the display quality i would have liked a full hd display but that apart i've only used the phone for a day but so far the display looks good now the colors are fairly vibrant and the display is decently bright for outdoor usage now there is one thing see the phone only has the wide wine l3 license so you can't watch netflix or prime in hd coming back to the design i think the lava z6 is a pretty comfortable phone to hold it's nine millimeters thick and it weighs around 190 grams and apart from that there's the headphone jack and the usb c port on the bottom a single speaker right here on the back and there's the dual sim plus micro sd dedicated slots right here now coming to what's inside this phone i think you already know the specs but here they are now the lava z series is powered by the mediatek helio g35 chipset the 12 nanometer processor with features like the hyper engine gaming tech and there's 6gb ram and 64gb storage i like the 6gb ram option because you don't get that much in the sub 10k range now when it comes to the real one performance that's something i can only judge after using the phone as my daily driver but so far it's been fine as for the software there's stock android here there's android 10 and it's a beautiful clean experience i mean this is the app drawer of the phone out of the box and as you can see they are only the important apps there is an fm radio app a sound recorder app a lava guide app and facebook which you can uninstall by the way but yeah that's about it honestly this is how budget phones and low end phones should be clean and nice now coming to the features there are obviously stock android features but there are a few nifty additions so there's face unlock which works fine there's also screen recorder built-in so that's nice so these are a few additions but overall it's a very stock experience and i really like that moving on to the cameras there's a 13 megapixel main camera a 5 megapixel ultra wide angle camera and a 2 megapixel depth sensor along with a 16 megapixel camera on the front now here are some camera samples from the phone to be honest this is a low end phone so i'm not expecting out of the world camera performance but yeah i will test things out so far the photos look kind of decent-ish with a few issues here and there but that's kind of expected at this price lastly the battery the lava z6 has a fairly big 5000 mah battery so the battery performance should be pretty sorted as for the charger there's only a 10 watt charger in the box so yeah no fast charger here apart from that there's one thing i noticed on the connectivity front and that is the fact that the lava z6 only supports 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi networks anyway that was sort of our first look and first impressions of the lava z6 which is prices rupees nine triple nine now one thing to note here is that the lava z2 z4 or z6 they all have the exact same design and they're pretty identical in terms of specifications as well well the difference between these phones is in the number of cameras the storage and the ram that's it so basically the lava z6 should give you a good idea of all of these new z series phones now another interesting thing about the lava z6 or basically any other lava z series phones is that they are customizable with the new myz program so here is the myz customization page and as you can see there are five steps here first i can choose the camera setup i can choose from a dual camera setup or get triple cameras then there's the front camera where there should have been an option to choose between 8 and 16 megapixel but i'm only getting 16 megapixels so i'm gonna go with that i can also choose the ram three four or six gb i'm going with six there are also storage options 32 64 and 128 gb and lastly there's the option to choose the color now once you've done all of that you get the price so this is good right the ability to you know customize your phone i mean this is definitely kind of just a start but i really hope in the future we get to choose things like say the chipset or you know the screen type or even the screen resolution now that would be pretty awesome right this could also put an end to rebranded phones because a lot of companies just increase the ram or increase the storage or just change a single camera and launch it as a new phone so this could put an end to that there's also the z up program which is very interesting so using the zer program users can actually upgrade their z series phones ram and storage later on by visiting a lava service center and this is an on the spot upgrade so it won't take a lot of time i mean this is great because there are a lot of times when you realize later that you need more storage or more ram overall i'm just really glad that another indian smartphone brand is making a comeback the lava z series is obviously a first-gen product but i like the effort lava is making especially with the new add-ons like the myz program and the z-up program which i hope lava continues to improve and as for the z6 i will be using it as my daily driver to see how good the performance is compared to other phones in this price so yeah let's see how it goes but what do you guys think of the new lava z series the new z up and the myz program tell us in the comments down
