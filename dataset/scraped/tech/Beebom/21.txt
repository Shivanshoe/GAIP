the asus zenbooks have always been good to work laptops and now this is here this is the asus zenbook 14 oled and this brings up to the design the screen the cpu the random storage basically everything so is this like the thin and light windows laptop that you should be buying i'll answer that and i'll also show you this very cool space edition laptop so don't miss that okay so let's start with the design asus has finally done away with the whole concentric circle design on the lid instead there's this new design that features these lines to form the new asus logo and there's the asus zenbook branding in the corner which is minimal overall i think this looks very classy and premium and this whole build is aluminium alloy with the military grade certification and this finish is a bit of a fingerprint magnet but apart from that i like how it kind of shines when light falls on it the interior of the laptop has the same aluminium alloy finish but the keyboard has been toned black which i think looks better the ergo lift hinges here and it can go to 180 degrees now the hinge is also aluminium alloys so it's solid and has this glossy finish with these shiny caps which look pretty good also the lid can be opened with one hand which is always good to see apart from this there are vents on the left and at the bottom the fingerprint scanner is in the power button which weirdly is not placed in the corner instead it's next to the delete button now like most zbooks this 2 is a very sleek and lightweight laptop it's very slim at 16.9 millimeters thickness and is also very lightweight at 1.39 kg coming to the display first of all the bezels are quite narrow but they have this plastic finish which is kind of okay for a laptop that otherwise looks very premium as for the display this is where the font begins this is a 14 inch oled display with the 90 hertz refresh rate and a high 2.8k resolution now this display is a big highlight because first it's a sharp and bright oled panel with a typical brightness of 400 nits and it can go to 550 nits with hdr mode second it's a beautiful one at display with d black solid color accuracy and a very high contrast ratio honestly this display is just ab beat for watching movies and shows or even when doing things like photo editing because it has 100 dc ipc coverage and 123 percent srgb coverage apart from this this is a 16-10 display which a lot of people like and the 90 hertz refresh rate is also great because windows 11 just feels smooth on this display one thing to note this is a glossy screen so it's a bit reflective but it's not a big deal if you ask me moving on the zenbook 14 on it also brings upgrades under the hood this is an intel evo certified laptop and it's powered by the new 12 gen intel chipsets there are core i5 and core i7 variants and our variant has the core i7 1260p chipset with 12 cores including four performance cores and eight efficiency cores there's also 16 threads and the cpu can go up to 4.7 gigahertz as of the gpu it's the iris xc graphics and the ram and ssd have been upgraded to its latest fast lpddr5 ram and there's the newest pci 4.0 storage that delivers crazy fast transfer speeds i mean here's the crystal this marks score and you can see how good the read and write speeds are anyway also run other benchmarks like pc mark 10 cinebench and the scores of the laptop are good now the benchmarks are fine but what's really important is that the real world usage of this laptop is very good the laptop boots up to the lock screen in 10 seconds and then goes to the desktop in just a couple of seconds so it is fast as for our usage everything has been lag free and at times we had a lot of chrome tabs open 4k video playing image editor open in the background and there was no stutter or anything we even tested photoshop on the laptop and the performance with multiple layers long usage was smooth and nice basically the newer chipset and the fast ram and storage combo making sure that everything works lag free as for thermals the laptop is mostly silent now we did open up the laptop and here you can see the soldered ram the ssd which by the way is upgradable and there's also the fan and the heatsink anyway coming to the other aspects of the laptop the zenbook 14 oled has a backlit chiclet keyboard with 1.4 millimeter key travel and the keyboard is nice and comfortable to use with really good feedback and good spacing between the keys the touchpad is also big and responsive and it's actually asus number pad 2.0 so you can hit this button and get this numpad and you can hit the top left button to increase and decrease the brightness i can also slide from this button to open the calculator quickly moving on there are two speakers in the bottom with harman kardon certification and the speakers are fairly loud and there's even a little bit of depth here overall i'd say the speakers could have been a little better if we take the macbook speakers as a benchmark but for laptop speakers they are decent the camera is a usual 720p webcam and here's a video from it this is a video from the front camera of the zenbook 14. tell us how you like it and if you're enjoying this video so far make sure to hit like below welcome support there is a lonely usb a port on the left and the right has two thunderbolt 4 ports which support usbc charging and also work as display port there is also an hdmi 2.0 port a 3.5 mm combo jack and a micro sd reader on the connectivity front there is wi-fi 6e and bluetooth 5.2 the battery is a decent 75 watt battery and there is a 65 watt fast charger in the box now asus claims battery life for up to 18 hours which is a lot but i think more practically you're looking at seven to eight hours of battery life with this laptop when it comes to software there is windows 11 with the usual windows apps and there is the useful my asus app but that's it there's no weird bloatware here now before i compare the zenbook 14 only to other laptops in the same price range let me show you the asus zenbook 14x space edition which is super cool and by the way it's not the same laptop the 14x space edition has these specs but its usb has to be the design this is how the laptop looks like it features these cool space themed graphics on the lid the palm rest and even on the keyboard you must have also noticed this delete features this 3.5 inch oled display that's inspired by a data sheet of a spaceship now this is totally customizable so you can set it to space mode which shows this you can set it to show the time and date music equalizer or even a custom message so the space edition is definitely cool but coming back to the zenbook 14 oled the variant we have has launched in india rupees one lakh four thousand nine ninety and what i like about this laptop is that if you compare this with the likes of the dell xps the hp envy this is better in terms of specs here's the comparison and the zenpo 14 all it has the higher resolution oled screen it has the newer fast chipset faster ram faster ssd and a bigger battery overall this nb14 oled is a solid upgrade from last year and it kind of sets the bar for upcoming 14 inch ultrabooks now i'm sure other brands will be launching their 2022 ultrabooks in india soon and we will surely compare them to the zen book once they arrive in the meanwhile i want to know what you guys think of the zen book 14 on it so comment down below what you think of this laptop at this price and yeah give this video like make sure to
