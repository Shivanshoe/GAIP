[Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and let's face it we all love wallpapers it's like the simplest customization but the right wallpaper can really bring your home screen to life but which is that right wallpaper well to help you guys out today i'll be showing you the coolest wallpapers i have used on android and you can just watch the video pick the ones you like and then apply them on your phone also do note that i'll be talking about my favorite live wallpapers amulet wallpapers abstract wallpapers vector wallpapers photography wallpapers and a lot more so make sure to stick till the end because i'm going to start with my favorite live wallpapers frankly there are a lot of cool live wallpapers on android but i mostly don't use them because they drain the battery a lot now there are actually two live wallpapers that i use and these are not battery hogs and secondly they look awesome first one is this live wallpaper which is the most minimal lightweight and clean live wallpaper i have ever used now what's live about this is that it shows you minimal colors that change according to the time of the day here's the time lapse of how it changes over the day yeah that is beautiful and the name of this live wallpaper is valo so you should check it out the other live wallpaper i use looks like this yes this is a wallpaper based on the map of my current location and yeah this actually looks great this is from an app called cartogram and this app lets you use your location as a map based live wallpaper now the map wallpaper i'm using isn't exactly live but you can enable the live option although that requires the location all the time because it changes the wallpaper depending on your location another cool thing is that apart from your location you can search for any iconic location as your wallpaper there are also a lot of different color styles to choose from and i had no idea a map on my home screen would look as good as this now live wallpapers are cool but when it comes to simple standard wallpapers amoled friendly wallpapers are something that i personally use a lot i mean most budget phones the good budget phones and the mid-range phones come with amoled panels and if you have a phone with an amulet display you are gonna love these wallpapers and don't worry i'll be sharing the source as well so first up i love this wallpaper this just hits the spot it's minimal it's mostly black perfect for amoled and it has this rainbow sort of pattern in the center which is great for me because it does not really interfere with my icons so yes this is beautiful another amulet wallpaper i really like is this one which has this moon over the hills i think this is gorgeous and i know it's not totally black but i still think it's app for amulets now if you're wondering where i get these really cool amoled wallpapers well i don't really use an app instead i'm using the amulet background subreddit where a lot of people add some of the best amoled wallpapers i have ever seen in fact apart from the couple of wallpapers i just showed you i also love this star wars wallpaper from the subreddit and i also like this wallpaper of a porsche this is beautiful right and i don't really go to reddit to check out these wallpapers one by one i instead use this app called wallpapers from reddit but i have added the subreddit and it just brings me all the wallpapers one by one i also like that the app changes the wallpaper automatically from time to time and i also use it to blur a wallpaper decrease the wallpapers brightness to make it more amoled friendly so this is a really handy app apart from amulet wallpapers i'm also a big fan of colorful vector based art wallpapers because first they look good on most phones and second they really bring out the colors in the display so here's one of my favorite wallpapers of all time as you can see it's minimal nothing too flashy but really really cool i mean this looks clean and nice on every single phone i have applied it to the next wallpaper i like is this space vector artwork and this is just so vibrant and really brightens things up on the home screen as you can see here's another vector artwork that i really think is cool and this you must have seen in our other videos as well here's one more from my lot of favorite vector wallpapers and yeah these are awesome wallpapers now my source for these vector wallpapers are two apps one is unusual wallpapers where the developer adds two new wallpapers every week and this has some really interesting you know unusual wallpapers the second source is the backdrops app which is my go-to app for all sort of wallpapers i mean most wallpapers that you see in our first impressions and review videos are from backdrops and a lot of you guys always ask which wallpaper app you're using and yeah this is it now backdrops is great because it's not just about vector wallpapers i like the pattern wallpapers it brings like this one and even brings stock wallpapers from other manufacturers like this dark windows 11 wallpaper which also looks great on a phone yeah these are really good and i also use it for some really cool abstract wallpapers now talk about abstract wallpapers backdrops is great for that but there are a couple of other abstract wallpapers that i feel are really stunning first check this out this is so epic right it makes me feel like my phone is more powerful now jokes apart here's another one and check out another abstract wallpaper now these wallpapers are actually really great and they are from the guy who designs oneplus beautiful abstract wallpapers along with wallpapers for the paranoid rom here's an app called abstract and it has the most beautiful collection of abstract wallpapers no doubt as you can see there are so many stunning wallpapers here that i really love so yeah highly recommend it lastly i also like using scenic photographs as wallpapers on my phone from time to time so let me show you my favorite photography wallpapers so this is something i really like because this is a stunning photo now here's another photo i like and i know this one's not very fancy but this brings a very cool clean look to the home screen while also looking really nice now check out this next photo too which looks really great as a wallpaper now i do get some good photography wallpapers from backdrops as well but the primary app for photography wallpapers is definitely volpe which uses unsplash as its source and that means so many really good photos to choose from well those are some of the coolest wallpapers i've come across and some of the coolest sources of wallpapers on android but i know it's wallpapers it's a very subjective thing
