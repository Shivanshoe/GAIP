[Music] if you use a samsung smartphone and you like customization you probably heard about samsung good luck i mean it's an app that brings a ton of customization features for practically everything in one ui now every year good luck gets updated to support the latest one ui update and bring in some really cool features well good luck 2022 is here it supports one ui4 but more importantly it brings a ton of cool new features if you are one ui user you need to watch this video so let me take it one by one my favorite good luck module has always been home up so home up as you guys know lets you customize the home screen home screen folders but i like it most because of its task changer aka recent screen options here's the app let's change the multitasking screen to a grid or a vertical list or a list like this anyway home up with the new update is getting a much needed feature so let's face it most of us don't like swiping horizontally in the one ui app drawer well this option changes the app drawer style from horizontal to vertical see this this is much better but it's still kind of in early stages i say that because this priority app section on the top cannot be removed and i don't like this also i can't go back to the home screen with the usual swipe down i have to use the back gesture hopefully this can be fixed because a vertical lab draw option is actually great the next module i want to talk about is nice shot which lets you customize screen record and screenshot options and this year it's gotten way better first of all there are these new options to make sure the screenshots you take do not get copied in the clipboard yeah handy and the second option make sure you don't get cropping suggestions while editing a screenshot now the new option i find more handy is this add delete button this brings a delete button here to this toolbar when you take a screenshot this is handy because i take a lot of accidental screenshots especially with the weird power of combos now i think you'll relate to it now with this i can just delete any wrong or accidental screenshot quickly that's all my shot is also bringing some new features for screen recording first of all there's an option to automatically turn on do not disturb when taking a screen record so that notifications don't get in the way of your screen records there are also new selfie video options so you know how the one ui screen recorder lets you record your face too in this small kind of circle you can double the size of this in night shot not just that if you have a green screen or blue screen you can make the background of the selfie video transparent there's also auto detect background color which did not work for me but hey i like these new features the next module that has gotten a really good update is theme park now theme park as the name suggests is all about theming and when one ui 4.0 arrived it brought support for third party icon packs to the one ui launcher both from the galaxy store as well as the play store now with the 2022 update it lets you change app icons individually three dot menu change app icons now i can select any app and change its icon from the gallery or one of the third-party icon packs yeah super handy anyway it's not just icons another new good law feature is you can also get wallpapers like this with the whole parallax effect i mean i'm not a big fan of using my own face as wallpapers but this is what demo purpose is only so basically with the wonderland module you can just select a portrait mode photo like this one go to image settings and enable motion effect you can see the preview here now you can set this as your wallpaper and if you want there's also a new option to add a 3d effect to these photos another module that a lot of you guys use is one hand operation plus that lets you totally customize the gestures you can basically use the sides for not just one back gesture but more as you can see and all of this is customizable now one of the things that everyone uses is this quick tools page to quickly change the brightness use these toggles and this quick tools page is number refined to be in line with one ui4 and it also supports the colors from the wallpaper theming feature now this is good but there are a couple of new actions in gestures this move screen which moves the entire screen around and magnifies it through a small circle it's a little confusing but what's useful is this keyboard shortcuts option that lets you use a gesture to use a keyboard shortcut let me show you so i have set the diagonal of gesture to use keyboard shortcuts so in chrome i can do this gesture to get these shortcuts to open a new tab close tab go to previous tab switch tabs yeah this is good but you can also customize the keyboard shortcuts to only have one of these so i've set it to open a new tab and i can just do this gesture and it opens up a new tab let me do it again yeah i think this is super handy and it works in chrome youtube samsung's browser and you can add any app you want here hit like below if you think this feature is really cool moving on to the next one there's sound assistant this lets you customize the whole volume panel set volumes for apps individually change tracks with the volume button yeah this is feature pack but this year it's kind of getting fun the new feature in sound assistant is the voice changer feature so basically you have all these different voice effects let me try it out like this video right now like this video right now like this video right now like this video right now so the effects are kind of okay honestly not very good but another new feature in sound assistant is the ability to customize the volume panel index mode now apart from these major updates a lot of other modules have gotten a few features keys cafe the super cool module with these really cool keyboard effects now lets you create your own stickers just add anything from the gallery and it will show up in the stickers section of the samsung keyboard clock face the model to customize the aod and the lock screen clock will now be able to sync the clock on the phone with the galaxy watch it's not currently working for me right now but it should be a cool feature to use multi-star module is also getting a lot better in fact it's bringing a launcher to the galaxy z flip series cover screen so you can run media apps maps on the cover screen we don't have the z flip 3 with us otherwise this would have been a cool feature to check anyway so that was good lock 2822 and you know what the new features are just insanely good the vertical app drawer is something i've always wanted the delete button in screenshot toolbar is just super useful the option to set gestures to keyboard shortcuts is a great new feature i mean good luck is basically a voluntary project by samsung developers who work on these new features in their spare time so it's amazing to see how far it has come with all of its features if you ask me it definitely makes the one ui experience a lot better honestly if you haven't tried out good lock you're missing out a lot so make sure to try it and
