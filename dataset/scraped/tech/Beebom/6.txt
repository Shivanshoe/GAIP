this samsung phone deserves your attention right now you're probably wondering which phone is this right this is the galaxy m52 5g that originally launched in india back in october 2021 at rupees 29 triple nine but right now this is available for rupees 20 triple nine yeah this is the listing and you know what this pricing makes things interesting i mean we all know how samsung phones in the mid range and the budget segment have at least one big compromise where the galaxy m52 is actually a good all-around smartphone and a 21k this is a samsung phone that actually beats the competition i mean here the specs of the galaxy m52 versus the newer moto g82 and the redmi note 11 pro plus now all of these phones have their advantages as you can see but the m52 beats them due to two reasons one it has the snapdragon 770 hd chipset which is fantastic at this price and two this is actually a well balanced phone all around see i'm going to keep this video short and sweet so here are the pros and cons of the galaxy m52 at this price the biggest pro obviously like i said is the snapdragon 778 g look the 778g has to be one of the most consistent no issues chipsets from qualcomm off late and that's the reason even newer phones like say the moto h30 or the upcoming nothing phone one are using it and you know what in this price range it just beats the competition just look at the benchmark comparison the 778g easily beats the demsig 900 and the snapdragon 695. this is what makes the galaxy m52 really stand out at 21k because like samsung mid-ranges which are usually under part and overpriced this is value for money another big pro in the galaxy m52 is obviously the 120 hertz super amoled display from samsung i know you do get 120 hertz amulets and p oleds in this price segment but i like that the m52 matches up to them i mean the m52 displays bright and sharp it has the beautiful colors and blacks you expect from a samsung amateur panel and the phone has the wide wide angle license so no problems here pro number three is the camera performance i mean there's no 108 megapixel sensor here but it has a higher resolution ultraviolet macro camera than any other phone in this price range now megapixel is the part what really matters is that the m52 is a solid camera phone it might not be the outright best camera phone but it takes very good photos be it in low light or daytime and i like that the main camera is good even the ultra wide camera is good and even the 32 megapixel selfie camera is pretty good basically you'll find good camera performance plus unlike a lot of phones in the segment this shoots 4k videos from both the rear camera as well as the front camera in fact it even lets you switch between the main and ultra wide lens while shooting a 4k video how cool is that pro number four is the fact that m52 has received the one ui 4.1 update which is based on android 12 and it will still get another major android update aka android 13 and there's still three years of security patches left apart from this the m52 has got all the basics right it's a sleek and lightweight phone at 7.4 millimeters thickness and 173 grams of weight there's 11 5g bands so it's a proper 5g phone it has carrier aggregation support and the 5000 image battery is good enough so the galaxy a52 obviously has a lot of good things going for it but there are some cons in this phone first is obviously the fact that this is not the most premium looking phone at least on the back the plastic bag with this glossy finish is kind of meh another negative of the m52 is that it does not have the headphone jack which is something you'll find in almost every phone in the segment it also escapes stereo speakers which is actually a little disappointing then there's the fact that the 15 watt charger that comes in the box is rather slow for today's standards i know at least it comes with the charger but one hour 50 minutes to fully charge the phone seems like a long time in 2022. i also don't appreciate the amount of bloatware samsung bundles with this phone even though you can uninstall most of these apps so yes the m52 does have its positives and negatives but you know what at 21k i think the pros far outweigh the cons i mean the m52 does really well on all the major factors and that's what's important plus samsung has a good track record with updates so if you ask me i think if i had a budget of around 21 22k i would go for this phone without any doubts now this 20 triple nine price tag is only on reliance digital and phone is available right now so if you ask me you should take advantage of this deal because i'm not sure if this price cut is permanent or temporary because i checked on samsung.com flipkart and amazon and they still have the older higher pricing anyway share this video with people who have been looking for a good smartphone in the whole 20 to 25k segment and tell me what you think about the galaxy a52 at this price comment down
