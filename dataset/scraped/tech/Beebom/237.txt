[Music] dude hey guys this is rupees from bbum.com and realme has just announced its latest seven series smartphones and i know you're all excited for the real me seven pro even i'm excited but the video on that is coming tomorrow today i'm going to talk about the new realme 7 which is also quite an interesting smartphone i mean i i don't like the box much sorry by fans but yeah the phone is definitely interesting so what's new with the real me seven how is it different from the real mistakes let's talk about that okay so let me just tell you straight away the real me seven isn't exactly a massive upgrade over the six but there are some good changes actually there are minor changes in the design the chipset the camera and the battery so let me start with obviously the design so this is the real me seven and as you can see it has this new pattern here and style that kind of reminds me a little of the oppo f17 pro anyway the back here is polycarbonate aka plastic but i like the fact that it's matte and the camera model is not the same as the old reel me style we've been used to i mean here's the redmi 7 next to the real me six and well the real me 7 does look a little more classy to me now apart from this change in the back design the readme 7 looks and feels pretty much the same as the 6. well here are both the phones and both of them have the same buttons the same ports and the same side mounted fingerprint scanner the display is the same too it's a 6.5 inch ips lcd with gorilla glass 3 and like the real mistakes it has the 90 hertz refresh rate now on paper the display seems the same but i did notice slightly warmer colors on the redmi 7 which make up for more punchy colors other than that it's the same but it's not a bad thing because it's a very smooth display thanks to the higher refreshing plus i like the fact that the phone has support for wide wine elven license and netflix shows and movies play in hd so no problem on that front now the design changes are good but another upgrade is on the hardware front so the railway 7 comes with the updated mediatek helio g95 chipset along with up to 8gb lpddr4x ram and up to 128 gb ufs 2.1 storage now the ram and storage options are good but what about the g95 how is it upgraded from the g90t well actually there's only one upgrade here and that's the faster gpu see the mari g76 gpu on the g95 is clogged at 900 megahertz compared to 800 megahertz on the g90t anyway i ran a few benchmark scores on the realme 7s to check out the scores of the g95 compared to the g90t now as you can see the scores are very similar in both the chipsets in geekbench in 3dmark which is a gpu center chipset the g95 is just a tad bit better due to obviously the overclocked gpu now as for gaming i have played asphalt 9 and pubg mobile on the phone and the g95 handles them pretty easily obviously i haven't noticed the overclock gpu much because even the six handled these games fine now one strange thing i did notice is that the max graphics on pubg mobile is hd and high whereas the g90t supports hdr ultra graphics so that's pretty strange apart from that the real me seven is also said to have a new carbon fiber cooling system to cool down the g95 after intensive gaming but that's something i'll be testing it out so g95 is the new here and to be honest it's not a massive upgrade but it's okay because the g90 has been very capable so the g95 should be solid on the real v7 too i mean in my brief time with the phone the phone has been fairly lag free but obviously i'll have a better idea once i use the phone as my daily driver moving on to upgrade number three the main camera to be more specific so this is the realme 7 quad camera setup and by the way these are the exact same cameras as the pro variant now the redmi 6 2 came with a 64 megapixel sensor so the upgrade here comes in the form of the new imx 682 sensor now the camera performance so far seems good as you can see from these shots which are very detailed and have good colors now i did notice some over processing in some of the shots but yeah it's too early to judge now i actually wanted to see if the imx 682 in the real me 7 is better than the samsung gw1 sensor on the real music so took a few comparison shots and yes the real me seven does take better photos the redmi 7 photos just look more punchy and i also noticed that the phone captures shadows better and that's not all in most photos it has the better detail let's zoom in on the sony text here on the camera yup see the difference so yeah the imx682 is actually an upgrade anyway another new camera feature that the realme 7 brings is support for ultra steady video mode this wasn't present in the readme 6 and well as you can see it does capture stable videos so it's a good addition apart from that i also took a few ultra wide angle shots and some macro shots so let me just show them to you now the point really is i want to truly test the cameras before making a final judgment so yeah stay tuned also if you're wondering the selfie camera is the same 16 megapixel sensor from the real me six and well the selfies are decentish so far now upgrade number four on the real me seven is the battery so the redmi 7 brings the bigger 5000 mah battery with the same great 30 watt charger so i've used redmi 6 as my daily driver in the past and i found its battery performance to be pretty good so the bigger battery here should translate into even better battery performance because the chipset and display haven't changed drastically as for the 30 watt charger it should charge the phone pretty quickly apart from these major upgrades and changes the real me 7 comes with the real me you are with all of the features and customizations you know of but there are a couple of new apps so there's the new doc vault app where you can save all your personal government ids and you know keep them secure now apart from that when it comes to the pre-installed apps they are the real me apps and there's amazon facebook and wps office all of which you can uninstall so that's good so that was pretty much all the upgrades in the real me seven and i know most of the upgrades here are pretty minor be the new bag the g95 chipset the upgraded main camera or the bigger battery but they all kind of combine to make the 7 a solid smartphone in this segment and well you know what i'll be doing a detailed comparison of the realme 7 versus the redmi note 9 pro to put the mediatek g95 versus the snapdragon 720 g see how these chipsets perform check for any heating issues and also compare the camera performance battery display everything so yeah if you're planning to buy the new real me seven i'd suggest you to stay tuned for a comparison video
