when it's time to unbox this amulet featuring Snapdragon 730 phone that just cost three thousand five hundred rupees let's go [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient be Volcom and today I'm gonna unbox some things really special something really unique yeah am I kidding not really see here's the story recently we came across an ad on YouTube about this phone this Android smartphone called the Krypton note 9 probe features like 6 GB RAM 128 GB storage snapdragon 734 a price tag of 4000 rupees he of that is actually mind-blowing but it's not actually my droid see this is clearly a scam and we being the good guys we wanted to get scammed for you so we clicked on the ad and it took us to website called easy phones now as you can see this whole website is a bit shady it's filled with cloned phones there's Krypton em 30s Krypton 10 are Krypton XT Krypton K 20 and there are some interesting things here like you can sign it on the website but there's no way to sign up anyway we went for the Krypton K to Indy because I wanted a pop up camera phone with AMOLED display okay so the page shows the read me I mean the Krypton K 20 and the specs are listed to be snapdragon 730 Super AMOLED bezel is display 4000 mAh battery triple cameras yeah it sounds legit especially because it has a five star rating and there are eight reviews here and well these reviews seem genuine definitely anyway so the price of the phone is five thousand five hundred rupees after a 54% discount which is pretty awesome but hey there's another discount so the offer price is four thousand five hundred now and if you pay online there's another discount of 18% making the price three thousand five hundred good deal right well we went ahead and clicked on the Buy Now button fill didn't all the details like the name the address and phone number and things like that and we made the payment through net banking because we did not want to give our card details to these shady guys and when this is are all received now honestly we weren't expecting the phone to arrive because we did not get any confirmation email or any confirmation text but then yesterday this all right yes this is basically the Krypton k20 so what are you waiting for let's unbox this yeah let's unbox it okay first up take a look at the box no mention of Krypton and the phone on the box does not look like the k20 the bezels are similar but it's not the same on the side it does say Super AMOLED dual front cameras with LED flash where this is even better than the red BK to any anyway let's open it up so this is the Krypton key 20 and yeah this looks premium and brand new once I'm done with the unboxing I'm gonna give my hands and this phone some really good sanitizing because that's how tacky it looks and feels anyway just holding this phone in my hand I can hear creaking noises like something's gonna break what else is in the box there's this microUSB charger the earphones and a 2200 mAh battery yeah still bigger than the iPhone se is battery I'm gonna put the battery inside the phone now and let's start it up okay so this isn't charged okay so this is how the phone looks like after some cleaning charging and sanitizing and I like the minimal Android 4G branding on the back and there's a physical fingerprint scary and that's not an actual fingerprint scanner but yeah it gives the phone a very premium white you also get the dual cameras not the proposed triple cameras which is a little sad on the front you get an almost specialist look with the display - yeah it's not AMOLED obviously did not have any jokes for that now red cups are softer the phone is running Android lollipop which is what six years old now so definitely not that old as for the promised Snapdragon 730 chipset after a lot of struggle on the phone it did connect to Wi-Fi and I installed cpu-z on the phone and as it turns out the phone has the old entry-level media take MT 6 5 7 - chipset what a surprise now as you can see the phone is very very fast I mean slow it makes me hate my life so I'm gonna stop and get to the point Nicolle jokes aside this is obviously a very cheap phone a scam phone and we went ahead and bought this because we don't want you guys to fall for it I mean I'm pretty sure that you've seen ads like this on YouTube and by the way it's surprising that you do have these ads and we've already reported it but I'm sure that these types of ads are prominent in other platforms apps as well so I just were tell you guys to fall for these scams see this was just an example but there are several scam websites with similar clue and fake products so when you see an ad that shows a phone with amazing specs or looks I'd say four thousand five thousand rupees please don't fall for it it's always too good to be true so just please keep this in mind and share this video with your friends and family because you guys us they all take aware and we know what's fake and what's not but not everyone is the same and a lot of people fall for these scams so just make sure to share this video so that more and more people watch it and they stay away from these scams yeah share this video also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and tell us a favorite feature of the krypton phone mine is the fingerprint scanner because that really works anyway what is your favorite feature tell us in the comments also give this video thumb I already said that subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos well that's me signing off thanks for watching I will see you in the next one [Music]
