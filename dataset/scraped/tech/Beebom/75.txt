which is the best tablet under 20 000 rupees so we have five options so there's the nokia t20 tablet the real me pad the galaxy tab a7 the lenovo tab m10 fhd plus yeah weird name and the 10 tab max now when you buy a brand new tablet you either buy it for the multimedia experience for gaming or you know productivity and i'm going to tell you the best tablet for each of these use cases so let's go so there are two big factors that matter when it comes to buying a tablet for the multimedia experience the display and the speakers now starting off let me just make it clear that all of these are 10 inch tablets with similar display specs but i'm going to remove the tcl 10 tab max and the nokia t20 tablet from this section because both of these tablets don't have wide wine advert license which i think is a deal breaker for a multimedia tab i mean sd quality on netflix or a 10 inch screen just does not make sense to make it clear the tcl tablet does have quad speakers with fairly good audio quality but with the wide wide l3 license it just does not stand a chance now i'm also removing the lenovo tab because even though it shows wide one element license in the drm info app as you can see in netflix it says l3 and there's only sd playback support so yeah sorry lenovo so you basically have two options readme pad and galaxy tab a7 now out of the two the real me pad has the better display so here's the real me pass display in action and this is a display that's slightly better and it is more punchy when it comes to colors so it makes up for a great video watching experience plus it has better viewing angles the tab a7 display is also well tuned even though it is a tft panel it looks good if you ask me especially because it's samsung so the colors in the display has been tuned to be vibrant but i just think that overall the real me patch display is just better when it comes to the speakers both of these tablets have quad speakers with dolby atmos support and both of these speaker setups are quite loud now i did a speaker test and the tab a7 was louder hitting 89 decibels while the real me pad hit 85 decibels so yeah pretty close as for the quality i think both of these tablets sound really good really crisp and nice but i found the depth in the galaxy tab a7 slightly better honestly it's not a huge difference and if i had to buy a tablet for the multimedia experience for watching shows and movies listening to songs i would pick the real me pad because of its better display so the best tablet under 20k for gaming and performance first of all let me make it clear that all of these are budget tablets and the specs tell you the same story yeah these aren't the most powerful chipsets by any means but which is the best chipset out of these so we ran some benchmarks on these tablets and according to the benchmark scores here's the ranking of these tablets so the realme pad with the g80 chipset is at the top with the best course in both antutu and geekbench the nokia t20 tablet with the unisoc chipset is at number two the galaxy tab a7 with the snapdragon 662 is at third the tcl tab max is at fourth with its mt8 780 chipset and the lenovo tab comes at last with its helio p22t with some pretty low scores now honestly if you want a tablet for bgmi or even casual gaming i'm not going to recommend a tablet with the helio p22t or even the mediatek mt8788 so you basically have three options the nokia t20 tablet the real me pad and the galaxy tab a7 but the best tablet for gaming and performance once again has to be the real me pad see i'll be clear the nokia t20 is also a good performer i think it's fairly smooth in day-to-day usage and i did not notice any lag in casual games in bgm my default low settings and it's kind of playable but i'm choosing the real me pad because it's just overall better at gaming and overall performance in bgmi it's the only tablet out of the five to default to hd graphics and at smooth and ultra the game runs very well on the real me pack as for the casual games the db pad handles them without any issues the readme tablet is also just more smooth in terms of day-to-day usage be it for multitasking loading apps etc so obviously the real me pad is the number one choice when it comes gaming and performance now there is also the galaxy tab a7 i haven't forgotten about that but honestly the performance on the samsung tablet is just not good enough i mean it's kind of fine in day-to-day performance like playing videos browsing etc but gaming is where i found the tab a7 to be pretty laggy so yeah not for gaming [Music] now we recently asked you guys about any questions about tablets under 20k on instagram yeah follow us there if you haven't already because we do this whole q and a sort of thing every now and then so you should join it now the most popular question from people was which is the best tablet with stylus support no taking capabilities well if you want stylus support the lenovo tab m10 comes with one in the box actually works pretty well if you want to draw or you know jot down notes the tcl tablet does not come with the stylus but it supports stylus input so you can buy a third party one and maybe use it also one thing to note both the lenovo and tcl tablet also come with these magnetic pins for detachable keyboards docks etc and the rest of the tablets they don't support styluses or these magnetic pins another question that you guys have been asking is which is the best tablet under 20k for the battery life well here are all the battery specs and one thing to note is that out of all these tablets only the real me pad comes with a fast charger in the box anyway i did a battery to interest on these tablets where i ran the cpu throttling test for 30 minutes and to do 5 runs and geekbench 5 runs and at the end this is where they stood in terms of battery the lenovo tablet was the worst at 31 and it's understandable with its 5000 mah battery 3d pad the tab a7 and the nokia tablets were pretty good and kind of similar while the tcl tablet with its larger battery was the best next big question which is the best tablet for the software experience well except for the galaxy tab a7 all of these tablets come with a stockish android ui with no different tablet specific features the nokia tablet does have this page in the home screen recommendations for youtube videos games books etc but that's about it now one ui 3.1 on the galaxy tab a7 is definitely more feature rich with its more tablet optimized ui and features like the pop-up window aka floating window for better multitasking so yeah one ui is obviously more feature-rich as for the updates there's no word from lenovo and tcl and i'm not very hopeful both of these tablets come with android 10 i'm not kidding the real me power on the other hand is on android 11 and i'm expecting it to get out of 12 since it's a fairly new device but there's no other promise from really the galaxy type a7 should be updated 12 too i'm hoping for that but there's no word on how long it will be supported because samsung has only announced the new good update plan for its series tablets nokia has promised two years major android updates and three years of security patches for the t20 which sounds really good but it's nokia and after the nokia 9 fiasco i'm not very sure next up which is the best tablet for attending classes doing video calls basically the best tablet with a good camera and a mic now i did a front camera video test and i found the readme pad to be the best here's a video from the realme pads front camera and i quite like the overall quality i think it's sharp the colors are good and i like the whole wide angle sort of coverage also the mic is loud and clear so that's pretty nice the nokia t20 tablet comes second because of its lack of overall detail when compared to the real me patch front camera but it's still pretty good in terms of overall exposure the mic is also pretty good coming to the conclusion now i think it's pretty clear that the real me pad is the best tablet overall under 20k let me show you a comparison see the readme pad has a premium metal design it has a better quality display than all of the others and it has the wide vinyl license it has quad speakers that are almost on par with the tab a7 squad speakers which i consider the best the helio g80 is the best performer among all although a special mention for the nokia t20 and it does well when it comes to front camera video and mic quality now the lenovo tablet does come with the stylus and along with the tcl tablet it has support for magnetic accessories but both these tablets are quite average on other fronts the nokia t20 has the best software support but again you know the flaws the galaxy tab a7 gets a few things right but it's performance is something i'm not very sure of so overall it's clear the real me pad is without a doubt the best tablet under 20k anyway if you agree with my wording
