[Music] so [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from b1.com and xiaomi recently launched the redmi note 9 here in india and you know what don't get confused the redmi note 9 pro and the pro max arrived earlier this year this note is more towards the lowest i mean unlike the past years where it started at 10k this goes at 12k so the big question is should you be buying the redmi note 9 at 12 000 rupees well i've been using this phone as my daily driver and i think you should watch this video till the very end before you go ahead and buy the redmi note 9 so let's get started okay so this is the new redmi note 9 and i was using it as my daily driver before the nord came along and when unlike redmi note in the past this one has given me mixed feelings starting off when it comes to the looks the phone has aesthetics that's very similar to the note 9 pro and the pro max with a similar color scheme and the square camera module having said that the redmi note 9 isn't as premium as the pro or the max see i'm not sure if you guys can tell from the shots but the back here is glossy plastic that does get smudged pretty easily although to be honest i think this color and the finish makes the phone look fairly good for the price i mean yes glass would have been nicer since the redmi note 8 had a glass back but well plastic is what you get here on the front you get the 6.53 inch fhd plus ips lcd display with gorilla glass 5 and a small punch hole on the left now i think the display looks good i mean the bezels are very narrow and the colors are not the most accurate but the display looks vibrant so that's pretty good however there's a slight problem in the brightness as you can see indoors the display looks pretty good no problems outdoors the max brightness is a bit on the lower side here's the note 9 versus the note 9 pro display in comparison outdoors you can see the difference as for hd playback on the display the phone comes with a wide vine l1 license and on prime video you can see the hd tag in videos as you can see here so that's great as for netflix no matter what i did the app just did not open up for me i always got this error i tried wi-fi mobile data uninstalling reinstalling switching on and off my phone but netflix yeah it did not work on the redmi note 9 it's probably a bug but it's not good anyway going back to the design when it comes to the in-hand feel i did find the device a little hefty to use i mean it weighs around 200 grams which isn't too bulky but yes i did feel like i was holding a bigger phone anyway the fingerprint scanner is placed below the camera model and at first i had trouble with it because it's placed a little higher but i got used to it so i don't think it's a problem apart from that you get the usual buttons the headphone jack the usbc port the ir blaster on the top which i really like and there's the single speaker as well now coming to the speaker performance it's not the loudest but it gets the job done plus i like the fact that it's very clear and that's good for a budget smartphone moving on to the big highlight of the phone the hardware the redmi note 9 comes with the mediatek helio g85 chipset with up to 6gb lpddr4x ram and up to 128 gb emmc 5.1 storage now these specs look kind of usual but the redmi note 9 is the first phone in india to pack in the new g85 chipset so how does the g85 differ when compared to the g80 that the real me nazo 10 was packed with well it's basically the same chipset with only one change yep i have no idea what's going on here as you can see the g85 has two cortex a75 cores that go up to 2.0 gigahertz and six cortex a55 cores that go up to 1.8 gigahertz identical to the g80 the gpu is also the same mali g52 mc2 but the difference lies in the clock speed the gpu on the g85 can go up to 1000 megahertz while the same gpu can hit 950 megahertz on the g80 that's a very small difference now this makes me wonder why did mediatek launch the g85 maybe xiaomi wanted to launch the redmi note 9 with the new chipset to differentiate and mediatek just bumped up the gpu clock speed a bit and gave the g80 a new name wow anyway the benchmarks show just that the g85s geekbench scores are very similar to the g80s now compared to the g90t which is powering the new realme 6i the g85 is far behind same is the case with the 720 g so the helio g85 is basically the g80 and it's not really a big deal coming to the real world performance the phone handles day-to-day tasks with these i did not encounter any major issues or anything with app loading or multitasking but yes there were a few bucks like the netflix one i already showed you earlier and yes this the apps in the dock just disappear a lot of times it's probably me wise fault of the fact that it's not optimized very well for this chipset but it's something you should know moving on to gaming i know you want to know how does pubg run on this phone well i'd say not very well see the phone defaults to balanced and medium graphics settings but first i switch it up to hd and high to see how well the game runs and well it does not run very well on hd and high it's virtually unplayable because of all the lag next up i switched to smooth and ultra and at that i think the gameplay was a little better but it was still very chopped and i noticed a lot of lag when driving or shooting so i switched to smooth and medium and at that setting it was kind of playable but again it wasn't the smoothest experience it's a bit surprising because mediatek as you can see markets the g85 as a gaming chipset and that is kind of a false advertisement this isn't exactly for gaming anyway the phone comes with me ui 11 and i like the fact that there are no banned apps here including me community hello i mean these are the pre-installed apps on the phone however the cleaner app part by clean master is still here i mean when we made the poco m2 pro video the clean rap issue kind of blew up everyone covered it so i was hoping xiaomi would fix it in its next phone but it's still here next up let's talk cameras so the redmi note 9 has a quad camera setup featuring the 48 megapixel samsung gm1 sensor and 8 megapixel ultra wide angle lens a 2 megapixel macro lens and a 2 megapixel depth sensor now i was hoping for great camera performance like the redmi note 9 pro because the note 9 pro and the note 9 have the 48 megapixel main camera but quite surprisingly the performance here was mixed i'm in good light the phone at times takes very good shots with great details and good sharpness all around but the problem is it's not very consistent just look at this photo the details are all washed up and it's grainy i know it was raining before but i expected slightly better from the phone the phone also does not handle tricky light situations very well which is i guess fine because it's a budget phone in low light to the phone struggles in keeping the photo sharp which is like every other budget phone and i also noticed that it has troubles focusing but once you do get focus i think on a lot of occasions the camera does a decent enough job so i'm okay with it as for the ultra wide angle lens i think it does a good job at preserving the color from main camera so it's decent there's also a macro lens and i like that it has auto focus as for the photos it's a hit and miss this is a good photo this is not now this is the show you're pretty much every macro lens on the video front the phone has no 4k support there's 1080p 30 fps support only so check out a video from the phone now i'm working here casually and out of nowhere the camera just loses focus you can also see the jitters and the video quality is kind of average so yeah when it comes to selfies the phone has a 13 megapixel selfie camera which does a fine enough job at selfies because i noticed that details were fairly good and the color was mostly fine too see overall the cameras on the redmi note 9 are decent to oakish i mean they're definitely not as good as the redmi note 9 pro and that might be due to g85 isp i'm not sure but that might be the case in fact i took a few comparison shots with the nazo 10 which also has a 48 megapixel camera and just look at it the nazo 10 has taken better photos in most daytime scenarios they are more detailed and sharper lastly there's the battery it's a 5020 mah battery and this is an area where i have no missed feelings i was totally impressed with the battery performance in my usage the phone always lasted me for more than a day and almost a day and a half i mean as you can see from the screen on time screenshots here i always got a screen on time of seven and a half hours eight hours too so the battery performance here is pretty awesome as for the charging there's a bit of a confusion so the phone comes with a 22.5 watt fast charger but the phone is actually locked at 18 watt fast charging so even this 22 charger charges the phone at 18 watts now xiaomi has confirmed that they'll be unlocking 22 or charging with a softer update so that's good news at least as for the charging speed the 22.5 watt charger takes around two hours to charge the phone from 10 to 100 percent i also tried the 18 watt charger you get with the redmi note 9 pro to charge the note 9 and it too took two hours so yes this 22 watt charger is charging the phone at 18 watts anyway the phone has another interesting charging feature it supports nine watt reverse charging from its usb c port so you can use the phone as a power bank i guess it's a handy feature so the redmi note 9 starts at 11 triple nine and at that price i think it's tough for me to recommend this phone and i think the biggest issue here is the mediatek helio g85 chipset i mean clearly the g85 isn't a great chipset for intensive games like pubg mobile and in my experience miui and even the camera of the redmi note 9 aren't very optimized for the g85 and does the average performance see the redmi note 9 is not a bad budget smartphone but the g85 is kind of what's breaking the deal here so if you ask me i'd honestly ask you to spend 2 thousand more instead of this get the redmi note 9 pro or the poco m2 pro which are better than the note 9 in almost every single aspect if you can't spend 2k mode take a look at the real me 6r which has got the g90t which is actually a gaming centric chipset either ways the conclusion is look for other options so that was our review of the redmi note 9 and if you still have any questions around the phone its performance its camera
