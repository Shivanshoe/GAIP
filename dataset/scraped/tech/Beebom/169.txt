[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and realme has been launching a lot of earbuds in the past year or so read me about air the dreamy buzz neo buzz q buzz wireless birds air pro yeah that's a lot and now they've launched this the read me bugs air 2. now these are something that actually got me interested because these bring active noise cancellation at just rupees 3300 so instead of focusing on the nasophones i decided to use this full time and this is a real me buzz air 2 review okay so let's keep things crisp and nice from the design front the readme buds air 2's case is basically the buzzer pro case with the same over design usb c port but without the little chrome thingy on the back as for the earbuds design it's a little different and it's something i personally not call good looking but i'd say it's interesting so as you can see it has this two-tone design with the stem featuring a chrome silver look while the earbuds are the usual white with silicone tips i mean the looks are subjective so to each their own but i don't really like this design as for the earbuds they are ipx7 rated so they should be fine with sweat and some rain and these earbuds are also very light and they fit in my ear perfectly now here's akshay doing his thing and yeah they fit in right and shouldn't fall off during workouts as for the comfort these are budged earbuds and i'd say they are oakish comfort wise when i was using this continuously for half an hour or less i found them to be fine but when i was using them for longer like an hour or two hours i did feel the need to remove them and give my ears a break so yeah i'd say okay now the design apart the big usp of the redmi buzz a2 is obviously active noise cancellation now if you think about it in this price segment there is the readme buds a pro and the oppo encode w51 that bring the active noise cancellation feature but they are priced around 5000 rupees and the readme buzz air to bring anc to an even lower price segment which is actually great so the ream buzzer 2 has a feed forward mic to cut down the noise and it can cut down noise up to 25 db which is lesser than the 35 db mark of the air pro but let's talk about the experience so there are three modes noise cancellation for max noise reduction general for you know slight noise reduction and transparency mode which lets you hear everything from the outside world and you know talk to other people now as you can see i can switch between the two noise cancellation modes by just press holding the touch sensor on the readme but there too now as for the experience the noise cancellation on the readme buzz a2 actually works fairly well now it's not as good as higher priced earphones quite obviously and it won't have an impact on higher frequencies but it does a good job of reducing sounds from say a computer fan engine rumble car horns in the distance so it's good that way and if you play music the noise cancellation is even more impactful so it's good see i think noise cancellation at this price is a big deal especially because this actually works i mean a lot of earphones which have anc don't make a lot of difference so this is pretty good for the price now apart from anc the biggest factor when it comes to wireless earbuds is the sound quality so the real me was there to have 10 millimeter high five drivers and when it comes to codex asc is supported but qualcomm's aptx is not now to get to the point state i think the sound quality of the readme buzz a2 is very good i was using the oneplus but z before this and when i switched to the bird's air too i was like these does not sound like earphones that cost three thousand rupees i mean if you've used the higher priced birthday pro let me tell you that the buzzer 2 brings similar good sound quality there are a lot of positives here they're very loud almost crazy loud the bass is nice and thumping the sound stage is wide and the balance between the lows mids and the treble is pretty good for the price look if you ask me it's hard to find negatives in these earbuds especially considering the price point but if i have to tell you the negatives i think at the max volume some songs do sound a bit sharp shrill but it's not a big deal because these earphones are so loud i mostly listen to them at 60 70 1. so the sound is good but since these earphones are so loud there's a lot of sound leakage let me just show you so these are the earbuds at 100 volume and i think you can listen to the sound leakage right now moving on to the mic performance my experience with budget tws earbuds when it comes to the microphone has been kind of underwhelming and the readme buzz a2 is kind of on the same line now when it comes to the calls it gets the job done when you are in a no noise environment but if you want to use it in a noisy state with maybe wind you'll find them practically useless and it's not like other earbuds in this segment do a better job at this i found the same issues with previous readme earbuds and the oneplus buzz which i was using see the point is we need better mics in the budget dws earbuds to give you a better idea on the mic quality this is me talking from the readme buzz a2 and i think the sound quality from these microphones on the reemy buzzer 2 is a little inconsistent at times it sounds fine but other times it cuts down a lot of noise making the voice unnatural so this is the real way buzz a pro now and i think the real me buzz air to sound better than this because this seems to be doing a lot more because noise cancellation making the voice all muffled kind of lastly is the oneplus but z and when i tested them i found the mice quality to be similar to the real me buzz a2 but yeah let us know in the comments which mics quality did you like more as for the connectivity and pairing this bluetooth 5.2 here with google fast pair support and that means pairing is pretty easy you just open up the case and you get this prompt to pair the earphones and yeah this proper price on all phone brands not just real me which is nice now as for the connectivity i did not face any weird connection drops or stutters while using the buzzer too with smartphones other than tv smartphones now that's good but one thing i did notice is that there's no way to connect multiple devices and then switch between them next up i want to talk about the features and the real me link app now first up a lot of you guys always have this doubt about earbuds getting updates well when i first played the readme buzz a2 with the redmi link app i got an update so yeah we can expect updates now this is the readme buzz a2s page in the realme link app and the ui is surprisingly clean and nice anyways along with the noise cancellation modes you get these three sound effects bass boost plus which really really amplifies bass but i don't like it much because in this mode the bass kind of starts to outshine the instruments and the vocals there's lively the mode i use because this is balanced in terms of treble and bass and then there's clear which focuses on the vocals and i think this can be useful for podcasts audiobooks etc there's also volume enhancer here which i think is the reason why the earbuds are so so loud anyway the birthday 2 support wear detection and i found it to work well no issues here there are also the usual touch controls which are hit and miss at the start but once i got used to the idea that it's located at the top end of the stem i found it to work fine apart from that there's game mode which i think is super important because i have used the readme bugs air in the past and the latency in those earbuds was crazy so back then i used to play pubg with those earbuds yeah so good old days and it was almost unplayable with the latency in the buzzer now the buzzer 2 without the game mode is still pretty average when it comes to latency while playing say cod mobile now with the game mode turned on it's better the latency does reduce but it's still not absolutely perfect or anything lastly the battery life so the buzzer 2 has a 30 image battery on each of the earbuds and a 400 mah battery on the case which is kind of on the lower side when compared to say the oneplus bhz but with the real me r2 chip realme claims better battery performance and the buzzer 2 are rated to last 5 hours on continuous usage and that's with anc off and a total of 25 hours with the case which yeah sounds good now in my usage i got around 4 hours 50 minutes with anc turned off on continuous usage which is i think good and with nc turned on i got around four hours which again is pretty decent as for the charging the case takes around two hours to charge while the earbuds get to 100 in around an hour well to conclude things should you buy the real me buds a2 at rupees 3300 well my answer is yes i mean yes the readme buzzer to have its pros and its cons but i think the pros definitely outweighs costs i mean the pros are the big ones like the sound quality is fantastic it brings anc on a budget and the noise cancellation is actually good for the price then there's the fact that the smart features work fine and the battery life is good now coming to the cons the comfort could have been better the my quality is okay but that's a problem with most budget tws the game mode is kind of fine so yeah these earbuds are not perfect and if you have issues with any of these points you should not get the buzz there too but if you're okay with these points i think the real me buzzer 2 are a very good pair of tws earbuds to buy i think they bring a great balance between features and price well that was my review of the read me buds a2 but i want to know
