this is the moto g515g and this is a phone that's powered by the snapdragon 480 plus now i know what you're thinking and i was thinking the same snapdragon 480 plus at 15k what was motorola thinking well the truth is what was qualcomm thinking because the 480 plus it's not a bad chipset it's more like 720 730 and that's what makes the g51 5g a very interesting 5g phone under 15k in fact if i'm not wrong this is probably the most affordable 5g phone powered by a snapdragon chipset under 15k so yeah this is pretty interesting but i know the most debate is going to happen on the snapdragon 480 plus so let me just address that first time so basically here are the specs of the moto g51 snapdragon 480 plus 4gb lpddr4x ram 64gb umcp storage now i know a lot of you guys have doubts about umcp but first the 480 plus so the truth about the snapdragon 480 plus is that it's a very capable chipset i mean it's very comparable to say something like the snapdragon 732g let me explain see the snapdragon 480 plus has two cryo 460 gold cores based on cortex a76 and six cryo 460 silver cores based on cortex a55 now compared to this the snapdragon 732g which is on the redmi note 10 pro has two cryo 470 gold cores and 6 cryo 470 silver cores which seems better because you know it's 470 but they too are based on the same cortex a76 and cortex a55 core so it's basically the same now when it comes to gpu the 480 plus actually has the slightly better adreno 619 gpu compared to the adreno 618 on the 732g apart from all of this it's only a difference of 0.1 gigahertz when it comes to clock speeds and both are built on the same 8 nanometer architecture plus they both have wi-fi six spot but one thing is the snapdragon 480 plus has an advantage with 5g support now overall this makes it clear that the 480 is not exactly deserving of the four series naming i mean it's close to a seven series chipset like the 730 2g i mean the benchmarks make it even more clear because the 480 plus does very well i mean here are the geekbench scores and as you can see it's close to what you get in the snapdragon 732 g or even the dimensions 700 720 so yeah 480 is kind of confusing but at the end of the day it's a good chipset especially under 15k in fact i was using the g51 5g for this video and it just feels like your usual good motorola phone i mean this is a phone that feels very smooth and nice and i haven't come across any lag whatsoever the gaming performance is good too bgmi supports a maximum of hd high or smooth ultra and i played a couple of full classic games on this phone and the performance is good there's no weird stutter or lag and there was no overheating or anything obviously these opinions are based on my short-term usage so this is not my final verdict but so far it's looking good now coming to the umcp storage umcp basically means unified multi-chip package which basically combines the storage the ram and a few other modules on a single chip now motorola claims close to ufs 2.2 speeds and i checked and the speeds are indeed close to what you get from ufs 2.1 or 2.2 also snapdragon 480 plus is a 5g chipset and the g51 is a proper 5g phone with 12 5g bands yeah that's a lot of bands now the more 5g bands the better the chance of this phone being 5g compatible when 5g arrives in india so it's good that motorola is making sure that its phones are the most future proof when it comes to 5g moreover the g51 supports 4x4 mimo and 3ca carrier aggregation which basically means it can connect to 3 frequencies at the same time now this is important because a 5g phone with no carrier aggregation just does not make sense so this is good now apart from the 480 plus another point of debate in the g51 is the display as you guys probably know the phone has a 120 hertz ips lcd panel now you guys know me i would have liked an amulet panel just like the g31 but i think with bringing 5g motorola had to compromise somewhere and they did with an ips lcd on the g51 now it's not really a compromise because it's a 120 hertz display and also because if you look at other 5g phones in this price range be the realme 85g or even the new note 11 t5g both of them have a 90hz ips lcd while the g51 like i said has a 120hz ips lcd so yeah it's pretty good and the panel here is nice with sharp the colors look good the contrast is good and the 120 hertz smoothness has been noticeable ever since i first used this one when it comes to the brightness i'll be honest it's kind of oakish at 600 nits of peak brightness it's not the brightest panel out there but again compared to other 5g phones this is kind of on par and even slightly better because the panel in the real me 85g has a peak brightness of 600 nits which is the same and the 115g display has a big brightness of 450 nits so yeah it's comparable on the g51 now those were the two big factors in the g51 but what about the rest of the phone well first up this is a fairly big phone as it's 9.1 millimeters thick and over 200 grams in weight now credit rates do the weight distribution here make sure it's comfortable to use but yeah this is not the most compact or lightweight phone anyway the g51 also has a decently big battery at 5000 image and i haven't really tested the battery date but with stock android and the eight nanometer snapdragon 480 plus it should be good now one thing i like here is that the phone comes with this 20 watt turbo power charger now this charger is interesting because globally the moto g51 comes with a slow 10 watt charger but in india motorola is packing this fast charger which i think is a really good move going back to the phone's design i was kind of personally wishing the fingerprint scanner to be in this moto logo but it's on the side here in the power button anyway it works well so it's fine plus you must have noticed this additional button on the top it's actually the google assistant button on the left you get the dual simplest microsd hybrid slot there's also a headphone jack and this whole design is ip52 rated for splash resistant now one thing is missing is stereo speakers moving on the g51 like any other moto phone brings the stock android motorola experience and it's super clean as you'd expect there are only facebook and dolby atmos apps pre-installed along with the cool motor features like big display different customization options and then they are used for gestures like power touch which lets you double tap on the power button and open this up to launch apps more quickly apart from the features there's no weird ads no recommendations basically it's a clean experience that i want from budget smartphones when it comes to updates motorola has promised the android 12 update and two years of security patches now to be clear motorola has only promised this one major update which is not the best support but they say that they prefer to you know promise less and over deliver so i'm expecting more updates on the g51 lasting when it comes to camera performance these are the specs and yeah the 50 megapixel main camera is what matters so here are some shots from the 50 megapixel main camera of the g51 and it's early days but one thing is clear the main camera takes very good photos in daytime most photos are sharp and pleasing and there's enough details too now in daytime the ultrawide camera is also pretty good retaining the colors and the overall exposure from the main lens now in low light like most budget phones the g51 kind of struggles sometimes it takes decent enough shots but i noticed noise in some shots so yeah still checking things out but low light seems kind of okayish now when it comes to videos there's no 4k because the snapdragon 480 plus only supports 1080p at 60fps max and that's what the g51 supports now talking about the pricing the moto g51 has launched in india to piece 14 triple nine for the 464 gb variant and if i had to sum up my first impressions i would say this is a good 5 g4 the g51 is just a more functional 5g phone when compared to other 5g phones in this whole 15k segment because more experience camera aggregation good processor good battery high refresh rate display 125g bands so yeah the basics are right now the camera needs more testing which i'm already doing but overall like i said this seems like a good 5g phone anyway i want to
