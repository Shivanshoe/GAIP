[Music] [Applause] [Music] so guys this is from bbm.com and samsung has just now its latest a series budget smartphone the galaxy a21s and well this is the galaxy a21s so what's new with it what are the upgrades that this budget smartphone brings well let's take a look at the brand new galaxy a21s because first up the design of the galaxy 821s hasn't changed a lot from other samsung phones in this price segment you still get the glass like plastic finish with a little bit of gradient thrown in and it's still a very functional design you get the type c port the headphone jack and the single speaker on the bottom and you get the dedicated dual sim plus micro sd slots also as you can notice it has a physical fingerprint scanner on the back because the galaxy a21s does not have an amoled display on the front you get a 6.5 inch ips lcd display with the hd resolution i like the fact that this is an infinity o display with the whole punch hole design because that makes up for a very modern and edge-to-edge look yes amoled or even 1080p resolution would have been nicer but this is a budget phone and i don't know the price yet so i'm gonna keep my expectations in check apart from that the phone has the wide one l1 certification so netflix and prime video videos play in hd now display changes apart the galaxy a21s brings a brand new chipset into the phone is powered by the latest eight nanometer exynos 850 processor which is an octa-core chipset with two quad cortex a55 core clusters that can go up to two gigahertz and it's paired with the mali g52 gpu anyway eight nanometer plus cortex a55 cores mean that the exynos 850 should be a very power efficient processor anyway let's check out the benchmarks first well here are the adido and geekbench 5 scores and as you can see the exynos 850 isn't going to beat the competition but hopefully the phone is fast and smooth in the long run i mean as of now i haven't faced any lag of stutters so hoping for the best as for gaming i've only gotten the chance to play a few pubg mobile sessions but if you want to know the game runs on hd graphics and high frame rate by default which is also the highest graphics setting and on that setting the gameplay was decent enough another thing that's an upgrade in the galaxy a21s is the cameras it's a quad camera setup including a 48 megapixel primary sensor and eight megapixel ultra wide angle lens a two megapixel depth sensor and a 2 megapixel macro lens well this seems like a capable camera setup and the results look good too so far here are some shots from the phone and as you can see some of the shots are really pleasing especially when it comes to details and the dynamic range yes some photos look a bit overexposed but it's a bit too early and as you can see some of the shots are pretty nice as for low light like most budget phones there's a bit of struggle in the dark conditions but the a21s has managed to take some decent shots i also took the ultra wide angle camera for a spin and as with most samsung phones the ultra white shots look good with nice colors and exposure the details are kind of lacking but other than that things seem positive apart from that the phone obviously has the macro lens so here are a couple of macro shots i took and they look fine for a phone macro lens on the video front there's no 4k or 1080p 60 fps support on the phone so i shot a 1080p 30fps video and as you can see the quality is fine i know the video is not very stable and that's probably because i was holding the phone with one hand and cycling yeah i'm kind of laid out like that as for the selfies here are a couple of selfies i took from the 13 megapixel camera on the front moving on when customer software the galaxy a21s comes with the latest one ui 2.1 onboard on top of android 10 and that means you get all the latest one you have features like automatic dark mode navigation gestures and more plus you get all the samsung features like samsung health knock security so yeah this is great then there's the battery keeping up with the a series and m series tradition the galaxy a21s packs a big 5000 mah battery with 15 watt fast charging now most budget and mid-range samsung smartphones boost of some great battery life and the a21s features the very power efficient exynos 850 so the battery life should be pretty amazing all in all it's pretty clear the galaxy a21s is another all-around solid budget smartphone from samsung and samsung is putting this as the galaxy 8 successor and if you look at it that way this does bring some good upgrades and it brings a new infinity o design display it packs in the new exynos 850 chipset the cameras have been upgraded and like always there's the reliable latest one ui and the battery is great yes i haven't used the phone extensively and i know there are a few questions around the phone but you know what i think it all depends on the price and i'll reserve my judgment when we get to know the price having said that if you are a samsung fan i think the galaxy 21s should be a decent all-around smartphone package for you guys well what do you think of the new galaxy a21s tell us in
