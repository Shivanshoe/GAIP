hey guys this is based on bbm calm and at CES 2020 I'm a spirit now this very first truly Wireless buzz the amaze bit power box and you know what it has to be one of the most feature packed wireless earbuds out there well we went hands-on with the amazed with power buds so let's take a look so these are the new amaze with power bugs and they come in three cool color variants all of them have this smooth pattern as you can see in this white gradient but this is a texture that is the most prominent in the black one as it's red and I think it looks very cool anyway these are sporty wireless earbuds so they have the full in your design and well I'm always light pull in your wireless earbuds the power buts do look a bit confusing I mean you get the idea after some time but at first I was always confused how they'd go in apart from that they do fit in nicely and a fairly lightweight and they come with different tips so it should fit most people I also wanted to see how well they'd hold up during workouts so I gave these earbuds to one of the trainers at the event showcasing the new amaze with Aaron and while it was fine mostly the air buds did fall of once now that's where this comes into play the power buds come with sport ear hooks that stay here in the charging case so you have them at all times now these are magnetic ear hooks so you can just do this and that's it you're able to now have the ear hook design which makes sure that the ear buds don't drop even during intensive exercises I did the head banging test because Akshay is not here and as you can see the ear buds stay put another thing to note on the design front is the fact that these are IP XY water resistant a buds so these should be fine with sweat and rain when it comes to the build quality beat the ear buds or the case I think they have a fairly premium build so no problems here come into the features now like I said they're mates with power buds are for the most feature packed wireless earbuds out there first off let's talk about the big one the amaze speed power buds come with a PPG heart rate sensor built-in so you'll be able to monitor your heart rate during workouts with ease using these earbuds which is pretty awesome now we couldn't test this but I'm a sweet sees that you'll get voice notifications when your heart rate exceeds a certain number you've said now dad would be pretty awesome that's not although the ear but you also bring your workout details like the pace the duration the distance and more apart from the heart rate tracking feature the amazed with barbers come with all the usual features that we always want in violets here but there are touch control so you can play pause music skip tracks or activate google assistant all these actions are said to be customizable in the app so that is pretty nice then there is weir detection which is one feature that's super duper handy and I really love it on other year phones as well so with this you can just take out the earphones from your ear and the playback stops as you can see there also a couple of modes there's a new true mode which can be enabled with a single tap now this is the mode that increases the ambient noise so many are maybe running outdoors you can hear the surrounding traffic conditions however if you're working out indoors and you want the dark night music playing in the background to really pump you up there's a motion beat mode for that which enhances the bass so that your workouts are you know more dynamic another feature to note is en CAK environmental noise cancellation with dual mics for a better quality during calls all of these features sound great but we are yet to test them out as the Amezcua rap with all of these features and the bad support is still in closed beta and yeah we only use these earphones very briefly now there's one thing I did test and that's the sound quality again I use these earphones briefly with the songs playing not the type of songs I generally listen to but in whatever time I had the quality of these here but seemed great the bass is pretty good and the quality at around 80% volume was really good so I'm positive when it comes to sound quality of the powers lastly there's the battery and this is where the Amaze with power buds impressed me the most the earbuds are rated for eight hours of playback on a single charge and that's with heart rate monitoring turned on it is honestly really impressive most truly wireless earbuds don't have this kind of battery life the readme buds err they last around 3 to 4 hours the airport's pro day lasts around 4 to 5 hours so you get the idea plus you get another 16 hours with discharging case that's a total of 24 hours now the charging case here is also pretty nice looking and it has the USB C port which is just perfect talking about the pricing now the amazed with power buds will arrive in February and it'll arrive at $99 which is around 7000 rupees in India now I know that seems a little pricey considering the fact that the likes would read me buds and JBL c100 are available for around 4k but I think if this is priced around 5 to 6 K it a big grade because compared to the earbuds I just talked about these bringing features like the heart rate monitoring magnetic earhooks different sound modes and way better battery life plus they're all the features like touch controls variate action ENC with good sound quality so yeah I'm hoping a misfit brings this to India soon because from the looks of it the AMIA street power bird seemed like a winner yeah I was really impressed with your mates with power buds but what are your thoughts on it tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make
