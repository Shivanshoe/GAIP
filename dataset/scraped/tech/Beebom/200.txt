[Music] [Applause] [Music] phones were boring in 2020 weren't they i mean there were a lot of launches but they were all the same 64 megapixel cameras triple cameras snapdragon 765 g or 865 and the same big big screens i mean it kind of felt like companies were just running permutations and combinations on hardware to come out with new phones but then this thing came out and well this changes things hey guys i'm akshay from bbomb.com and this is the lg wing a phone that actually offers something different something fresh and that's why i found it more interesting than any other phone this year so what's special here well this yeah this screen swivels out and you get the secondary screen just below believe me when i tell you you do this in public and it sure turns ice anyway this is a pretty big phone as you can see and that's a giant 6.8 inch p oled panel up top but still opening the screen is easy with just one hand and it's very very satisfying i mean it opens with this swoosh sound and makes a satisfying tactile click when you close it check it out closing it with one hand is not impossible as you can see but lg obviously wants us to use both hands to close the screen here that's fine to be honest but i mean come on lg you went this far maybe just add some easier way to close the screen as well just a suggestion anyway let's try to use both these screens with the apps i use most often and see what we can do i've tried a couple of things on this phone already and some i'll be testing right now but i do have some tips for you guys that i will be sharing later on in this video so i use netflix a lot and i'm sure you guys do too so let's just open this up here now i usually find myself texting my friends quite a bit so let's open up a chat window here and well this looks fine doesn't it i mean it's easy to text people while watching something at the same time so yeah i guess that's a nice use for these screens one thing i noticed is that the weight distribution of this phone gets messed up when you swivel the screen look this phone weighs 260 grams which is heavy but not as heavy as something like the galaxy z4 2 which is 280 grams however due to this weight distribution problem my hands started hurting a little after 30 minutes or so of using it this way now most of the time you probably don't chat for too long while you're watching something so this should be fine but yeah if you're going to have a longer chat session maybe find some place to raise your hands speaking of chatting one really cool feature here is that you can open up a messaging app on this small 3.9 inch geolet display and then just tap this button and get a full size keyboard on the bottom screen unfortunately this feature is only available with the built-in lg keyboard and not with third-party keyboards but it's still a pretty nice feature to have and i hope gboard and swiftkey also bring support for this feature moving on last night i was playing a couple of games on this phone as well now i'm still missing pubg but call of duty is something i play a lot these days and in that game this second screen shows some lg game tools but that's about it nothing really special in asphalt 9 however you get this cool map on the secondary screen while you race on the main display that's quite cool and i wish call of duty also brings something like this that would be really cool but before we move on let me tell you about those tips so most of you guys must be having online classes these days on microsoft teams or google classroom right well if you're in a boring meeting you can use the second screen to chat with your friends at the same time or you can be a good student and actually use the second screen to take notes along with your class it's your call another thing i used this phone for a lot yesterday was handling reddit and keeping up with things going on in our quipped documents normally i have to keep switching between these apps on my iphone but here i can just open them both on separate screens and keep a track of what's going on plus if i find something interesting i can quickly share it with my colleagues as well look i didn't really come here planning to talk about anything other than these screens but lg has a pretty cool camera feature here as well so on the rear of this phone you get a triple camera setup with a 64 megapixel primary a 12 megapixel ultra wide lens and a 13 megapixel ultrawide lens yeah there are two ultra wide lenses here and here's what when you swivel the screen out the phone uses the ultra wide lens as a gimbal camera you get all these controls here and a bunch of modes plus this lock button that keeps the frame locked even if you move around a bit so yeah it's pretty damn cool so as you can see here i'm taking this shot by just panning the phone around myself now the lg wing has pretty solid stabilization itself so this video is quite smooth even when i'm turning physically and recording the pan but now here i'm using the gimbal camera feature of the phone to ban the shot without moving physically this way you can get slightly better stability as you can see here however you are limited by the field of view of the ultrawide lens here so the pan isn't as wide as it can be if you physically turn and record the video so yeah there's that but this is still a pretty cool feature to have i'm sure you're wondering why i'm going on and on about this phone right see 2020 was a pretty weird year and not a lot of good things have happened even the phones launched this year have mostly been boring but this is a phone that's actually something different and interesting and well i like it so yeah kudos to lg for making this phone and yeah i can't wait to see what else lg comes out with under its explorer project because this this is cool but what are your thoughts on this phone and do you have any other use cases in mind let us know in the comments also give this
