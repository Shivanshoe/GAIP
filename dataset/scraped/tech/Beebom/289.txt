[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and off late it's been all about smartphones so when this the msi alpha 15 arrived in our office we decided why not make a video on this because this seems like a power pack laptop in fact a budget friendly version of the msi alpha 15 is on a great deal in india right now and i'll be talking about it in the end so make sure to watch the full video anyway let's talk about the msi alpha 15 now okay so the msi alpha 15 is a pretty power pack laptop with a lot of features but there are two major highlights that got us really interesting the display and obviously the amd cpu and gpu so i'm going to start with this nice beautiful display the ms alpha 15 comes with a 15.6 inch full hd ips panel with a 144hz refresh rate yup a 144hz refresh rate panel plus the laptop comes with amd's freesync support which dynamically adjusts the refresh rate to make sure games look much smoother and there's no screen dating well i and and more from our team have been playing games on the msi alpha 15 and well the display has been brilliant the experience has been smooth and it helps the display looks really good the colors are crisp too there's arrogant brightness the viewing angles are great yeah it's an all-around great display anyway not just games i've watched some netflix two on the laptop and it looks amazing so yeah i think the 144hz display lives up to its expectations i really like it plus i like the fact that the top and the side bezels are tiny well the bottom bezel is a little thick to accommodate the msi logo which is okay overall i like the display here moving on to the next big highlight of the msi alpha 15 the amd cpu gpu combo okay so the alpha 15 is powered by the ryzen 7 cpu and on the gpu front there's a seven nanometer radeon rx 5500m and when it comes to storage there's a 512gb kingston nvme ssd along with an empty 2.5 inch drive bay where you can either use a regular hdd or sata ssd there's also 16 gigs of ram now all of these are some great specs and the radeon ryzen combo is said to be better than the core i5 9300 edge processor and the nvidia 1650 gpu and it shows in the benchmarks see we run multiple benchmarks on the alpha 15 because this is the first time we are testing a ryzen 7 laptop and well as you can see from the benchmark scores the amd ryzen 7 plus radeon rx 5500m combo does really well now we don't have a core i5 nvidia 1650 laptop to compare things but these scores are really good now coming to the games we played a number of games on the alpha 15 ranging from c o d warzone pubg shaqiro shadows die toys and apex legends and it's clear that the laptop can handle almost any game you throw at it but hey we wanted to push the radio and rx 5500 m to its limits because yeah like i said it was the first time testing it so we played all the games on 1080p high graphics settings and well the average fps was pretty good in pubg we got an average fps of around 71 fps which i think is pretty good in apex legends the fps was around 7580 which again is pretty good and when it comes to cod warzone we got an fps of around 78 80 which is nice now the fps did dip down while playing sikiro it was around 45.50 but i'd say it's pretty decent so yeah the alpha 15 can handle aaa titles with a lot of ease and you can always get even better frame rates by knowing the graphics a bit anyway i also like the thermal performance of the alpha 15 the dual cooling fans and a lot of heat pipes thanks to the whole cooler booster 5 system keep temperatures under control so you never see the cpu temperature rise above 80 degrees which is pretty good now the keyboard deck does get a little warm at times but we did not get the urge to crank up the fan or give the system some rest now the fans are usually pretty silent but they do get a bit loud when you switch to extreme performance mode so yep msi alpha 15 is a pretty good performer but what about the power consumption well the msi alpha 15 has a pretty modest battery so we are talking about a 51 watt battery pack with a 180 watt adapter yeah that's not a big battery and in my usage the laptop only lasted for two to three hours at max and you'll obviously be playing games with the laptop plugged in but yeah the battery performance of this laptop is pretty average now apart from the amd cpu gpu the great 144hz display what about the rest of this laptop well on the design from the msi alpha 15 looks functional i mean it lags the whole game rescue black red vibe msi is known for instead it offers a matte black aluminium laid with this green phoenix logo which i think looks fine there's no rgb here if you're expecting that now the rest of the laptop has a regular plastic chassis with a silver paint job around the keyboard and i think it looks pretty functional on the bottom you get the two cooling fans and the speakers and when it comes to the ports there's hdmi mini displayport ethernet usbc and usb a ports and the mic and the headphone jack on the left side and on the right you get two usb a ports an sd card slot and the ac adapter now one thing i like here are the rgb lit usb ports they look cool and they're easy to find and plug in peripherals at night now moving on to this keyboard it's a full-size steel series keyboard which isn't cramped and it has perky rgb lighting spot which is great if you like that sort of customization and as you can see there is a dedicated steel series button on the top to cycle through the different lighting modes and you can always install steel series engine 3 to get more control look the customizations aside i've always liked the steel series keyboards on msi laptops and things aren't any different on the msi alpha 15. so the typing experience is great once i got used to it key travel is decent and well no complaints on the keyboard front then there's this trackpad which is a tad bit on the smaller side which is okay because you're anywhere going to use a mouse to play games the touchpad here supports windows pressures and drivers and well the buttons are creaky but loud now pretty much everything i like about the msi alpha 15 except for maybe the sound quality see the msi alpha 15 is said to have giant speakers it's written right here but the sound output is pretty average okay so output is not as loud as you'd expect and the base isn't that great so the speakers here are kind of average now coming to the conclusion the msi alpha 15 is available for around 90k on amazon but like i said there's another variant of this laptop that's usually available for 75 80 k but right now during the flip cards big shopping day sale it's available for just 69 990 and that's a great price for this laptop now if you're wondering what's the difference between the two alpha 15 variants well there's not a lot the msi alpha 15 the 70k variant brings the same design a 120 hertz ips display which is still pretty great it has the same specs yes ryzen 7 plus radeon rx 5500m gpu with the same cooler booster 5 cooling system which means the performance should be great there's also a 256gb ssd plus 1tb hd combo the same config keyboard but no perky rgb customization the same battery the same speakers so yes if you ask me at 70k the msi alpha 15 a3 dd044in with all these great specs and features seems pretty great yes the battery performance and speakers are kind of average but at 70k the pros of the msi alpha 15 far outweighs cons so yeah i think it's just a crate anyway what do you think of the msi alpha 15 tell us in the comment section below also do note that we are talking about the deal price of the msi alpha 15 so the prices might fluctuate after the big shopping day sale is over also
