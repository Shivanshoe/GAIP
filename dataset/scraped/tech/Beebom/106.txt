[Applause] hey guys this is from vm.com and motorola has been launching some good phones off late the h20 and hd diffusion that it recently launched are phones that i really liked and now the company has launched this the motorola h20 pro now this is a high-end phone with some really good specs and it obviously comes with this great stock android experience so is this the budget flagship you should be considering now well let me tell you all about the h20 pro so here's the motorola h20 pro in my hand and this is a phone that actually seems good all around so i'm gonna take things one by one first of all here's how it looks like it has gorilla glass 5 on the front and the back and i like how this phone looks it's not too flashy but it's not mundane too it just looks good with the matte finish back that also has this cool pattern and effect when the light falls on it now a phone is definitely premium when it has an aluminium frame and the s20 pro has just that an aluminium frame apart from that there's a slight camera bump here in different steps kind of which means you can't really place it on a table and use it because it will wobble anyway i was actually surprised at how sleek and lightweight this phone is i mean most phones with 6.7 inch displays were north of 200 grams and they're also thicker than 8.5 millimeters now the h20 pro on the other hand is a phone that only weighs 190 grams and it's only 7.9 millimeters thick so it's pretty good for a phone with this footprint anyway other things to note in the design is that it's ip52 rated for splash resistance the power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner there's also a dedicated google assistant button on the left side apart from that there's no microsd slot and there's no headphone jack here and as for the speakers there's only one speaker at the bottom so no stereo speakers coming to the display which is actually pretty cool it's amoled fhd plus resolution it has an insane 144 hertz refresh rate with a touch sensitivity of up to 576 hertz it's also a 10 bit display with hdr 10 plus support dc ip3 coverage dc dimming support and up to 1000 nits of max brightness now on paper this sounds good and well this display actually looks good so far it's a bright display as you can see in the shot here it's super responsive and i've been using this phone with the display set to 144 hertz and the screen just seems very responsive be it while scrolling or even when i'm just tapping or using the usual gestures the display also looks great color wise it's amoled so deep blacks and vibrant colors are here and yeah the display as you can see looks really good moving on to the hardware where i feel the motorola h20 pro kind of hits the sweet spot so you have the specs the phone has the powerful snapdragon 870 with fast lpddr5 ram and also fast ufs 3.1 storage now i say sweet spot because i've seen a lot of people complain about heating issues on some phones with snapdragon 888 and this is the same reason that motorola gave me when i asked them why the snapdragon 870 and not the triple eight on the h20 pro so yeah the snapdragon 870 kind of makes sense ci for the performance it's too early to judge but the h20 pro feels like a fast phone if you know what i mean everything seems smooth and snappy there's no lag anywhere so far and gaming is also pretty great i mean there's the snapdragon 870 so bgmi can run on ultra hd graphics and smooth frame rates and as you can see it looks really good and so far the gameplay has been really good it's pretty awesome now i'm fairly positive about the performance of this phone but apart from the fact that this is a snappy phone the software experience of motorola phones is always like a breath of fresh air well the phone has android 11 on board and motorola has guaranteed the android 12 and android 13 update and two years of security patches now that apart what i like is there's absolutely no bloatware no weird recommendations or shady features and even the features that motorola has added to the stock android experience are actually pretty useful for example there are many useful gestures as you can see and i like this gesture that lets you put apps into split screen like this and i had no idea about this i mean this is something i can see people using there are also different personalization options where you can style the colors icons etc there's the more to peak display feature game time and there's the useful ready for feature so for people who don't know you can just connect your h20 pro or any other edge device that is launched in india to your miracast supported tv wirelessly or via hdmi to any tv to get the ready for desktop experience now as you can see you get this test of experience with the whole ui and everything and all the apps you can open apps here multitask yeah it's a good feature in fact you can even play games on the bigger tv screen via the game section and after all you can even take video calls with apps like duo on the tv so yeah this is actually useful feature now moving on to the cameras now cameras aren't always the highlight in motorola phones but the edge 280 pro is packed with camera features first up the specs are pretty good 180 megapixel main camera a 16 megapixel ultra wide angle camera and an 8 megapixel periscope telephoto lens with ois capable of 5x optical zoom and 50x digital zoom now the telephoto lens is once again a very good addition in the h20 pro because most phones in this whole sub 40k price segment skip the telephoto lens and that's something i prefer instead of the useless 2 megapixel macro 2 megapixel depth lenses anyway coming to the camera experience i've only used the phone for a couple of days and here are some shots i've taken now i haven't really compared things to other phones but from the looks of it so far the photos from the 108 megapixel sensor look really good the few photos i've taken have very vibrant colors the contrast is good and so are the details i mean some of these photos are really good right and as you can see the dynamic range is also fairly wide now in low light the photos are bright and nice and so far i say pretty good especially because the night mode also works well so yeah that's good honestly i would have liked the night mode to work with the ultra wide angle lens as well as the telephoto lens but right now it's only sticking to the main camera i also took some zoom shots because obviously there's a telephoto lens and they are as expected pretty good so here's a 1x zoom shot and a 5x zoom shot and as you can see the 5x zoom shot is really sharp and crisp yeah that's what you get with optical zoom i like it i also took a 50x zoom shot and this is obviously not as good as the optical zoom but it's pretty good for 50x here's another example and yeah if you ask me i'm a big advocate of telephoto lenses so i like this now apart from all of this like i said the h20 pro has a lot of camera features for example there's audio zoom where you just zoom in in the video on the subject and the sound increases accordingly this also features like the multi-lens video support in 1080p so you can switch between lenses like this there are also other camera features like pro mode dual capture spot color portrait video etc lastly there's the battery and connectivity on the battery front there's a decently sized 4500 image battery with 30 watt turbo power charger as for the 5g bands this is a phone that has a lot of 5g bands 11 5g bands to be exact so yeah this is a proper 5g phone now coming to the pricing the motorola h20 pro has launched an india at rupees 36 triple 9 and there are some good launch offers as well now i know in this whole price range there are phones that come with snapdragon triple eight but like i've always said it's the experience that matters and you know what in the motorola x20 pro i think there's a good combo of specs and experience see the snapdragon 870 is a powerful chipset no doubts the 144hz amulet is as good as it gets in this price range the cameras seem very capable the phone has a premium design and solid build and you get the nice and clean motorola software experience look i'll deserve my file worthy for later after i've used this and compare the h20 pro to other phones but you know what the looks of it this actually looks like a solid smartphone for its price anyway i want to know your thoughts on the new motorola h20 pro how does it compare to the competition what do you guys think comment down below
