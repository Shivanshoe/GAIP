this is the latest 14-inch windows 11 budget laptop from infinix the x1 slim and budget laptop is the keyword because a lot of you guys always ask us to cover budget laptops and we are going to focus on that more often now this is a super value for money budget laptop and why do i say this well first of all it starts at an aggressive price of 29k and i like that all the venues of this laptop have plenty of ram and storage there's no variant with 4gb ram thumbs up for that now this is a laptop that is feature packed infinix has put in almost every feature you can think of in this price segment unlike a lot of other budget laptops but the most debatable thing about the x1 slim is the fact that this comes with 10 gen intel chipsets the variant we have has the 10 nanometer core i5 gcd chipset with 4 cores and 8 threads a maximum clock speed of 3.6 gigahertz up to 25 watt tdp and intel uhd graphics the ram is 8gb lpddr4x 3200 megahertz ram and it is soldered while the storage is a 512gb pci gen 3 ssd that is upgradable up to 1tb now we did open up the laptop and you can see that the storage is indeed expandable and you also get a view of the heat pipes and the fan anyway the big question is does the x1 slim with a tangent intel chipset make sense in 2022 so the answer is i would have personally liked in 11 gen or even a 12 gen intel chipset but according to infinix they've used the 10 gen intel chipset because they wanted to keep the price low while focusing on other aspects like the build quality the port selection and charging now the tangent core i5 chipset on this laptop actually compares fairly well against the 11 gen core i3 which powers laptops like the lenovo ideapad 3d in my book now the tangent core i5 chipset has more cores and it has more threads the 11 gen core i3 has the higher clock speed so kind of both have their advantages specs aside the performance so far seems good on the x1 slim in our usage of multiple chrome tabs video playback some image editing the laptop works perfectly there's no lag or stutter in fact we even did a slightly intensive test with 15 chrome tabs open to 4k videos playing and the laptop did not stall the cpu usage does go up but you can see the laptop working without any lag i also like that the 4k videos play fine the performance here seems good for day-to-day usage and as for benchmarks here is the crystal dismock score to give you an idea of the ssd speeds here's the geekbench score and here is the pc mark 10 score the thermals seem fine too so far they're dual heat pipes and a silent fan and i haven't come across any overheating and the fans have remained silent mostly now long-term usage is something that we can't test right away but if you ask me i think tangent intel chipsets are fine for this price especially because this laptop packs in a ton of features and the design is very similar to the higher priced x1 laptop that we covered and that's a great thing because you get a fairly premium looking laptop with an aluminium alloy chassis the dual tone design of the lid is here and this two is available in multiple colors now this does not feel like a cheap laptop at all and the best thing about this design is how light and slim this is it's just 14.8 millimeters thin and the weight is just 1.24 kgs which is exactly the same as the new m2 macbook air i mean this is very portable easy to keep with the bag easy to just carry around and i really like that infinix also hasn't cut any corners on the display the bezels are narrow and the 14 inch display is an fhd panel with 100 srgb coverage and 300 nits of brightness specs about this looks like a nice and sharp display be it for work or for watching movies and shows the color accuracy is fairly good the viewing angles are wide enough and even though the brightness said to be 300 nits it did not seem low to me it's bright enough let me put this way for a laptop in this price range this display is actually very good now one thing that's missing from the x1 here is the fingerprint scanner yeah there's no fingerprint scanner other than that the webcam is still a 720p webcam but interestingly it has a dual led flash here on the top that can be activated with a simple keyboard shortcut this is how it looks like and you can use it while video calls too here's a video from the infinix x1 slim front camera and i can just turn on the dual led flashlight and yeah you can barely see the difference but this might be handy in low light scenarios another thing that's going to come in handy in low light is the backlit keyboard with two levels of brightness a lot of make escape backlighting and keyboard in the budget segment so this is good as for the keyboard the keys have decent travel and the feedback would have been better but the layout is good and once you get used to this you should be able to type fast the trackpad is pretty good i like the size and the smooth surface and it is responsive and nice with obviously support for windows precision gestures the port selection is good too there's no thunderbolt port but the left has a usbc port which has displayport support and it's also used to charge the laptop there's also an hdmi port and a usb a port the right has another usb port a usb c port a micro sd card slot which is nice the 3.5 mm combo jack and the kensington lock slot when it comes to connectivity there's wi-fi five and bluetooth 5.1 the two speakers are here at the bottom and they're decently loud no problem there there's also dts audio support but the quality is kind of okay i would say for a laptop in this price segment these speakers are fine now this is a slim and light laptop even lighter than the x1 so the battery is kind of modest too at 50 watts now infinix claims 9 hours of battery life on this laptop and in our usage this does look like a laptop that will last six to seven hours practically apart from this i like that infinix bundles the 65 watt usb cpd charger in the box and this is a fast charger that charges the laptop from 0 to 100 in just 90 minutes in terms of software there is windows 11 pre-installed and i like that there's no bloatware whatsoever no annoying antivirus apps here lastly a lot of you guys asked us about service center support for these laptops in a last infinix video and the company has confirmed to us that there are 1100 plus service centers in more than thousand towns in india and it's also pick up and drop support look to conclude things the x1 slim brings a pretty good solid package especially with its multiple variants and especially when you consider the fact that this starts at 29k i mean this leak in premium design the really nice modern looking display the port selection the backlit keyboard the big trackpad the good battery life these are all on point for a budget laptop yes this has the tangent intel chipsets which might bother some people who want the latest and greatest but apart from that i think the x1 slim does look like a great value for money offering i want to know your thoughts on this laptop though so comment down below and hit a like if you want us to cover more budget laptops and yeah thanks
