down below [Music] so you know how some interesting miui features are missing from some xiaomi phones but there's actually a new super interesting app that lets you access all of these hidden miui options on every smartphone and i'm not talking about the miui's hidden settings app from play store this is actually something new and different i'm talking about this me ui hidden libs which i know looks like a very simple app but it brings hidden features from ui 12.5 miui global rom and the miui 11 rusher on to give you an idea the poco f3 gt does not have memc the motion smoothing display feature or the ai hdr enhancement feature by default which is weird because the mi 11x has all of these features anyway with miui hidden lips you can just tap here and you can just access this feature one by one and even enable them on a non-support phone like the pro f3 gt now that's not all though see by default all xiaomi phones are set to the balanced power mode which brings the best of performance and battery efficiency which is actually a hidden power setting in miui that you can access from this app and as you can see it lets you switch to performance mode which obviously prioritizes the best performance now how much of a difference is this when i ran geekbench on both balanced and performance modes and as you can see from the scores the performance mode does improve things a little now this app has a lot more hidden options like this hidden battery stats page which shows you the battery health as well which is useful so yeah this is cool i mean give the video a like if you did not know about this do it [Music] so you've probably seen this video from the slo-mo guys with the apple watch is ejecting water it's pretty cool and you can do it in the iphone 2 with the same shortcut but you know what i'm getting at yes miui has a similar feature built in it's available in additional settings clear speaker and this plays a 30 second audio to clear speaker of water or any dust i tried this on the me 11 ultra because that's the only ipdated xiaomi phone i have and here's a video of the phone spitting out water with the clear speaker feature yup this is useful and if you don't have this feature on your phone where you can use the miui hidden libs app to access it so yeah sorted [Music] so one of the biggest issues i have while gaming is auto brightness turning down the brightness suddenly when i have an enemy around now it's probably an excuse i give myself for when i'm getting killed yeah i suck at bgmi but the point is yes auto brightness can be a little annoying when you're gaming but you know what not on me ui on me why there is an option that automatically turns off auto brightness when you start a game so here's the phone with auto brightness turned on and now i can just open up bgmi and look at this auto brightness goes off awesome right this is a feature you can enable by going to game turbo settings here go to enhanced experience and enable this turn off auto brightness and it's done now this is a useful feature but game tub also has options like bandwidth priority which is great for games like bgmi and also has this performance optimization option if your device heats up a lot while gaming [Music] so in stock android you just press hold the power button and you get this page along with the power-up menu and this page has all of these smart home controls and you can just turn on or turn off things from right here now this is pretty handy and this is something i used to miss in me ui but you know what miui actually has a super cool way to let you access these smartphone controls and not a lot of people know about this so you know what you can actually get all of your smart home devices here in this ios like control center miui as you can see i have the lights the fan the ac and a lot more i can just turn them on or off like this from right here now to get the smart home control feature first of all you have to switch to the ios like control center if you're using the older style notification shade now once you switch to the new version you'll get this smart home option where you can set the app you're using for example i'm using google home and i can just select it and that's it you'll now see smart home controls in the control center [Music] so this is not a feature obviously but it's very useful simi ui by default collects a lot of data especially for its ads and recommendation services but not many people know that there's actually an easy sort of hidden option in me ui that lets you disable these ads as well as stop me ui from collecting all that data see the passwords and security page where you get this fingerprint scanner face and lock options there is an option right at the end that says authorization and revocation which normally you wouldn't even notice because it just sounds so not user friendly anyway you can just go here and as you can see there are these xiaomi apps and services there's msa miui's ad service i just disable it and look what it says it says that this will stop it from collecting my data and very importantly all related info will be deleted from the servers so i'm gonna do it and i think you should do it too now these are five sort of hidden me ui features that i think deserve a lot of attention but i want to know if you guys
