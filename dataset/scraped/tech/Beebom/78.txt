best privacy apps on android what apps we use on our phones so eight super cool open source android apps but which are the best apps of 20 21. [Applause] [Music] well the year is coming to an end and that means it's time for our year and roundup of the best apps that are not this year i mean i'm talking about the absolute best apps of 2021 on both ios and android now before we begin i want to give a huge shout out to wondershare whatsapper which is a great tool if you want to transfer your whatsapp data from your android phone to iphone or vice versa whatsapp lets you do this in two ways you can use the whatsapp desktop client or you can use the whatsapper app on your android phone and connect it to an iphone via a usb otg cable you can transfer chats photos videos audios attachments etc i mean awesome right well you can download one to share whatsapp for free so check it out from the link down below [Music] first up i think you've heard about the wallpaper engine i mean if you haven't heard about it it's a very popular pc wallpaper app on steam that lets you create some really cool animated wallpapers well this year actually recently wallpaper engine finally arrived on android now unlike the steam app the android app is free and you get these really cool live wallpapers in the app for example just check out this one or this one cool right but wallpaper engine android is all about importing your live wallpaper collection on your pc your phone now that's all walmart ranger also lets you create live wallpapers out of videos on your phone gifs photos and you can create a custom wallpaper playlist that will cycle your wallpapers it's all pretty nice [Music] so like every year we got some really cool launcher apps for android this year for example there was the launcher 12 which i really like but a proper new launcher that really got my attention is minimalist phone as the name tells you it's a very very minimal launcher which is all about reducing your screen time on your phone improving your focus and it works for that i mean this is the home screen with just the clock and these apps that i've said as my favorite there's the whole app list here and that's pretty much it it's clean and nice now there are different color themes which kind of look good and a couple of handy features like an in-app timer so you don't just keep scrolling in an app also there's the option to filter distracting notifications so this is an app that deserves to be checked out [Music] let's face it the android tv launcher aka the home screen is kind of okay even the new one that google recently rolled out to all android tvs now this is where i like the new f launcher i mean it's almost a perfect replacement as you can see it's very simple very clean with just the app showing up now there are some handy options i can set the wallpaper here create different categories for different apps hide apps now i honestly like this because it just gets me the list of apps and that's it no permanent ads no recommendations plus it shows side loaded apps as native and it is open source so what's not like [Music] 2021 was a really rough ef oneplus let's have a moment of silence for that [Music] yeah but the one thing it did good was launch clip it's a clipboard app that's available on android ios and even windows and mac thanks to browser extensions it's a truly cross-platform and it's pretty good and you just have to set it up on your phone and your pc with the same google account and then you can copy and paste text share photos and other files across devices i can just send the latest clipboard data on my phone like this and it's available on my laptop this is great because a lot of us use things like whatsapp or even a cloud service to share files between our phones and pc now clipped is free and there's no limit on the devices you use [Music] i know there are a lot of great podcast apps available out there and i've tried the majority of them but the best new app if you want to discover new podcasts is moonbeam this is the app and it asks you the topics first up you can even import podcasts from other apps and then you can beam through the different podcast suggestions well what's been well the home page has this really cool ad-free feed of podcast recommendations where i can just swipe down and moonbeam plays a clip from a podcast and i can just swipe down again to go to the next podcast and on it on it goes and this is what beaming is all about now what i really like in this app is that the brief preview clips that are played are very well chosen and the discovery page is great too basically if you like podcasts you have to try moonbeam which is available on both android and ios for free [Music] so we don't really get a lot of great camera apps for android and iphones get them but on android it's pretty scarce but this one's pretty interesting see motion cam is the first app on android that lets you shoot 10 bit cinema dng draw video here's the app and there is the raw video option as you can see with all the manual controls you need now raw video recording is still an experimental feature in motion cam i mean only works well on flagships it does not record any audio the file size is huge as it is with dngs but this is a pretty good step i mean the control you have when it comes to color grading and draw videos is a big advantage and we've seen how iphones have up the video game so it's high time we see android up its game too so yeah this is the reason motion cam is in our list of best apps of 2021. [Music] now buzzkill is an app that launched last year but i discovered in 2021 and it's a pretty good app i mean buzzkill lets you handle your irritating notifications a lot better i mean you can set the rules in the app to make sure that you don't get continuous notifications from the same app for example there are times when you get constant notification tones from messages this stops app you can also set buzzkill to automatically copy the otp or verification code and just dismiss the notification how cool is that now you can create your own rules but the best thing is the explore page which has these many rules you can use so it's super useful [Music] so you probably know all about android 12's privacy dashboard feature which is pretty great and this app called privacy dashboard brings that feature to every single android phone and it's awesome i mean i'm sure a lot of you guys know about this app already but this deserves to be in this list i mean shows your timeline of what apps have used the location camera and mic and when they've used it and also brings the privacy indicators for these permissions so you know when an app uses location or mic in the background best thing though it all works pretty well well that was a list of the best apps of 2021 and i'm sure there are some really great apps that we kind of missed out on so make sure to comment down below so that everyone knows also give this video like share it subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos and also subscribe to our really cool bee bomb shots channel if you haven't already the link is down below thanks for watching and in advance happy new year and merry christmas why is your prepaid plan valid for 28 days and not 30 days tell me why [Music] you
