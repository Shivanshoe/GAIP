[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and i'm pretty sure when you saw the title of this video gadgets under 100 rupees you thought what can you actually get under 100 rupees honestly when you're looking for all of these gadgets under 100 rupees i had the same low expectations but turns out you can actually get some really useful gadgets under 100 rupees now do note that we bought all of these gadgets under 100 rupees but when you check them out the price might be a little different but it should not be a big difference anyway let's check out the gadgets now [Music] so you know how we have charging sockets at home but there's nothing near them to actually keep your phone on well this mobile wall holder is perfect for docking in your phone while charging it's pretty simple you just peel off this adhesive tape stick it to any wall and yeah it works on any surface even glass surfaces and that's it now you just put your phone to charge and pop your phone right in yeah it's useful and it looks kind of cool now can you guess the price of this it's crazy i'll give you five seconds to comment and let's see if you get the price right okay so it's actually priced at just 30 rupees insane right now most charging cables especially apple ones are infamous for being stupid pieces of fragile crap i mean look at my old macbook air cable yup that does look like crap anyway what you can do is get this cable protector set and even on the amazon listing they've showed it on apple cables so you can just put these protectors on your cables like this and prevent them from looking like this yeah it's very useful and it's just 97 rupees for a set of four [Music] have you ever wanted to connect a bunch of pen drives ssds phones etc to your laptop and run out of ports well that's not a good feeling i mean my macbook air only has two usb ports we'll enter this four port usb hub at just rupees 99 i know this looks kind of cheap and feels kind of cheap and has usb 2.0 so it will perform cheaply too but you know what it can actually get the job done it has this beautiful pink design and it has four usb ports and i tested it and all of these ports work which is awesome considering the price so yeah pretty useful now what if you bought the four port usb hub because it's pink and pretty and then you realize you actually have the new macbook which only have usbc ports thanks to apple now this simple usbc to usb a dongle is for all the new macbook users out there with this you can connect your usb accessories and even the 4 port usb hub now what's interesting is that it has support for usb 3 which means you get fast data transfer speeds now the price is awesome for what it brings it's just 74 rupees crazy now i think you'll relate to this while playing games for long hours the fingers get sweaty and that results in misfires and inaccurate shots now enter these thumb sleeves honestly i had no idea that thumb sleeves were a thing but turns out these have been pretty popular since the pubg days yeah the good old days anyway you get two sleeves in a pack and they fit my thumb fine they're sweat proof and they work well on every phone i tried them all now honestly i felt kind of weird using them at first and i don't think this is for casual gamers like me instead it's for hardcore gamers also if you like akshay and you have this claw setup in games like cod mobile you'll need additional grips the price just 97 rupees for a pair [Music] next up on this list is this earphones pouch which honestly at first looks seemed a bit small and tiny but you know what it's actually pretty useful if you're good at wrapping things up so this is the earphones pouch and it has two slots one is this mesh slot which can securely hold your earphones and the other side which is this blank space and here you can keep your pen drive the dongle i told you earlier about memory cards and more so it's fine and it also looks decent enough and it's priced at just to be 68 so yeah pretty good for the price so this is actually something that makes a lot of sense so this is a stylus that also works as a ball pen and wait for it it also works as a phone holder yeah this thing is packed with functionality so as you can see it works as a stylus for your phone and it actually works well just don't expect apple pencil or s pen like accuracy when it comes to drawing also you can just twist it and use it as a pen it works fine and you can also keep it like this put in your phone and yeah watch wonder vision or the new falcon and winter soldier or you know the snyder cut justice league yeah lots of options these days price is once again pretty awesome it only costs 99 rupees and we've got a pack of two which costs 149 rupees so yeah worth the money [Music] another really cool thing that you can get under 100 rupees is an optical mouse so this is the mouse i'm talking about and it's actually from a decent brand it's the zebronic zeb rice wired optical mouse with 1200 dpi three buttons and a 1.2 meter cable at just rupees now for the price this is very good i mean compared to a gaming mouse or any other usual mouse it's kind of tiny but it works i had some issues with it on some surfaces but other than that it works well as a usual mouse because i'm sure you've seen these mini usb led lights they're fine they're cool and they can be useful if you don't have a laptop with backlit keyboard so overall it's fine but you know what's even better actually pretty amazing two of these mini usb led lights at just rupees 48 in fact you can get four of these at less than 100 rupees which is honestly pretty awesome and get four of these get the four port usb hub and it's actually party time [Music] so i use
