[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient be Montcalm and we've been waiting to get our hands on the brand new Galaxy Note end well this is the galaxy note there light so what are we waiting for let's check it out so we have the aura glow variant of the galaxy note tend to order blue no 10 plus anyway the note red light has the same new rectangular camera setup that we have seen on the galaxy s2 light and the galaxy a 51 and on the front you have the super AM display with a center punch oh it's a six point seven inch display and when it's the same striking AMOLED panel we saw in the s10 light those are the fingerprint scanner on the front which is an optical sensor and it's worked well so far now all that is great but we all know what's the highlight of the galaxy note there light well it's this the aspect I mean we recently made a video talking about how the s-pen makes the difference in the note then light and now that we have the phone we can see why the s-pen on the Galaxy Note 10.1 or the galaxy note in flash chips which means it is Bluetooth enabled has a point seven millimeter tip and has 4096 pressure levels now all the take aside the s-pen here brings all of the great features you generally associated with the Galaxy Note for example there's my favorite feature screen off memo so on the note 10 line you can just take out your pen and jot down a note without unlock on the phone you can even keep this note on the lock screen now like the note flagship you can just take on the s-pen to also get the Air Command with all of the tools you in create a hand into note quickly and he would convert it to text with ease you can use the smart select feature to capture a screenshot of a particular area and doodle on it or you know make a jet quickly you can also use pen up to get drawing really quickly and create some beautiful arcs there are just so many features that the S Pen brings and since this is loaded enable you can use it as a remote too so you can use this to capture a photo switch between the main and the selfie camera move between photos and gallery and do a lot more so this is the same great s-pen that you saw in the Galaxy Note Templars but there is one difference so the air actions feature is a bit limited on the Galaxy Note 10 like so in the note in line you cannot really use gestures to save switch between the lenses so main I mean we scroll up and down in the browser yeah these gestures aren't part of the galaxy Northern Lights s-pen but honestly I don't think it's a huge deal because the more youthful more used S Pen features are present but the s-pen on the Galaxy Note 10.1 about the rest of the phone when the rest of the food is pretty feature packed - when it comes to the cameras the Galaxy Note 10 12 megapixel F 1.7 primary camera a 20 megapixel F 2.2 ultra wide-angle lens and a 12 megapixel F 2.2 telephoto now this seems neither capable camera setup and while I'm here to truly test it out here are a few photos I have taken from the note tonight well the photos of the food looked great in good light things are sharp and well detailed I also like the dynamic range in this photo you know like - the photos are fairly good the F 1.7 aperture means the photos are bright and I like that definitely I also took a couple of photos in the light focus mode and yeah just check it out the phone also has the ultra wide-angle lens and as we have seen in Samsung falls off late the ultra wide angle lens seems really good I mean these photos look nice don't they but yeah like I said it's still pretty early to fool adjusting apart from this the Galaxy Note 10.1 camera features like the night mode the pro mode and more on the video front quite surprisingly the Galaxy Note 10.1 surprising because the Galaxy S 10 light only records for Kate 30fps videos anyway this is a 4k 60fps video shot from the Galaxy Note 10.1 stability is decent - I mean there's dual OS so it is kind of expected the Galaxy Note inline also has the super steady mode fiber oh is and it is super impressive here's a video I shot from it and yeah I love how it stabilizes things lastly on the camera front are the selfies it's a 32 megapixel F 2.0 selfie camera we're talking about and well here a few selfies I took from the phone over all the cameras might not be the highlight of the galaxy note ended up roms under the hood the Galaxy Note II light is part by the Exynos 9810 it's up to a GB RAM and 128 GB of expandable storage now I know Encinos 9810 is an older processor and it can't really compete with the flagship chipsets in this price range but we also know that it is a fairly capable processor I mean in my usage so far the Galaxy Note in light has been smooth even with all the s-pen testing I've been doing so yeah I'm hoping it'll work out just fine now if you're wondering Hoss 9810 can hand along the high-end games when I played pubsey mobile on the phone which T Falls to high graphics and the performance was great in a couple of sessions I play moving on to the software the Galaxy Note tail light comes with one UI on top of Android 10 and that means you get all of the features you can think of this features like the game booster for enhanced gaming performance the link to windows feature recently fast paced and loved the Knox security features and a lot more lastly there is the big battery the Galaxy Note tonight might be a light branded phone but it's got a not so lightweight 4500 mAh battery which should last pretty long browsing has 45 were charging support and it comes with the same 25 watt charger you get with the galaxy note 2 plus and the s10 light so yeah charging should be pretty fast that was a good look at a brand new Galaxy Note tell my dad has been launched at least 38 triple 9 in India and I think that's a good price for a food that makes the note more accessible I mean I know the Exodus 1918 is an old chipset but you know what not every food is about just the processor sometimes it's about the experience and the Galaxy Note deadlines brings the note aka the Esper experience to more people the note series has always been aimed at professionals business people and the Galaxy Note then light makes it more accessible to the students it's about the experience and for that I appreciate it having said that yes I will be using the note deadlines extensively in the next few days to see if it's all as good as it seems so you know what stay tuned for a full review of the Galaxy Note 10.1 but first and early thoughts on the Galaxy Note 10 light but what do you think there is the thoughts in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos but that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music]
