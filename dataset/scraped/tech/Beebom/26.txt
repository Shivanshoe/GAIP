a lot has been happening with oneplus off rate but let's face it phones like the oneplus 9r or even the oneplus 9rt good smartphones so when i heard about the launch of the oneplus 10r i was kind of looking forward to it but when this finally arrived i was kind of speechless and not in a good way i mean just look at this phone this can't be one plus i mean this does not look like a oneplus phone does it see no matter what your opinion of oneplus phones is i think you will agree when i say that almost all oneplus phones looked elegant and premium the 9 series the 8 series or 7 series oneplus phones have always looked classy but this i can't say the same about the oneplus 10 just look at the oneplus 10r it has these lines on the back which is something i would expect real me and oppo to do not oneplus it's not just the speedpad look at the camera bump which first of all looks super ugly i mean it makes the oneplus 10 pro look kind of good now it's not just the looks this glass module is a huge huge fingerprint magnet this is how it looks like after you've used the phone for a bit honestly it looks kind of cheap now these apart the whole boxy design is not something you associate with oneplus i get it everyone's moving to flat size like on the iphone but on the iphone it looks good because it's metal the oneplus 10r has a plastic frame which makes it look and feel like a budget phone and even though this is only 8.2 millimeters thick it looks and feels like a very very thick phone plus over the frame you can see the screen kind of bulging out which makes it look even more uneven the point is this whole design just does not look one plus like i mean he's the oneplus 9rt next to the oneplus 10r and it's kind of obvious the 9rt looks way more premium and it looks like a phone that costs 40k and the 10r looks like a phone that would be around 20k forget the 9rd just put the 10r next to any recent oneplus phone and it will always stand out and not in a good way now maybe maybe you are in a forgiving mood sir like it's fine it's just the looks who cares i'll put a case on it it's fine but how will you forgive oneplus for not putting in the iconic alert slider in a 40 000 rupee phone yes this phone does not have the alert slider i was just not expecting this i know hurts it's like oneplus does not want to be light anymore see the problem is the oneplus 10r is a wholly unoriginal smartphone i think you already know this but the oneplus 10r is basically the real me gt neo3 rebranded as you can see from this comparison the oneplus 10r is basically the same phone as the gt neo3 same display same cameras same battery same 80 watt and 150 watt charges so let me save you some time and only talk about what's different in this phone so first of all the oneplus 10 art has the diminishing 8100 max chipset which is basically the 8100 with some behind the scene changes from oneplus and mediatek now going to oneplus the max weight into the 8100 brings better thermals lower power usage and better gpu performance but when i ran some benchmarks on the 10r it actually scored lower than the gt neo3 in antutu as well as geekbench it did do better in the 3d market so maybe the jeep is actually faster on the max weighted i also ran the cpu throttling test app on the 10r and the gt new 3 and in the 30 minutes 50 threads test both the phones did well as you can see from this course i also checked the temperatures and they were both pretty normal but the 10r lost more battery i started the test with both phones 100 and the 10r lost 11 percent battery while the gt new three lost just eight percent so i don't think the max optimization is making a big difference here now another area where the oneplus 10r is different is the software i mean the software looks the same because oxygen os 12 is basically color os which is basically real me ui but the difference is in terms of bloatware and ads the gt neo3 comes with a ton of bloatware apps the 10r is a lot cleaner compared to that there's only netflix and spotify the gt93 also has these ads on the lock screen the 10r does not the 10r is also promised to get three major android updates and four years of security patches which is better than what really promised for the gt neo3 the one large difference between these two phones is the pricing the gt neo3 is priced 2000 less than the oneplus 10 look oneplus phones have always been oppo phones rebranded we all know that and we've been fine with it because oneplus used to take oppo phones make some good changes to it and launch it at good affordable prices the oneplus 10r is the opposite of that this is just a bad rebranding of the gt93 with higher pricing and i don't really know what's going on here to be very honest this is not an outright bad phone it is decent-ish but it just does not feel like a one plus smartphone maybe because of its unsettling design choices higher than competition pricing and cutting down on iconic differentiation such as the useful alert slider overall there's just one thought going in my head about this phone this can't be oneplus honestly i really really want to know what you guys think of the oneplus 10 at this price this design and yeah comment down below your thoughts on this phone give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing
