the apple ecosystem everyone always talks about the apple ecosystem they talk about the cool features like airdrop continuity imessage etc and yeah they are cool but no one talks about the android ecosystem well i'm going to change that today i'm going to talk about the android ecosystem [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bbm.com and the apple ecosystem is called an ecosystem because of the way the different apple devices are interconnected with each other i mean be the iphone macbook apple watch ipad or airpods all of these devices are designed to work well together but what about android i mean google 2 has multiple platforms like we all know android android tv wear os chrome drive but in india when we use an android smartphone we use a lot of different devices along with it a windows laptop a smart watch with maybe a third party os earbuds from different manufacturers so how does this whole ecosystem work well first of all i think there are three things that i really like about the apple ecosystem see first is continuity this lets you start off an app on one device see the iphone and continue on another say the macbook and as you can see it actually works very seamlessly i also like how these devices talk to each other for example there's universal clipboard support so anything you copy on one apple device is available to paste in another apple device third are the universal features present on these devices like say airdrop which makes file transfer between these devices just seamless and smooth now coming to the android ecosystem chromebooks especially in india aren't very popular so most people who use an android smartphone use a windows pc along with it now obviously android and windows are two separate platforms but microsoft with this earphone app has brought features that make the whole android windows experience a lot closer i mean the earphone app brings a number of useful ecosystem like features for example i have my pixel 4a paired with this zenbook 14 a video on which went live recently so check that out too after you're done here okay so with the your phone app set up i get all my phone notifications on the pc like this and i also like that i can respond to messages from right here so this is a whatsapp message and i can just reply like this this is very convenient apart from this another feature that i really like is that i can see all my recent photos from my phone here this is handy because this way i don't have to transfer photos to pc via mail or any other method i mean i take a lot of screenshots and sometimes i need them on the pc so this is actually very handy anyway the earphone app also lets me make or receive calls right from the pc as you can see there's the dial pad here there's also decent calls and i can also search the contacts so yeah it's pretty nice so these features are actually very good but here's the strange thing see all of these features that i just talked about are present for all android devices but there are some more cool features in the earphone app that are exclusive to samsung smartphones i mean first of all there's universal clipboard support so you can copy text on our samsung phone and paste it on the pc and vice versa there is phone screen which basically lets you mirror your phone's screen on the pc which is again great there's also android app support in some samsung devices i think the flagships which lets you run android apps on the pc yeah this is cool lastly with one of the samsung's flagship phones you can also drag and drop files like this from the file manager so this is actually cool now these are actually very useful cross-platform features but this is where the android ecosystem kind of lags behind because like i said these features are not present for all android devices anyway it's not just this though see there are a lot of other great things in the apple ecosystem that just don't work in the android ecosystem let me give you an example the notes app on apple devices syncs across devices beautifully but it's not the same with android i mean i use google keep for notes on my phone and i can get the same notes on my pc via the google keep web app but in true google style the web app will soon be killed so i'll have to use keep.google.com which honestly isn't the same as using an app another example is when you set a reminder on say the apple watch using siri you get the reminder on macbook the iphone and even the home pods yeah all the devices now when it comes to android google assistant is not available on windows it's not available on most smart watches because in india most smart watches don't have wearables they have their own platform so basically you only have google assistant on your phone and maybe your smart watch if it has wear os and also a smart speaker if you have the google one not the amazon it's also better sync in apple devices when it comes to say photos icloud photos are available on both macbook as well as iphone so you can access your photos anywhere anytime it's very easy google photos on the other hand is not available as an app on windows you have to use photos.google.com and yeah the experience isn't the same as an app now it's not just macbook or iphone if you use the airpods with other apple devices it can be paid three different apple devices at the same time and say you're listening to music on your macbook and you get a call on the iphone the airpods will automatically switch to the iphone it's not the same with the standard users i mean i've used earbuds from xiaomi realme oneplus and others in the past and none of them do this they don't switch automatically between the laptop and the phone i have to do it manually see right now there's only one word i have in my mind for the android ecosystem broken now the biggest reason for this is windows it's a separate os it's obvious but i don't think that's the big problem see the problem is manufacturers are busy launching new devices beat phones earbuds smart watches iot devices without working on bringing a seamless experience between all of them honestly i think it's high time google worked with microsoft to bring more cross-platform features integrate the important android services and features at not just google i think other manufacturers should also work on bringing a more seamless experience between the devices look 2021 should not be the year of rebranding devices i really hope that this year companies focus more on creating an overall user experience i mean apple's biggest strong point is its ecosystem so i think companies should come forward and create an ecosystem b the samsung ecosystem xiaomi ecosystem or an android ecosystem so that we finally have some tough competition for apple well what do you guys think do you think an android ecosystem is even possible comment down below also give this video a like if you enjoyed it
