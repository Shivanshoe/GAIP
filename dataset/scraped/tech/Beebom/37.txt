you guys loved our video of gadgets under 100 rupees but a lot of you guys also commented that you can get those same gadgets for under 50 rupees if you buy offline so you know what we decide to head to nehru place and look for gadgets under 50 rupees [Music] so we're just coming back from nehru place and we got a ton of gadgets but what we also really found that if you want gadgets under 50 rupees offline you need that one great skill bar gaining and i have that in abundance hey bro how much is the screen cleaner for this one thanks so we've tested all the gadgets and it's insane how some gadgets that cost 50 rupees or less are so useful and some gadgets are just super bad it's hilarious and i'm gonna talk about that too so let's check it out so first of all earphones under 50 rupees so we actually got a number of earphones at this price which is actually very surprising so we got this usbc earphone that's definitely original i mean i believe it believe it we also got these earpods copy earphones and we got these earphones from intex which are actually usable these are the 193 and i don't know what the 93 is for or the thunder but they're definitely good for 50 rupees at 75 volume the sound is fine bass is decent but if you go to the max volume it's still okay it's very loud but the treble is a bit too much overall i think these are great for 50 rupees because on amazon you get these same earphones for 250 rupees [Music] of course none of our gadget videos are complete with our mouse and yeah this time under 50 rupees we got not one but two mice for 50 rupees each so there's this one from zebeon and this one from zinx and both these mice are good but i like the zinc one more because of its slightly bigger size and beautiful red accents but jokes apart it has the higher 1600 dpi and it just felt more usable when i tried it plus i mean it's the art of high tech so why wouldn't i like it also this one is called the elfin optical mouse which is like man this one has a lot more cooling name it's called the mzx29 sounds like an iron man suit and by the way along with the mouse we also got this mouse pad which is definitely from logitech yeah seems legit and we got this for 50 rupees so we've got two carphone holders under 50 rupees this kind of usual one and this super cool one which i like more i know this looks like a mouse but you push this button and the phone holder pops up like this this is cool right it's also very functional because you can put your phone at any angle you want and it's also expandable and it can fit almost any phone out there now what's interesting though is we bought it for 50 rupees but online the same carphone holder is available for a piece 400 yeah that's a big difference [Music] the absolute best thing that apple has done is not launching the iphone it's introducing us to the world the age the era of dongles i love them and i know you do too i mean what's not to like about carrying another stupid tiny little device that can easily get lost i love dongles [Music] and the good news is under 50 rupees you can get a lot of dongles dongles so you can get this really useful usb c to a dongle that actually works you can get a bluetooth dongle that actually works too you can get this headphone dongle which looks like it was stolen from a oneplus box i did not steal it trust me and then you can connect this splitter to the dongle to create your own dongle world and this can actually be useful because you can use one port for earphones and the other one for the mic all of these cost less than 50 rupees so awesome [Music] i know what you're thinking smartphone gaming controller under 50 rupees but this is not just any gaming controller this is the w11 plus eat chicken artifact which is sensitive and fast without delay that's what she said so this is what the controller looks like and you're probably thinking this looks bad the truth is it even works really bad okay i mean trademarks do it has all the features two triggers a joystick it's expandable but none of that matters because it just does not work the joystick is fine but the right trigger is dead the left one gets stuck plus you can see the solid durable build right that's all everything else is flawless jokes about if you are a pro player like me [Music] first of all hit the like button do it right now and second you don't need these stupid gadgets what you need are finger sleeves sleeves for your finger 40 rupees so yeah pro play so if you want to buy a usbc cable or a lightning cable online you'll have to pay a minimum of 200 rupees which will seem like a lot after you watch this video now if you buy offline you can get these cables from a brand called erd for 50 rupees each and these are actually good and what's interesting is that online the same usbc cable costs 160 rupees and the same lightning cable costs 240 rupees anyway i say these are good because the cables seem strong and they work pretty low bar i know but still the usbc cable is rated for 15 watt charging and the lightning cable is rated for 10 watt charging so these can be used as a spare cable now if you can go 200 rupees you can also get this braided usbc cable from call mate [Music] next up is my absolute favorite gadget the four port usb hub let me quote myself from the past have you ever wanted to connect a bunch of pen drives ssds phones tablets laptops etc to your laptop and run out of ports yeah that's not a good feeling i mean my macbook pro only has two ports two ports so this is a usb 3.04 port hub and you know how much i love the dongle life [Music] so i just use the dongle connect this hub to it and have a ton of usb ports now the most important thing about this hub is that all of the ports work which is surprising given the 60 rupees price of this thing and it has features like led indicator slim size not really [Music] [Applause] so next up this is a tripod as it says on three places in the box tripod tripod and tripod yeah we get it so it's a pretty basic thing it has three legs that's the name tripod and it comes with a phone holder that is extendable and it extends quite a bit so this should fit in every single smartphone out there the smartphone holder can also be rotated and tilted and i also like that for 50 rupees this does not feel super cheap just a little cheap it's actually not bad also as the box says it supports simultaneous live broadcast of three devices which is an outright lie because how most of our laptop screens look like this and if you watched our laptop gadgets video and bought this for 2500 rupees first of all i'm really sorry because you could have gotten this screen cleaner for 50 rupees now you can just spray it on your face i mean your screen and just wipe it and your screen is all clean and nice this is what my macbook screen looked like before and this is how it looks like now so yeah i'd say this is useful [Music] now we also found some other gadgets under 50 rupees hence the name other gadgets for this section so we got this metal phone stand which does one thing that is holding your phone and it's not very good at that as you can see we also got this phone holder for a tripod which is definitely useful lastly we also got this bluetooth speaker for under 50 rupees which is super ugly and super old but it's fine from the front but look at the back the point is you can actually get gadgets under 50 rupees and some of these gadgets are actually usable so yeah hit like below and comment down below if you want us to do a video
