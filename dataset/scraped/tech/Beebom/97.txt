[Applause] [Music] so guys this is paige from vm.com and this right here is the brand new real me gt neo2 this is a snapdragon 870 phone that has just launched in india at a price tag of rupees 31 triple nine for the eight 120 gb vayner and now this goes against this the me 11x which is also a snapdragon 870 phone and this has an official price tag of rupees 28 triple nine for the eight 128 gb variant plus both of these are available at some great festive offers as well so which is the better phone to go for the neo2 or the me11x well i've done a detailed comparison so stick till the end to find out the verdict so let's take it one by one let's start with the design of these phones okay so here we go this is the real me gt neo2 and the mi 11x side by side and i think both of these phones are premium looking with glass backs so i'd say the looks are pretty subjective i mean the main mx has a glossy finish in this black variant which is a huge fingerprint magnet but it is available in matte finishes too as for the gt neo2 this is the gt news neo blue variant which i like with its matte glass frosted back but there is also the neo green variant which is kind of bold and some people might like it so both of these phones give you multiple options also for anyone wondering both these phones have a plastic frame as for the dimensions and weight the main 11x is slightly thinner and 4 grams lighter but the gt neo2 has a marginally small footprint when it comes to height and width you know what it's just not a big enough difference now do note that both of these phones don't have a headphone jack there's no micro sd slot but both of these phones do have stereo speaker setups but in my usage i found gt neo2 speakers fantastic i mean compared to the mi 11x speakers there's just a little more depth a little more thump on the gt neo2 speakers with its louder earpiece speaker the main evidence speakers are good too and they have a little more treble so that's there now so far it's been pretty evenly matched both of these phones have their advantages when it comes to the design that the other phone lacks the real me gt new 2 has an in-display fingerprint scanner which honestly i prefer a lot more than a side mounted fingerprint scanner on phones like the m11x i mean i expect in-display fingerprint scanners on amoled phones now on the other hand the mi 11x has a gorilla glass 5 back as well as front and it has the ip53 rating for splash resistance the gt neo2 does have a glass back but there's no mention of gorilla glass and yeah like most phones these days this should be splash resistance but there's no ip rating coming to the displays both these phones have the same display at least on paper e4 amino panel fhd plus 120 hertz refresh rate same contrast ratio 1300 nits of peak brightness hdr 10 plus support 100 dc ip3 now there are a few differences the gt neo2s panel is said to have a touch sampling rate of 600 hertz compared to 375 hertz on the mi 11x apart from this the mi 11x has memc support which gt neo2 lacks but the gt neo2 has the open ultravision engine with features like video image enhancers so yeah it's good now specs apart i think both the panels look really good really vibrant and really smooth thanks to the higher refresh rate they have been tuned a little differently with the gt neo2 going for a warmer look and the male 11x going for a cooler look but you can always change the color more i also did a manual brightness comparison and both these displays are very bright now in a manual test i did feel the me11x panel was maybe one two person brighter honestly you'll be good with any of these great ammonite panels next up i want to compare these cameras because this is one area where i'm expecting a big difference see both of them have triple cameras but the main camera is what matters the gt neo2 has a 64 megapixel main sensor while the 11x has a 48 megapixel main camera so which is better well it's pretty close see both phones have their advantages but i think the gt neo2 is slightly better overall see the gt neo2 shots are more detailed almost every single time for example in this photo of the ps5 controller if we zoom in you can see that the gt neo2 shot is sharper now here's another example again zooming in and more details on the realme phone the gt neo2 also has better dynamic range i'll give you two examples for example in this photo you can see the buildings in the background in the gt neo2 shot now here's another photo where you can see the window and yeah the gt902 is just better at dynamic range now the mini 11x does take more natural shot at times but to be honest both of these phones saturate colors here and there so yeah it's fine now in low light it's a very close call the mi 11x does very well when it comes to sharp photos even if it comes at the cost of more noise the gt neo2 cuts down the noise better but sacrifices the sharpness at times however when it comes to night mode the gt neo2 has the better night mode now we took these shots in the night mode and as you can see from the shots it's a big difference when it comes to videos the gt neo2 supports up to 4k 60fps videos while the mi 11x can only do 4k 30 fps max anyway here's a 4k 30fps video from both the phones and color wise and even stability wise they look pretty close but i did notice that the mi 11x video was a little sharper at times now when it comes to ultra wide angle lens both these phones are sort of decent they both take photos that are sharp and in focus but the color accuracy is something that both of them are inconsistent with apart from that when it comes to the front camera the gt neo2 has a 16 megapixel sensor while the mini 11x has a 20 megapixel sensor now megapixels apart both these phones take fairly good and well exposed selfies but the mi 11x selfies are sharper and they have this warmer tone which might be appealing for some people moving on to the performance the gt neo2 and 11x are evenly matched snapdragon 870 ufs 3.1 storage you know the specs but how do they fare in the real world well both these phones are nice and smooth in day-to-day usage and when it comes to gaming both of these phones are also almost lag free when gaming at highest graphics settings so that's good but apart from that i ran a few tests first up i did some benchmarks now first up i did a storage speed test where the gt neo2 scores higher which is a surprise since both of these phones have ufs 3.1 storage anyway i also ran some cpu gpu benchmarks here's the additive score but surprisingly again the gt neo2 scores higher now same with the geekbench 5 scores the gt neo2 does better and that may be due to the thermals xiaomi has not clearly talked about a cooling system in the mi 11x but the gt neo2 comes with what realme calls stainless steel vapor cooling plus which is a large area 8 layer structure now i'm telling you this because i did a thermal throttling test on both these phones and while both of these phones don't have any overheating issues in my testing i did notice that the realme gt neo2 performed a little better than the m11x see i used the cpu throttling test app and i ran it three times in the first 15 minute run the gt neo2 throttled to 88 of its max performance while the mi 11x throttled to 78 of its max performance now in the second 15 minute run the gt new 2 throttled to 86 of its max performance and the mi 11x went to 77 percent as you can see in the screenshot now in the last run i ran the test for 30 minutes and again the gt neo2 was better throttling to only eighty nine percent of its max performance the mean mx on the other hand throttled to 79 which is not bad but yeah the gt neo2 is better now the next segment is battery charging the real gt nu2 is the better phone on paper here beyond the battery front or charging now the battery performance is something i tested and while it was not a big difference the gt neo2 was obviously a little better i played a youtube video at 1080p at max brightness for an r and the gt newton lost only six percent battery while the mi 11x was also pretty good losing seven percent battery i also recorded a 15 minute 4k video on both the phones and in this both phones lost exactly the same five percent battery now as for the overnight battery gain i checked and both the phones are pretty good losing only two percent battery on charging front the reamy gt nu2 goes from zero to 100 in just 39 minutes with its 65 watt charger while the mi 11x takes 58 minutes with its 33 watt charger now when it comes to the software there's real me ui 2.0 there's miui 12. now both of these ui skins have their fans so it's subjective when it comes to pre-installed apps the me 11x is better the gt neo2 has netflix snapchat amazon facebook dailyhunt josh linkedin booking.com prime video amazon music merge yeah lots of them although they can be uninstalled the me 11x has netflix amazon prime video facebook linkedin and yes these can be uninstalled too now apart from that both of these phones are on the august security patch so yeah pretty even lastly there's the connectivity now when it comes to 5g bands the gt neo2 is a proper 5g phone and like the me11x it has eight 5g bands while the mi 11x has two 5g bands apart from that both these phones have carrier aggregation support so that's great but one thing to note is that the real me gt new 2 has nfc on board which is something that the mi 11x lacks now it's not a big deal but it's something you should know but it's time now for the verdict so which is the better phone between these two the gt neo2 or the male mx well i'll be honest the mi 11x is a phone that i liked until the real me gt neo 2 arrived because honestly the enemy gt neo2 looks like the better phone overall so the real me phone wins on a lot of important factors it has a better camera a bigger battery faster charging more 5g bands better performance in thermal tests better touch sampling date and it has an in-display fingerprint scanner which i really like now the main x has a gorilla glass 5 front and back ip53 rating better front cameras and it's a bit more affordable but yeah the gt neo2 is my winner here because like i said it's just a better phone overall well what do you guys think which phone would you go for
