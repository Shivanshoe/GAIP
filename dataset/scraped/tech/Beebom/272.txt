[Music] [Applause] [Music] Nega dissipation beyond comm and Oppo has launched its flagships of 2020 in India the Oppo find x2 Pro and the over find x2 now both of these are flagship phones with toggling specs and premium features no pro findings - Pro has obviously gotten the more hype but the Oppo find x2 is also a very similar phone with hopefully a more appealing price so we thought why not take a look at the Oppo find x2 well here it is so what are you waiting for let's unbox this and if you're wondering about the Oppo find x2 Pro we have posted a very cool unboxing on our Instagram page to check it out and by the way it came in this huge box so go ahead check it out now what are you waiting for let's unbox the Oppo find x2 so I'd like the things you get in the Oppo find x2 box you get the brand new Oppo find x2 obviously these type CEO phones which I kind of like the transparent silicon case you get the type-c cable and the insane 65 watt fast charge of which I will get to in a while anyway this is the new oppa fine x2 and I think this mirror finish and this color looks pretty striking the ceramic black gradient is something I like more but this ocean blue variant is also pretty good-looking now coming to the specifics of the Oppo find x2 this is obviously a flagship phones for everything here is top the line premium but the highlight to me is this display so let's talk about this beautiful display this is a curved six point seven inch qHD plus 120 Hertz HDR 10 plus display with this punch hole and it has some really cool features now the moment i unbox define X 2 the first thing I did is switch the refresh rate from auto to 120 Hertz which by the way works at qHD resolution and well the display feels super smooth and look stunning the display supports 240 hertz touch sampling to so it should be super responsive while gaming now to display here is very bright so outdoor visibility looks fine it has a great contrast ratio and it looks fairly good like it to me a lot of interesting features first of all it has the nature tone display feature which adjusts the screen temperature based on the lighting and here's how it works outdoors and indoors yeah sometimes the impact is minimal bad it's there the phone also has the over an ultra vision engine on the hardware side which does two interesting things first it converts SDR videos to HDR which should see details better while also widening the color gamut secondly it can upscale 24 or 30 FPS videos to 60fps or even 120 fps both these features are supported in popular apps like Netflix YouTube and prime video now when I did try it out the HDR video enhancement did work on some of the non HDR videos here's a video with HDR enhancement turned off and the right side is the video with the feature turned on now I'm not sure you can see it in the camera but some of the videos do look a bit more attractive with the HDR feature tour not as for the video motion enhancement feature it's a feature probably seen in TVs and here's a video with and without this feature now it's cool for when you're watching something fast-paced because it really smooths things up but do note that not all types of videos play well with this feature logo for find X 2 has the same display as the Oppo find X 2 pro and well it's a beautiful gorgeous display stunning to look at and I think it's one of the best displays I've ever seen so that is honestly great now coming to highlight number 2 and that's the flash of specs no profile next to comes in a single radiant and while I love these specs snapdragon 865 plus with 5g 12 GB of lpddr4 RAM and 256 gigs of u FS 3.0 storage yup these are flagship specs and the benchmarks show that as you can see the numbers here are pretty awesome and you know what I've only used this phone briefly but I can tell you it's one fast smart phone the animations the app loading it's all very snappy and I like gaming right there has been no hiccups and I wasn't really expecting any to be honest that's what helps is the fact that color over seven is a good upgrade from previous color choice iterations it's definitely more mature and brings in all the features you need as for the pre-installed apps well there are a bunch of these apps pre-installed on the phone and most of them can be uninstalled birtija these are the apps that you get with the phone pre-installed next up I want to talk about the cameras jeez I think the only area where the find x2 is not similar to the findings to crow but hey the non-prorated is no slouch when it comes camera so let's talk about it it has a 48 megapixel primary camera a 20 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens and a 13 megapixel telephoto lens the specs are decent ish but what really got me excited here are the video features the fine x2 is capable of shooting 4k 60fps videos and you get all the really cool features like ultra steady max and ultra steady Pro video mode which worked really well here's a video I captured using the ultra steady max mode while cycling and it's pretty stable even though I was having a tough time holding the phone with one hand anyway there's also the portrait mode video feature that has always worked when an opah phones and yeah it works well here too as you can see yeah I'm asking you guys to hit the bell act in the video now apart from the easy Oppo find x2 comes with these audio effects were recording 3d recorded records of 360 degrees around sounds on the mic the sound focused feature is basically the sound increasing based on the subject and you're zooming in and there is an option to reduce some wind noise which is interesting I mean the scenes used right so I tried it out hey guys what's up I am recording this video with the fan turn of the max and the reduce wind noise option turned on I think it reduces the noise after a couple of seconds but it kind of works but I want to test it out in windy conditions to really know its impact anyway what do you think - listen the comments so the video features are pretty exciting and pretty cool but I also took a few photos from the find x2 in daytime I think the fine x2 just a fine job of details and dynamic range some shots look really good the character C isn't always perfect as the phone tries to boost colors but overall looks good so far you know likes things are pretty good - the photos of bright and sharp and nice some photos have a little bit of an over processed look but it's still early days so no judgement I also took a few ultra wide-angle shots which has autofocus and I think the shots look great so far they're not even official telephoto lens just 2 X optical zoom and 5 X hybrid zoom and I think the camera does well at 2x and 5x here's an example bad also I took a few selfies from the 32 megapixels selfie camera so check them out moving on to the battery and here the fine x2 comes with a failure big 4200m age battery and while that's great the highlight here is obviously the crazy-fast 65 watt super boot 2.0 charger which I've been waiting to talk about because it's just insanely fast the charger takes to find x2 from 10 to 50 percent in around nine minutes and that is fast but it causes a full charge the find x2 takes 28 minutes to fully charge yes 28 minutes to fully charge a smartphone with a 4200 mah bad for ya I love this charging speed 65 were charging for the wind really truly exciting stuff having said that if you're wondering there is no wireless charging here which definitely would have been nice for a flagship phone like the Oppo find x2 anyway all of this all of these features are packed in this stunning design I like this finish and I like the in hand feel of the phone as for the functionality the phone comes with the in screen fingerprint scanner which has been super fast and it has features like steel speakers NFC the IP 54 rating for dust and splash resistance also other things to note here is that the phone has a dual SIM card and it has no microSD slot which I don't think should be a problem well at the end of it all I've only used the Oppo find x2 briefly but so far this is a phone that feels and looks like a premium smartphone it has a lot in common with your profile next to pro and that's also a great thing I mean that means you get the same stunning design flash specs one of the most amazing displays out there the insane 65 watt fast charger and all the high-end camera features now there's one thing that's different from the pro is the cameras and well that's something I need to test out extensively to truly judge when all said and done I will wait to know the pricing of the phone to truly give my word it on it but I do hope or price the fine x2 well because well the fine x2 does seem like a great fine see what did they sorry well that was our first impressions on the Oppo find x2 so what do you think tell us your thoughts in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs
