android and windows generally don't play very well but samsung has been trying to fix that this is the new galaxy book to 360 that launched recently in india and this brings some cool features good specs but it also shows us samsung's ecosystem features in action so yeah let's get into it [Music] [Music] so the looks this laptop speaks class from all the angles it's got a metal build which looks quite minimal and nice i also like that this aluminium finish is not a big fingerprint magnet and has this soft touch feel which makes this whole design stand out one thing that surprised me though is how sleek and light this is it is 12.9 millimeters thick and weighs only 1.19 kgs i mean i was comparing it with the macbook air and turns out the galaxy book 2 360 is slimmer and lighter plus this is a two in one laptop and the hinge feels solid so far which is very important because you're gonna use it in tablet mode tent mode and even in this stand mode i mean i've been using this laptop in tablet mode a lot and the hinge seems reliable in fact the lid here can be lifted with one hand which is impressive because generally light laptops two-in-one laptops can't really do this this design is also mostly solid but i did notice a very minor flex on the keyboard it's not a big deal but yeah other than that this feels like a very well-built laptop it has the mil-std 810g certification for military-grade durability the port selection is good too there's a micro sd slot on the left along with the mic headphone jack and a usb port on the right there is an hdmi port a usbc port and a thunderbolt 4 usb c port so it's not only thinner than the macbook air it also has more ports than the macbook air yeah garage there's also a fingerprint scanner in the power button which is fast and nice the speakers are on the bottom and there's two of them and as for the quality they're kind of okay the clarity is good but the loudness could have been better moving on to the display you have the specs now in a two in one the screen matters a lot and this is a super amoled panel and it looks like a super amoled panel i mean the first time i saw the screen it just reminded me of the amoled displays on samsung phones it's just a premium audio display with very good colors great blacks and a lot of us use two in one laptop so multimedia and this display makes sense for that another good thing is that this is a very responsive touch screen so i actually like using this in tablet mode there's also s pen support and samsung selling that separately but i did try the s22 ultra s pen on this and it's a good experience but the palm rejection could have been better now one quirk about this display is that it's a fairly reflective screen i mean the brightness is good but you can see the reflections on it let's talk about the specs now the galaxy book 2360 is an intel evo certified laptop and it comes with the latest 12 gen intel chipsets the variant we have has the 10 nanometer core i7 1255u cpu with 10 cores 12 threads iris xc graphics 15 watt tdp and there's 512 gb of gen 3 pci ssd and 16 gb lp ddr4x ram if you're wondering about ddr5 ram that's only present in the pro variants anyway i did run some benchmarks on the laptop to give you an idea so here's the geekbench score this is the pc mark score and here's the budget bench photoshop score and lastly this is the crystal disk mark score benchmarks apart the performance of the laptop seems fast and snappy i mean i was able to get through 10 tabs on edge with 8k video playing smoothly and there were no hiccups honestly i've only used this laptop for a day so it's too early to judge for me but the laptop beat in the usual laptop mode or in the tablet mode feels smooth the laptop comes with windows 11 on board with microsoft office bundled with it but what's really cool are the ecosystem features the laptop actually comes with this galaxy book experience app that shows you all the cool connected features between the galaxy book 2 a galaxy phone and a galaxy tablet and even galaxy earbuds first of all the second screen which lets you use a galaxy tab as a secondary screen along with the galaxy book 2. there's also multi-control which is a lot like apple's universal control and it lets you use the laptop's keyboard and mouse on the tablet seamlessly but it only works with tablets that have the one ui 4.1 update so we could not really try that plus there all the features like quick share to share files between samsung devices wirelessly and it automatically converts files in case the other device does not support that file format there's also private share to send private files that nobody can share or take a screenshot of smart switch to move files from your old laptop to this one click pairing with the galaxy buds and there's also the link to windows with all the cool features like clipboard sharing notification mirror the option to use android apps on the laptop so the galaxy book 2 360 is feature packed when it comes to ecosystem features and if you have a samsung phone samsung tablet samsung earphones the experience is going to be amazing for you as for the other basics of the laptop the touchpad and the keyboard are some of the best i've used on a windows laptop this is the trackpad and it's very smooth and responsive the keyboard is very good too it is a standard backlit chiclet style keyboard but i like how the keys are well spaced out and even though the key travel is not a lot it's okay because the keys are super crisp the tactile feedback is good and it just feels very clicky i did feel the keys are a bit too flat because i'm used to the curvy keys on the macbook but overall this just feels like a keyboard that will be fun to type on the battery is a 61 wattage battery and i haven't had the time to test out the battery but samsung rates it for 22 hours of video playback the charger is a 65 watt usbc charger it looks pretty nice and since it is a pd charger you can fast charge your other devices too the 720p webcam is on the top and the webcam is nothing special but samsung has these cool features to blur the background smooth in the face there's also this auto framing feature which zooms in on your face and make sure to track your face to keep it in the center coming to the pricing the galaxy book 2 360 score i5 variant cost rupees 99 990 and the core i7 variant we have cost rupees 1 lakh 5990 plus they are all these launch offers so this is a premium high-end laptop from samsung and i quite like it i mean i'm here to test things out extensively and compare it with other laptops in this price range but there are many things i like about this the design looks very understated and premium i love how lightweight and sleek this laptop is the super amoled display is absolutely gorgeous and i love the cool ecosystem features that samsung is bringing i also like the keyboard track pad and the poor selection are on point so this seems pretty cool so far but i want to know your opinion on this laptop do you think the galaxy book 2 360 makes sense at one lakh rupees comment down your thoughts in the comment section down below also
