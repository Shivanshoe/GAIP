[Music] is [Music] hey guys this is paige from phone.com and a lot of you guys have been asking us to talk about the new pixel 4a and well here i am talking about it this is the phone right here and let me just get straight to the point i recently switched to the pixel 4. yes i've been using the pixel 4a for almost a week now and the big question why exactly did i switch to the pixel 4a see smartphones launched in 2020 have been all about one thing gimmicks and the pixel 4a on the other hand is a very simple smartphone with things that actually end users want i mean the first time i unboxed this phone and held it in my hand i was actually surprised at how lightweight and compact this is just look at the phone in my hand it's just super handy now to put things into more perspective this is a phone that's almost as light as the new iphone mini at around 140 grams see everyone's hyping up the iphone 12 mini as the ultimate compact phone but i think the pixel 4a is up for that spot too just look at it next to the oneplus not now you can see the difference right and unlike past years when the pixels had those big bezels and clunky designs the pixel 4a has an almost bezel-less screen with the punch hole and even then it keeps the stereo speaker set up which is fairly good by the way now i know the back isn't very premium it's plastic but it's matte and there's no worries about fingerprints or you know breaking it now to be honest i like the minimal look but yes it's not the same as the glass mat feel of say the pixel 4 i know it has the headphone jack well the point is we have been asking smartphone makers to give us more handy more compact phones and nobody is doing it so the pixel 4 even with its slightly generic design kind of feels fresh and nice now another gimmick in the smartphone world is the number of cameras everyone wants to have the most cameras and they do that by including useless macro and depth lenses and whatnot the pixel 4a does not go for the triple camera or the quad camera hype nor does it have 108 megapixel or 64 megapixel camera it has that one camera that can be the budget phones the high end phones and even some android flagships it's so good so here are some drops from the phone and i switched to this phone from the oneplus 8t and i noticed a difference in photos straight away the photos on the pixel 4 look like they're taken from a flagship phone just look at the color tools the dynamic range or the details it's just very good in order to the pixel 4a handles the exposure the lighting very very well and we all know about the portrait mode shots they look very pixel-like and stunning on the video front there's 4k 30fps support and there's ois and i like the video quality too sometimes the videos from the phone have a warmer tone but mostly the video was very good see the pixel camera experience is not absolutely perfect there are a few minor issues here and there and there's obviously the big missing feature the ultra wide-angle lens which honestly would have been great because i've heard about the great ultra wide angle performance of the new pixel 5. so that would have been great but this one camera for this price range is top notch and just unbeatable i mean i compared the pixel 48 to the oneplus note and the pixel 4a absolutely beats the oneplus note almost every single time the knot sometimes captures more details because of the higher resolution sensor but the pixel 4 is just a better phone in terms of color accuracy and the overall exposure and sharpness be it in good light and especially in low light so the camera is honestly brilliant and coming from any other phone that's not a flagship you will notice a very big difference moving on the biggest pain of using smartphones these days is in the software see i'm just tired of all the bloatware the ads and even the privacy issues that most android skins have and this is where the pixel stock android experience is just brilliant see in the past stock android did not have all the features so it's understandable why people like custom skins which are very feature packed but now i think stock android is mature enough and has everything an end user needs and the experience on the pixel 4 is just better than any other skin out there there's absolutely no bloatware there are no ads no weird bugs it will get the android updates first up even the betas it does not kill apps in the background you know this if you've seen our last video so it's a great experience and even though there's snapdragon 730 on board i found the performance of the phone to be very very good see people these days buy smartphones based on the chipset they have but i always say that high-end specs are fine but it's the optimization that matters and on the pixel 4a it's actually optimized software here is very smooth and runs very well to be honest i wouldn't call this the fastest phone out there or a crazy fast phone but i'd say this it's consistent and lag free which is good enough for me and most people even the game experience is good i have been using this phone as my daily driver so i've been doing some gaming on the phone and there's been no lag or any weird heating issues so all good look the pixel 4a is not a perfect phone i have mixed feelings about two things in this phone so firstly it has an oled panel which is good when it comes to colors and accuracy i mean it's on it so it looks great all around but i did feel that it wasn't very bright when compared to say a phone like the oneplus not there's also the fact that there's no high refresh rate apart from that there's a mod is 3140 mah battery and that's expected considering the size of the phone and in my usage i found the battery ranging from decent to average with screen on time of four and a half hours or some days and five and a half hours on other days same with the charging the 18 watt charger takes the phone from 10 to 100 in an hour and 30 minutes which is not bad but not something brilliant so to conclude things everyone's marketing their phones like we're bringing the snapdragon 855 to this price the snapdragon 765 g to this price heck you can even get phones with the snapdragon 865 at this price like say the iq3 but no one's going to buy phones like the ico 3 because of the skin it's not about the processor it's all about the overall experience i mean the pixel 4 is a phone that's got a lot of hype and it's something that people actually want to buy at least 31 triple nine even with the 730 chipset single camera and small size and that's because there are no gimmicks or unnecessary marketing frills to this phone this is a very simple smartphone that brings the overall premium experience and honestly that's what's appealing to me but what do you guys think of the pixel 4a do you think it makes sense tell us in the comment section below also give this video a like if you enjoyed it and make sure to share
