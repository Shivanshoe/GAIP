[Music] hey guys this is a page from p1 comm and we are here in Las Vegas for CES 2020 and MSI's and weand a lot of cool new laptops gaming headphones gaming monitors and whatnot but there's one laptop that I found really interesting and I think this might be the laptop of 2020 the MSI G is 66 Raider now what makes this laptop truly amazing well let's check it out well this is the brand-new msi ge62 6 Raider and yeah this is a gaming laptop that looks super cool mostly thanks to this yeah this RGB LED light bar stretches across the front edge and msi calls this the all-new panoramic or aura lighting and you know what I like it I mean this is kind of a unique way to put some cool RGB lighting on a gaming laptop isn't it anyway the rest of the design might not be as flashy but it is premium looking the laptop has a silver aluminium design all across be the back or the chassis and that means this is a premium looking and feeling laptop there's also more flash in limited edition of the GE 66 that's called the Dragon shield Limited Edition and it does look really cool this is a design that's inspired by Star Wars and designed by Cooney words who has well done a lot of Marvel movie star wars movies and more now the msi ge62 6 raider is obviously a very good-looking laptop but I like the fact that it's also very portable MSI happen to be the weight and the dimensions but I did find the laptop fairly portable when I lifted it up plus I like the fact that I can lift the lid with just a finger like this yeah it's great now the portable part is interesting because it's a big big battery in here which I will get back to later off anyway the design here is pretty functional too on the io front you get almost all the ports you can think of there USB a Porteous BC ports HDMI port a headphone jack and SD slot and a proprietary charging port that supports up to 280 what fast charging if you're wondering why not USB C charging well msi says they wanted to offer faster charging with a proprietary port so I'm ok with that because you know faster charging for the win when comes with a keyboard ge 66 Raider comes with MSI's SteelSeries RGB keyboard that supports Perkey RGB lighting with smart key illumination based on the visuals in a game now the SteelSeries RGB keyboards are something that a lot of people have liked on other MSI laptop speed for the typing experience or the gaming experience or the software control so I'm hoping it stays the same with GE 66 trader order the display now which is one of the big highlights of the GE 66 Raider this is an IPS display here but it's not your usual IPS display this is a 300 Hertz display we're talking about yes a 300 Hertz panel which should be pretty awesome if you play a lot of fast shooting games now I did not really get to test the 300 Hertz display on the GE 66 personally but this full HD jeez incompatible display does look pretty nice so I'm positive anyway the 300 Hertz display is said to be optional as the laptop will also come in 240 Hertz display models moving on apart from the fancy new design the ultra-fast rear in Hertz display one of the big highlights of the GE 66 Raider is the big big battery the laptop comes with a 99.9 watt hour battery which is the biggest battery size that is allowed in airports so the battery life on this laptop should be pretty good as I mentioned the lateral supports charging up to 280 watts so it should also charge up fairly quickly as well having said that all of these things are something we need to test out to get a better idea if you're wondering what's under the hood the details are scars being on the cooling front of the specs front but the msi ge62 grader should come with Intel's upcoming 10 gen comet lake at City CPUs along with fast SSDs and lots of that when it comes to the graphics DGE 65 hat top-of-the-line and really at 27 2 GPUs and GE 66 Raider should come with the latest Nvidia graphics 2 now do note that there are some details we aren't allowed to share yet but MSI should reveal these details once the laptop is closer to launch apart from that the ge 66 data and all the new MSI laptops will come with the updated dragon center software which will bring a new most straightforward UI one-click optimization gaming mode 2.0 the ability to customize settings in a game and better update well that was a quick look at the new msi ge62 6 Raider and apart from this MSI's also unreeled the GS 66 stealth which has the same 300 Hertz display and 99.9 water battery in a design that's definitely classy and more understated something a lot of people like anyway coming back to the GE 66 Raider this is a laptop that looks like a great follow up to very popular msi ge62 5 the jesus' accelerator brings interesting design changes that really make it stand out it brings a new ultra fast 3 and in her display are big big battery and obviously all the performance updates now like I said a lot of people think the msi ge62 5 radar was the best gaming laptop of last year so the msi ge62 6 raider certainly seems on track to be the laptop of 2020 well we'll find out anyway how do you like the msi ge62 6 raider do you think this is the laptop after a 20 tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends lastly subscribe
