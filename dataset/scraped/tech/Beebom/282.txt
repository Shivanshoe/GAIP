[Music] [Applause] [Music] it has dissipation beyond calm and this here is the brand new iPhone se 2020 and this is a phone that's been getting a lot of hype lately because this is what we essentially call a budget iPhone in India so is this new iPhone se 2020 perfect is this phone worth all the hype well I think not today I will be talking about the dark truth of the iPhone se 2020 and if you are interested in the spoon I suggested to watch this video till the very end yeah you need to watch this now let's get started okay so this is the iPhone se 2020 and I know at around 42,000 rupees this seems like a good deal because you're getting an iPhone that comes with the powerful and modern 813 Bionic chip set the same chipset that powers the latest iPhones so yes it does sound alright but I don't think it's worthy of all that high that really you need it first up this is the phone that looks straight out of 2015 or maybe 2016 yeah to be honest I like the compact form factor in a world full of big phones out there but that's it that's the only thing I like about this design I mean don't get me wrong it's an iPhone it's a premium phone but these bezels well they look supremely outdated see when I unbox the iPhone se 2020 I thought I maybe you know I could live with those bezels in 2020 but after playing with the device for quite some time now I don't think I can get along with these big-ass bezels and one of my annoyance is about this whole design is the home button I mean iOS is fluid and smooth on the iPhone se but without the navigation gestures this just does not feel like a modern experience pressing this home button to go home or even go to the multitasking page is a pain I especially miss the gesture to switch between apps look this whole home button big bezel screen experience makes me feel like I'm using an old phone and not a brand new phone that are just unboxed I know some people might prefer the fingerprint scanner instead of the face ID but I think face ID is definitely better now and just more seamless plus it was better with the whole gestures UI of iOS now this how dated design isn't the only thing that I dislike about the iPhone se to a 20 there are a couple of more things there's the battery obviously so the iPhone se battery life is a huge letdown for me it has a modest 1821 battery and that just does not cut it for me also because it's 2020 and Apple still bundles 5 watt charges in the box see in my testing of the iPhone se the small battery drained pretty easily after an hour of pubsey gameplay on the phone at HDR ultra the iphone SE connected to Wi-Fi lost 24% battery while heating up to 40 42 degrees now that battery drain for a brand new phone is a lot but anyone who uses the phone extensively which is pretty much everyone these days this won't cut it I also did a video test the iPhone se lost 16 percent battery after watching one hour of video at max brightness on YouTube at 480p again that's a pretty fast battery drain and I think of it you can't quickly charge this phone the 5 watt charger takes around 2 hours to fully charge this 1800 mAh battery so yes the battery life is a little underwhelming to say the least talking about underwhelming the iPhone se in 2020 still has a single camera on the back so you get the 12 megapixel sensor the same Sony sensor found in the iPhone 8 and he has times to be a 13 Bionic and its new ISP the iPhone is he supports smart HDR and portrait mode and to be honest the pictures from the phone look decent enough but my problem with the iPhone se is in the fact that there's no ultra wide-angle lens everything about it Android phones going from budget phones to mid-range phones to flagships all have an ultra wide-angle lens but the iPhone se to end when he does not yes the 12 megapixel camera is good but that does not make the iPhone se special not really the corner on it's clear to the iPhone se 218 is basically an iPhone 8 with an 18 Bionic chip set and to think of it instead of paying forty to forty three thousand rupees for a phone that looks and feels outdated I personally go with the iPhone 10 are from last year which usually goes for 48 50 thousand rupees but there are a number of sales in which it comes down to 39 40 thousand rupees and that's in the iPhone se ballpark now if you compare the two the iPhone 10 out brings the new iPhone design with an edge-to-edge display with the knotch that houses face ID and that means it looks way better way more modern yes some people might hate the knotch but I think it looks modern compared to the iPhone se 282nd the iPhone ten-hour battery is something everyone raves about to compare the iPhone 10 outcomes in 2942 image battery which is huge compared to the iPhone se is 1821 mAh battery now I know the iPhone 10 hour comes with the 8 well Bionic aces of the 813 Bionic but I don't think that makes a huge difference specially iPhones I mean just take a look at the antutu scores from both the phones and as you can see it's pretty close apart from that both of these phones have 12 megapixel cameras on the back although the 10r has the newer sensor but the SE has the updated isp from the 813 Bionic they also have the same 7 megapixel front camera and both come with the ip67 rating and wireless charging yes if you ask me between the iPhone se to a twin II and the iPhone 10 R I go with the iPhone 10 R without any doubt any day now that brings me to the dark truth about the iPhone se 2020 see this is the food that's been getting all hyped up as the budget iPhone of India as a true value for money iPhone and well while it might be value for money I don't think it's anything special or word the high I mean I've been waiting for an iPhone se successor for so long and when the iPhone is situated when you arrived I was disappointed because this is the iPhone 8 this one is just apples way of reusing its iPhone it designs to gain some traction in countries like India see it's 20/20 measureless spoons ultra wide-angle cameras good battery life fast charging these are all norms in smartphones and using the iPhone se is like taking steps back two three four years yup the new iPhone se is hyped but like I said it's not worth the hype but those are my thoughts on the new iPhone se 2020 and yeah I will be comparing it to other phones say the 1 + 8 in the coming days so stay tuned for that also what do you think about the iPhone se 2 8 when you tell us in the comment section below and yeah give this video a thumbs up if you agree with us and make
