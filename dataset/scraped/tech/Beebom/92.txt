[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is patientview.com and this is the google pixel 6. now let me make it clear that this is not coming to india this is the us variant of the phone but you know what the google pixel 6 is a phone that desperately needs to launch in india see more than india i personally wanted the google pixel 6 to arrive here because i've been hearing so much about this phone apple and samsung beware the very best google phone a proper iphone rival if the hype is real so you know what we went ahead and imported the pixel 6 and the moment it arrived i put in my sim card and by the way it works without any issues with an indian sim card and there's also an option to add any sim so yeah you can import it too anyway so i've been using the google pixel 6 for a day and this actually seems like an excellent flagship phone first of all i want to talk about these looks because this is a phone that looks really cool and unique with its wiser camera bar i mean one issue with the previous pixel phones has been the fact that they don't really stand out in terms of design this they stand out this looks unlike any other phone and i appreciate the nexus 6p wipes apart from the unique and cool looks i also appreciate the fact that the pixel 6 does not cut down on any of the flagship design specs so there's a dual stereo speaker setup which sounds really good the haptics are very flagshipy the fingerprint scanner as you've probably heard is a little inconsistent that's true then there's gorilla glass vectors on the front gorilla glass 6 back aluminium frame and this whole design is ip68 rated for water and dust resistance plus it has wireless charging support so yeah everything you expect in a flagship now apart from that i think you know the specs too there's a high refresh rate amoled which is bright vibrant and the blacks are deep and nice it's powered by the new custom chip from google the tensor chip which is a customized and improved variant of the exynos 2100 and that means it is flagship great but it also has a few exynos issues like getting randomly hot in some apps there's also the lpddr5 ram and ufs 3.1 storage the cameras have got an upgrade too it has a new 50 megapixel main camera with a larger sensor and when the pixel 6 lacks the telephoto lens from the pro it has an ultra wide angle camera on onboard the battery is 4614mah and i've heard about the average battery life but i can't comment on that yet also there's no charge in the box in typical flagship style so the google pixel 6 is a proper flagship phone and this feels like a flagship phone like i said i have put in my sim card and i've been using it as my daily driver and one thing to note is that this is a seriously fast and responsive phone i mean here's the phone in action and everything just feels super smooth and quick and i'm really enjoying it so far and it's also because of the experience see it's not just these specs that make the pixel 6 a proper flagship phone the experience is what matters and the pixel 6 gets that bang on see let me put it this way the pixel 6 is one of the most fun cool phones i've ever used all thanks to the software first of all i was trying out the iphone before this and switching from an iphone to the pixel 6 was a super seamless process which i wasn't expecting in fact the one big issue all of us have whatsapp transfer but that was seamless too since there's a feature built in now now once i set things up i got face to face with android 12 with material u and it's not perfect i know but it's just a refreshing take on android with all the colors personalization options the cool animations i mean you know that feeling you get when you get a brand new smartphone and you just admire it well i get that feeling with the pixel 6 and that's mostly because of this software it just feels brand new all that is cool but let's face it the hype around the google pixel 6 is due to the tricks it brings thanks to the tensor chipset i mean there's a lot of things there there's better dictation support in gboard which works really really well the search medium settings or even the app drawer is a lot more powerful google assistant is faster and better recognition and the recorder app is even faster thanks to transcriptions working locally so it does not require any internet then there's obviously the cameras i mean it's a google pixel we expect the best cameras out there and it seems to deliver now i haven't compared the cameras yet but the photos i've taken so far from the pixel 6 look really really good i mean some of the shots are just stunning i also like the fact that video recording capabilities have improved too which was a big complaint in previous pixels there's 4k 60fps support with no limits and the videos from the pixel 6 look much better plus you need to check out the new camera tricks the pixel 6 brings they are insane so there are two different motion modes an action pad mode where you can focus on a moving subject and it adds a cool blur to the background here's a photo from this mode and yeah it looks cool right i mean the fact that i can just take the shot from a phone handheld is just awesome there's also a long exposure mode which is amazing because again it's handheld and it's just so easy to use i'm here a couple of shots from this mode yeah awesomeness all over again then there's the much talked about magic eraser tool which lets you remove people or objects in a photo easily for example i can just remove myself from this shot and yeah it looks seamless here's another shot and again it works fairly well i mean it does not always work this well with all the photos but most of the time the magic eraser tool is well magical look i've only had the pixel 6 for a day and so far this looks like an excellent flagship phone unlike the previous gen pixels i mean it's not perfect but for someone like me who wants a good android flagship in india there's actually only one option there's just samsung i mean there was one plus but as you guys know oneplus has been changing so i'm not considering that and that's where the new pixel 6 flagships come into play i mean the pixel 6 is priced at 599 dollars in the us and if you go by iphones us and india pricing this would launch in india at 59.99 60k and at that price this makes sense especially for people like me who want to try out the pixel phones use the pixel software experience now i understand google did not have the best experience with the pixel one two or three in india but those pixels actually had a lot of issues while the pixel vi actually seems like a good all-around flagship phone so google if you're listening if you're watching i know a lot of tech enthusiasts in india who want to buy the pixel 6 or the pixel 6 pro so it'll be great if you could come up with an option for us indians to you know buy the new pixel 6 flagships think about it anyway what do you guys think of the brand new pixel 6 and the pixel 6 pro do you think google should have launched these phones in india comment down below also give this video like make sure to share it and subscribe to
