this is the new xiaomi 11 eye hyper charge and as the name tells you it charges very very quickly but is the xiaomi 11i hypercharge just about crazy fast charging is it a good phone overall is it a good upgrade to the meat and i also i know there's a lot debate online about its pricing and i'll talk about that as well so this is the phone right here and let's start with the most hyped up feature of this phone obviously the insane 120 watt charger this is the 120 watt hyper charger which i was expecting to be a bit more intimidating but it's actually a pretty compact charger now when you connect this charger to the 11a hypercharge you get this cool animation and the charging speed is insane in my test the phone hit 50 percent in five freaking minutes yeah that is crazy 75 in 10 minutes and a full charge in 16 minutes i know not 15 minutes but a lot depends on the ambient temperature too so this is close i mean that was really really fast but that was with the boost charging mode turned on confused let me explain see by default the xiaomi 119 charges at around 100 watts which in itself is super fast i mean if you're wondering without the boost mode the 11i goes to 100 is around 20 22 minutes which like i said is super fast now to enable the max 120 watt fast charging you'll have to do it in the settings now to know the difference this is the charging animation with boost mode on and this is without the boost mode on now if you're wondering why is the full 120 watt fast charging disabled by default well first of all this is to give users choice with different charging modes and secondly the max 120 watts can heat up the device a little especially in summers in places where the heat gets kind of crazy now it shouldn't be a problem according to xiaomi with all of the protection features as well as real-time temperature monitoring i also like the fact that xiaomi went ahead and got the tuv rhineland safe fast charge certification as for the battery health xiaomi claims that the 11i hyper charge retains up to 80 battery capacity even after 800 cycles compared to other phones retaining around 60 battery capacity after 500 cycles anyway the 120 watt charging is fantastic no doubt but when people buy a phone they buy it for the overall package so how is the 11 hyper charge as an overall package first up the big new in the 11i is the new chipset the xiaomi 11i comes with the new dimension 920 chipset that's based on the six nanometer architecture can go up to 2.5 gigahertz brings the latest cortex a78 cores and the mali g68 mc4 gpu plus the phone has vapor chamber cooling for the thermals up to 8 gb lpd or 4x ram with up to 3 gb virtual ram and 128gb ufs 2.2 storage uh xiaomi has made no compromises to 5g with the 11i featuring eight 5g packs anyway i'm sure you're wondering about the dimension 920 chipset now let me make it clear that the dimension 920 is not as powerful as the demancity 1200 but it is a good upgrade over the meat and i snapdragon 750g i mean just look at the adder to scores it's a big difference now take a look at the geekbench 5 scores and yeah it's clear the dimension 920 is a good upgrade over the meat and ice 750g as for the real world performance i'm still kind of testing things out but so far it's been a good experience beat app launching multitasking or even 120 hertz usage gaming is no problem too here's bgmi at high graphic settings on the 11i and as you can see the experience is smooth and nice talking about the experience there's miui 12.5 enhanced here and that means you get all the features you want as for the pre-installed apps there are a few of them but they can be uninstalled now one thing i noticed is the app vault has these recommendations but you can switch to google discover from the home screen settings for a better experience as for miui 13 xiaomi has confirmed the 11i will be one of the first devices to get it in india anywhere new ipad the chipset is an upgrade from the meteoni and so is the display now i remember my only complaint with the 10i was its ips lcd display and i'm glad 11i changes that the 11i has a 6.7 inch 1280 hertz amoled with up to 360hz touch sampling rate 1200 nits of peak brightness gorilla glass 5 and a 360 degree ambient light sensor so the specs are great and here's the display in action and i can tell you that this is a bright sharp and vibrant amoled panel that's also super smooth to use thanks to 120 hertz now not just usage shows and movies look great on this display thanks to 10 and wide wide l1 support now complementing this display is the one big highlight of the 11i stereo speakers with dolby atmos stereo speakers are in another phone these days so what's exactly the big deal here well the 11i has stereo speakers that have the most beautiful thing ever symmetry here's the bottom and the top speaker side by side looks great and importantly sounds loud and good in fact this is probably one of the loudest speaker setups of late just listen to this the design has also changed from the 10i the 11i has the new xiaomi camera style which is quite protruded but this is a good looking design nonetheless with the nice fingerprint resistant matte glass back and i like how this green color looks and how it reflects light plus the 11 also comes in these different colors and finishes which is pretty cool now the frame is plastic and it's not the lightest or the most compact phone but it's fine at 8.3 millimeters thickness and 204 grams of weight the design is also ip53 rated for splash and dust resistance and i love how xiaomi has gotten the basics right good old headphone jack and the good old ir blast apart from that you get the dual sim plus micro sd hybrid slot right here the fingerprint scanner is in the power button embedded uh you get a screen protector pre-applied and there's a transparent silicon case in the box one thing that has not changed from the 10 i is the cameras the main camera is the same 108 megapixel samsung hm2 sensor and i'm okay with this because i really like the 10 ice camera performance and from the photos i've taken with the 11i it looks great too i mean details are a given with 108 megapixel sensors but most photos from the 11i have really good colors and contrast in low light too i like how sharp and clean the photos are typically this looks good but i'll have a better idea when i've compared it to another phone there's also an 8 megapixel ultra wide angle lens which i have used briefly and the photos from the camera seem fairly good so far but yeah too early to judge lastly the connectivity the xiaomi 11i has wi-fi six support and it has carrier aggregation support i checked with the net monster app as you can see and it's there talk about the pricing now the xiaomi 11i hyper charge starts at rupees 26 triple nine and there's also a xiaomi 11i which has the same set of specs same design but it has a bigger 5 160 mah battery and kind of slower 67 watt fast charging which starts at rupees 24 triple nine now if you compare the 11i hypercharge versus 11i versus 10i you will see that the 10i launched at 21 triple nine for the six 128 gb variant so the 11i brings a 3 000 rupees price bump as well as a bump in the feature set this high refresh rate amoled now a newer faster chipset way more 5g bands symmetrical steel speakers the 11i has a bigger battery and both the 11i and the hypercharge have super fast charging so the 11i series is a good upgrade over the 10i and i know people are expecting the price to be around 22k but i think xiaomi increased the price to bring these new charging technologies and these new features anyway that's what i think and i will be comparing the xiaomi 11i hyper charge to other phones in this price range like the real me gt master edition or the xiaomi 11 lite any 5g in the meanwhile let us know your thoughts on the pricing of the xiaomi 11i and the 11 eye hyper charge
