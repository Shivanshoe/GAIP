this is the new galaxy s22 ultra and let me make clear this is not a usual first impressions video because the device launched in the us some time back and the reviews are out too and india samsung's embargo restricts us to first impressions i know weird this happens every year but this year we decided to do it our own way rather than talk about what you already know we are going to answer all of your questions that you guys have asked us on instagram and twitter and honestly there were a lot of questions so let's start with the most obvious most asked question which chipset is the s22 series coming with in india yes a lot of you are still confused if it's exynos or snapdragon in india so let me just answer this once and for all the s22 ultra and the s22 series in general come with the snapdragon 8gen1 chipset in india so here are the specs of the s28 ultra and honestly this is good news especially with all the negative reports of the exynos variant in europe so yeah this is good the next common question that you guys have asked us is about the agent one's performance in the s22 ultra the questions are how does it perform the gaming performance how the benchmarks are there any throttling issues any heating issues well i've been using this phone and there's no lag or stutter anywhere now a longer run would give me a better idea but i've heard about the exynos variant lagging even while set up and i did not come across any such lag on this phone coming to the benchmarks they're good kind of what you expect with the agent one as for throttling issues i tested things out i first set the phone's performance to maximum to get the best idea and i ran the cpu throttling test app multiple times this is the 20 threads 15 minute test and you can see some throttling in the graph anyway the end result was 79 which is a good number i ran this test multiple times though and the phone did well sometimes throttling to 87 sometimes to 86 percent which is actually really good for agent one if you ask me especially with the phone set to maximum processing i even ran a more intensive 50 threads 30 minutes test and the s22 ultra did throttle there but 76 percent is still decent dish when it comes to heating the phone does go to 43 44 degrees after intensive cpu throttling tests but generally i notice it's staying around 3940 degrees which is not overheating i mean here's a video shot from the phone and this is after an hour of bgmi at the highest graphics and the phone is at 38 39 degrees max which is good i even did a temperature comparison with the iphone 13 pro i shot a 4k 60fps video on both the phones for 15 minutes and i checked the temperature the s22 ultra is at 3940 degrees which is fine but the iphone is kind of hot it's at 44 degrees and honestly it feels warmer than that also if you're wondering about the game performance i played bgmit ultra hd graphics and ultra frame rates for around one and a half hours on the trot and the game was smooth af no lags or anything i mean i've only had this phone for a day but the performance here seems well optimized the next lot of questions were on the camera first up transition between different camera lenses is it the same as the s21 ultra or has it improved so we don't have the s21 ultra but compared to the note 20 ultra i did feel switching between the lens was smoother here i am switching from the ultrawide to the main camera slowly and you can notice the jump in the s22 ultra but it's a lot smoother when compared to the note 20. let me show it to you once again and yeah if you like this new format a sub to the channel would mean a lot do it going to the next questions how about the video quality at night has the video quality improved in the s22 ultra so the videos i shot at night are good but i wouldn't call them extraordinary here's a video i shot at night and while it's sharp and good there is some noise too also there's an auto fps feature that changes frame rates dynamically for better low light videos i felt this was resulting in weird shake in the video so i turn it off has the portrait mode improved as others are saying well i tried out the portrait mode on the s22 ultra 3x and it's actually really impressive here are some portrait mode shots from the phone and the edge detection is actually great just look at akshay's hair in this photo or even these glasses and i like the details and the background blur now it does add a warm tone at times but it's definitely improved why two telephoto lens how is the zoom lens well here the camera specs and the telephoto camera is capable of 3x optical zoom and the periscope camera brings 10x optical zoom here's the view from our office and this is 1x now the 3x shot is sharp and nice like you'd expect but look at the 10x shot now this is awesome right i mean that is far away and the photo is pretty good there's still 100x space zoom which is still kind of gimmicky but it does fine a lot of you guys also asked us to compare the cameras on the s22 ultra versus the iphone 13 pro and we did and my brief test the s22 ultra does well it's a very good camera phone but i feel the iphone 13 pro is better the iphone photos have the slight warm tone that you expect but other than that the iphone photos are generally better looking with better dynamic range and in low light it just takes better exposed and sharper shots videos are another area where i feel it's just hard to beat the iphone i mean the s92 ultra matches the iphone in terms of stability but the iphone video is sharper if you notice and balances the face better with the bright sun in the back now create waves dude the s28 ultra is the winner when it comes to zoom photos v3x b10x the s22 ultra shot is always sharper with more details it also has more details on the face in the portrait mode but i like the face tone in iphone photos apart from the camera this obviously is one of the big highlights of the note 22 i mean the s22 ultra and you guys obviously had a lot of questions with it first how is the s-pen experience on this phone well it's like using a note look the s pen is identical to the one on the note 20 ultra when it comes to the looks and the size but it's said to have 70 percent lower latency aka 2.8 milliseconds of latency now there's no way to check this but the s pen on the s22 ultra screen feels really smooth and natural almost like writing on paper does it have all the note functionality the answer is yes there are all the aspen features here you can still just take out the s pen and start jotting down notes without unlocking the phone you can create a handed note like this and even convert it to text with ease you can take partial screenshots and doodle on it you can also use it like a remote and use air gestures basically all the aspen features we know are here with the s22 ultra to s22 and s22 plus have s pen support no they don't does the same s pen work with the galaxy tab now this should work with the new tab s8 along with older galaxy tabs that have s pen support but i don't think this will work on the a series tablets more of the design questions now is it handy how is the weight distribution the durability so the s22 ultra has gorilla glass victus plus on the front and the back along with armor aluminum frame which is said to be a lot more stronger so i think the s22 ultra should be fairly durable i did a small drop test and it was fine no scratches or anything so seems good as for the weight and in hand feel this looks like a note so it has a whole boxy design and it is big and kind of heavy but with the curved sides i did feel it's easy to hold and the weight distribution is good here next up speaker quality haptics now the speakers in my test were as loud as the ones on the iphone 13 pro with similar quality as for the haptics i did feel it was more precise while typing which i like but it's also less pronounced when compared to other flagships one ui 4.1 experience well one ui 4.1 on the s22 ultra is actually great especially with the promise of four years of os updates so here's one ui 4.1 in action on the s28 ultra and it's very stable so far with no issues and i like the new features like this new color palette picker for the android 12 like dynamic theming feature there's also this new smart widget which is swipe like this to access multiple widgets kind of like ios's smart stacks widget you can even customize what widgets you want here as for bloatware there are these microsoft apps along with facebook netflix and spotify and you can uninstall them when it comes to ads i did not notice it in the weather app or anywhere else so far lastly there's one area where some people have doubts on and that's the battery here the battery specs of the phone now i could not check the sot because i've only had the phone for a day but i did do a couple of battery tests and the s22 ultra actually did better when compared to the iphone 13 pro in the one hour video playback test the s22 ultra lost 5 battery while the iphone 13 pro lost seven percent battery in the 15 minute 4k video recording test the s22 ultra only lost four percent battery while the iphone lost nine percent yeah that's a big difference i also tested the charging speed with samsung's 25 watt charger it goes from 10 to 50 percent in 21 minutes and 100 in an hour i also charged it with this one plus 65 watt charger which supports 45 watt usb pd and surprisingly took almost the same time so those are almost all the major questions that you guys asked us on the s22 ultra and if i had to sum up my experience with this new samsung flagship i'd say fairly positive now i say this because every year we're used to s flagships with eggs in us and this time we've finally gotten the snapdragon version and so far it seems well optimized and good plus it looks premium brings the s pen the latest software with the promise of four years of os updates i still like the iphone's cameras mod but the s22 ultra cameras are definitely flagship great anyway if you still have any questions that i did not answer comment down below and i'll answer them in the first
