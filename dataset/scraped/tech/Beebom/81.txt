[Music] [Applause] [Music] you've probably seen this the oppo finded oppo's first foldable smartphone and there's no doubt that this is an incredible foldable phone but i promised you a different story and i'm gonna give you a different story on this phone first of all all the good things that you've heard about the oppo find end are all true i mean the oppo find it is a surprisingly refined product and a device that feels like it belongs to the mainstream see i've tried out the z-fold 3 but i haven't really used it for a day or two or longer so the oppo finder is practically the first proper folding phone i have used and you know what i am impressed and you already know this but the fine and has a design similar to the z43 you get this 5.4 in 60 hertz amoled on the front as the sort of cover display and i can open this up and get this bigger 7.1 inch 120 hertz ltpo amoled display on the inside now both of these displays are high quality amoled panels but there are two things about this whole design that have really impressed number one this whole design the hinge the folding mechanism everything feels just solid look at this oh no just kidding see i think you relate to it when i say that when you hold a foldable phone for the first time you are a little careful as to not break it or something now i had that feeling first up with the finding but it went away as i start to you know flip it open close it multiple times yeah let me do this one more time this feels nice and this third kind of makes it clear that this will be fine as for the durability the cover screen has the gorilla glass victis while the inner screen has the same ultra thin glass as the z-fold 3 which operates for two lap folds the same as samsung the second thing about the design that has really impressed me is the crease every single foldable phone runnable phone i have seen comes with this really visible not so attractive looking crease but on the oppo finding i know there's a lot of debate a lot of you guys have asked us about the trees on twitter and instagram and i can just tell you guys that the oppo find it almost solves the whole crease problem in foldable smartphones and honestly if you just ask me i just did not notice it while i was just using it casually it looks seamless from most angles now here's the oppo finder and opened up and i can just tilt it across both sides and you will see the very minimal crease actually multiple creases only when you look at it from certain angles see i have a few doubts about the fine end which i will be talking about in a bit but grease is not one of them the grease here is definitely better than almost every other foldable i have tried now this is all because of opposed water drop hinge design which kind of widens the angle of the fold to reduce the crease and this is probably the reason that when you try and see the crease you see two three creases now one thing to note though the crease can be felt just a bit on touch but once again it's better than any of the other foldables i have tried so this design is actually very good very refined and i know this is a cake boy and once i'm one of your questions you can put it in your jeans it was not a problem for me anyway it's a hefty phone but it's in the same ballpark as the z43 as you can see from the weight and dimension side by side now one thing i don't like is the placement of the buttons see the volume button and the power button are adjacent to each other which means whenever i want to lock the phone i always press the volume keys instead of the power button so it's kind of weird anyway the designer part you probably know all about the cool features that the fine end comes with there's the smooth switching between the cover screen and the inner screen i mean i have an app open on the cover screen i can unfold the device and the app switches here seamlessly in fact when i'm playing a youtube video and switching between the screens the video and the audio don't stop it's very smooth there also different camera features thanks to the foldable design i also like the dynamic wallpapers on the fine end just look at this yeah this is cool right now the whole seamless switching and the overall smoothness in the oppo finding is probably due to the fact that this phone has flagship specs there's no eight gen one but there's snapdragon triple eight lpddr5 ram and ufs 3.1 storage now these are all flagship specs and the phone just feels very fast the camera is black should be do you already know the specs now i'm mostly focused on the foldable design but whatever photos i have taken from the finance so far look really good everything looks sharp detailed and vibrant something you expect from a very good phone as for the battery the fine end has a 4500 mah battery divided into two now i get to test the battery as my daily driver but it kind of feels a little modest for the phone with two displays having said that no judgment right now because like i said i haven't used it as my daily drive so basically like i said all the good things you've heard about the oppo find n are true but after using the fine end for a couple of days i have a couple of doubts here's the different story see the problem is foldables are supposed to be the bridge between phones and tablets and a lot of people just use tablets for watching movies and shows playing some games and this is where i feel the finance aspect ratio is not very practical the 7.1 inch display has an aspect ratio of 8.5 is to 9 which means it's almost a square now this is fine for reading or just browsing but the problem is most netflix shows are 16 9 most youtube videos are 18 s9 and most movies are even wide at around 22 tonight so when i'm watching a 16-9 youtube video it shows up like this on the find n when i'm watching a movie on disney plus it looks like this yes there are these big black bars on the bottom at the top the video kind of looks tiny now since it's a squarish design i can rotate the screen but it won't really solve the problem to give you a better idea here's the same video playing on the ipad mini in landscape which has an aspect ratio of 14 eastern 9. now there is letterboxing here too but it's a lot better than the find it now this is why most tablets have a slightly wider aspect ratio to make sure the video experience is good and this is also the reason why the z-fold 3 has a taller display samsung has used such a narrow and tall display on the cover to make sure that the inner display is not a square the z43 has an aspect ratio of 11.2 is to nine because of the taller design i mean 11.29 is still not the best aspect ratio to watch videos but it's a little better than the find it apart from the weird aspect ratio another thing i noticed with the find n is that the software here does not make full use of the whole tablet like big screen i mean there is this gesture to move an app into the split screen and i like this gesture and there is support for floating windows in color os but some more multitasking gestures would make this whole experience a lot better also a lot of you guys have asked this how are the apps optimized for the foldable form factor in the oppo finder well the google apps and the popular apps we use aren't really optimized because the phone is launching only in china at the moment but these apps aren't available now an app like bgm that runs pretty well because pubg is available in china plus it's running the chinese version of color os so can't really judge on that having said that i do think if oppo does launch the find n in other markets i'm hoping to do so with android 12l which is exactly aimed at devices like this look overall the oppo finder is clearly a very promising foldable smartphone so this is the foldable that almost solves one of the biggest issues with foldables the crease and trust me when i say that the inner screen looks almost seamless here plus the fine end feels durable it feels like a phone i can use on a daily basis without worrying about breaking it which is a big factor so the oppo finder gives off a vibe that foldable phones are ready to arrive to become mainstream and it's just very exciting yes i'm not sure about the aspect ratio and i think and a 12 would make more sense on this but hopefully oppo can work on these and we get an ultimate foldable phone that launches globally yes i'm hoping for this anyway i want to know your thoughts on the oppo fine and does this make sense to you comment down your thoughts below also
