[Music] hey guys this is paige from video.com and this is the new lava agni now this is the phone that's been getting a lot of hype specially because this seems like a good phone at 20k from an indian smartphone brand now emphasis on the indian because i know the company has been marketing this phone with the proudly indian hashtag now that is fine but i'm gonna keep aside the whole indian aspect of this phone and look at this phone more objectively so this is the lava agni so is it actually a good phone that can go against the competition well it is good but it's not good enough so i'm going to divide this video into three sections the good the usual and the bad first of all let me talk about the good in this phone and the best thing about the lava agni is the software experience on this phone i mean when i was setting up the lavagna first up i was surprised that there were no additional prompts or recommended apps or any weird services it was just a simple clean native android setup and after i set up the phone i noticed that there's actually not a lot of bloatware in fact there's only one here's the app drawer with no apps installed from my side and as you can see apart from the few lava apps like lava guide sound recorder there's only facebook which you can uninstall so yeah it's all clean apart from this the whole ui experience here is stock android with a few minor changes here and there like see the launcher settings or you know the colorful icons in the settings so overall the software experience on the agni has been very good in fact i might say it's been lit the next good thing about the agni is the chipset the agni 5g is powered by the mediatek dimension 810 with 8gb lpddr4x ram and 128gb of ufs 2.1 storage now the dimension 810 is something i've used in the past and it's actually a fairly powerful chipset and it competes well against the competition i mean it's a six nanometer chipset so it should be good at efficiency and it also does really well at benchmarks i mean beats the 732g on the note 10 pro and it's close to the demand city 800u on the moto edge 20 fusion so yeah it's good i've only had the agony for a day so can't really comment on the long term performance but so far the phone seems smooth as you can see i also played some bgmi and the gaming performance has been good too so yeah so far good performance now the last outright good point about the agni is the battery and charging the phone has a 5000mah battery and i think this phone will have good battery life because you know six nanometer chipset plus a clean software experience yeah i'm positive of the battery here it's also fast charging with a 30 watt fast charger in the box and that's pretty good now those are all the good things but before we get to the bat there are actually some usual kind of oakish things first up i'm talking about the design and display i mean here's how the phone looks it's got this nice gradient finish on the back and honestly this kind of reminded me of the design on a lot of real me phones now there's a side mounted fingerprint scanner a headphone jack a dual sim plus micro sd slot all that's okay but it's kind of usual i say that because three things first the back is plastic second there's no stereo speakers and third the display is an ips lcd the agni comes with a 6.7 inch screen and it's not a bad screen in fact it's a good ips pan that also has the high 90 hertz refresh rate but the problem is there are phones with 90 hertz ambulance and even 120 hertz amulets in the same sort of price range so ips is okay usually you get the point then there are the cameras the agni has a quad camera setup with a 64 megapixel main camera a five megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a couple of you know the two megapixel sensors now the cameras here are fine but when you look at the competition the ugly kind of feels lacking see first of all the camera ui is kind of outdated and switching between the main camera and the ultra wide angle camera is just a pain secondly the photos from the phone so far have been inconsistent sometimes they take good well exposed shots like this one or you know this one but a lot of the other times i noticed that photos have washed out details and don't look as sharp as i'd like even in good lighting other thing i noticed that there's no 4k video recording support which is really surprising so overall the camera experience of the does feel kind of usual nothing special now moving on to the bad in the lava agni and these are the points that make the phone not good enough first of all the agni has no white wine l1 certification and the netflix app is incompatible by the play store i mean i did play some videos on prime video as well and they were playing in sd so yes there's no hd support in this phone which i think is a deal breaker the second point is there's no carried aggregation support in this phone see i checked with vodafone airtel and i never got the lta tag or you know multiple frequencies in the netmonster app now this is a big deal because ca means better network speeds and better coverage i mean this is a 5g phone with three 5g bands it's called ugly 5g but what is the point of 5g when they don't even support fast 4g lte look overall that's the story of the lava agni smartphone it's good in parts kind of usual oakish at some things and just bad at some other things the problem is no wide wine and one no carrier aggregation are just you know deal breakers if you ask me also the cameras seem average and the phone has an ips lcd now i know the software experience is great and the performance seems good too but the moto x20 fusion has the same positives with an amoled panel better cameras and it does not have any of the issues of the agni there's also the redmi note 10 pro pro max which have a far better display better cameras more premium design yeah they are just better phones see the lava agni is a good attempt but it's not enough not at all but what do you guys think of the lava agni is it lit let us know in the comment section below also give this video a like if you enjoyed it make sure to share it subscribe to our channel
