[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is rupesh from beyond.com and this right here is the latest power bank i mean the latest smartphone from samsung the galaxy m51 and this has to be one of the most exciting samsung mid ranges i have ever used and honestly there are three reasons for that number one the obvious the quite insane the humongous never heard before 7000 mah battery on a smartphone which i did a few cool tests on so make sure to watch the full video number two is the fact that this is a phone that's powered by a snapdragon chipset and number three is the fact that it brings all of the other great samsung features that we kind of expect in a samsung phone so yep the galaxy m51 is quite an interesting smartphone so let's check out everything that it brings so first up let's check out the box so in the box you get the charging adapter the usbc cable and that's it samsung has kept the case and the earphones up anyway so this is the new galaxy m51 and i know it kind of looks like your usual samsung smartphone with the glass stick back design we've seen in quite a few phones the usual buttons along with a side mounted fingerprint scanner similar to the one in the m31s the usual ports and single speaker on the bottom and the dual sim plus dedicated micro sd slot so yeah it seems like your usual samsung smartphone but it's not this is a phone that packs in that insane battery i mean i remember when samsung launched the galaxy m30 with a 5000 image battery i was like wow that is good and then samsung went ahead and launched the galaxy m31 with a big 6 000 mah battery and it was awesome i mean even today 6000 mah batteries in phones is pretty rare and now samsung has done something i wasn't really expecting at least so soon it has launched the galaxy m51 with a 7 000 mah battery it's crazy and no other phone even comes close so let's talk about what you can actually do with this big big battery now it's said to last more than two days on a single charge on continuous usage and i kind of believe that but i also did a few of my tests so i did a gaming test first i played cody mobile's baton royale mode for 1r on the galaxy m51 with the graphics set to very high and the frame rate set to very high i also set the brightness to max because i want to take full toll of this battery so after one hour of gameplay the phone just lost 11 percent yeah just 11 percent that is amazing i mean to put things into perspective the poco x2 with a 4500 image battery but the same 730g chipset loses 23 battery in an hour on the same settings so you kind of get an idea of the difference this bigger battery makes anyway so gaming obviously drains the battery but i also did a video playback test so i was watching the england vs australia game the other night and i noted the battery rate which was very nominal see i watched the game for two hours and the battery rate was just nine percent yep just nine percent in two hours so the 7000 image battery should be good quite obviously but i also like the fact that you can actually use this phone as a power bank because it makes sense see the phone has the wired power share feature so you can use the usbc to usbc cable in the box to charge other devices using the galaxy m51 i also like the fact that samsung has put in a 25 watt fast charger with the m51 the same charger that you get with the samsung flagships and this charger takes the phone from 10 to 100 percent in just one hour 15 minutes which is great considering the massive battery size so the battery performance is great but i'm sure you're wondering with that huge battery packs is the galaxy m51 a crazy humongous phone well honestly i was wondering that before i you know got hands on the phone and well it's not a crazy humongous phone i mean it's not a very small or very compact smartphone but it's not crazy big or too hefty either as you can see i mean it weighs 213 grams which is fine for a phone that packs in that big battery anyway so that was the battery now like i mentioned at the start this also comes with a snapdragon chipset indoor so there's the snapdragon 730 g to be exact along with up to 8 gb ram and 128 gb storage and this should result in reliable performance see i've only had the phone for three days so far but i've used it a lot to test out the battery and i've noticed the 730g performs really well here the usual tasks work out fine obviously but it was nice to see the phone handle gaming well as i mentioned above i played cod mobile at very high graphics very high frame rates and the gameplay experience was very very good now obviously a longer run with the phone will give us a better idea of the performance here but so far it's been positive now apart from that when it comes to software there's one ui 2.1 on board on top of android 10 and it's got all the great one ui features as for the pre-installed apps there are a few microsoft apps that you can uninstall there are also these apps and as you can see there are quite a number of them but you can uninstall every single one of them so that's good now apart from the massive battery and the snapdragon chipset there is also this really nice display this is a 6.7 inch super amoled plus display in an infinity o design and this is a very good looking display it's very bright and it looks crisp and vibrant and just watching anything on it looks great now another area where the galaxy m51 seems promising is on the camera front so you get the quad camera setup on the back featuring the 64 megapixel imx 682 primary camera a 12 megapixel ultra wide angle lens a 5 megapixel macro lens and a 5 megapixel depth sensor so this seems like a very capable quad camera setup and as you can see from the photos that i've taken they look good with nice details and good overall exposure i mean the imax 682 sensor on the m31s does very well so i'm hoping for the same with the m51 now along with the main camera i also took a few pictures with the ultra wide angle lens but they're pretty good with some really good colors and yeah i like it so far apart from that there are all the other cool camera features you see in samsung phones like single take night hyperlapse super steady mode and more as for the front camera here are some selfies from the 32 megapixel camera and they look good enough well that was pretty much everything about the new galaxy m51 and obviously the biggest highlight of this phone is the 7000 mah battery i mean i really hope that this starts a trend of more and more phones packing in massive batteries so that we no longer require power banks anyway the galaxy m31 is not only about the 7000 mah battery it seems like a pretty well-rounded phone with the snapdragon 730g chipset the 64 megapixel camera setup the super amoled display and the 25 watt fast charging now coming to the pricing the 6gb 128gb variant of the m51 has been priced at rupees 24 triple nine and there's also a nice 2000 rupees instant cashback on hdfc cards on amazon for the first three days anyway this is the price i was expecting for the galaxy m51 because there's also the m31s which starts at around 20k
