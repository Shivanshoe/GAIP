[Applause] [Music] hey guys i'm akshay from vwom.com and chrome is definitely one of the most used browsers out there i mean it's fast it has a ton of features and there are a lot of extensions for it but one of the best things about chrome is chrome flags which lets you get new features and just improves your browsing experience overall well today i'm here with eight cool chrome flags that you should be using now i'll talk about chrome flags for desktop and mobile and there are some really cool ones so make sure you watch till the end now let's get started before i move on though i know you are missing rupesh and vel rupesh has a cool sponsor to tell you about so here you go i mean i'm sure you have tons of questions when buying a new laptop like does it have the latest generation of processors does it combine best-in-class technologies like wi-fi 6 and thunderball 4. does it have neural noise suppression ai enhancements and super video resolution for amazing video calls so many questions but all you need to do is just ask does it have intel 11 gen it's all you need great now let's jump right in and check out these cool chrome plugs first up i'm sure a lot of you use apps like pocket to save items for reading later right well you don't need to use that anymore yeah simply enable the read later chrome flag and you get a reading list built in so i can just add new websites to my reading list easily like this article right here i'll read it after the shoot plus i think you should also enable the site panel plan once you do this you'll get a much better ui for the reading list as well as your bookmarks which is great next up we have all seen these annoying notification prompts and camera location prompts right these are huge and you have to close them before you can see the page completely it's just a hassle well not anymore simply go to the chrome flags page and enable the permissions chip experiments and quiet notification prompts flags now when i go to a website that needs access to my camera i get this really clean and non-intrusive prompt i can even ignore it if i want to which is great now this one is a cool chrome flag for android users so when you're out and about and you come across a file that you want to download it can be annoying to do that on mobile data right and maybe you just want to download it at a later date we'll just enable the download later flag as well as the download later on wi-fi black now when you try to download a file from chrome you will get this menu where you can pick a date and time or just set it to automatically download when you connect to a wi-fi network that's pretty useful isn't it moving on if you're someone who uses incognito mode on your phone a lot this chrome flag can be very useful for you normally android doesn't let you take screenshots in incognito mode but if you really want to just enable the incognito screenshot flag on chrome or android and you will be able to click all the screenshots you want even in incognito mode now if you're like me you always have a lot of tabs open in chrome and you probably use tab groups to organize them now that's all fine but if you want chrome to not destroy your computer's resources there's a really handy chrome flag you should be using just enable the auto freeze collapse tab groups flag and that's it now whenever you collapse a tag group in chrome it will freeze those tabs so you will have more free resources for other apps speaking of tab groups i do like them on desktop but personally i think on mobile tab groups are a little too much plus now if you long press on a link you simply get an option to open it in a new tab in group well if you like me and you want the old open a new tab option back here's how to do that first go to chrome flags and search for start surface choose enable single surface v2 finale next search for tab grid layout and choose enabled without auto group relaunch chrome and now when you long press on a link it will give the option to open it in a new tab pretty cool right next up i have a chrome flat for you that widget lovers will love yeah you must have seen the new chrome widget on ios right well you can get a similar widget on android now as well all you have to do is go to chrome flags and enable the quick action search widget plan now on your home screen you can long press and choose widgets and you will find the new chrome widget right there right now this is only available in chrome canady and the image search button doesn't work but it comes with a quick search bar shortcut for incognito mode voice search and yeah the dyno game so you can play that whenever you want hopefully this will be added to the stable channel soon as well lastly there's a cool chrome flag for anyone who uses chrome's link to text feature normally when you use this feature you just get a hyperlink that links directly to the piece of text you selected right well if you enable the web note stylize flag you can now select any text tap on share and then tap on this new create card button to get these cool looking cards you can then share these with anyone you want you can also enable the web notes publish flag while you're here with this flag enabled when you're sharing the card you will also get a save option right there so you can save the cards on your phone as well neat right that's it this flag is also available only in chrome canary right now i mean technically it's available in the stable version as well but it doesn't really work right now so yeah you'll have to wait a bit before you'll be able to use this flag in the stable version of drone well those were the eight cool chrome flags i had for you guys and since most of these flags are available on the stable version of chrome you should get started with using them right away and let us know which chrome flags you use in the comments down below also give this video a like and share it with your friends and
