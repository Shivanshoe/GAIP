cable managing a desk setup can be a real pain in the backside let's be real but poor cable management can make even the slickest of desk setups look like a hot mess and so as frustrating and as annoying as it might be to do it's always worth taking the time to do it right so today i'm unpacking my complete guide to cable management which will take your desk setups from looking like this to looking like this let's go now there are really two main directions that you can take for your cable management you can go for a really clean but less flexible option and this is for those who have perhaps a more permanent workstation where you're happy to lock everything in for a solid stretch of time well the second option is to keep things still tidy but less so and more flexible it is important to first determine what direction is going to be best for you and your setup because if you're planning to upgrade your peripherals in the next few months or you're always moving apartments whatever it might be if you need flexibility then you definitely don't want to lock yourself in too tightly now before we do any sort of managing of cables we first want to unplug everything and lay it out in a fairly orderly manner still plugged in to the devices themselves just not into a wall outlet or power strip this will just give us as good a start as possible with the most flexibility before we go about securing cables or plugs and getting ourselves into a tangled mess so with that done let's first touch on the more flexible method if you're going to go with this approach you're going to want to get yourself two main accessories a cable management rack like this one from ikea and a cable management box like this one also from icao so you screw the cable management rack into the underside of your table and then you load in all of your excess cables and a power strip as well preferably and that helps to keep all of your messy cables off the floor suspended below the table which is a great first step in your cable management from there you just run the power strip cord along the underside of your table using some cable clips like so and then ideally you run the cable down behind a set of drawers on one side or one of your table's legs and that runs into your wall plug any extra cable length can be run through that cable management box as well as any extra power strip that you might be using and bada boom bada bing you just really cleaned up your desk setup now this sort of approach to cable management looks best when you're standing in your room or your eyesight is above your table anytime you get too low and you will start to see that cable management rack and some cables as well so there is a more refined approach that we can take and that is using cable runways now alongside the cable runway we're also going to be using these super strong double-sided adhesive strips mine are from 3m and they've worked really well for me but essentially what we're going to be doing is instead of letting our power strip and our cables hang fairly loosely in a cable management rack we're actually going to secure the power strip to the underside of the table using those 3m double-sided strips now because the cable runway and double-sided adhesive strips are really strong and secure you really don't want to be pulling these on and off trying to perfect the alignment so before you do any sticking of anything to the table you really want to take your time to plan out how you think your cables will best run and in what orientation for me i went with mounting my power strip parallel to my alex draw unit just to keep it tucked away and out of sight from there because i have a corded lamp on the far side of my table and my monitor cables running from the center of my table i've actually taken that cable runway and cut it into thirds approximately and then i've used two of those thirds underneath my table so this leaves a gap in the middle for my monitor cables to run neatly through rather than having to leave the cable runway door slightly ajar which will just completely pop open over time so now with the runway mounted to the underside of the table i can now run my lamp cord the speaker connector cable the monitor power cord and the display adapter cable all the way through and plug them into the power strip like so from there i was tossing up between running just a power board directly from the wall outlet there or using a short extension cable to further its run and i ended up deciding to use the short extension cable and this allowed me to hide the power strip comfortably behind my alex draw unit and in this ikea cable management box i was also able to run my speaker power unit and cable down and into this cable management box as well as a few other cables that i was needing to run to my computer such as the one from my wireless charger and the usb extension cable that i have attached to an sd card reader and mounted to the underside of my worktop using a 3m strip and aside from the extra storage capability having a draw unit like this one is a really easy way to hide a bunch of cables even if they are somewhat neatly organized into a cable management box like this so finally to help clean up this unsightly extension cable in the middle of my desk here i'll use that leftover third that i cut from my cable runway and attach that to the wall using the adhesive and run the cable through that if your power outlet is in the center of your wall like it is for me then unless you have a corner desk set up this is just about the best solution that you'll be able to come up with you can also instead mount that cable runway vertically which might help to clean it up a little bit visually but then you also have to deal with all of these extra cables underneath your tabletop now after getting my cable management pretty close to complete i realized that i had a little bit of a problem the lamp power plug that runs to the power strip that is mounted to the underneath of my table it was actually beefier than i had originally accounted for and so as a result you can kind of see it jutting out from underneath the table depending on where you are in the room so if you have solid in size power plugs that are needing to be plugged in like i do then you might want to instead run the entire power strip behind your drawer unit if you have a drawer unit then mount it to the back of that drawer unit using 3m strips then you can run all of your other cables underneath your table top using the cable runway and then behind your drawers as necessary this is actually what i ended up doing and i did find that it cleaned up the cables a little bit nicer than the previous setup the only issue with this configuration is that your peripheral cables will need to be a little bit longer compared to what they were with the previous setup because that power strip is located a little bit further away compared to where it was previously and if you don't have a draw unit to hide your cables behind then you will just have to mount your power strip to the underneath of your table like i had previously done now a quick disclaimer at the back end here i do not recommend picking up or using these adhesive cable tires in your cable management they can't take a lot of weight and they end up just falling off really quickly i bought them and tried using them in this desk setup and immediately i remembered why i shouldn't have bought them instead if you're looking to secure longer cables to the underside of your desk then i highly recommend picking up these cable clips that have little nails in them meaning they properly secure your cables to the table if you don't like the sound of essentially nailing your cables to the underside of your table then instead you can use them in conjunction with these little twisty ties tie them around the cable clip then around your cable that's a great way to keep things slightly more flexible but that's my approach to cable management if you enjoyed this video or you found it helpful then a sub would be amazing and if you haven't already checked out my course on creating cinematic technology videos then i'll leave a link to that below aside from that thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
