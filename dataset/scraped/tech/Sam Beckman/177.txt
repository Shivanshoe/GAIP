so a little over five months ago I uploaded my latest what's on my phone video which featured the setup you're currently seeing on screen now I said in that video that if it reached four thousand likes I would create a step-by-step instructional video unpacking exactly how to replicate this setup on your own phone and well about a month or so ago the video finally ticked over four thousand likes and so here we are what you might not know is that even though it was August of last year that I posted that video pretty much that exact setup is still what a rock on my daily driver so with that said let's dive in and set this thing up so as mentioned in that original video the launcher that I'm using for this home screen setup is lawnchair version two and four over a year now this has remained my launcher of choice so we're gonna start with how launch it looks straight out of the box this is the default setup when you first install it and let's jump into our settings and get everything here setup correctly first so let's go from top to bottom in each of these settings starting with the theme section through our icon pack we're gonna take the crichton icon pack and drag this upwards into the enabled section then we'll head back we'll tap on the theme down here and I like to set the theme based on daylight which means once it's dark outside the thing goes dark now that's all of the settings that I change in the theme menu so let's head back and then navigate into the desktop page so firstly I set my grid size to ten by six then I enabled the overlapped placement option and I also enable the hide app names option as well from there I changed my icon size to seventy-seven percent and I also disabled the add icon to homescreen option then down below that I leave most of these settings as is but I do enable wide widgets and I disable the top shadow as well then we head back into the home widget menu and here all I do is switch this off as I replace this with a custom widget a little later on then under the dock settings page I turn on the shadow and then I change the dock scale to 75 percent and I also disable the page indicator setting a bit lower on this page and here I changed the number of icons from five to three and then I disable the doc search bar as well now heading into the app drawer page I firstly bring down the icon size to seventy-seven percent match the size of the icons on the desktop then I'll usually select a number of apps to hide but we'll skip that for now and a bit below that is where I've disabled the display app suggestions option as well which will become important later on after that on our search page the only setting I change here is right down the bottom and I switch this color setting from follow theme to light then on the gestures page I've got one gesture that I always tend to set up regardless of the setup I'm using which is the DoubleTap to launch a global search gesture and I enable this mainly because I've disabled the search bar in the dot the other gestures I leave as is now I can't actually remember whether this next setting is only for those who have a rooted device and who are using quick switch to set launcher as the default launcher but regardless I then head into this recents menu and disable the blur background option as it's known to cause lawnchair to use more memory if it's switched on and I don't really care for the blurry look anyway I used to also set this corner rounding option to eight DP but this setting actually no longer works at least on the latest launcher builds that are made for Android ten ok and that is it for all of our base settings within the lawnchair settings menu and now we can head back to our home screen to start getting everything in place so the first thing to do is to remove the default widget and all of the default icons on the home screen so we've got a clean slate for setting things up then we'll go about setting up our weather widget so long press our screen and enter the widgets menu then we'll never get all the way down to kW GT and I'm just going to select a 2x2 widget here and I'll drag this to the middle upper portion of my homescreen then I'll long press the widget and increase the size of both of the sides just a little bit now we'll tap on the blank widget and we'll enter into the kW GT settings page now the weather widget I use is a customized widget from the Huq 4k WGT widget pack which I will of course link below and it's a widget called free 0 19 so it will tap on that and will be taken into the page where we can start customizing the widget to make it look how we want it to okay so we'll first step on this overlap group option here and then in that menu will select the top overlap group and the bottom stack group and we'll delete both so we're left with just the stack group that was in the middle then we'll tap on that stack group and then on the Google now weather option and we'll scale that down 150 well then head back twice to the first stack root page and move over to the position page and move the white offset up so that the widget now sits in the middle then we'll tap the Save icon and come back to our home screen to quickly check how things are looking I'm happy with that so far so I'll tap the widget again and this time I'll navigate to the touch panel and tap this option here then I'll tap the top menu and select launch app will now get an app picker below that so I'll tap that and navigate down to the Frog weather application then I'll hit save again and if we come back to our home screen you'll see that tapping on the widget now launches straight into the Google weather feed all right with that completed and out of the way it's time to start loading the various app icons onto our home screen so I like to place the apps on my desktop in a 4 by 2 configuration which I've become obsessed with for some reason and then once I've got them laid out like that I like to also have my podcasting application on my home screen but I obviously don't want to interrupt this neat pattern that I've got set up so I do so by somewhat hiding it in a folder underneath this Spotify icon here so I'll grab the app that I want drag it over the Spotify icon to create a folder then I'll tap on the folder and then the little three icon here in the corner and I'll switch on cover mode which essentially means Spotify is the app that will show up on the home screen and that will launch when I tap on it but if I swipe up on the Spotify icon it will open that folder which is a neat little feature I enjoy using okay now we're gonna create that folder icon that shows up in the dock so I'll grab all of the different applications I want to include in that folder and I like to put them on the desktop first because it seems a little less finicky to put them in the folder this way then I'll move it on to the dock then I'll open it and tap on the little 3 icon here as well I'll tap on the folder icon at the top then tap on candy cons and select this little white dot draw icon at the top here and that's it for this folder and his first homepage as well you can see because my phone is rooted and I'm using the quick switch module that folder icon even stays in the recent panel as well which is super convenient and this is why we had to disable that display app suggestions option earlier otherwise this folder icon would not stay in the recents menu so let's now take a look at how I set up that calendar widget on our second homepage well first long press our home screen and enter the widgets menu and again scroll down to the K you GT section and again I'm going to select a two-by-two option and hold and drag this onto a second page then I'll resize it so it fills the entire bottom third or even just a little bit bigger of the screen okay let's tap on it and from here the calendar widget that I start with is taken from the Sun and c4k WGT widget pack and then what I use is about halfway down and it's called SNS 0:44 so it will tap on that and then we'll select the overlap group and then the bottom object here labeled mmm and then we'll go ahead and delete it so we're left with just the calendar portion of the widget then we'll never get to the position tab you can move the white offset up so it sits in the middle okay now if we head back to our first page with the overlap group option visible we're going to tap on this overlap group then on the component option here and then we'll navigate over to the touch menu from here we need to click on where it says launch app and again tap on the launch app option at the top and in this menu select launch activity now we can tap the activity option below that and scroll down to the month calendar widget section and we'll go ahead and tap on and from this drop down list we want to select the middle option that ends with date info activity so tap that save the widget head back to your home screen and now when you tap the calendar widget it will open up the month calendar widget overlay which I really like because it means we get the best of both worlds a super minimal looking calendar widget to suit the rest of the setup and then a really functional calendar overlay that allows you to quickly see upcoming events as I mentioned earlier I do also like to hide a bunch of apps that I don't need direct access to from showing up in the app drawer so I'm going to navigate back into the lawnchair settings and then into the app drawer section then I'll come down and tap on hide apps and go through my list and hide any apps I don't want to see in my app drawer which as you can see cleans it up beautifully but if I do need quick access to one of the apps that I've hidden that I can always use the search bar in the app drawer which will still reveal hidden apps that is it for my home screen setup I hope this has been helpful in getting your own home screen set up to look like mine and if there are any issues definitely feel free to drop a comment down below and I'll do my best to hit you up with a response aside from that thank you all very much for watching and I'll catch you later [Music]
