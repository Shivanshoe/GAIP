okay we're back we're into the new series sorry for those who don't like the Hat it's a hat day for me let's roll the intro right if you do not know what this series is you're like Sam what nerf is going on well I posted a series announcement video a couple of days back make sure you go and watch that that will help clarify it but in short I'm taking your setups I'm loading them onto my phone and I'm redesigning them so let's get into the first setup okay so we have our first home screen set up ready to go this one was sent in by Shelby thank you for being willing to be the first contestant in this series this setup was made using lawnchair I'm using version 2 the backup files transfer between the two different versions so that's nice on the home screen here we have the Delta icon pack love that icon pack and then we have a couple of widgets taken from the outline 4k WGT widget pack up the top and down the bottom there but then in the middle we've got a self-made line widget just to separate those icons there okay so just some general comments before we go about changing this setup at all I like the vibe of what you're going for I do like the vibrancy of the icons compared to the sort of subdued look of the background there and overall it's got a pretty good layout and I think what you've done here is a pretty good start and we can make some small changes just to refine the overall look okay the first thing I'm going to do is just remove that line widget in the middle there even though I like that it's an originally made widget it's not really adding a whole heap to this set up both visually or functionally either so in that case it's probably best to get rid of it so now that we've removed that line I think you'll agree with me that the gap in between the top layer of icons and the bottom layer of icons is too big it's it's way too big now that we've removed that line so what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to bring down that top layer of icon so it sits nicely on top of that bottom layer of icons now as well as that I think those icons are just a little bit too big I think they're taken up too much screen real estate so what I'm going to do is I'm going to head into the home settings and ahead into the desktop menu there and going to come down to icon size and I'm gonna bring these down I'm gonna start pretty drastically down at 70 percent come back to the home screen so it looks like I don't mind that but they're probably a little bit too small for a lot of people's preference so I'm gonna bring that up to maybe 85 so there we go I'm just brought them down 50 percent it's not a big change but bring them down just ever so slightly can help clean up an otherwise cluttered home screen now I quite like the look of that Google search bar widget down there I might make one or two small changes but before we even do that I'm just gonna head into the home settings I'm gonna come to I'm not even sure this is in dock maybe oh yeah and down to show arrow and I'm gonna uncheck that and then when we come back to our home screen that little arrow indicator that indicates that we can pull up to bring up the app drawer I've now just disabled that so it just again cleans up that home screen a little bit further now as I said I do really like the Google search bar widget but just to see what we can do I'm gonna jump in to kW GT anyway and see if we can make some changes to clean it up even a little bit further so let's just have a little play around here just going to jump into the stack group then search and then let's just see what our layers are here overlap group I think that's probably what we want to open there I'm just trying to find that search but I can't okay this stack group again what have we got okay we've got that Google there I've got a search text in the middle and then the search bar icon if I check that and delete it if I cleanse it up just a little bit I'm gonna save that actually jump to the home screen and yeah so now it's centered up at the Google search bar text and I think that's enough we don't need that search bar icon there as well though you could go the other way around and actually remove the Google search bar text and keep the search about icon and in fact I'm not even trying to do that right now okay so I've just done the opposite where I got rid of the Google search bar text and I've left the search bar icon there and I think that cleans it up nicely but one final thing I might do is actually just decrease the height of this overall widget so there we go I've decreased the overall height of the entire widget had to go in and change the height values for all three rectangles that you can see there we've removed the Google search texts and I think that just cleans it up quite nicely without removing the original intention of the look of this widget so now for that top widget which I'm a little more nervous about because there's quite a few elements there so it's going to take a little more fine-tuning to see what we can do with this widget to clean it up a little bit so I'm just going to try and find where those lines are let's click on that and then I'm assuming it's these top and bottom shapes that we can see the square shapes there and yeah it looks like it is let's just delete those just double-check excellent so we got rid of those lines but now you can see our text has shifted so let's go ahead and move that now I'm pretty sure that's in the center there let's just save that and head back to our home screen and that will - okay except now the fact that our square widgets at the bottom there are sort of off-center that looks weird so let's fix that up all right so I've moved those back into the center I think they're roughly in the center there I think the last thing I want to do though is potentially just thicken up that line in the middle there because at the moment it's it's a little bit too thin for my liking that's thickened it up quite nicely and I think now I like the contrast between that line and the date and the day there but I think I'm going to make everything else a little bit thicker as well so let me just do that okay so what I've done is I've actually changed the font of the Tuesday text there to Roboto black so it's nice and thick and I think that contrasts against the date which is quite thin nicely and then the last thing I want to do is I'm actually going to come back to the overarching widget page which is it was tap on that head back in and I'm gonna head over the shortcuts page and I can see that actually there's already a few shortcuts set up here so let's see what they do if I tap on that they're nothing tap on that okay my guess is that this widget is supposed to launch into the various corresponding apps but perhaps I don't have them installed so let's just go ahead and tweak what apps these open from my phone okay so I've done that so now when we tap on the text up there it goes into the calendar that should go into the weather and that should go into the clock all of which it does now the last thing is the battery icon at the moment just goes into the main settings page so let's set that up so that it actually goes into the battery settings page so we want to head back to our watch a menu here click on that bottom option and then click on battery so what we can do is actually tap on where it says launch app and change that to launch a shortcut then tap on where it says settings and come down to settings shortcut and we should be able to come down and select battery then if we save that come back to our home screen we can tap on that they go straight into our battery settings which makes a lot more sense so this is the final home screen that I've come up with with the existing wallpaper but I do want to try it with a different wallpaper because I still think that wallpaper is to detail that's trying to fight for too much of our attention so let's try and pick a new wallpaper all right so this is what I found just a quick search through wall P and I thought this one had a similar color palette that sort of soft blue slash green colors which are quite liked I like that in your original setup but this is a pretty drastically different look so again that's up to you depending on what you like I personally go this one because I think that it just lends itself to being a more visually pleasing home screen setup but again if you have a big affinity with that backdrop that you originally used then obviously you would want to stick with that so there we go those are the changes that I would make to this setup definitely a little bit of a departure from the original but I think that's the idea of this series but I still think it retains that same visual identity but you guys be the judge let me know in the poll above do you think I improved it or did I not improve it let me know and if you have any comments on what you'd change about to setup let me know in the comments below right onto our second set up for today this has been sent in by Phoenix it's been made using Nova Launcher you're seeing the original screenshots sent on screen right now because I actually don't know where that clock widget was taken from so I've just got a blank space for that on my home screen there's a couple of other widgets used as well and the flat white icon pack has been used here there's a couple of changes that I would make straight off the bat but in terms of just general impressions I think that it has a good starting point I like the space vibe and I definitely like the use of the flat white icon pack but I think there's a few things we can do that I'm going to take very long that are going to clean up the look of this home screen so first things first that backdrop don't mind it but I don't love it and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and just change that straight out of the gate because I think again it's just got lots of stars and things in the background that take our attention that kind of just draw our eye away from what's actually happening on the home screens I think it's good to find a slightly more minimal backdrop so I'm gonna come back into warp II here and I'm just going to type in stars and see what comes up now I do want to try and find an image that has a fairly similar color palette to what you've originally used there but I have done already a little bit of searching and a currently find one that is clean and also that has that sort of purpley hue to it so instead I'm gonna find out one that is slightly different in color palette and I think I'm gonna go with this one actually so again you can see it's a bit more of a green slash blue tint to it with a little bit of warmth there but hopefully you don't mind that I'm gonna switch up the color palette just a little bit now I think just changing that wallpaper has really improved the look of this home screen straight out of the gate it just helps to clean it up gives a little bit of definition to the different areas of our home screen and so I think changing the wallpaper has done wonders as it is so you're looking at your original submission I can see you've got a date and time widget up the top there so we're going to go ahead and find one that I like the look of now because it's got those outlines we're gonna actually use the outline for kwg tea widget pack again which was used in the previous setup okay so after a fair bit of digging I decided on this widget here its widget number one five four from the outline Kay WGT pack even though it doesn't have the clock it still got a little bit of that rectangle vibe that you had in your original setup so I'm hoping you don't mind the change there and I also think that yellow color complements that sort of warmth of the sunset portion of that image in the background there quite nicely okay so if I tap on that I'm just gonna come over to the layer panel there just to show you that I brought scale down to around 45 just so it wasn't so overbearing on the home screen but to make up for the fact that there is no longer any clock portion of this widget I'm going to tap on the overlap group here come over to touch tap on the plus icon up here then tap on where it says none and then action none and then I'm just going to tap on launch app tap the space down here then come down to the clock and save that come back home so now when I tap on that it'll launch into the clock application which we can just navigate over the clock section and there we go there is our time right now I don't actually mind that default Nova Google search bar there I'm just gonna bring it down a little bit just to separate it a little bit further and further accentuate those three icons that you have in the middle of the home screen there which actually quite like and I think that looks pretty good for the home screen but let's now come over to our second page here and a couple things that I want to address on this page you can see over on the left here we have an icon that obviously wasn't supported by the flat white icon pack and in this case what I will do is actually be a little bit sacrificial on functionality and I'll long press it edit it manually and edit the app icon there come to the flat icon pack and what I do is try and find an icon that kind of looks like the app icon that could pass as being the icon for that app and then just set it so that it has that icon so we've kind of got a little bit of a globe here I have no clue what that is for but again as long as I know that that app goes into whatever I have set up there then generally speaking it's not a big issue in terms of functionality now the other thing I might do is I might actually just bring down those icons down the bottom here I'm not upset sure whether or not that's gonna work but yeah I think then that matches the position of the Google widget that is on the first home screen so I think that kind of works it might be a little bit cluttered there and in fact I might want to remove that arrow indicator here as well come to app drawer and I think it's under swap indicator there it is head back home yeah I think that looks a little bit better without the indicated there and then the last thing I want to do is we've got this widget here that is from actually probably a specific app that relates to your workplace it's called my duty and that's fair enough if you actually need to leave it there then that's fine but what I'm going to do is actually get rid of that altogether and I'm gonna add a widget for the month calendar widget application drag that to my home screen and I'm gonna resize that so that it fills up a similar space that you had set up just like that maybe bring it down a little bit just give it a little bit of negative space there and then I might even head into the Month widget settings come over to settings and I'm just gonna select a date range to display change that to one month let's go over to the themes and there we go I've applied that I'm just gonna bring it in a little bit more increase the padding there bring that in maybe make it a little bit smaller and I think that looks a little bit better you still got the entire month there which is helpful but I guess the downside there is that you'll have to transfer all of your work information over to your regular Google Calendar I guess if you want it to appear on this widget but aside from that I think that in terms of a visual standpoint that looks a little bit cleaner compared to the other application we did that you had there alright so those the changes that I would make to this to page setup I think we haven't sacrificed too much functionality with the visual changes that we've made but let me know what you guys think vote in the poll above do you think I've improved the setup or have I made it worse let me know in the poll and again let me know what you would change in the comments below all right onto our third and final setup for today this one has been sent in by yes with apologies if I butchered your name there but this one has been made using Nova Launcher it's got a couple of widgets that have been taken from the mini ism KW GT widget pack though they have been modified and the icon pack on show here is the phosphor icon pack that's be honest with you I don't think there's a whole lot that I would change about this setup visually at the very least I think you've identified what design language you're going for the black and white theme is very strong and you've adapted to that theme very well now there are a couple of tweaks that I would change though I think the first thing I'm never a big fan of a quote on a home screen that is just my personal preference I know a lot of people dig them so please ignore this if you're someone who loves having quite soon your home screen but for me I'd probably simply just get rid of this one get rid of that down there but then that leaves a lot of empty space down there so I think I want to fill that with something else okay so what I've done is I've taken this widget from the Sun and see widget pack its widget 72 to be precise although at the moment it's sort of cut off so what I want to do is I actually want to just go into this and delete a bunch of these layers okay so I basically deleted every single layer except for the Google search bar I thought it tied in with this theme really nicely and it adds back in a layer of functionality which otherwise wasn't there and whilst I do like the principle of the backdrop there where it's you know the moon and we've got that silhouette of some bird like creature on the top of it I think we're gonna try to find something a little more minimalistic so let me try and find something in the Wolpe app on a search for one here called I'm just going to search for moon and see what we can come up with now I'm trying to keep in mind obviously your black and white theme but I think it's okay if we introduce a very subtle amount of color so something like this could work nicely okay so what we've done is I've brought in an actual image of a moon rather than a graphic which I think the original image was we do have a slight hint of yellow in the moon there but I think it actually doesn't take away from the black and white theme I think it only complements it and accentuates it further I think the only other thing I want to do with this setup is make it a little bit more functional so to do that I'm going to create a folder icon from one of these icons down here on the dock okay so I've just created a folder on that Google icon thereby grabbing a bunch of random apps I think some of them are even duplicates of what's already there on the home screen but no matter I'm just going to long press it now and then tap Edit and then I'm gonna check mark this thing here that says swipe to open folder and then tap action first item in folder is perfect done so it still looks nice and clean we have that minimal dock there but when we swipe up on the Google icon now we get a folder full of applications so this is just a really handy way to add in a lot of functionality into a pretty clean home screen like this okay so those are the changes that I would make to this home screen setup I really like the design language that you had set up from the get-go the black and white very minimal theme all I did was add in some functionality to that Google icon down the bottom there having it so that we can swipe up on it to access a folder full of applications I changed the widget to a Google search bar down the bottom there and I also slightly changed the background let me know do you think I improved the setup do you think I made it worse vote in the poll over on the side there and again let us know in the comments below what you would do if you had to tweak the look and feel of this setup okay but that's it let me know which of the redesigns you liked most down in the comments below and again if you have different ways that you would change the setup so that I featured then let us know down in the comments below I'd love to hear how you would approach changing each of these setups but that's it thank you guys for watching I appreciate you a lot hopefully you enjoyed this one and I will catch you later [Music]
