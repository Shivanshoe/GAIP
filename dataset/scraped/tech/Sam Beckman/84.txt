[Music] if you're someone who doesn't use spotify premium but you just absolutely fed up with the ads well mute them with mutify once installed whenever mutified detects that spotify is playing an ad it turns the volume down to zero so now you can play your favorite music without being smacked in the face every time one of those ridiculously loud spotify ad starts playing and so here we go 10 more android applications to get the month of june started off with the bank so get that phone of yours and let's go now material u is a kw gt pack designed to emulate the recent android 12 redesign we saw announced at google i o at the time of recording this video the pack comes with 24 android 12 inspired widgets but what's really impressive is that all of the widgets feature this handy global color editor where you essentially edit the main color of the widget and then all of the other supporting colors will adapt accordingly it's not quite as smooth as the supposed wallpaper based themes coming with android 12 but it's just about as close as we're going to get using widgets crimson wallpapers is an app that got to mention in my recent episode of the best nova launcher setups but the backdrops impressed me so much that i just had to showcase it in today's video as well so you get access to over 230 unique wallpapers and whilst i would categorize each of them as abstract they're also quite diverse as well catering to just about any style that you might be after each of the wallpapers is super crispy and sharp and so if you're looking to spice up your home screen with a fresh backdrop then this app is definitely worth a shout now before we press on just a heads up that i have a bunch of promo codes to give away for several of the apps featured in today's episode which i'll be giving away over on my instagram page and i'll let you know which ones we have codes for at the end of the video but thought i'd let you know now so you don't miss out all right back to the apps all right mark is a very unique android application that has basically one piece of functionality to auto delete screenshots so when you open up the app you get only two settings that you can change how many minutes to wait before deleting a screenshot and whether to clear the notification after 40 seconds automatically very specific anyway from there anytime you capture a screenshot you'll get a new notification that asks if you want a delete said screenshot if you tap yes it'll delete the screenshot from your phone after the predetermined time so for those instances where you wanted to capture just a temporary screenshot then using mark could be a handy solution time rise is an impressively simple app that makes setting and watching a timer something you might actually want to do so when you open the app you tap the number in the middle set a time and press ok and then to start the timer you're ready for it you just flip the phone around and just like that your phone's display will start filling up and it really does give you that same vibe of using an egg timer but now it's on your phone you can also adjust the color in the app's settings plus there's a couple of other customizations you can adjust as well but i honestly love the concept now i'm assuming because you're here watching this video which is all about apps then you like a decent app right and so if that's the case then you should definitely check out the amazing app made by today's video sponsor skillshare or just check out their web platform whatever suits you best and that's the cool thing about skillshare not only is it an incredible online learning community that has tens of thousands of classes across a wide range of categories but the fact that you can watch these classes on both your computer and on your phone and even download them for offline playback is seriously fantastic and the best part you just pay a single monthly price and that gives you access to any class that you like now one of my favorite uses of skillshare recently has been finding after effects tutorials to enhance my own videos here on youtube and so a really cool one i stumbled upon recently is called repeating patterns it's by one of my favorite skillshare teachers jake bartlett and this one is quite a short class so keep an eye out for this type of effect in a video on my channel at some point in the near future skillshare premium starts at less than 10 a month but because they're sponsoring today's video they are offering a free trial to the first 1 000 people who use my link down in the description below so definitely make sure that you check it out and get learning okay so there have been many times in these app videos themselves where i've mentioned that an app might require permissions to be granted via adb now this is normally a somewhat tiring process of connecting your phone to the computer setting up adb via a command prompt and then typing out some lengthy script that gives certain permissions to the apps on your phone but shizuku is a recent app that caught my attention like so few apps rarely do because it's actually been designed to essentially do this process for you now obviously you do need to give permissions via adb to shozuku first but as more and more apps start supporting shizuku the idea is that you should hopefully only need to do this process once and then never again now because there aren't that many apps supported at this time consider this an official call out to developers whose apps require adb permission you guys know what to do get on board and let's hope we can streamline this whole adb process a heck of a lot more going forward time arrow is a fancy way of viewing countdowns to important events so that you don't miss them so we've all got those dates we don't want to forget right wedding anniversaries our mums and dads birthdays when the rent next needs to be paid all that good stuff well time arrow makes it super easy to track these events visually so you'll hopefully never forget them the app packs in a bunch of other fun features as well like tracking how many days it's been since you were born or viewing how much of the year has passed as a percentage but for the simple task of tracking events this app has got you covered all right the black suite icon pack is a relatively undiscovered icon pack that has a minimal design language sure to make just about any home screen setup look amazing so firstly each icon has this black rounded rectangle as the background and as long as the launcher you're using supports icon masking this makes it really easy to achieve fantastic uniformity across each of your icons even when they're unthemed but then for the themed icons you also get this pastel color icon on top of the black background which i really like the look of it just means the icons are not overly saturated and in your face rather they're subtle and look simple yet elegant add on to that there's already over 2600 icons supported and this is well on the way to being a fantastic icon pack that's well worth checking out spread is a notification manager designed to help you focus by reducing distractions and decluttering your notifications so once you've granted notification access to the app you can then sift through your entire app list to determine which notifications are important and which ones the app should hide and from then on out any notifications from apps that are delegated to the hide section well they'll never be seen in your notification bar again you can also set the app to hide group chat notifications which is pretty neat and the app can even auto detect promotional notifications which is very handy and last but certainly not least automatic is an auto reply app for both whatsapp and facebook messenger so once the app is set up anytime you receive a whatsapp or messenger notification the app will reply instantly with the autoreply text that you've set up you can manually enable or disable group chats which is kind of nice and also choose whether it's enabled for either whatsapp or facebook independently and whilst i desperately wish there was a way to disable the scent using automatic signature that gets automatically attached to each order reply aside from that the app works just as advertised but that is it now as i mentioned earlier in the video we have a bunch of promo codes available for several of the apps featured in today's episode so a big thank you to the developers behind the apps on screen right now these guys have all agreed to give me some promo codes that will unlock the premium versions of their apps so that i can give them away to you lot like last month i'll also be giving away this month's promo codes on my instagram stories so make sure that you're following me over there to have the best chance at claiming one of the many codes on offer and i'll start releasing them in the next two weeks or so to give you plenty of time to get those story notifications switched on aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
