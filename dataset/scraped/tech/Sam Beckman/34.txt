one of the most frustrating parts about switching from using an android phone to then using an iphone or vice versa is app compatibility you spend sometimes years curating your favorite apps on one platform only to discover that half of them don't exist on the other and so i thought why not create a video that showcases 10 of my favorite applications that work on both ios and android and so that's exactly what i've done now i'm bypassing all of the blatantly obvious applications like any from google or even apps like spotify or twitter because well that'll just be plain boring the apps on this list are a little more interesting than that so without further ado let's dive in starting things off we have bring a shopping list application that i've been using for probably over five years now now first and foremost the design of this application is top shelf as are most of the apps on today's list but functionally i've never found anything quite like it you see each shopping list can be shared with any other user of the app and then as anyone adds or removes items from a list it'll then be updated in pretty much real time on the other user's device now my wife is an iphone user and i'm an android user and we pretty much rely on this app to keep a track of our shopping lists and so the fact that it works flawlessly on both operating systems is amazing oh and it's completely free as well all right following that is notes nook and this is a beautiful note-taking app i discovered a few months ago and i was super stoked to find out that it was supported both on ios and android it covers the three key pillars of a solid note taking app ease of use clean design and online sync support and honestly if you're someone who switches back and forth between android and ios switching your note taking over to an app like notes nook is a no-brainer because as soon as you log in every note will automatically sync across that's what i'm talking about now if you're into abstract wallpapers then an amazing application that works on both ios and android is backdrops i use this app all the time to find incredible wallpapers for each of my phone reviews and the fact that you can sign in with google authentication means any favorites will automatically sync across any of your devices as well more than that the app is filled with a plethora of fantastic backdrops that can spice up pretty much any home screen setup you use them in so if you're only ever going to use one abstract wallpaper application this one is a pretty great bet now whilst google podcasts does work on both ios and android devices which can't be said for apple podcasts the app itself is pretty limited and so a much better ios and android friendly podcasting application is pocket casts i've been using this app for the past few years and whilst the design is fairly run-of-the-mill in regards to podcasting applications it's the functionality that keeps me using it seriously the level of customization you can have over how the app behaves is incredible but more than that the fact that i can log in to the app and sync my playback history across any device i use it on is amazing moises is one of those apps that might not be utilized every single day or even every single week but its functionality is just so damn impressive so the app basically scans any song you upload to it and then somehow through some form of dark arts wizardry is able to isolate each of the main different instrument stems this means you can then either solo or mute just the vocals or the drum track or turn up just the bass line and trust me when i say this is not an easy task to do so the fact that this app does it within moments is mind-boggling okay it's not a best apps video without some sort of weather application and so if you're looking for one that works on both ios and android then might i encourage you to take a look at hello weather this definitely isn't the most feature dense weather app you'll come across particularly if you opt for the free version but it is absolutely one of the best in regards to design it is just a visual treat to look at with colorful icons used throughout and a clean layout to go with so well worth it in my opinion if you ever find yourself constantly checking emails or tracking numbers or even text messages to stay on top of all of your incoming parcel deliveries then it might be worth simplifying that process by using an application called aftershift aftership is a free yet wonderfully designed parcel tracking application that makes staying on top of all of your deliveries an absolute breeze and the best part is that on both ios and android the app is completely free you can scan barcodes to quickly insert tracking information there's automatic carrier detection and you can even log into the app which again will sync all of your deliveries across any device you're using the app on now one of my favorite note-taking apps but not for traditional note-taking is other voice notes and as the name indicates this is an application that utilizes voice transcripts to create notes and as well as creating the notes using your voice the app will also store your recordings as a file that you can listen back to and you can even search through each recording to find specific moments which is amazing it works seriously well and is perfect for taking notes during those times you need to remain focused and more than that the app is completely free second to last is life ar and this is a really cool augmented reality application that allows you to provide support or receive it from anyone on the other line using ar with the app installed on both devices you can then connect via a video chat and in real time you can use ar to insert pointers or sketch marks or even notes and without question this has the potential to come in really handy an app like this would be super limiting if it was just on either ios or android so the fact that it's on both just makes it that much more useful and so finally today we have droid cam a fantastic app that essentially transforms your phone into a souped-up webcam it's no secret that the selfie cameras on our phones are often far superior to the ones on our laptops or computers and so with droid cam installed on both your phone and pc you just pair the two devices and just like that you can now use your phone as a webcam to be honest i was kind of surprised this one was available on ios as well but i'm certainly not complaining because this app is fantastic so there you have it 10 incredible applications that work on both android and ios devices now before we wrap up today's video as you all know over the past couple of years i've been doing promo code giveaways on pretty much all of my app related videos and usually i've hosted these giveaways over on instagram or twitter but going forward i'll actually be migrating these giveaways to my channel membership page if you're someone who's been a long time fan of the channel and you've been wondering how you can support the channel then becoming a channel member is an incredible way to do so but i wanted to make sure that there was a big enough incentive for anyone signing up and so hopefully what i've come up with fits the bill so at this time there are two levels of membership the first being five dollars a month which gives you access to a members only discord and a live stream that will be taking place each month but then the second is 15 a month and this will obviously include the members only discord and live stream that i just mentioned but it'll also give you access to any assets i've created for free so wallpaper packs icon packs and of course the premium version of my application palette and you will also be a part of the exclusive club who will receive any promo code giveaways i host each month now i will be asking any app developer participating in the giveaways to give me access to enough promo codes for however many channel members i have each month and i'm also planning to host the giveaways on the day the video launches which means anyone who's already signed up will receive a promo code but if you sign up part way through the month then you'll obviously need to wait until the next app video launches to get your promo codes but i may need to revise this plan if for some reason we get a huge influx of people signing up because app developers aren't always super keen to give away a hundred plus promo codes so we'll play it by ear and see what happens but i guarantee this you will receive at least one promo code each month plus as i said any assets i've either already created or that i end up creating in the future so if you feel like you want to support the channel and get access to all of that exclusive stuff then use the link below to sign up but aside from that thank you all very much for watching have a safe and happy new year and i will catch you later [Music] you
