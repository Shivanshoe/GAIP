well team 2021 is quickly coming to a close and that means it is time for my yearly roundup of the best android apps now because you're watching this video i'm assuming you already know that i've featured a stack of applications on the channel throughout this year well over 150 if you include all of the different app series here on the channel and so as always for today's video i've chosen my top 20. and for those wondering i curate this list based on two key things whether i'm still wowed or impressed by the application this deep into the year or more importantly whether i'm actually still using the application as always there will be a bunch of promo codes to give away for a heap of the apps featured on this list so stay tuned to the end of the video to see which apps you can score promo codes for but this time i'll be releasing half of the codes over on my instagram stories and half of them over on my twitter page so make sure to go and follow me on both of those accounts to have a chance at claiming one of the many codes on offer but without further ado here are my top 20 apps for 2021 all right kicking off the list is buzzkill and this is an app that got a feature all the way back in january of this year if you're looking for an app to keep your notifications under control there's really not a better option because it's filled to the brim with various rules and actions essentially allowing you to see the notifications you want to see when you want to see them and then filter out those that you don't want to see a fantastic app worth the price of admission now colorize is a photo editing application of sorts but this was truly one of the first apps i featured this year to absolutely blow me away put simply this app will take any black and white photo and instantly colorize it it's kind of scary how accurate it gets and it's just a super fun app to play around with now i haven't actually used droid cam since i first featured it but it is a seriously cool app that essentially transforms your phone into a webcam once it's downloaded on both your phone and on your pc device of choice you follow the pairing process and within seconds you'll be able to use your phone as a webcam super helpful stuff you guys seem to love any app i showcase that involves a custom charging animation and so with that in mind i just had to include pica charging show in this round up this app has a huge library of custom charging animations to choose from that once selected will show up and animate at the bottom of your phone screen whenever you plug it into charge so definitely a fun application worth trying audio tube is one of those apps that feels like it shouldn't be allowed on the play store and that's because its functionality is so dang helpful essentially if you're someone who doesn't use youtube premium then you can actually use audio tube to search for and play anything from that platform in the background there's a bunch of other features as well but for that one feature alone it absolutely deserves a place in this video all right back in may i was once again absolutely flummoxed when i stumbled upon an application called moises and to this day i'm still as impressed by its functionality the app will analyze any music track you upload to it mainstream or otherwise and then somehow isolate each of the different elements within that song and place them on their own individual layers so the vocals the drums the bass line and any other instrument will get split up and this means you can then solo or mute any of them or even just lower the volume of them individually as well and like this is something that even advanced pieces of audio editing software can't do so super impressive back in may just as impressive today now since featuring it on the channel hands-free music is no longer available on the google play store but it's not really all that surprising when you learn of what it does so what does it do well a lot of things but the standout feature is that it lets you search across every single song on the youtube platform simply via lyrics just tap the microphone say as many of the lyrics as you know and it will instantly start playing the most relevant song i guess the fact that it uses youtube's audio library might have been a contributing factor who knows but you can still download the apk file which i've of course linked below okay so when android 12 was first announced the headline feature was material u and since then there have been a stack of kwgt widget packs that have come out that kind of emulate this feature the best of the bunch that i showcased this year was the aptly named android 12 widget pack for kwgt it now has a huge selection of 136 beautifully designed android 12 inspired widgets the key feature for me is that the widgets are programmed to change their color palettes based on your chosen wallpaper very cool another app that i no longer use but that really impressed me at the time was life ar this is a video chat application that allows you to interact with other people on the other line using augmented reality so you can insert pointers or sketch marks or even notes and this has the potential to really level up how we communicate via video chats love the concept and the execution is pretty damn spot-on now believe it or not it's actually pretty rare that an application featured in a top hat's video will go on to become an app i end up using every single day but notes nook somehow managed to do so this is a beautifully designed note-taking application that i've mentioned several times on the channel this year and that's because along with that incredible design it also features online syncing support which is a must-have feature form as i said i use this app all the time and so accordingly i can highly recommend it all right before we press on just wanted to give a huge shout out to today's video sponsor friendspire friendspire is an incredible app that provides you with highly personalized recommendations for movies tv shows books and even podcasts and if you've ever heard of imdb or goodreads it's kind of like both of those platforms in one but then even better now when you first launch the app you'll be asked to enter some genre preferences and then to write a few titles and this is how the app starts the process of learning your tastes to start personalizing content recommendation from there the entire home page is personalized for you but this horizontal picked for you carousel at the top is where the app places content it's 99 certain you'll really like you can then click on any title to open up its dedicated page and this will allow you to view trailers overall ratings or additional details like what actors are in the movie and you can even see suggestions for similar titles which is really helpful all of your own ratings can be found over on your profile page and as you've probably no doubt already picked up on the entire app is user-based so you can actually also follow other users and see their recommendations as well the app itself is completely free and it really is a fantastic option for discovering new content so i highly recommend that you check it out using the first link down in the description below okay darkenator is an app that will automatically change your phone's wallpaper depending on what the system theme is set to so if you have a beautiful bright wallpaper that you love using throughout the day that then becomes a little too bright at night this app is the perfect solution you just use it to set your light theme wallpaper and your dark theme wallpaper accordingly and then the app will automatically switch between the two whenever your phone's system theme changes problem solved what i love is that the app doesn't require any permissions to be granted and because of how well it works this is an app i'm actually still using another app i use nearly every single day is snap drop this app is one of a few android clients for the free and open source file sharing solution snapdrop.net but if you've ever wished airdrop was a feature available on android or windows devices this app is probably the closest you'll ever get you simply download the app then navigate to snapdrop.net and any devices in the near vicinity will instantly be recognized then on either device you select a file and boom it opens on the other device and you don't need to sign into any account or install a third-party extension and it also works on ios devices as well amazing all right after that is sky tonight and this is a really cool application that i did use for a little bit after i featured it because my son was really into the night sky at the time the app uses augmented reality to basically place a constellation overlay on top of the actual sky this means as you move your phone around you can actually learn about the various objects you're seeing whether that be constellations astronomical events or even just what a particular bright dot in the sky is super cool app really fun to use highly recommend another really fun application that i don't use regularly but that i can see being helpful in the future is water resistance tester this is an app that will use your phone's barometer to see whether it's water resistance is still intact which might be handy if your phone is getting a bit old or if it's been damaged at all and whilst it's obviously never going to be a 100 guarantee in all of my own testing it absolutely worked really impressive stuff now adapticons is actually an application that i've used very often throughout 2021. it basically allows you to create your own customized icon packs within just a few clicks but for me the key feature that i love to use it for is for creating icons by importing images that i've either created myself or that i've downloaded from the web and then once you've created your icons you can then export them as an apk file which can be installed like any old icon pack and that means you can then use them seamlessly with your home screen launcher of choice and actually goes really well when used in conjunction with another application i featured really recently called icon pack mixer this app will show you a list of every application installed on your phone alongside corresponding icons from any icon pack installed on your phone so let's say you largely want to use an actual icon pack downloaded from the play store but there's a couple of icons you've created using adapter cons you want to sub in well with icon pack mixer you can pick and choose these as you see fit and once done like adapticons you'll be able to export your mixed up icons as an apk file once you install that if you're using a launcher that supports third-party icon theming the up icon pack will show up just as any old icon pack shows up and when selected it will apply all of those icons accordingly very neat but changing things up a bit and a really cool app i recently showcased but no longer use was media bar to keep it short this application transforms your phone's status bar into a media playback controller whenever you've got any media playing the progress of that media will become visible somewhere on your status bar depending on how you've set it up but even more than that you can actually even scrub through whatever is playing by swiping left or right so even though i no longer use this app i'll still find it super cool and worthy of a place in today's video now i've featured a number of budget manager applications on the channel over the past few years but without question one of my favorites is the recently featured ivy wallet aside from the functionality which is exactly what you want and need out of a budget manager application for me the real talking point is the super impressive design and ui if i'm going to manage my finances using an application on my phone i want to do it in style and so ivy wallet fits the bill beautifully all right second to last is retropod and whilst i might not personally listen to offline music anymore somehow this app kind of makes me want to as you can see the app emulates the old ipod devices from many years ago and the experience is super convincing particularly if you're using a device that has an oled display with small bezels i reckon it genuinely looks like a real ipod well worth a shower and so finally we have launcher 12 which is my main home screen launcher on my pixel 6. and the main reason for that is that this version of launcher has been updated to work with quick switch on router devices running android 12. and so because my pixel 6 is in fact rooted that means i'm able to set it as my phone's default home screen launcher which gives it full access to the gestural navigation system that means animations remain intact the overview page feels as fluid as it should and it really is a game changer if you're a fan of customization but that my friends is it those were my favorite apps of all of the apps i featured throughout 2021 and as mentioned i've got a stack of promo codes to give away so a huge shout out to all of the developers on screen right now as they were all very kind in agreeing to give me promo codes to give away to you lot this time around as mentioned i'll be releasing half of the codes over on twitter and the other half over on my instagram stories in the next few weeks so make sure to follow me both on twitter and instagram to have the best chance at claiming one of the many codes on offer you can check out all of the links to the apps i mentioned throughout the video including today's sponsor friendspire down in the description below and as always let me know which apps were your top picks throughout the year and who knows maybe they'll be featured on the channel in 2022. aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
