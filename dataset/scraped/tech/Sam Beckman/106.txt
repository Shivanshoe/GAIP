welcome to 10 android applications that you might just want to check out this month let's get straight in buzzfire is another one of those customization based apps that's main job is to give you all of the latest news and developments on anything related to customization now i've featured similar apps like buzzfire on my channel in the past and the idea is that if you're in the market for some new theming related apps whether that be wallpapers icon packs or widget packs well this app has got you covered it'll alert you to any new updates these types of apps receive or even just when new apps are added to the play store as well and what's really cool is that it will also let you know when any of these types of apps are hosting a giveaway i think what makes buzzfire so great though is its design a truly beautiful user interface that will make staying on top of everything customization related a visually pleasing experience now the android 12 icon pack was one such app that i saw in the buzzfire application and as soon as i saw it i just knew that i had to feature it so this icon pack is fresh off the press newly released to the play store and as the name indicates it takes its design cues straight from the android 12 screenshots that we saw a few weeks ago that hinted at a fairly large ui overhaul in the next software update from google so the icons are all circular in shape and they come in either this cream white or soft beige colorway and there's already over 850 custom icons supported plus the masking for unsupported icons is really solid now the developer of this app has been kind enough to give me 20 free promo codes which i'll be releasing over on twitter this month so make sure that you're following me over there to have the best chance of claiming one of those codes speaking of really nicely designed apps productive is a habit tracker application that is for those looking to build healthy routines into their day-to-day lives the app will provide a bunch of suggestions for you straight out of the box like learning a new language or reading a book but then you can obviously create your own habits based on your own unique goals that will then send you notifications at predetermined times of the day or at times that you tell it to this will help you to stay productive with the tasks and goals that you've laid out canary mail is a third-party email client that provides a pretty nice alternative to the more popular email apps so firstly this is a universal email application which means you'll be able to load in any and every email address that you might own but then from there it also offers features like end to end encryption read receipts smart notifications and it even has composed suggestions to match what google is doing within the gmail app and that list of features barely scratches the surface it really is a super powerful email app client with a pretty nice design as well now tide is a pretty popular application that you may have heard of already but if you're looking to bring some relaxation into your life then this could be just the solution it's got four main modes depending on what you're looking to use the app for focus which is for those needing help to focus on one particular task or activity for a set amount of time sleep for helping you to fall asleep quicker and also wake up more naturally in the morning not for taking a quick sleep in the day and breathe which is a relaxation breathing guide designed to help you learn how to breathe calmly and more steadily the app will then play a range of different ambient sounds all of which will help to keep you calm and focused on the goal that you've set out [Applause] it's a great app and it's definitely worth checking out [Music] you ever find yourself waiting somewhere perhaps in line to order a coffee you're having a quick scroll on your phone you find an article that you really really want to read but now it's your turn to order well that's where article reader offline comes into play this is an app that as the name so helpfully implies allows you to save articles for later reading you simply share the article you're interested in to the article reader application and that's it you can also customize how the articles look within the app and there's also an export to pdf option plus a speech to voice service if you want the app to read the articles allowed to you and the great thing is that it's completely free to use all right ratio launcher is a home screen app that's been doing the rounds lately and i have to say i really appreciate its minimal and no-nonsense approach so the launcher has three main screens the tiles view where you can access all of your apps each of which have been automatically sorted into their own smart categories as well then there's the root screen which is kind of like the google discover page only a little less cluttered and more minimalistic and finally the tree page which is still in beta keep in mind but it's essentially designed so that you can view all of your messages on the one screen it's a really cool concept that i can see a lot of people digging but then amoled papers is a wallpaper app that is perhaps better suited to those who enjoy the more traditional methods of customizing our phones as the name implies the wallpapers in this app are all designed to make the most of phones that have an oled display and this means that each of the backdrops have pure black elements scattered throughout which helps to save your phone some battery life but what i also really like is that it combines that principle with pops of vibrant color meaning just because it's saving you some battery life doesn't mean it can't look fun at the same time the wallpapers themselves look outstanding so if you're after a fresh backdrop to spice up your phone's home screen then you can't go wrong with this app the developer of this app has also been kind enough to give me some promo codes which as above i'll also be releasing over on twitter all right remind me is a very practical application designed to make setting reminders an outrageously easy thing to do you simply title the reminder set its priority and then from there you can select whether you want it to be a persistent reminder that is one that you can't dismiss from your notification panel a saved reminder that stays visible within the app or a scheduled reminder for recurring tasks the feature that i really like is the quick settings toggle which allows you to quickly send a reminder to your notification shade just from the tap of a single button and last but certainly not least floor plan creator is exactly that an app that lets you create floor plans now it's not the most elegant of uis and it can be a bit finicky to get a detailed floor plan set up correctly but just like a lot of these types of apps it does get easier with practice and the amount of control that you have to really dial in an accurate floor plan with every sort of room size and structure you can think of is really impressive if you haven't yet checked out episode one of my new renovation series then i'll leave a link up in the cards and down in the description below but this is an app i can really see myself starting to use more and more as we continue working on our house but that's it if you enjoyed the video then a sub would be super appreciated and don't forget to follow me over on twitter to have a chance at claiming one of the promo codes on offer from the apps featured in today's video aside from that thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you [Music] later you
