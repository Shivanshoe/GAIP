it is kitchen time so we bought a house actually we bought it a few years ago now and since then we were just trading it as an investment property renting it out while we were living here in sydney but we've decided to do the place up and move in and of course i wanted to document the process so in this brand new series i'm going to unpack each step of the renovation process and talk about how we saved a heck of a lot of cash along the way as well as some of the mistakes that we made that hopefully you can avoid in your own renovations today's episode is all about the kitchen we're going to unpack every strategic decision that we made to transform what was a pretty dated kitchen into something much more modern and elegant looking so here was our plan we were going to paint the cabinets with a clean and simple coat of white cabinetry paint remove the old handles and replace them with new ones the old range hood would be updated with a new one the existing light fixture had to go and the plan was to replace this with three hanging pendants above the bench top we were also going to remove the existing bench top and replace it along with the splashback with something much more modern and that suited the new white color palette oh and the floors were also going to be covered with new laminate floating floorboards throughout the entire kitchen and living area along with the back room as well so we'll cover that update in this video as well let's get to it now as i mentioned in episode one of this series we could have spent ten thousand dollars on brand new kitchen cabinetry which definitely would have yielded a really nice end result but we were looking to save money wherever possible with this renault so in terms of the cabinets as mentioned we decided to paint instead and this meant that instead of spending ten thousand dollars we spent closer to three hundred so with that in mind it was time to start prepping the cabinets now prepping involves cleaning all of the cabinets as best as possible trying to get rid of every single mark that you can and then you sand the idea is that you're just looking to roughen up the surface to give the paint something a little nicer to grab onto then we applied this renovator series primer from dulux surprisingly it was a clear product but it's designed to let the top coat paint stick a little better would i recommend it maybe but that said we did end up having to do four coats of top paint which i think could have been lessened by one if this primer actually had some white color to it already but once that primer was dry we got to slapping on the first coat if you've ever painted before then you know the process someone's got to do the cutting in and someone's got to do the rolling we actually ended up using these really nice mini rollers that were perfect for this type of job and resulted in quite a nice finish at the end what was also handy was that because we were painting before the new flooring and the new benchtop were installed we could afford to be a little more haphazard and didn't have to worry about spilling paint inadvertently so after coat one was done it looked like this pretty woeful if you ask me but you never judge a job off the first coat so the next day with coat one all dry and ready to go we were on to coat number two and then it looks like this a bit better but still clearly in need of another coat so off we went and this is the trouble when going from such a dark color such as that brown we had to such a light color or in this case white it'll take lots and lots of coats to really hide that original color which can be brutal so here's what it looked like before we started painting and here it is now with coat number three completed now i kind of thought maybe it was done but then when i returned a week later i decided to go with one final coat so that's a pretty whopping total of four coats plus the primer but then it was well and truly done okay from there it was time to remove that awful splashback and this quarter round trim that was lined in the benchtop and then from there that's when i got the professionals in so at the start my wife and i were very unsure as to what type of benchtop to go with you've got all sorts of options that suit all sorts of budgets and whilst we were initially thinking of going with a laminate timber look we ended up deciding to go with 20 mil quantum quartz ask anyone who doesn't already know and most people would assume that quantum quartz is just caesar stone it looks and feels pretty much identical but it's about half the price but i think the real banger of an idea was what we did with the splashback we were originally thinking glass or maybe even timber but once we decided to go with the quantum quartz benchtop we thought yep let's have it run right up the wall and act as the splashback as well so with the professionals working away on measuring decommissioning cutting and installing the new benchtop it was time to get the flooring done now we've always wanted light timber floorboards and as i mentioned in episode one we ended up paying a professional to do this in two days as opposed to trying to do it myself for two weeks i also had my electrician come in to remove this awful awful original light fixture and install three rattan pendant lights over the benchtop we bought these ourselves online after some shopping around and that helped to save a little bit of money and then the last step of the puzzle were those door handles we ended up going with matte black squared off handles which all up cost around 50 bucks from a local hardware store for 20 handles in total and so with the new handles installed the original benchtop and splashback removed and disposed of and the new one measured up and installed a kitchen that originally looked like this transformed into this [Music] [Applause] you can see what a difference it makes even just slapping on a fresh coat or four of paint and that new quantum quartz bench top looks a million bucks i think you'll probably agree that it was the right decision to have that bench top float onwards and up onto the splashback area as well it just really modernizes this entire area and is a severe improvement compared to that piddly little splashback that was there prior now those new floors were also one of the serious game changes about the entire house renovation it cost just shy of five thousand australian dollars to get these supplied and installed and that is money well spent in my book it just really brightens up the entire house and helps it feel even more open particularly given that it now flows from the front living area into the kitchen and dining space out the back we're also big fans of these new rattan pendant lights definitely a huge improvement over the light fixture that was previously in this space and the best part of all is that we came in right on budget painting the cabinets ourselves as well as installing all the new handles really helped to save a big bucket load of cash and the electrician who installed the pendant lights was also the same guy working on the garage conversion out the back so that helped to save some money as well the two big costs were the new benchtop and splashback which cost around four thousand five hundred dollars for supply and install as well as the new flooring which cost four thousand eight hundred dollars with the extras for paint and door handles as well as some additional costs here and there we landed right on that initial budget of ten thousand dollars and for that amount of money we're really happy with the end result and so that's it that's the kitchen and flooring complete in the coming episodes we will unpack the other bigger parts of the renovation including that garage conversion out the back which i'm positive that you'll love so if you're not already hit that subscribe button and that little
