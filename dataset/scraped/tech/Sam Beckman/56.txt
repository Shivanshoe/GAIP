all right team we have the galaxy zedfold 3 in the house and just quietly i've been super excited to check this device out ever since the announcement from samsung a few weeks ago now i know what you might be thinking isn't it pronounced z fold 3 well yes in parts of the world it is but here in australia we pronounce it zed so we'll press on with that for the remainder of this video now back in march of this year i did an in-depth six month later review of the previous iteration of this device to fold too and whilst i had lots of good things to say about that device there were a couple of areas that i thought could be improved and when i saw all the changes that were brought about with this new version i thought by golly samsung may have actually listened but i'm getting ahead of myself so let's rewind a little bit back to just after the phone was delivered and unboxed the thing oh and a huge shout out to optus for sponsoring this video we'll chat a bit more about them a little later on but with that out of the way let's get unboxing okay so the box itself has this pretty nice two-toned finish which i quite like but once we open the box up straight away we are greeted with the fold three in its open state we'll move that to one side for a moment and from there we also get a little envelope which when opened reveals some documentation a sim ejector tool and a usbc charging cable and that is it nothing too surprising all right let's get all that plasticky goodness off the device [Music] and with that the fold three is unboxed and ready for action now to be clear this video is just an unboxing and first impressions video but i will be working on an in-depth review that will come to the channel in the next month or two so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss out when that goes live but let's take a quick look at version three of this new foldable device from samsung and see how it differs from the fold too so there's a few key upgrades that have been made to the zed fault 3 that i want to point out in particular the first of which is this cover display for reference the cover display on last year's fold 2 was 60 hertz but because the main display was that big beautiful buttery smooth 120 hertz panel it actually resulted in quite a jarring contrast anytime you switch back to using the cover display and so with the fault 3 the cover display is now 120hz as well which is fantastic now another really promising upgrade that i think will significantly improve the experience of using this phone is app continuity i actually found it a little bit tricky to predict what was going to happen to my apps when i opened or closed the fold 2 but now with the fault 3 this has been improved further to make the experience just that little bit more seamless excellent as well as that back in my review of the fold 2 i did mention that some apps didn't fill up the main display completely but samsung has addressed this by adding in a new setting that we can adjust called customize app aspect ratios you can find this under the lab section and we can use this function to essentially adjust any apps that have yet to be optimized for the size of the main display to fill it completely just keep in mind this is a new feature so it won't work for every app yet okay from there we have the cameras and on paper it looks as though they are the same cameras that we had on last year's fault two but even with that being the case i'd say they still hold up here in 2021. obviously i'll need to spend more time using the cameras over the next little while to really form a solid opinion on them but for this video i thought it could be fun to do a very quick camera test whilst i thank today's video sponsor optus now to kick things off we're starting with the cover screen selfie camera so if you've been liking the sound of the galaxy zed fold 3 and you want to get your hands on one yourself then a great way to do so is with optus okay now over to the main camera and the best part is that with optus pay you can pick it up on one of their great value plans and pay it off over a 12 24 or even a 36 month period completely interest-free plus you get to enjoy loads of data and optus's best network ever and finally the ultra wide lens optus phone plans come with high speed 5g access and a 5g price match guarantee so if you see a better upfront price of the samsung galaxy zedfold 3 in australia they'll match it all right let's get out of the rain head back to the studio to wrap this up so again if you've been thinking about picking up the fold three or really any new device then check out the first link down in the description and sign up to a new plan with optus today all right but moving on from the cameras and the last thing that i want to make mention of in this video is the design it's not a radical change over the fold 2 but it just feels even more refined it's actually ever so slightly thinner and lighter compared to the fold two which is always nice and it now even has an ipx8 water resistance rating which is super impressive i also love this satin finish on the back of the phone it feels amazing in the hand and i kind of wish all manufacturers would adopt this exact finish on their own phones now there are plenty of other features that i haven't touched on in this video including the battery life and this under display camera on the main display but i'll leave comments on these plus everything else for the full review after i've had a bit more time to really put it to the test and so aside from that let me know down in the comments below what you want to see addressed in the full review but that's it thank you all very much for watching thank you to optus for supporting the channel and i will catch you later [Music] you
