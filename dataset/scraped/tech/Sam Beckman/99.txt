so as a channel that largely focuses on phones and applications it probably won't surprise you to hear that i get tons of emails every single day from people insisting that i check out their app and to be honest in most cases i do i'm always on the lookout for fresh and exciting apps and oftentimes the suggestions coming into my inbox are actually really good ones you do of course get your dads as well but it doesn't take long to decipher the good from the bat but one email recently caught my attention because it talked about a brand new concept for a social media application that i hadn't heard of before and that really doesn't happen all too often anymore so the app in question is called fly and full disclosure i did actually agree to partner up with flyer to showcase their app on my channel and so today that's exactly what i'm going to do so let's dive in all right let's cover the basics as i said fly is a new social media app and what makes it unique is that it utilizes actual cities and locations presented in the form of a 3d map so in practice this allows you to engage with other users of the app whether that be individuals or communities or even businesses based on locations let me explain so in fly every location is what you could call a social hub and each of these hubs has its own timeline so when you're using the app anytime you go to a specific location or hub you can check in and provide updates and you can share your experience of your time at that particular hub flyer is all about the stories at these locations you can explore cities and view what people in your network have gotten up to as they've explored these locations and then you can share your own experiences too so here are the main functions within the fly app firstly you have city indicators so as you scroll and roam through your chosen city you'll start to see building indicators that will show where your friends are your favorite or styled locations and you'll also see hotspot locations that have been getting a lot of hits lately which means they might be worth checking out yourself from there we have friend highlights you can find this by clicking this little icon down the bottom left here and this page will show all of the highlights related to your friends based on their recent activity now all good social media platforms have ways to share photos and videos and there are two main ways to do that in the fly app the first is by tapping on any building or landmark and this will open up its existing timeline from there you can upload or capture your own photos or videos as well as add in a description and this page is also where you can interact with other users activities as well the second is through what are called pins this is similar to the aforementioned method but instead of just tapping on existing landmarks or buildings you can instead just select any location by tapping on this big blue icon down here and then selecting whichever location you so desire so if you're going for a walk in the park or you saw some cool street performer you can then pin it and share your pictures and videos instantly all right from there we have starring this is where you can favorite locations by starring them and the app will then collate all of these starred locations into a list categorized by cities for easy selection in the future you can also use the check-in feature to quickly let friends know where you are and then you can also view all of your own app interactions in your profile's post journey and you can access this by tapping on your profile picture and then show my post journey we also have the search bar which allows you to search for any user location or hashtag and you can also share your posts to any other social media platform with a generated story link and share page that is well designed what's really exciting is that flyer is still super new and it's evolving and being updated all the time so it's a really fantastic opportunity to jump on board now and be one of flies earliest adopters the team has asked me to encourage you to share feedback directly within the fly app by tapping on the mail icon down here and really do let them know of any ideas that you have that might make the app even better oh and if you're an early adopter it also means you get to secure that username that you love using across all of your socials beyond all of that the app itself is completely free no hidden trial periods no features hidden behind a paywall and no ads so if you're interested in giving it a go and checking it out then you can do so using the first link down in the description below and once you've signed up don't forget to share your profile with your instagram followers and maybe put your username down in the comments below as well that way we can start building a really solid platform for this new social media app to start gaining some traction aside from that hopefully you found this video helpful thank you all very much for watching thank you to the team at flyer for supporting the channel and i will catch you later you
