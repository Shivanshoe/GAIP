[Music] oh no oh no oh no it's been way too long since i've posted a customization video on my channel and for that i'm sincerely sorry i'm sure for a lot of you that may have been the reason that you subscribe to this channel in the first place but here's the deal if i'm being completely honest i kind of just got a little bit tired of that same old format and so we're switching things up starting today well this video is just a serious announcement but it kind of counts anyway roll the intro okay so as you can tell by the name of this video and the intro itself we're changing up this series now there's this legend called zimri mayfield who has this really fun series on his channel called redesigning your logos and if i'm being completely honest i'm kind of addicted to it and i thought hmm maybe i could do this on my channel except instead of logos i could do home screen setups so look full credit to mayfield for this entire series idea i'll link him below so definitely go and show him some love but this series will follow a very similar format i'm going to take your submissions and offer some constructive critiques but not only that i'm actually going to also download the setups and load them onto my phone and then walk you through how i would go about changing them to hopefully improve their aesthetics and their functionality it should be a really fun series i'm hoping that you guys will enjoy it as well who knows we may only end up doing one or two episodes i'm not committing to anything just yet we'll see how things pan out as we go along but at the very least i'm super excited for episode one which should be coming very soon oh rules rules yes okay so in short i'm not creating a new email address you can still submit your setups to the email listed below and i'll assume you're cool with me featuring and critiquing your setups in these episodes and you still need to send me links to backup files screenshots links to wallpapers icon packs and widget packs all that good stuff so that i can download and load your setups onto my phone all right that's it keep your eyes peeled in the coming days for episode one of this brand new series but aside from that thanks for watching and i'll catch you later [Music] you
