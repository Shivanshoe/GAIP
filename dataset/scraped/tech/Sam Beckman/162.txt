so something my wife and I have always wanted in our apartment or in our house or wherever we've been living at the time has been a robot vacuum there's a lot of you may or may not know I'm a little bit of a neat freak and so just the fact that you can have a device ready to clean up after you without you having to do anything at all is something I'm seriously on board for now running a tech based YouTube channel has opened up lots of cool opportunities particularly the way of receiving some new and exciting tech products and so when the team at Robo rock reached out to partner up for a video I was definitely interested it's like a quick disclaimer when a company reaches out and asked to sponsor a video on the channel two things have to take place the first is I have to actually like the product and consider it to be something that I would genuinely recommend to my audience to you guys before I agree to letting them sponsor a video on my channel the second is that a company can't actually pay me to review a product strictly speaking so what that means is I'm happy for a company to reach out and sponsor a video in exchange for me featuring their product in a video and highlighting it to my audience if it fits that first criteria of me actually liking the product but they can't pay for my opinion they can only pay to have their product featured in a video on my channel and so any opinion that I express within a video sponsored or not will always be my own this is something I've been developing my philosophy on over the last few years and there are still refinements being made but hopefully that sets the framework for the following video and any future video that is sponsored on my channel but with all of that being said let's now jump into the Robo Rock s5 max now as I was doing research for this video or someone upon the huge world that is robot vacuum reviews and comparisons which I found super fascinating by the way but I've barely wanted to find out how the Robo Rock s5 max was different to the other vacuums in Robo Rock's lineup but also what differentiated it compared to its competitors so firstly these latest Robo rocker vacuums have numerous software and hardware working together to make these vacuums better than ever this Robo Rock s5 Max for example has a 32-bit quad core processor which is actually the same processor found in a of modern smartphones this bigger brain allows for some really impressive features including one that's called partition sweeping so robot vacuums work off mapping your room but the s5 max is really intelligent in this regard and that it understands the various rooms in your house with all of their different shapes and obstacles and then it uses that intelligent mapping information to determine the most efficient way to work its way around your house without missing a single area of the floor so that means the vacuum can make the most of its already impressive battery life which allows for up to three hours of non-stop continuous cleaning you can also set up custom partitions using the companion app which means you can tell the vacuum where you want it to clean and also set up no-go zones which the vacuum will then super accurately avoid the s5 max doesn't just pull off this impressively accurate navigation performance using that 32-bit quad-core processor alone but also does so using lidar this is actually the same technology used in Apple's most recently released iPad pro and it's also rumored to be included in the iPhone 12 that's going to be released later this year but if you're unfamiliar with what lidar is it's essentially a laser rangefinder now the s5 max this laser spins at 300 rpm which allows the vacuum to create a 360 degree scan of your room really quickly and in doing so creates a 98% accurate floorplan map using that data you can then set up schedules for the vacuum to clean your house whether that be one room at a time several rooms or the entire house what I really love is that you can set it up so that it starts up and starts cleaning your house once you've left which is really helpful I am particularly excited for this is having an 18 month old kid who seems to be obsessed with buttons and anything that moves around we are now able to leave the house and go for a walk and then the vacuum will automatically start up and start doing its thing and then we can return a little while later to a home that is and span as well as that the s5 max has now been upgraded so that it has an electric control water tank for its impressive floor mopping functionality Robo Rock vacuums have had mopping functionality in the past but this is the first Robo Rafa vacuum with an electric control water tank which means you can control the water output level using the app rather than just relying on gravity like the other models the tank is also significantly larger than other models coming in at 290 Miller litres and so again this is just another one of those features that is seriously impressive on top of all of that the vacuum has an intelligent recharging feature meaning if it gets partway through a clean and it needs to recharge it will determine how much power is required to complete the clean and then it will start cleaning as soon as it reaches that required level and then only once the clean is completed but then returned to fully recharged this means your house gets cleaner faster which I'm all about now even though this video is sponsored Robo rock are not paying me to tell you that this vacuum is seriously impressive that is just my honest opinion the price will vary depending on the market that you're in that there's no skirting around the fact that this is an expensive vacuum and if there's one downside to this vacuum it's the price that's it if you are in the market for a robot vacuum Robo rock have flexed every single muscle in the book and have created just about the perfect one so if you have the money for it then you definitely won't be disappointed and if you don't believe me then check out a seriously informative review made by the team over at vacuum Wars which are we'll link to down below this topic is their bread and butter they test vacuums inside and out all the time and they have arrived at a very similar conclusion so again make sure to check out that video if you haven't already aside from that if you want to learn more about this vacuum and score a 10% off discount and you can do so using the first link down in the description below but that's it hopefully found this video helpful thank you all very much for watching thank you Robo rock for supporting the channel and I'll catch you later [Laughter] [Music] you [Music] [Music] all
