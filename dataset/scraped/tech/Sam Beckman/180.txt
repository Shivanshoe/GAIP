so we're back with yet another episode of the best home screen setups episode five to be precise and of course we have three new setups to showcase in today's episode but before we get onto the setups I just wanted to quickly thank today's video sponsor Skillshare now we've only just ticked in to 2020 and so it's definitely that time of the year where we're all making commitments and resolutions and feel someone who's wanting to make this year the year of exploring new skills or furthering existing ones then Skillshare is definitely the place to do it we haven't heard of it yet Skillshare is this amazing online learning community that has thousands of classes across a wide range of categories including graphic design video editing and cinematography just to name a few a fascinating class that I've just started watching is called digital poster designs it's all about developing skills in combining imagery and typography to create visually stunning designs using Adobe Photoshop now to attend this sort of a workshop that goes into this level of detail in the real world would normally take at least half a day attending a super-expensive workshop and that's what makes Skillshare so great and why I so readily promote them on my channel is that it's been designed to fit in and around our super busy lives the fact that I don't have to put life on hold to watch a class and that I also get access to not just one class but thousands of classes for less than $10 a month is seriously amazing even better yet skill sheet is offering anyone who uses my link in the description two months of skill share for free so definitely make sure that you try it out and start exploring your creativity today and with that let's roll the intro click to get us into the episode we have a really nicely designed setup sent in by J this is a one page setup created using Nova Launcher it's quite simple to recreate as well so let's dive in and unpack what we've got going on that backdrop is just about as simple as you can get just a solid dark gray color that J created himself you could create one on your own if you feel up to it but for convenience sake J has also sent through the one that he made so it's of course been linked down below that is for widgets we have two on this home screen both taken from the foxy 4k WGT widget pack up towards the top right is a date/time and weather information widget widget zero six one and man does it just slot into the look of this set up perfectly the only thing to note here is that the widget originally had an app drawer icon included so this one has been edited to remove just that aspect down the very bottom to the right is an app drawer widget this is widget 0 4 7 and this one is actually the opposite to the aforementioned widget as it originally had a bunch of other information included within the widget but it's all actually been removed so that we're only left with the app drawer icon and I really like this implementation and then in the middle on the right we have a 3x3 set of 9 application icons each of which are using the lime line icon pack which looks phenomenal in my opinion it's almost as though this icon packs been specifically created to go perfectly with this setup and I also just wanted to show you how visually pleasing the app drawer is as well with this icon pack and how satisfying the color coordination is but that's it and on to setup number 2 all right this next submission is a three page setup sent in by siddharth it's a super colorful and vibrant setup made using nova launcher and it's one of those setups that will appeal particularly to those who really appreciate having lots of functionality on the home screen so starting with that wallpaper this has been sent through directly which is great although you do need to scale it up a bit when setting the wallpaper which means we can then move the colorful desk in computer vector up to the top half of the screen allowing us to have this nice white empty space at the bottom this thing gives us plenty of room to fill it up with app icons and widgets which is obviously what has been done really well here I actually think this wallpaper is the highlight of this setup it's got some real nice vibrancy to it and makes this setup look super unique on our first page is a date welcome message whether time and battery status widget all in one and this comes from the spiffy 4k WGT widget pack widget 15 is the one to look for there although you will obviously need to tweak the name but that simple black text looks really great against the white backdrop here super clean I like it a lot below that our for app icons each of which are using icons from the voxel icon pack which looks super nice particularly against that white background and then if we swipe over to the next page here we have an edited music player widget taken from the Sun and c4k wget widget pack and this is widget 79 the global colors for this widget have been customized so that they are black which ties in nicely with the previous widget and again helps to make it stand out on the backdrop and then swiping to the third and final page and here we have a really cool set of 20 app icons laid out in a five by four configuration and again these are using icons from the voxel icon pack although as you can see here there's a very intentional selection of apps and icons on show which results in this super pleasing color coordinated set of applications now not every app has a different colored icon available though so some compromise may have to occur to recreate this color coordinated set of app icons but aside from that it's a feature packed set up and definitely want to enjoy using on your own device so for our third and final setup for today we have a KL WP base setup which means it can be pretty easily implemented on most popular third-party launchers it's been sent in by Ralph it's an absolute cracker so let's take a look at what is used in this setup so on your home screen we've got so many different elements that it's really hard to know where to start but starting as always with the backdrop you can see here that Ralph has gone with a fairly muted and generic wallpaper we've got some blurred and fairly dim color balls scattered throughout the home screen and then we have this really thin line pattern visible over the top which just adds a nice layer of texture if you want just the wallpaper than a link to that has been included below from there up the very top on the left is a time widget and then over to the right is a battery status indicator widget and then just below that is a welcome message which you'll obviously have to go in and customize so that says your name or really whatever you want it to and then below that is the date and that is it for the top section below that is a set of eight application icons set up in a two by four configuration and if you like the look of these icons then the icon pack Ralph is used here is called the Juno icon pack which looks great now each of these applications have been preset within klw PE so if you want to customize the apps on show here you'll also have to go in and make those changes within KL WP below that are three labels each of which relate to corresponding folders filled with various applications the app icons within each of these folders have been taken from the glady and icon pack and again if you want to switch which apps are visible in these folders and you'll need to do so in KL WP and then right down the bottom is a music player widget and this can actually be triggered by tapping the listen now text which neatly opens up a sort of cover of your list of music that is currently playing and tapping on the upcoming and previous album art will take you to the next and previous songs respectively and that's really all there is to this setup and I use the phrase all the areas pretty lightly as there is actually quite a number of impressive elements included in this setup but aside from a few tweaks here and there with in KL WP it's actually a fairly simple setup to achieve on your own device aside from that that is it for episode 5 of the best home screen setups links to all the different assets you need including backup files warp papers applications and so forth have
