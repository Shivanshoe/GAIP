i mean oh my goodness 250 bucks for that about seven months ago i created a video on this channel titled i paid five developers to create an entire app for me the video was in partnership with the good folks over at fiverr and the goal was to essentially hire a bunch of developers to create an app i've always wanted to make but have never had the skills to do so and the results were really impressive now at the end of the video i mentioned that i was hoping to have the completed app live and on the google play store within the next few months but suffice it to say that never ended up happening see after that video went live i had a bunch of people commenting saying i had taken the wrong approach to ask the app developers themselves to also come up with the app's design and ui and that in the real world you would normally have a separate team whose sole purpose is to create the design of the app and then another development team who will turn that design into a functioning application and so i decided to go back to the drawing board and redesign the entire app ui myself and to cut a long story short i may have gotten a little excited adding in tons of new features and ui changes which is why we're still working on the app and actually while we're talking about the app let's take a really quick look at where it's currently up to so if you watched that original fiverr video you can see how things have been redesigned we now have a carousel interface swiping through all of the submitted setups we have various categories that we can switch between our setup details page has a fresh design and we also have a redesigned menu and setup submission page now for reference everything within this app is currently working as expected users can submit setups that can be approved within an admin version of the app we can log in with google and when we do the favoriting feature works as expected we also have search functionality working pretty well and there's also this new featured section which showcases setups from my best nova launcher setup series here on youtube so the core app is complete and in fact it actually entered into alpha testing a few weeks ago with a public release on the play store fairly imminent but then about a week ago the fiverr reached out again and asked if i'd be open to creating a new video for and the wheels in my head started turning and i thought this could be a really cool opportunity to not only address any current issues with the app but to also add in a stack of additional features we haven't yet had the time to implement and so the plan is pretty simple i'm going to create a generic message for our potential developers showing them the app in its current state and asking them to make as many improvements as possible i let them know i was giving them full creative control but i did also create a list of my own suggestions along with supporting mock-ups to help guide them if need be but then i told each of them i'd need the finished product within 21 days and then i sent that off to a bunch of developers and then after a bunch of going back and forth here are the five developers i've decided to go with all right starting things off we have sandip 2611 his page says he will develop android apps and fix bugs and he's a level two seller with over 50 ratings and a 4.8 star average which is really impressive and he agreed to work on my application for 157 bucks sold next up we have junaid underscore 51 his page says that he will develop premium android apps he's got 12 ratings and a 4.9 star average which is still pretty great going and he agreed to complete the changes for a grand total of 250 bucks from there we have a underscore a developers and this dude has a whopping total of 308 ratings with a 4.9 star average absolutely bonkers and so i was super happy he agreed to work on the project boom 280 second and last is sales park he has 38 reviews and a 4.9 star average which is nothing to sneeze at and he got the gig for 400 and the last but not least i wanted to give fiverr's custom request feature a go which is basically where your request gets posted to any eligible sellers who then essentially apply to take the job and after a stack of developers submitted their applications i ended up deciding to work with a developer named mike george this guy has 18 five star reviews although some of them are as a buyer but he does have 10 ratings as a seller but either way he seemed really keen on the job so he was locked in for 400 so those are the five developers i've decided to go with and for anyone wondering i've obviously sent each of them all of the necessary coding files and any other assets they might need but they're all now busy working away on making improvements to the app and i'm absolutely chomping at the bit to see what they all come up with alrighty folks it's judgement day through the magic of editing it is now three weeks after i first got in touch with the developers on fiverr and that means we finally get to review the finished products as with the last video i'm going to be ranking each version of the app to try and assess which one i'm most impressed with and what makes this comparison interesting is that unlike the previous video all of these developers had the same ui and mock-ups provided to them which should hopefully make picking a winner even easier that could come back to bite me though with that said to help simplify things just a bit i will split the ranking into two different categories firstly the amount of features added changes made and secondly how effective each of the implementations actually are that is have the changes actually improved the app or have they made it feel less polished [Music] let's begin [Music] all right first up is sandip just a reminder he cost 157 which is the cheapest of the lot so it'll be interesting to compare his work with the more expensive developers on this list all right so opening it up so the first thing that i notice is the category slider down the bottom again each developer got a mock-up with this category slider and it did look fairly similar to this so if we tap on one of those it goes yellow and we get the category coming up there we'll head back to our home screen animations so far are fairly similar to the one that i sent in but let's tap on one of these setups here ah okay so he's got okay so he's got this sort of scaled up animation here which i quite like the concept although the execution is still a little bit buggy as we tap on that you can see the screenshot sort of jumps around and then as we go back the outline of the phone also is a bit inconsistent as well but i like the idea so if we tap on the menu icon here oh cool he's uh he's implemented the pop-up interface rather than the full screen menu which i quite like ah he's also implemented that submission screen as a pop-up interface as well although there's a white bar at the top not too sure why that is the case but that works pretty well uh if we go to search we'll just type in nova this interface has changed slightly you can see we've got two columns there which i don't mind but the animations haven't really changed there but in reality that's all there is to it a few changes implemented i'm pretty impressed for 157 not too bad would i be able to publish this version to the play store no it still needs a bit of refining but again 157 hard to complain from there we jump up a bit in terms of price with junaid he was booked for 250 so let's see how he did all right so we'll open that up and uh oh yeah that's right i actually helped mock up these onboarding pages which this developer did implement so let's navigate through see that little bounce that happens i just love that makes an app feel so fluid tap on get started beautiful logged in and then we get to the main interface of the app you can see of course we still have that category slider down the bottom although it looks slightly more refined to my eyes at least let's tap on one of the setups ah really nice so you can see what he's done at the top there is that he's made it look like a bit more of a card interface and if we head back that sort of slides in and out as though it's coming on top of whatever the previous page was that looks really nice we've got a new icon at the top here to sort our setups uh into you know the oldest ones or we can go to the most viewed now if we tap on the menu here excellent he's put that into the pop-up interface as well so if i tap on that you can see we get the submit home screen not a pop-up interface but still he's got that card look to it which i quite like and if we scroll down here you can see we've got additional details and a place to insert a backup file from our local storage which is fantastic so we'll get out of that ooh really nice updated interface there for cancelling out of that process now if we go over to search you can see we also get options to sort the search here as well which is really cool let's type in blue and he's got search suggestions as well which is fantastic and if we tap the user icon down here he's added in a couple of key features that i was hoping to have in the previous version but that were just a little bit too tricky to pull off which are you know being able to see which setups have been approved and alive within the app and then also being able to see any setups that are pending one other feature that i know this guy was working on so i'm really keen to see how it turned out was updating this featured page so if i tap on that you can see instead of just having the different episodes from my best nova launcher setup series you can see we've now got my other series as well so the best home screen setups redesigning your setups and what's on my phone so if i tap on that that loads in the various episodes from my best home screen setup series which is different to the best nova launcher setup series tap on that watch this episode on youtube and i can see that he's also fixed the carousel here when we've only got three setups now it's actually showing the main setup in the middle and yes that is fantastic that he's managed to fix that because i think that was really hard to do i mean oh my goodness 250 bucks for that this is top shelf stuff from junaid i'm really impressed i don't know how the other developers are going to be able to top him excellent work you made so this next one is from a underscore a developers 280 bucks they cost so let's see how it stacks up i'll tap on the icon okay cool so uh he's also implemented the splash screen animation boom successfully logged in okay so again we can see that category slider down the bottom things do look a little bit different though but they're all there seem to be working let's tap on one no little yellow icon there but that's okay nice little bouncy animation though we'll go back tap on a setup here not much to the animation there sort of just fades in doesn't it we'll tap on that excellent he's also implemented the card style interface here for the main menu tap on the submit home screen menu and yes he's also implemented this in a sort of pop-up interface which is great we'll go to our user menu here no changes here you can see we've got this sort option up here although i think he told me that it's not actually working no search suggestions favorites that looks the same and so that's just about it in terms of the changes from a underscore a developers all right second last we have the sales park team for 400 which is a fairly decent price jump over the previous three so this will be super interesting to see how they've done all right let's open up the app okay so we've got a splash screen but uh no animation no login ui again similar story we've got the category slider down the bottom so my guess is that this is one of the easiest features to implement if we tap on one of these categories that animation is pretty much what we had in the original version so nothing too improved there tap on a setup okay he's kind of got the slide up but so far i'm a little bit nervous uh particularly when you compare this to junaid's version for 250 bucks nothing's changed here it's still the full screen menu that we had in the original version same thing here we do have a spot to add additional info which is good let's tap on the uh user icon here and go log in and this is actually quite new we have a login with facebook log in with google and the option to log in with an email so let me just uh register here and there we go okay so we've got a few other login options which is actually kind of cool and now when we tap on the user menu there we get public profile tap on that you don't have any approved setups which is not true i do actually have some pending setups nothing we've got the additional information icon down here so that's been implemented nice no search suggestions he does have a latest and oldest button here which looks to be working we'll go over to favorites yeah nothing's changed there and i think that's really all there is to it okay so finally we have mike this is also a team of developers and just a reminder this is the only developer of the lot that i worked with who was actually booked through the request feature on fiverr but right up front i do want to disclose that this developer actually came to me towards the end of the project and realized he couldn't achieve most of the improvements we'd initially discussed and so instead of retaining that initial 400 price tag he was kind enough to cancel that order and put forward a new one for 150 dollars which actually makes him the cheapest 12 of the lot but it also makes me very interested to see what improvements he was able to make all right so let's open it up and uh okay so we've got the login page that's good he's added powered by imake under my icon there which is a bit of self-promotion not sure how i feel about that let's tap on sign in signed in successfully excellent so we're in and okay not too bad so we've got the category slider down the bottom looks alright we'll tap on a setup here nothing different about this i'll tap on the menu icon here okay so he has put it into a pop-up interface but it's just sort of like a flat background with straight edges and there's this funny line down the bottom submit home screen okay no that that doesn't really work because he's got the menu bar staying on screen with that open which isn't really what's meant to happen and he's also just moved to the full screen interface as well so he hasn't been able to implement that pop-up interface uh interesting okay and uh the category slider has now disappeared which i guess is a bug is there any way to bring that back let's tap on the user profile here again just the same version that was sent through in the original version so is there any other changes how can i say that's kind of broken i'm tapping on all these different categories and nothing's changing okay so the category slider only works from the home screen so broken functionality limited amount of changes animations are all exactly the same as the version that i sent through yeah so uh when you compare it to the other versions i think the developer did the right thing by lowering his price to 150 because essentially he's added the category slider but it's half baked he's added a really simple splash screen with some self-promotion but aside from that that's about it [Music] okay so after taking a look at each version of the application and as we assess all of the final rankings no surprises here the clear winner is junaid who not only implemented by far the most amount of changes overall but he also did it in a way that i think really leveled up the look and feel of the app which can't be said for some of the other versions that were sent and so without question this is the new version of the app i'm going to be moving forward with i've actually already sent it over to my team of internal testers and there's still one or two minor issues we need to iron out but i'm hoping with all of my fingers crossed to have the app live and on the play store before the end of 2021 and so i'll of course pin a comment down below letting you know once it's up and live a big thank you to fiverr for sponsoring this video and for supporting the channel make sure you check out the first link down in the description to start getting your jobs completed or perhaps you might be someone who wants to instead sign up to fiverr as a freelancer and start selling your own services but that's it if you enjoyed the video then a sub to the channel would be fantastic but aside from that thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] [Music] you
