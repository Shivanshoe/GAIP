well well well look at what the cat has dragged back in okay look i'm not promising anything just yet but for now welcome to episode 26 of well you already know what it is because of the title but yes it is the series return of the best nova launcher setups roll that intro [Music] ah that felt good did it not i mean it felt good for me so here we are and i'll keep this short so we can get straight onto the setups but a quick explainer as to why i'm rebooting this series so for my channel at least this series was an absolute ball buster we're talking hundreds of thousands of views per episode and they're still gaining traction all these years later now i've trialled other variations of this series since then that haven't quite reached the same success as this series once did and who knows maybe this rebooted series won't reach the same heights either i do think we live in a different world now than when that series ended back in 2019 but hey i'm now doing this youtube thing full time and i've got more time on hand to sift through all of the submissions and load each of them onto my phone which does take some time and so with that said it'd be kind of remiss of me not to see if this series can reclaim even some of the success that the last iteration did so we're reopening submissions and even though this series is titled the best nova launcher setups you are still eligible even if you're using a different launcher if you've got a cool setup to submit then the rules from the previous series apply i need backup files i need wallpapers icon packs widget packs and custom widgets if you've got them and more than anything i need screenshots of the completed home screen setups if any of those items are missing then sadly i cannot feature your up in the series all those elements can be sent to the email address homescreen setups gmail.com and if you can include descriptions of how you've set things up as well anything that is going to make my life a little easier well then that would be an excellent bonus so essentially the same submission rules apply as the best home screen setup series so i'll leave that submission video linked down in the description below but with all of that said let's cut the intro and get straight onto today's three home screen setups all right starting things off our first setup today has been sent in by supin this is a lovely two-page setup we've got lots of colors on show which makes for great vibrancy so let's dive in and see what's involved now that wallpaper has come from the crayons icon pack which is really convenient as the icons themselves also come from this icon pack and i've got to say i really enjoy this wallpaper and eye compact combo as i said it makes for a really vibrant and eye-catching setup but it's not in your face and over the top oh and if you'd like a chance at claiming a promo code for the crayon icon pack then i'll actually be releasing some over on my instagram stories in the next couple of weeks so make sure that you go and follow me over there to have the best chance at claiming one of those codes but back to our home screen and this simple 5x2 layout of the icons on this first page here really helps to keep things fairly clean as does that wallpaper which has all of this negative space on the bottom half which is great for placing all of our icons and widgets as supine has done just quickly to show off this crown icon pack a little further just have a look at the app drawer here super nice coverage of icons and the masking of the unsupported icons is also top notch but then above our icons on the home page is a day and date widget this comes from the mini-ism for kwgt pack and it's widget 073 though keep in mind it has been edited very slightly and then over on our second page and super told me that he originally had a samsung calendar widget here but because i'm showcasing this on a oneplus phone i've loaded in a fairly similar looking calendar widget from the month calendar widget application itself that's all there is to this first setup i really enjoy the simplicity of it yet it's still a visually striking setup so a great one first up to get those customizing fingers dusted off and underway all right so second up is a very clean and elegant two-page nova launcher setup sent in by vaughan there's not an outrageous amount of elements going on with this setup so it should be fairly easy to recreate starting with that wallpaper now i don't know where it's been sourced from directly so if you recognize it please feel free to let everyone know down in the comments below but i do have the direct link to it in the description so that saves us a little bit of effort there but i think this wallpaper is one of the real highlights of this setup it's super minimal it's got a great color palette and it gives this setup some real character now on our main home page here there are two main components that widget at the top and the collection of icons down the bottom here starting with that widget this is a custom made widget that vaughn sent to me directly so again it's been linked below i'm not sure if it has come from any widget pack in particular but regardless it packs into time the date the day and the battery percentage as well all in a really nice and compact form factor now down the bottom is a set of 20 app icons laid out in a 5x4 configuration the desktop grid size is 13 by 9 by the way which is what allows these icons to be bunched up as much as they are but all of these icons come from the lights void icon pack which looks fantastic and then swapping over the second page this one is incredibly minimal potentially too much so in fact but down the bottom is another custom widget that vaughn sent through directly and it also has the day and date but what makes it different to the widget on the first page is that it also has this neat music player bar down the bottom if it was me i would probably add perhaps some other app icons onto the second page maybe even a folder icon to keep it looking clean but otherwise it's still a really nice overall setup and i've got to say i'm a fan and finally today we have this super unique two-page setup sent in by abhishek again created using nova launcher and this is essentially two completely different home screen setups for the price of one there is a little bit of complexity to getting this set up right so let's have a look at what makes it work right starting with those wallpapers so this first page's wallpaper is the actual real wallpaper for this setup which will make more sense in a minute and abhishek said that this one came from the wally application but i couldn't find it within the app when i looked for it so i do have a direct link for it down in the description below but if you do recognize this wallpaper please let us all know down in the comments below as the one linked in the description isn't of the highest quality now as we swipe over to the second page you'll notice that a new wallpaper shows up and this has actually been achieved via a full screen kwgt widget with the image you can see set at full size it's a pretty handy way of basically having two wallpapers in the one setup but keep in mind the actual wallpaper that you're using so this sunset one on the first page for example it does need to have a bar at the top that matches the color of the second wallpaper and you'll most likely need to disable the gesture navigation bar as well if your phone allows you to as otherwise you'll see the real wallpaper on the bottom and top of your setup okay but back to the first home page and this funky looking widget is actually an all-in-one assistant date time and weather widget plus those icons down the bottom are also packed within this widget and it's widget number 63 from the frizzy for kwgt pack oh and i'll also be giving away some promo codes for the frizzy for kwgt pack on my instagram stories keep in mind the global colors of this widget have been tweaked to match the colorway of the wallpaper all right from there and onto the second page and here we have a day time date weather and battery status widget this has been taken from the vibrant colors for kwgt widget pack and this one is widget 005 down the bottom right here are eight application icons laid out in a four by two configuration and these are using icons from the bubble gum icon pack which looks really nice great consistent design which will suit most home screen setups really beautifully oh and the bottom left icon here is actually a folder icon and so tapping on that opens up a folder filled with some social media applications all right last but not least taking a look at the app drawer and here we have a fairly clean yet dark vibe icons are again from the bubble gum icon pack which looks really nice here but that is it for this setup as i said a little bit involved to get it working correctly but hey two setups for the price of one definitely deserves a spot in today's episode and that's it now just like the good old days links to each and every asset that you need to load these setups onto your own devices have been included down below and if you're not even sure how to load these setups onto your device then there's a video down there for that as well oh don't forget if you're interested in picking up a promo code for some of the apps used in the setups today then make sure to go and follow me over on instagram and keep an eye out on my stories as i said at the start submissions are now open again so make sure that you check out the submission video also linked below but aside from that that is it thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
