so we are back with episode 29 of the best nova launcher setups and we've got three very creative and downright good looking setups that feature lots of cool elements of functionality throughout and all of which are actually pretty easy to set up as well and so actually you know what let's just roll the intro [Music] all right setup number one today is a beautifully minimal one-page nova launcher setup sent in by apay and as impressive as it looks it's also just about one of the simplest setups to recreate so let's dive in okay starting with that wallpaper and it is without a doubt the most striking element of this entire setup it's been taken from the crimson walls application and if you search for congo it should show up but there's something about the vibrant yet still pastel vibe of this backdrop that really does make this home screen stand out whilst not being too in your face i love it but it's also the way obay has balanced that backdrop with the layout of the icons and widgets on top that helps to make this home screen setup still visually pleasant the wrong widgets and icons here could have been absolute chaos but hey has chosen really nicely and it complements the backdrop beautifully so that widget in the middle there is from the terra kwgt pack it's widget 0-12 and it incorporates quite a bit of information up the top we have the time and date and then below that we have some battery status information but this is just the home page of this widget tap on these other tabs down here and the widget will change to show calendar information weather information as well as some music player controls which is really really impressive i mean this widget adds so much functionality to the home screen yet it's all contained within this beautifully minimal widget so a big thumbs up from me okay from there we have the icons we've got six icons in total on our home page they've been laid out in this staggered formation both on top and below the middle widget there and these icons are taken from the bubble gum glyphs icon pack which i think looks incredible super small which is my style and whilst they're still colorful they also have this pastel look to them which suits the backdrop to a t swiping up and into the app drawer nothing too special here really and so that's it for this incredibly sleek looking home screen setup from ebay now today's second setup is a really creative three-page setup sent in by melo apologies if i'm mispronouncing that i most definitely am but it's been created using launcher 2 but most of what you see within this setup has actually been made using klwp so a quick refresher klwp is a live wallpaper application and it lets you create interactable wallpapers that act like leveled up widgets and in some cases they act as even entire home screen launches and everything is usually contained within one single backup file which makes replicating these complicated setups really quick and easy as long as you have the backup file so with that said as you can see with melo's three page setup as we scroll to each of the different pages this entire widget up the top also changes so the main home screen is in the center and you can see we have a summary of information in this black box here including the date the weather and any media that's currently playing and a battery percentage indicator as well but we also have a mini status bar at the top a google search bar down the bottom and this funky abstract looking wallpaper as well and so you can kind of see what i mean when i say sometimes these klwpp presets are kind of like home screen launcher replacements in and of themselves now what's also really cool is if i tap this little hamburger menu icon here a couple of little controls animate out including a shortcut to the klwp settings page which is pretty handy and then this little icon is a dark and light mode toggle so if i tap on that the entire home screen changes to a light colorway so a really handy piece of functionality to this already impressive home screen setup now on the bottom of this middle screen here we have 10 application icons laid out in a 5x2 configuration these are actual icons they're not part of the klwp preset and they're using icons from the dual gifs icon pack which looks fantastic a couple of these icons also act as folders if you swipe up on them so again even more functionality hidden in this really impressive setup so from there if we swipe over to the left we have our weather page and as you can see the components up the top change over to more detailed weather information and down the bottom we have a lone weather icon which not only indicates what page we're on but it also takes us to our weather application of choice and then swiping over to the page on the far right and as you can see the little icon down the bottom changes to a spotify icon indicating that we're now on the music focus page so accordingly up the top all of our elements switch over to music player controls but again we can also launch into spotify using that icon down the bottom as well and that's the main portion of this entire home screen setup complete i'll quickly show you the app drawer as well it's also got that dark and minimal vibe to match the rest of the setup and actually no apps have labels which can take a little while to get your head around but we've also got a paginated app drawer layout which i quite like but aside from that that's it for this really fantastic home screen because melo has been kind enough to send through the klwp backup file it's actually one of the easiest setups to load onto your own phone and finally today we have a really simple one-page setup sent in by paulo this is for those of you who like to keep things super minimal and dark at the same time so with that being said let's see what is used to set this home screen up all right as always starting with that wallpaper and this one is very subtle you can kind of see a dark grey smoky texture if you look really closely and i quite like the subtlety of it and it certainly makes for an easy job when it comes to then laying out the icons and widgets on top now paolo said it was sourced from the wally application but i couldn't find it when i went searching for it so i've left a link to the direct file down in the description below now as for that widget up the top this is a time and date widget with a little accent of red throughout it's widget 129 from the wolfie for kwgt widget pack although keep in mind that the global colors have been modified then all the way down the bottom is a google search bar widget and this is also from the wolfy kwgt pack it's widget 112. the icons have been altered so keep that in mind and of course the color of the search text there has also been edited to match the widget at the top all right from there smack bang in the middle of our home page are six application icons laid out in a two by three configuration and these icons have come from the delta icon pack which i love always been a big fan of the delta icon pack so great to see it in use here aside from that swiping into the app drawer nothing too outrageous here very dark and minimal like the home screen itself so that's it for a very clean setup by paulo but aside from that that is it for today's episode as always links to each and every asset will be included down in the description below and let me know which setup featured in today's video was your favorite and why down in the comments below if you'd like to have
