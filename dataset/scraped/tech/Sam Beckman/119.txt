[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so this is the oneplus 8t now when a phone is in its initial release cycle there could often be a number of bugs that hang around and that impact a reviewer's experience of using sent phone and so two months after the oneplus 8t was initially released after a number of software patches i'm finally bringing to you my review of the oneplus 8t and let me say right up front this phone is nearly perfect let's chat about it in terms of design i've got to say this might be my favorite looking and feeling phone of 2020 but that strictly applies to the lunar silver model which is the one that i've got so with this model you get this beautiful matte and frosted finish on the back which looks and feels incredible and i really like the colorway as well it isn't this in your face blue that's become super common in smartphones this year it's much more subtle and in some scenarios as the name would suggest it actually looks more silver than blue which i think looks really pretty i even like the look of that freshly designed camera unit on the back as well and so overall it's just a really nicely designed back of the phone now aside from the back we also have glossy metal rails around the edges of the phone the buttons are incredibly tactile and clicky as they are on most oneplus phones and then what makes the phone even better from a design standpoint compared to the oneplus 8 pro released earlier this year is that flat display which just makes usability so much better in my opinion speaking of that display the 8t gets a bump up from the 90hz panel found on the regular oneplus 8 and now we have a 120hz panel which puts it right in line with the oneplus 8 pro in terms of speed and fluidity albeit with a slightly bump down screen resolution but you really cannot tell unless you're a pixel peeper as with all of oneplus higher end phones the 8ts display gets really nice and bright and whilst the colors do have that slightly over saturated look to them straight out of the box if you head into the display settings i've found setting the screen calibration to srgb has made it look much closer to the pixel flagship panels that i've always loved because of how they render colors so a really really fantastic display top shelf stuff for sure and i'm happy to report that speakers and haptics on this phone are also incredible you get that dual speaker set up with audio coming out from the earpiece as well as the bottom firing speaker and the haptics are right up there with the best if anything i would say that the haptics could actually be dialed back a little bit just to make them that little bit more subtle and i'm pretty sure this is something that could be addressed in software and whilst we're on the topic of software the oneplus 8t ships with android 11 and that actually made me a little bit nervous because oneplus infamously redesigned quite a bit of the oxygen os skin with the android 11 update and when i saw screenshots and videos posted online when it was first released a few months back i did not like what i was saying but believe it or not i've actually come to really enjoy this version of oxygen os in some parts of the ui it's not quite the oxygen os i knew and loved from prior to android 11 but it's also definitely not as bad as i once feared it's still far superior to samsung's one ui skin no offense samsung but the inclusion finally event always on display and a dark mode toggle in the quick settings they've been enough to actually make me really enjoy the software experience in fact given how superior the oneplus launcher is in regards to customization i honestly think the software is what could keep me using this phone as my main device going forward touching on performance for a moment and look in terms of specs this phone is stacked and the performance is ultra smooth really really nice experience and this is actually the first time that i've enjoyed using an in-display fingerprint sensor i took some of your advice on board and i actually enrolled my thumb twice and i think this has seen some serious improvements enough to make me actually enjoy having an in-display fingerprint sensor which is very much so a first for me now in terms of battery for a 5g phone running constantly at 120 hertz and keep in mind i'm a user who likes to set my display fairly brightly throughout most portions of the day i would say it's an a minus maybe b plus battery on average i'm getting five and a half to six hours of screen on time each day and i've never killed it in a day though i have gotten fairly close on one or two occasions so it's definitely not a more than one day battery for a user like me but a solid performer nonetheless now as expected with the non-pro versions of pretty much any oneplus device one of the biggest areas that leaves little to be desired are the cameras and i think my biggest gripe with the camera performance of the oneplus 8t is with how it captures images of people i'm someone who likes to take a lot of portrait photos of my kids or friends and family and i just find that the portrait photos taken on the oneplus 8t just have this sort of unrealistic but also somewhat unpleasant look to them now that said i've actually found that installing the gcam mod on this phone has improved the portrait photos situation considerably enough to make it almost a non-issue for me you can hopefully see on screen the differences in how the gk mod processes its portrait photos versus how oneplus processes them and i just vastly prefer how the gchem mod does it there is even a version of the gcm mod that allows you to access the ultrawide camera so i'll leave a link to that specific version down in the description below but aside from portrait photos and just general images of people the oneplus cameras perform really decently just make sure that you give the sensors a lot of light and you'll be able to capture some really impressive results if you're in any sort of scenario where there's less than optimal lighting conditions then that's where the images will start to fall apart but video also performs reliably well particularly from the main sensor and so really in conjunction with the gcam port i'm pretty well satisfied with the camera experience on this phone so there are two main features that are missing from the oneplus 8t because it's not their top end pro model and they are an ip rating and wireless charging so firstly an ip rating is kind of neat here nor there for me oneplus still puts in most of the protection that allows their pro models to get that ip rating with their lower end phones they just don't pay for the rigorous testing process and so this is kind of a non-issue for me but wireless charging for me is a missed opportunity and it's what takes this phone down just one peg from being pretty much the perfect phone for me now it's not a deal breaker but i would have loved it had oneplus thrown in even just a slow wireless charging coil and that's how they could have differentiated it from their pro models this one has slow wireless charging the other has fast happy days but sadly it's not here and i do think oneplus has missed a trick by not including it on this phone so with all things considered the oneplus 8t has actually become my new main device and it's the first phone of the year to finally convince me to switch permanently from last year's pixel 4 xl we'll see over extended use how i handle the slightly subpar camera performance but aside from that i'm feeling good vibes about this phone and if you're looking for an upgrade well this phone is a seriously good bet
