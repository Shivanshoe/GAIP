[Music] so this is the oneplus nord and this is the first truly budget-friendly device that oneplus has released in quite a number of years and that is something that excites me to no end but when we're dealing with a budget device there are always going to be inevitably a number of cuts that a company has to make in order to get that price down and so we as reviewers get to determine if the cuts they made with the right ones and whether or not we're still left with a phone that is good value for money so i've been using this phone for the past month and i've got some thoughts on the matter we'll start with what's great about this device where it feels like you get the most value and for me i think the best part about this phone is the display firstly it's still oled it's got that 90 hertz refresh rate which for me is that perfect sweet spot for a phone display where you really don't notice the difference coming from the 120 hertz panel found on the oneplus 8 pro and it gets really decently bright making it great for outdoor use and in what i would argue is functionally an upgrade over the 8 pro is that the nord's display is flat actually making it the first one plus device with a hole punch and a flat display now speaking of the hole punch here on the nord we actually have a dual hole punch cut out for two front facing cameras a standard and a wider lens but that extra screen real estate being taken up by the wider hole punch means we actually are left with very little room for any notification icons to show up in the status bar the amount of times i've had to swipe down to see my notifications because most of them are hidden it's kind of annoying i think the only form of hole punch that i don't really mind is the one found on samsung's lineup of phones tiny and in the center meaning it kind of gets out of the way but aside from that as i said the display is really nice and feels like excellent value for money another great value aspect of this phone somewhat surprisingly is the performance so this phone has the 765 g snapdragon chipset which on paper is meant to be a fair bit of a downgrade from the 865 chipset found in the oneplus 8 pro but to be honest i really haven't noticed much of a difference and don't get me wrong there is definitely a difference and i have noticed the very occasional hiccup or lag here and there when using the device and something else to keep in mind is that i'm not a gamer i'm sure that for gaming there would be a much larger discrepancy between the two chipsets but i think there's a lot of value in this 765g chipset and most people will find that this phone is well and truly up to the task of tackling pretty much every average use case scenario that they can throw at it as well as that the battery life on this phone is excellent the 415 million power cell in combination with the efficient chipset and the slightly less power draining display means that i'm able to get a comfortable five and a half hours of screen on time every single day which is fantastic big fan of the battery life on this phone obviously there's no wireless charging here which i do miss but it's not a deal breaker so we've got the display the performance and the battery life and these three aspects really are incredible on this phone and make it feel like a much more premium device design wise is probably where the phone starts to take a small hit in comparison to its more premium flagship brothers now i do want to emphasize the word small there because it is still a pretty well-built phone but it's things like the plastic rails on the side or even the glossy glass back which might sound good on paper but when you compare it to the incredibly premium feel of those frosted glass backs found on phones like the oneplus 8 pro or the galaxy note 20 ultra or even the pixel 4 this phone definitely doesn't feel as nice in the hand it's funny in the middle of using and testing the oneplus nord i actually switched over to using the galaxy note 20 ultra for a little while so that i could review that and that phone is pretty much the exact opposite of the oneplus nord but using that phone with its beautiful frosted glass back panel and outrageously premium build quality and i know it's way more expensive than the nord but you do definitely feel the cuts that oneplus have made with the nord in regards to build quality on top of that the haptic motor has also been downgraded compared to its more premium flagship brothers which is definitely a bit of a shame and i will say even though it's great that we still have the alert slider on the side it definitely doesn't feel as solid as the ones found on the pro oneplus devices and it will often switch on its own as i slide it in and out of my pocket small nitpick there but still something i picked up on along with that no dual speaker system here on the nord just your plain old bottom firing single speaker which is definitely a step down from its more premium counterparts software is still the same old oxygen os that we know and love and i've even been using the stock oneplus launcher which is pretty rare for me and if you want to see how i've set it up then i'll leave a link to my recent watts on my phone video up in the cards and down in the description below keep in mind that the upcoming android 11 update is looking to give oxygen os a wildly different look something more akin to the one ui skin found on samsung devices so if you really enjoy the current form of oxygen os with its blend of stock but extra customization flexibility then enjoy it while it lasts because it looks set to change pretty soon okay now cameras on the other hand this is where you really start noticing the difference between the nord and a flagship device so i will say that the main sensor is pretty solid it's the same one that was used on the regular oneplus 8 so we know it isn't horrible but it is one of those given enough light and it'll perform well cameras and that's about the best complement that i can give in poor lighting conditions even on murky or overcast days the main sensor does struggle a bit to keep up nightscape mode can work fairly well to counter these poor lighting scenarios so that is of course nice to have but again you want to be using this camera in great lighting conditions to get the best and most reliable results the wide angle lens is one of those fun to have but not amazing quality lenses the images taken with it are fairly soft in comparison to the main sensor but in all honesty if you give it lots of light add a bit of sharpening in post the end results are fine if you're just going to be sharing them on social media and the macro lens is pretty much just straight garbage really horrible photos taken with this lens even in great lighting conditions so i would avoid using it at all costs and that depth sensor who knows if it's really doing anything at all these two lenses are just there purely as a marketing move not for any real practical game as i mentioned earlier we do have dual front-facing cameras on the front one being a slightly wider field of view and this reminds me of the pixel 3 xl dates i really enjoy having a wider angle lens on the front of the phone i think it's a seriously underrated feature the quality of the selfie images are pretty decent as well nothing amazing though but in terms of video quality to be honest i've been pretty satisfied with the videos captured on this phone in good lighting conditions now as i said if you give it lots of light then i found the videos are kind of on par with the videos taken on my pixel 4 xl now this might say more about the pixel than it does about the nord but with that said there is actually a funny little quirk when it comes to capturing videos on the north so using the front-facing camera on the oneplus nord uh how is this we get the option to record at 4k 60 using the front-facing camera which is a nice option to have but when you switch back to the rear cameras for video it caps out at 4k 30. super odd initially it was thought to be a software bug that was capping the frame rate when shooting video with the rear video camera but so far we've seen no update to address this issue so perhaps it's a limitation with the hardware who knows but that's pretty much it that is the oneplus nord an excellent phone with an incredible display really solid battery life and performance and an okay camera if your number one priority on a smartphone is the camera and you want reliably high quality images every time you snap a photo then this ain't the phone for you and you should probably look at getting something like the pixel 4a instead but if you're not someone who needs the best camera on your smartphone then this really is an incredible budget smartphone that will give you a close to flagship experience for a fraction of the cost you
