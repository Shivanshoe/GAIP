so this is my sony a7s to cinema reef I've been working on this read and therefore this video for over two and a half years ever since I first purchased my sony a7s 2 it's undergone several different modifications and alterations or have been trying to get it to suit my needs as best as possible and I've got it down to two different configurations the first configuration is a neat compact handheld run-and-gun rig and then the second is the full-on monster cinema rig best part about both of these rigs is that they're super affordable and budget-friendly so let's cut the chat and get straight in now the two reconfigurations have a lot of similarities and overlap so let's start with what's the same about the two rigs and then we'll talk about how they differ that had really any success in building out a camera rig you need to start with a cage the cage I went with is from small rig it's one built specifically for the a7s2 but there are so many different variations that small rig has to offer so no matter what camera you use will no doubt find something that works from there huge collection of cages one pro tip that I learnt from someone and I can't actually remember who that person was but this cage and a number of others that you'll no doubt come across I only have one mounting screw that connects the cage to the bottom of the camera and this can actually result in a little bit of side-to-side wiggle if and when that screw gets loose so neat tip is to grab some of these cheap twisty ties and tie them through one of the threads on the cage and then to the next strap mounting points on the camera and this will add a really nice layer of stability and help to reduce some of that side-to-side wiggle on top of that we have a pretty generic style top handle which I use all the time to carry my rig around and this one is also from small rig and again there are so many different options and styles available from a huge range of top handles but for me I would personally recommend avoiding any top handles that are mounted via the hot shoe as that can often result in a little bit of wiggle instead I would recommend looking for top handles that are mounted via quarter-inch screws as that will provide you with the most stability and reliability so then from there on the side here I have this wooden side handle that I actually nabbed off a generic cam Veit DSLR cage that I bought for a previous camera a number of years ago now and it just melts to the side of the cage using two inch screws you know I'm a big enthusiast of handheld footage and so having this wooden side handle helps to remove at least my left hand a little bit away from the body of the camera and this helps to reduce those micro jitters that can otherwise show up in handheld footage if you've got your hands directly on the body of the camera now directly underneath the camera I've got this nice long arca-swiss quick-release plate that I've connected using two quarter inch screws into the bottom of the cage and using two screws makes things rock-solid there's no wiggle at all which is what you want in a rig all of my equipment uses the arca-swiss system which makes it really easy to swap between different pieces of camera support gear now from there I mount the camera onto a Universal low profile 15 millimeter rod base plate which itself has been attached to an ARCA Swiss clamp meaning it's really easy to take a camera on and off but I use this 15 millimeter rod base plate to attach a few other accessories the most important of which is external power for most camera rigs you're going to want to use some form of external power to really beef up the battery life of your camera and transform it into more of a video shooting Beast and for me it's actually pretty much the main reason why I even have a rig in the first place now whilst V mount batteries can be a good long-term solution then always the best option for two main reasons cost and size so I went with pretty much the most budget-friendly option you can go for which is one of these external Sony NPF battery plates that powers the camera through a dummy battery adapter I've got the battery plate mounted on one of these 50mm Enwright adapters and then that goes at the back of the rig now using one of these beefy sony MP batteries will last me over four hours of shooting 4k internally on my sony a7s - and they're dirt cheap as well and so whilst your rig might look fractionally cooler with a V mount solution your wallet would definitely thank you if you go the sony MP wrap instead so the last piece of the puzzle that stays the same for both rigs is this brand new five-inch monitor that I've just recently received from Andy cine now this is their a 6 plus model and full disclosure they did send it to me in exchange for featuring it in a video on my channel but they didn't pay me a cent to say anything in particular and in fact I actually reached out to them to ask if I could try it out because I've seen so many other great reviews on it across YouTube now I've tried several different so-called budget-friendly monitors in my time and without a doubt the a6 plus is the best bang for your buck five-inch monitor that you can find and for me five inches is the perfect size for a compact handheld rig like this that said the real highlight of this monitor is that it is a touchscreen which for me is such a game-changing feature for an unfilled camera monitor to have because it makes navigating through the menus and switching on and off the various camera assist features an absolute breeze it's also got a super sharp 1920 by 1080 resolution which for five inches is just about as sharp as you can get it gets decently bright for outdoor viewing but also comes with the Sun hood for improved visibility and it supports 4k 30 signals natively which means your camera doesn't have to do the converting on its end it also comes with this really neat articulating mounting bracket which I've taken the liberty to mount on the front of my top handle or on the back depending on which way I've got it mounted this gives the monitor this super low profile setup which I'm all about and if the bracket isn't your theme and the monitor also has three quarter inch mounting points which makes attaching it to any camera read super versatile and flexible it's also got a whole host of inbuilt camera assist features as well including histograms focus assist audio meters zebras false-color ratio guidelines Peaks little pixel and 3d a lot support so just about all you could hope for and you can even pinch to zoom in digitally which comes in super clutch for nailing focus and is a phenomenal feature to have it's also got a really great operating system which is outrageously easy to use with customizable shortcuts just to swipe away it's got actual EMI out as well a headphone jack for monitoring audio and get this it also has a DC 8 volt output which means you can actually power your camera from the battery on the monitor if you have a dummy battery adapter for your camera of choice it is a seriously seriously great monitor that is packed to the brim with features and if you want to learn more about it then I recommend checking out Caleb parks review of it over on his channel which I will link down in the description below but I can highly recommend it myself particularly if you're looking for a 5 inch monitor that doesn't break the bank now with that out of the way we've got our Compaq handheld rig complaint and to be honest this is the configuration that I tend to find myself using more often than not it's convenient it's not too heavy and everything I need is pretty easily accessible but there are some situations that call for a more beastly rig and so let's talk about how I transform this cute little compact handheld rig into a full-on monster cinema rege personally I swap the top panel configuration all the way around so that the handle now faces forwards and the monitor is at the back and this will make more sense as to why I do this in a moment then I swap out these cute little 15 millimeter rods for these longer ones and then what really beefs up this rig tenfold is this matte box from fat gun it's called the DP 3000 and whilst it's not the cheapest matte box that you can find I think it's the cheapest that will actually enhance your workflow and you'll set up and not just make your rig look super cool it has dual filter trays one of which is rotating and it's also a swing-away matte box which makes it a heck of a lot easier to swap out lenses on the go I also took the liberty to spray-paint the various screws and bolts on this matte box black as I feel as though the original bright blue color is a little obnoxious and amateur looking but then the final piece to this beastly rig as I take one of those little 15 millimeter rods I attach it to the side of the matte box and then use that to attach an additional side end which again makes handheld shooting so nice because it gets my hands as far away from the camera body as possible and as you can now see having the monitor on the back of the rig means that I can keep it nice and low profile which isn't possible if it's facing forward given that the matte box gets in the way and it also counterbalances the weight of that matte box quite nicely now keep in mind with this fully kitted out cinema rig things do get pretty heavy which I actually don't mind given the look that it adds to handheld footage but the long extended shoots I have found that it can become quite taxing so that's why I tend to find myself going back to that small handheld rig for my running gun shoots but that's it those are my two camera rigs in all of their glory now every single part that I mentioned throughout the video has been linked down in the description below and if you have any questions regarding parts regarding the rig itself then hit me up in the comments down below and I'll do my best to get back to you with a response aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and I'll catch you later [Music]
