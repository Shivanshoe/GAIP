[Music] so it probably won't come as a big surprise that one of my favorite aspects about android as an operating system overall is the level of customization we have over our phones whether it be a clean backdrop or a set of minimally beautiful icons or even an amazingly functional widget anything is game for me when it comes to customization now a lot has changed in the customization world over the past few years and so whilst you still can use a third-party launcher like nova launcher or lawn chair to customize your phone if we're being completely honest ever since the introduction of gestural navigation using a third-party launcher is no longer the ideal choice unless you're happy to sacrifice a bit of fluidity and so after a two to three year journey of using pretty much every method in the book to try and customize the many different stock home screen launchers that ship with the different software skins available i thought why not put everything i know into one detailed video breaking down exactly how you can customize any phone and so for today's video that's exactly what we're going to do and we're actually going to break this video up into five levels of customization all the way from the very basics right through to proper in-depth levels of customization that might just hurt your brain a little but hopefully there will be something for everyone throughout so without further ado let's get customizing all right the first level of customization is to simply change your backdrop and this stems from the old adage that goes change your wallpaper change your life now whilst that saying is obviously a bit tongue-in-cheek i do actually believe that choosing the right wallpaper can really freshen up any odd phone so then the question is what sort of wallpaper should i choose and where do i find them now there are really two main categories to choose from when it comes to wallpapers photography based and abstract backdrops but whichever way you go the number one rule is to ensure it's clean enough so that the application icons and widgets sitting on top of the wallpaper can be seen easily a messy overly detailed wallpaper like this one can result in your home screen looking like a cluttered mess now there are hundreds upon hundreds of wallpaper applications that you can find on the google play store many of which i've actually featured on my channel in the past but if i could only limit your search to two i would suggest the backdrops application and resplash so backdrops is really one of the best wallpaper applications for abstract walls and that's because it has such a diverse range of backdrops and yet most of them are also really solid options for creating a pretty clean yet unique looking home screen setup reesplash though is a fantastic photography based wallpaper application it's actually what we call an unsplash client and if you haven't heard of unsplash it is a phenomenal website filled with high quality images that are completely free to use in any context and a lot of the images make for fantastic wallpapers now there are stacks of unsplashed client wallpaper applications on the play store and resplash is one of them but it's got a great design it's an easy to use application and it's also regularly updated as well now for the past year or two i've always found myself leaning more towards abstract backdrops as i find that they often allow for more flexibility when it comes to widget and icon placement and so some honorable mentions to abstract wallpaper apps i've been using a lot lately include fluid walls crimson walls and believe it or not the gladian icon pack and just to prove the importance of a good wallpaper all of the home screens you're seeing on screen right now are using the stock icons provided by the default launchers and yet as you can see the setups still look pretty clean thanks purely to a well-designed strategically chosen backdrop okay moving to level two in our five levels of customization this is where things get a little bit spicy so for this level we're talking icon packs and widgets most stock home screen launchers use pretty plain icon packs by default usually the icons are circle or rounded squares they're often pretty large as well and worse than that a lot of stock icons have very little consistency and so using a custom icon pack can be one of the best ways to ensure your home screen setup looks super clean the best part is that there are hundreds of beautifully designed third-party icon packs available on the google play store many of which are even free and so the choices you have in terms of style are really endless now some stock home screen launches do allow for icon theming but not many and so if your particular home screen launcher doesn't support icon theming then in order to set up custom icons we're going to have to utilize an application called shortcut maker this is an amazing application that is free and we can use it to essentially create widgets for each of the custom app icons we want on our home screen now i actually detailed the entire process of creating custom icon widgets in my pixel launcher home screen setup tutorial video so i'll leave that linked up in the cards and down below and i won't bore you with that entire process again here but essentially you long press your home screen to add a widget select shortcut maker from the widget menu drag and drop that to your home screen then you tap the apps button select the app you want to set up then tap the edit icon button navigate to your icon pack of choice and then search for and select the new icon that you want bonus tip if you're after a really clean home screen setup then i always recommend hiding application labels wherever possible you know what your app icons look like who needs an app label as well so thankfully shortcut maker does let us disable the app labels so once we've done that we hit create shortcut and there it is you repeat that process for as many app icons as you want on your home screen and would you look at that our home screen is looking very fresh indeed now as well as custom icon packs level two also involves incorporating pre-made widgets into our home screen setups a lot of apps these days have their own inbuilt widgets which you can find by long pressing an empty space on your home screen and selecting the widgets option and just having a scroll through this list but an even better option for widgets is to utilize the kwgt application like shortcut maker kwgt is also a custom widget maker application but this one takes things to another league all together by letting you create super customized widgets from the ground up the great part though is that a lot of graphic design artists and developers have done a lot of the hard work for us by creating their own custom made widgets and then wrapping them all together into what we call a widget pack which you can then find on the play store just like icon packs there are hundreds of third-party kwgt widget apps to find on the google play store again many of which are free and all you have to do is just install a pack and then open the kwgt app and boom all of the pre-made widgets will show up and that's how i've set up this widget or this widget or even this widget as well and all of those widgets took literally about five seconds to set up now for most people level two is where i suggest tapping out you can develop some really phenomenal home screen setups with just your phone's stock launcher using pre-made icon and widget packs and a really well chosen wallpaper and so for most people there's really no need to go any further but if you do want to take things to yet another level well let's press on now whilst third-party icon packs can get most of the job done sometimes they just completely stuff up the design of one of your favorite app icons or even more common is that they don't even support some of the apps you have installed on your phone or if you're more than that what if you just can't find an icon pack that you like the look of period well if any of these scenarios happens to be the case then you can actually create your own custom icon packs without ever leaving your phone now there are two applications i highly recommend using for this process the first being icon pack studio and the second being adapter cons so with icon pack studio you can use their advanced editor to essentially create awesome icon packs from scratch within seconds you can adjust pretty much any element of the icon you can also use special filters like shadows or bezels or textures and not only that you can even import existing icon packs and use those as the platform with which to build upon a lot of you have noticed in my recent oneplus phone reviews that i have every single app in my app drawer set up as these cute tiny little icons and the way i've achieved this is by using the icon pack studio application so within the app i create a new adaptive icon pack change the logo design to an external icon pack and then i select the delta icon pack from there i then bring the size down to 44 then i head back and over to the background tab set the background fill opacity to 0 and then disable the shadow then i tap on preview then apply then ok and the app will export an icon pack that i can install as i would any regular icon pack from the play store the reason i use this method is that even if an app doesn't have a supported icon from the delta icon pack it will just revert back to its default icon but with the custom sizing properties i've set up and so once i install the exported icon pack i can then go through and select each of these small icons for all of the apps in the app drawer and the end result looks amazing as for adapticons it's actually a fairly similar concept to the icon pack studio application but more so for independent icon editing and what i love most about it is that you can import images from your gallery to use as icons so if you've downloaded a fancy icon from the web or perhaps you've created one on your computer now you can import it into adapter cons and like the icon pack studio application it will also export an installable icon pack apk that you can then use to customize your icons now if you thought creating your own customized icon packs was fun wait till you get a load of level four customizing widgets so as mentioned back in level two one of the best ways to set up widgets is to use the pre-made widget packs for kwgt what's great is that when you load them into kwgt you actually get the ability to see every single element within that widget and if you want change any element as well so this means if you've got a purple backdrop set up but the widget you love is using a fluoro green accent color that doesn't match at all well just dive on in and change the color to one that suits a bit better or perhaps you love pretty much everything about a widget that you found but there's a little bit of text at the top that just doesn't fit well jump in and delete it or what if you've got a weather and calendar widget you love the look of but you want to improve its functionality further by making it so when you tap on the weather icon it takes you to your weather app of choice and when you tap on the calendar section it takes you to your calendar application of choice well jump over the shortcuts page for each element and set those actions right on up seriously pretty much any customization you can think of is possible within this app and i love it in fact you can get so crazy with kwgt that you can even use it to create entire home screen setups why would you want to do this well take a look at this home screen setup we've got a set of 10 applications with custom icons laid out in a 5x2 configuration looks pretty clean right well this is normally impossible to set up on any stock default launch because there is not a single stock launch app that ships with any mainstream phone that i know of that supports a horizontal grid size of seven which is what you need to have five icons next to each other with negative space on either side like what you can see here and yet it looks so good so i thought sod it and i created this entire icon configuration in kwgt using icons from the drops icon pack i actually covered this entire process in detail in my me ui home screen setup tutorial video so if you want to recreate this setup on your own phone then you can also find that linked up in the cards and down below now normally the biggest downside to using widgets to customize your home screen icons is that you lose both app shortcuts and notification dots but i've actually just recently found a solution to the latter issue i did a little bit of digging around and stumbled upon a slightly older tutorial that included a pack of free what are called custom components and with a bit of tweaking i was actually able to set these up to replicate notification dots within that very same kwgt widget now i haven't quite figured out application shortcuts though but i wouldn't be surprised if someone already has but regardless if you really want to level up the customization of your phone's stock default launcher then you've got to dive head first into the world that is creating custom kwgt widgets now for our final level of customization we're going to discuss how you can essentially load an entire home screen launcher onto your phone's stock home screen launcher and that is by using klwp now if you haven't heard of klwp it is another application in the custom family and it basically allows you to create entire home screen setups complete with animations widgets and icon packs and then to get it to work you just set it as your phone's wallpaper and so this results in essentially a third-party home screen launcher experience using your phone's stock launcher now creating your own klwp setups from scratch is another kettle of fish all together one that i'm not quite prepared to tackle in this video but thankfully like third icon and widget packs there are a bunch of very creative and intelligent developers who have done the hard yards for us and have created klwp preset files that can be downloaded via the google play store you can then dive in and customize these klwp setups to ensure they fit the way you want your setup to look and feel but then once all is said and done you apply it as your wallpaper clear everything from your home screen and there you go one thing to keep in mind though is that more often than not these klwp setups will require you to have several pages on your home screen to ensure the swiping functionalities work as intended and given that pretty much all stock home screen launches don't allow you to create blank pages you'll want to install an application called blank widget and then load that onto as many pages as necessary some of the absolute best looking and most functional setups i've ever come across have been klwp based and that is because the level of control you have is essentially limitless and so this allows for some crazy and amazingly impressive home screen setups but there you have it that is your deep dive into what i consider the five levels of android customization using the stock launcher that comes shipped with your phone now i've actually created separate standalone videos that unpack each of the different levels on their own in much more detail so i'll leave all of those linked down below as well as everything else mentioned throughout the video and if you're now wanting to get a heap of inspiration for what your next home screen setup could look like then i'll also leave a playlist filled with an abundance of videos covering that exact topic up in the cards and down in the notes below but that's it thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music]
