as a content creator inefficiency can be the worst particularly when it comes to posting on YouTube where the algorithm tends to reward those who post more frequently if you have inefficient processes in your production cycle believe it or not it can actually have a pretty big impact on your channel so I posted about this on Twitter and Instagram a couple of weeks ago but over the past few months ever since increasing the amount of days that I work on my youtube channel I finally picked up on all of these little inefficiencies in my workflow and off somewhat managed to get on top of them so I put together a list of 10 productivity hacks that will hopefully help all of your workflows as well so you ready let's go all right sit number one is something you do before you even set up the camera and that is creating to-do lists but not just any to-do list if you want to feel more productive then you've got to be really intentional with these to-do lists by breaking up large items and also by adding in a whole heap of really easily achievable items for example a to-do list on any given day for me might include replying to emails scripting a video filming a role for a video editing the a role for that video starting to film b-roll and perhaps starting to script another video notice how that list doesn't include finishing a video or editing an entire video there bits and pieces of a video plus a few other small tasks and they're all super achievable within a single day and trust me when I say when you've got a list of achievable goals to get through it's way more motivating than seeing a daunting list of the tasks that are going to take a week or even more to complete and so you end up actually checking off the items on your to-do list which equals productivity second up and let me tell you one of the best things you can do to up your efficiency is multitasking now I'm not just referring to any sort of multitasking but specifically video multitasking so for example at the start of any work week I'll try and make sure that I have to complete scripts ready to go then at the start of the week pretty much the first thing that I do is I set up my a roll set so what you're watching right now and then I filmed the air off of both videos back to back then I've got the base for two videos in the can and that sets the platform for the week going forward it's a my story with other setups top-down shots or studio b-roll shots if I can I'll grab whatever I'm shooting for both videos and get it done in one go since doing this my productivity has shot through the roof speaking about shooting b-roll if you don't already then do yourself a favor and pick up an RGB colored light take a look at this shot it's a macro closeup of a phone and it looks pretty cool right well change the color of the background light switch the way that you're panning the camera and bam you've got a completely different looking shot within seconds you don't want to use these shots back to back to back throughout your video but scattered throughout and you're golden I'm currently using the aperture MC RGB light but you could even get away with using lifx bulbs or even cheaper colored bulbs just as long as they don't flicker in your footage and I'll leave a link to some of my recommendations below another neat time-saving trick related to a role is to make sure that you film your piece to camera for the entire duration of the video that you're working on so sometimes we have videos that are half pasted camera half voiceover or sometimes entirely voiceover and I get it creatively sometimes that is the decision that is right for your video but trust me when I say having the entire videos worth of a role is so handy when it comes to editing and then shooting b-roll the reason for this is if I'm editing and I've run out of b-roll for whatever I'm talking about or I simply don't have time to set up a b-roll shot for the topic that I'm talking about well I just cut back to my face again it's not always the best decision creatively but if you're on a tight time budget it can save you loads of time at the back end of your projects now one killer in terms of efficiency if you're not in an acoustically treated room is setting up the space so that it sounds good now aside from throwing up a few blankets around your space one of the easiest ways to improve your audio and save a bunch of time is to get your microphone as close to your mouth as possible what if you don't want the microphone in your shot well simple once you finish recording just grab a 30 second clean plate which is essentially a shot without the microphone visible then in your editing software of a choice overlap the clean plate on top of your a roll shot then draw a mask around the microphone feather it a little bit and poof it's gone just like magic another thing that I've noticed has had a pretty drastic impact on my efficiency lately has been the length of my videos a few months ago I did a few 15 to 20 minute videos back-to-back and I ended up feeling super unproductive those weeks because those videos took so long to finish it's not that I was doing less work it's just that I felt less productive because the output of those weeks were only one video compared to let's say two so since then where possible I've done my best to try and keep my videos at under 10 minutes in duration and I'll even try and push for five minutes if I can and this is greatly sped up the production process of completing these videos meaning I want to get more than one done in any given week okay here's an easy one when it comes to editing videos for your YouTube channel there's a pretty good chance that you're using a bunch of the same assets across each of your videos so whether that be intro or outro graphics or little animated elements or certain sound effects files or even if none of that applies you surely at least use the same sequence settings for each and every project that you edit so with that in mind do yourself a favor and create a video project template you create a blank sequence with the correct settings create any folders that you normally setup at the beginning of a project import any assets that you use regularly and then you save that as a template project file when did you start and you project copy this template over rename it and boom you've just saved yourself ten minutes now if you've been following my channel for a while you may have picked up on the fact that I've embraced handheld filming a lot more over the past year or so and to be honest it's just because I like the look of handheld camera motion issue is if I'm filming a shot of myself which obviously needs to be done on a tripod it can be a little bit jarring to cut back and forth between static and handheld shots well a super awesome hack is to download some handheld motion presets load them onto your tripod film footage and now all of a sudden you have an invisible camera assistant who films you handheld wherever you go there's some paid options and some free options as well I'll link a few that I recommend below tip number nine come up with video IDs that can use old footage for the last few years of creating videos for my youtube channel for some reason I always felt like I needed to shoot fresh content for every single video maybe it was a pride thing or a perfectionistic thing but honestly I don't really know but I've developed some video ideas that I've been able to repurpose old footage for as long as you don't do this for every single video you can seriously use this to create a video in half a day and boy does it feel good to complete a video that quickly all right lucky last if you're fortunate enough to do content creation as at least a part-time job then do your best to set yourself regular work hours and then stick to them not only is this really healthy for your mental well-being but it can also help you to be way more productive for me I'll do my best to only work on my YouTube channel from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day knowing that I'm clocking off at 5 p.m. sharp gives me that extra motivation that I need to go as hard as I can throughout the day as a result I'm finding that I'm actually getting more done now then back when I would work longer hours over the course of an entire day and night for example and I'm feeling much more positive which is super valuable and something that we all need to prioritize in this content creation world but that's it 10 productivity hacks that I think will up your video game or at least your video workflow big-time let me know if you have anything that you'd add down in the comments below and we'll build up a long list of productivity hacks down there for anyone who might be checking out the comments section but that's it for this video hopefully you enjoyed it and I'll catch you later [Music] all
