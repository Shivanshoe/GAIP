did you know that there are well over two million applications available on the google play store two freaking million that's a lot and so that means if you're an app developer and you want people to not only discover your application but to also continue to use it indefinitely you better hope that your app provides some really unique functionality that makes it stand out from the rest or there is one other option that might help to make your app stand out and that is to make sure the design of the app is downright incredible and so after showcasing hundreds upon hundreds of applications on my channel over the past six years or so i thought it'd be fun to compile a list of some of the apps that i think have the best designs of the lot so buckle in and let's get started all right first up today is flux and this is a beautiful weather application still in early access at the time making this video but if you can get your hands on it it's one of the best looking weather applications you'll ever come across the app starts with this big animated portion of the ui that indicates what the weather is currently doing but then below that you have all the weather information you might need access to beautifully laid out in these separate little sections it's also got a weather radar that also somehow manages to look good plus it also includes a stack of really well designed weather widgets just to put the icing on the cake like i said incredibly eye-catching and super functional as well but if you're after an even simpler weather app that only showcases uv index then sony side is the app for you it is a super minimal app and yet despite this it still looks really visually pleasing you get a big uv index number displayed in the middle and then some guidelines for uv protection just below that but then even as you tap the guidelines or the settings menu toggles the animations are all just super bouncy and fluid and it just makes for a beautiful user experience after that is proddy and in my experience productivity-based applications always seem to have the best track record when it comes to design and proddy is one that certainly fits the bill here put simply this app is a habit tracker application with its main goal being to help you in developing healthy routines once you've set your habits up you can track each of them using the app itself or you can set reminders as well and that is all well and good but for me i just love how the app looks with its combo of colors and icons so definitely worth a look even just for that aspect alone another productivity-based app that is visually incredible is fanya and this is a to-do list and tasks organizer application that lets you stay on top of calendar dates and reminders and the design of this app is all about negative space there's no unnecessary clutter the buttons have this new morphism design language to them and i just think it looks really cool the only thing that could be potentially improved are the animations everything just sort of fades in at the moment whereas i'd like to see ui elements slide in or pop up but aside from that visually at least this app is top shelf now retropod is an application i featured on my channel at the back end of last year and as you can probably see the design of this app isn't necessarily impressive because it's ultra modern or because it features smooth animations it's because of how well it emulates the old ipod devices functionally speaking retropod is an offline music player application so it'll let you play any audio file stored on your device but design wise it's just so convincing how much it looks and feels like you're using a real ipod device super fun approach to an otherwise tried and true concept so hats off to the developer for making this one so unique but if you're after a more traditional looking and functioning offline music player then one of the best in my opinion at least is nick's music player it's got really cool animations as you swipe back and forth within the interface when you click on items the animations are all super fluid as well but then my favorite part of the app is this live audio visualizer that animates whenever you're playing music anytime i do a speaker comparison in one of my phone reviews this is the app that i'll use for the showcase and that's just because it looks so darn good and speaking of incredible animations perhaps the absolute best application i've ever tested in this regard is harpy for twitter this app is a third-party twitter client and whilst visually it looks really great as well for me the fluidity of the app is on another level everything from the scrolling up and down on the main timeline to then switching between menus to then opening photos all of these animations are just on point even if you don't plan on switching to this as a replacement for the twitter app full time just promise me you'll download it and give it a go because it really is just that impressive now when you've got an app that is functionally speaking at least super powerful and that largely runs in the background there will understandably be a temptation to just rush the design and let people enjoy the functionality itself but that is certainly not how the developer of the really impressive buzzkill approached designing their application the app itself is a notification manager which means you can create rules that will tell the app how to handle the various notifications coming in on your phone and it's potentially one of those set and forget applications but then the design of the app itself alongside all the animations is not only super unique but it's just downright gorgeous huge props to the developer for putting in the extra effort in regards to the design of this app buzzfire on the other hand is not a set and forget application but thankfully the developer has put just as much effort into the app's design the app itself is basically an all-in-one hub for discovering the latest news related to customization based applications and it's one of the best in regards to that particular functionality but again what impresses me the most about this app is its design it really is a visual treat to look at and the animations are all smooth and really fluid which makes scrolling through the interface a true joy and so finally today we have shiftwork a beautifully designed calendar application for anyone needing to organise their work schedule and i just love the pastel style icons that this app uses as well as the clean approach they've taken to the entire ui and functionally the app is really powerful as well visually stunning and powerfully functional that is a winning combo in my books there are so many calendar-based applications that are just super plain and boring to look at so if you're looking for something much fresher in the design department then shift work is totally the one to go for but there you have it those are 10 of the very best applications when it comes to the design now the 10 apps i picked for today's video were chosen from a much larger pool of applications so if you'd like to see a second episode at some point in the future let me know by leaving a thumbs up oh and feel free to comment below letting everyone know of your favorite apps in terms of design and who knows maybe they'll be featured on the channel in the future as well aside from that if you enjoyed the video then a sub would be greatly appreciated but that's it thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
