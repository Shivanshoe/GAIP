since the start of my youtube channel i've always filmed every single one of my videos in the same house or apartment that my wife and i have lived in now before i had a kid this was usually in the living room because i liked the depth that it provided given it was usually the largest room in the house but as you'd expect having a kid means filming in the living room really isn't an option so when we were moving at the end of last year i had to make sure that the apartment had a third bedroom that would act as not only my office but also my filming studio so we signed the lease we moved all of our furniture in i set up my office put my camera in place but it looked like garbage i tried from this angle but with the blinds open there was no way to nicely expose both my face and what was outside the window there blind closed and now it looks ugly well i couldn't do it this way because of that mirror behind me but then i landed on this shot which i still use from time to time in some of my videos the trouble is i don't want this sort of a shot for every single one of my videos because i really only want to use it when i'm actually talking about something that's on my computer which isn't all that often so i started panicking but i logged into youtube i searched up a bunch of inspiration and after a couple of days of going back and forth i was finally able to achieve this shot and this has been my main aerial shot for the last year so let's look at how you can do this yourself the first thing you'll want to grab is a backdrop now there are heaps and heaps of options to choose from online like paper vinyl muslin and so forth and they're all great for differing purposes but i wanted something a little more lightweight and minimal so naturally i got this block out roll-up lined in black from ikea it actually comes in a few different shades which is nice but it's called the tupler and i got mine in the longest length possible which is 200 by 195 centimeters but the best part is that it only costs 50 so i screwed that into the roof and boom there was my backdrop so as you can see i placed this just in front of my computer desk which means i'm able to use this space as a filming set for my a-roll but also as an office for all of my video editing so now it was time to bring in the lights i had previously been using the falcon eyes so28 td as my key light which i would also shoot through a diffusion panel but the issue in such a small space is this is that it spills just about everywhere including onto my backdrop which is not what i wanted so instead i picked up the godox sl60w which comes with its own softbox and this is an overall smaller sized package compared to the falconized setup with the diffusion panel as well then after experimenting i decided to take the black outer material that the diffusion panel comes in with the 5 in 1 reflector kit and actually use it to flag off half of the light coming out of the godox light which means the only half that was outputting light would hit my face and not the background now flaking light is a super neat lighting technique that is actually worth spending some time practicing but doing it the traditional way with c-stands and flagging sheets and whatnot can actually take up a fair amount of size using my method might not look very glamorous but it helps to retain that really small form factor which is perfect for a tiny bedroom such as this one here it is without the flag in place and now with the flag in place from there it's on to the backlight so for the longest time i've been using this budget-friendly light from aperture called the al h198c though i'm pretty sure it's been discontinued now so i'll link some alternatives below but this is a fantastic little bi-color light that now works perfectly as a backlight the only issue is this space is so tight that it flares like crazy on the side of the frame oh man never did i think i'd be shooting from this angle in a video on my channel but anyway as you can see it's right up against the wall as far as it can be moved over so the only option left was to flag it i've got this cheap pinboard material that i purchased from a local hardware store here in australia i'll link some online options below but to be honest you can use almost anything cardboard paper as long as you can mount it upright and on an angle so i'll literally place a second table that i have in my office below that angle it just right and bam that flaring is gone but you can see the next issue that we have right so to remove it from the frame i take the groundbreaking approach of picking up the camera and moving it in and there you go so what you're seeing right now is literally just about the widest angle that i can shoot from in this space and whilst it's definitely not ideal it is what it is and you kind of get used to being somewhat limited as well as that the backdrop also doesn't give me much flexibility to go wider either so these are just the sacrifices that you have to make when you're working on a tight budget and in a small room like this in fact i now shoot all of my a-roll sequences with this cheap 50 millimeter f 1.8 lens from canon and i pretty much cannot use any other lens that i own my 85 millimeter is too tight my 24 millimeter is too wide so the 50mm is just in that sweet spot i do think a 35 lens could be a really nice option for getting a slightly wider field of view without seeing the backdrop but i just haven't gotten around to picking one up yet anyway the last piece of this puzzle is this background light originally i was using this second aperture al light as my background light which meant i could only get a white light ranging between 3200 and 5600 kelvin but recently i purchased the aputure mc rgb video light which means now i can get any color of the rainbow that i like and that is how you can transform a tiny little bedroom into a full-time youtube filming studio which in my humble opinion looks pretty polished whilst i love being able to use real backgrounds and props in my a-roll sets sometimes you've just got to play the hand that you've been dealt and since using this setup for the last 10 months or so i've actually kind of fallen in love with the look of it and i'll probably continue using a somewhat similar setup even when i move in the future which just quietly is happening very soon but anyway that's it for this video if you enjoyed it and got something out of it then let me know by leaving a thumbs up but that's it thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later you
