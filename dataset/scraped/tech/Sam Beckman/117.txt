so even though my channel is largely focused on phones and apps and everything else in between i'm a filmmaker nerd at heart and so i'm always on the lookout for gear that will help to not only improve the production value of my videos but also help to improve the efficiency of my workflow so enter the slider mini 2. this is a tiny little motorized slider from the team at smarter and full disclosure they did send this slider to me quite a number of months ago now to test and use in my workflow but they aren't paying for this video nor do they get to see it before it goes live but this video is a very brief look at the slider mini 2 from the perspective of a technology youtuber now i've owned a fairly budget oriented motorized slider since about the start of 2017. it's fairly basic in its operation no app control or anything like that and i probably wouldn't recommend it too highly to anyone but i have managed to use it in a number of videos on my channel but it's definitely quite clunky and it can be a real pain to set up and get smooth shots out of particularly because my camera rig is so hefty now that's not this camera rig it's the one that's filming me right now now i've also found that i will always have to use post stabilization to smooth out the shots captured using this slider because there's always a little bit of jerkiness in the shots in one part or another so i was really curious as to how this tiny little slider mini 2 would perform and i've got to say for what it does it's really impressive if you've got a light camera set up like this one then the beauty of having such a small slider like this is that it can just mount onto one tripod and that means it can really seamlessly fit into just about any workflow because it's so small that you could just leave it sitting on top of that tripod pretty much indefinitely but for a heavier rig like mine unfortunately that one mounting option in the middle at the bottom of this slider actually means i can't use it with a tripod and you won't be able to either unless you're happy with some y-axis movement in your final shots that's because all of the weight is only supported in the middle so if you've got quite a heavy rig like mine then the slider will actually lean depending on which side your camera is on now as i said i'm all about a productive workflow and so i don't want to have to de-rig my camera setup every time i want a slider shot so my solution was just to always use the slider mini 2 on top of a table and then it works beautifully because it's so small it will fit on pretty much any table including bedside tables which i've actually used on more than one occasion so then because of its ease of use i actually have found myself being able to use the slider mini 2 a number of times over the past couple of months which you're seeing on screen as we speak and in fact most of these shots do not have post stabilization added after the fact and that's what i love about this slider is that most of the shots that you capture with it are silky smooth right out of the camera so i actually find the slider mini 2 to be a great companion to my larger motorized slider and that's because there are oftentimes that that slider just cannot get a smooth shot even with post stabilization added after the fact because i'm shooting perhaps with a tighter lens like a 50mm or an 85mm lens so in those scenarios this slider will be able to capture a smooth result when called upon which is great so why do i even use the other slider at all well for one as the name indicates this is a really small slider which means your runs aren't going to be that long if you are someone who needs really long slider shots this might not be the solution for you but the second and perhaps even more important reason why i don't exclusively use just the slider mini 2 is that it doesn't offer parallax movement which the other slider does so parallax movement is when the camera arcs around your subject at the same time as that sliding movement and i love the look of these shots and again it's why i don't just switch to using the slider mini 2 exclusively even if it was an added extra that you could buy on their website like a small motorized head even if it was an add-on that you had to pay extra money for that would still be perfect in my mind but unfortunately at the time of recording this video they don't have such an accessory and so that's why this i think works perfectly as a companion slider rather than a do-it-all slider but again it's the ease of use that makes this slider so good in my opinion they do actually have a companion app available and you'd probably want to use this if you're someone who's shooting time lapses but for me i've actually never needed to use the app i just use the physical button on the side there are different press combos that will indicate which way you want the slider to move and to be honest that's what i love about it it can fit relatively seamlessly into my workflow without getting in the way if you want to check out the slider then i'll leave a link down in the description to where you can do so they also have some other accessories that go with a slider like a ball head or what i think is almost a must-have accessory there's z or zed flex tilt head but aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
