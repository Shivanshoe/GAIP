pretty much every single time i upload one of my monthly top android apps videos someone will always inevitably ask me what is a great app for video editing and to be honest i've never really had an answer for them and that's because whilst there are a lot of options available on the google play store most of them are actually quite limiting unless you upgrade to their premium versions a lot of which are subscription based which can get very expensive very fast but i think i may have finally found the answer and that is a video editing application called catka this app is completely free no features hidden behind a paywall and it has a stack of really impressive features as well and so when the team at catcut reached out and asked if i wanted to partner up for a video it took me just a few minutes of playing around with the app to say absolutely this app is actually from the same development team as the one behind tiktok and this means it works really well in conjunction with the tiktok app but it is much more than that as well now to be clear this video is not a review of capcut it's simply a showcase and walkthrough of the app to hopefully help demonstrate how you can maximize each of its features but with that being said let's dive in so when you first launch the application you'll get two main options here the first is create a blank new project and then the second is this option here called shortcut if you're looking to have complete control over whatever you're editing then you'll want to select new project but if you're super short on time or you just don't want to spend time editing in the first place then you can select the shortcut option if you do this you can then select as many clips as you'd like and capcut will analyze each of them and essentially create an entire edit for you complete with music and effects automatically it's actually really cool you can of course quickly change the music being used or if you like you can even then jump into the template timeline to make further refinements if need be by tapping on this edit icon then on edit draft this will open up the full template timeline so if you like you can then remove or change any elements the template added automatically but either way the end results created using the shortcut feature are really impressive now by default the templates do have a little cap cut watermark visible but you can easily remove this either by coming to the export menu and then by tapping on export without watermark and even though this will redirect you to the ticktock application or to the play store if you don't have it installed the app will still export the video without the watermark which you can then locate in your photo gallery or file explorer app of choice and do whatever you like with or like i said you can also just tap on the edit icon on top of your selected template here and then on edit draft to open the entire template timeline itself and this will also automatically remove the watermark either way this shortcut feature is really handy and i can see it being super useful for a lot of people but like i said if you wanted to have more control over your edits then back on the main menu you'll instead want to select the new project option instead when you do this you'll again be able to select any clips you're wanting to use then the app will optimize them to ensure editing is as smooth as possible and from there you'll be greeted with the main editor view so if you've ever used any sort of video editing application this layout should be fairly familiar but for a quick overview up the top here we have a button to close our project and head back to the main menu and all projects are saved automatically so no need to stress about accidentally pressing that button then we have this little drop down menu here to change the resolution it defaults to 720p but you can lower this to 480p for an even smaller exported file size or increase it to 1080p for maximum resolution you can also switch the frame rate here as well which is pretty handy the last button up the top here is our export button okay below that is our main viewer where we can obviously preview whatever we're editing and then below that just above our timeline we have a time code indicator a play pause button our undo and redo buttons then finally a button to view the edit full screen and then below that is our timeline this is where all the assembly happens it's where you can scrub through to find the bits you're wanting to cut or keep it's where you can tap on clips to make further adjustments and over on the far side you can see there's this plus icon which is how we can import more clips onto the timeline if need be you can also mute all of your imported clips audio with just a tap of this one button if you like but you can also of course do this on a clip by click basis as well but then right down the bottom is our adjustments bar and this will change depending on whether you have a clip selected or not but put simply this is where you can start to have a lot of fun with your edits to start if we have a clip selected you can see we have a scrollable menu here with a plethora of options far too many to point out in this one video but here's a few that stuck out to me so if we deselect that clip and tap the text button you can of course add a simple text box with any text that you like and once done it'll be added as another clip on your timeline that you can adjust the length of and move around to wherever you like but what i really like is this auto captions option as the name suggests this will analyze the audio on your timeline whether that be the clip audio or a voiceover you've recorded or both and then automatically generate captions that will line up with the audio it's pretty accurate as well so given how important captions are these days depending on the type of content you're creating to have it built in natively here in a way that works so well is really impressive but back to the main adjustments bar and the next features i'm really impressed by are those found within the effects section if you tap on this you'll see we get two options here video effects and body effects both of these options are filled to the brim with a heap of super trendy filters and animations and if you're looking for an effect that applies to the entire clip then that's what video effects are for but the body effects option contains a range of animations that will basically analyze and track your clips for specific body parts for example and then place the animations in and around them accordingly and there are two really impressive factors about this feature firstly how fast and reliable it is at detecting the body parts and then inserting the animations into your clips but then secondly how smooth the app handles playing back all of these animations even if you have a heap of them stacked on top of the other i highly recommend just taking some time to experiment with as many of these video and body effects as you can and you'll no doubt have a lot of fun doing so the other really impressive feature of this app for me at least is just how many overlays you can stack on top of your main timeline i was able to import and stack six additional clips on top of the original timeline clip which already had about three or four filters added and captions and a text box which is kind of mind-blowing and even more than that i was able to play it all back without any dropped frames which is bonkers now there are so many more features that this application offers and if i walk through all of them this video would be about an hour long but without question what makes this app so amazing is that it's completely free no watermarks on exported videos no features hidden behind a paywall literally every feature is available to any user for free and so if you've been looking for a video editing application that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it i can't really see any reason to go for any other app besides capcom it's available on ios as well and i know this video is sponsored but i want to stress capcut are not paying me for my opinion but my opinion is that by far this is the best video editing application i've ever come across in my long journey of trying out an outrageous amount of video editing applications but don't take my word for it like i said the app is completely free so use the first link down in the description below to download and try it out and while you're at it i've also included a link to cat cuts tik tok and instagram account so if you want even more tips and tricks that will help you to level up how you use cap cut then make sure to go and follow them over there aside from that hopefully you found this video helpful thank you all very much for watching thank you to the team at capcut for supporting the channel and i will catch you later [Music] you
