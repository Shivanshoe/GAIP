you ever been somewhere really quiet like the library and you realize that you've forgotten to set your phone to silent well shut up as the name so helpfully suggests is an application that allows you to not only silence any incoming notifications but actually any system sounds with just a tap of a single shortcut on your home screen you can even set it up as a toggle in your phone's quick settings menu to keep your home screen clean and that's just one of 10 android applications i've got lined up for you today to get september started off with a bank you ready let's go all right any do is a to-do list and reminders application that despite its popularity somehow hasn't gotten a feature in this series yet the app packs in a pretty fresh design and ui but what really convinced me to feature it in today's video was that it also includes an inbuilt snoozing functionality for reminders for some reason this feature is missing from most modern reminder applications and so i literally never use one that excludes it there are of course a stack of other features as well including some neat home screen widgets but let's say you want to take managing your agenda to another level altogether well then lock screen calendar could definitely be a valuable tool to add into your scheduling arsenal so as the name indicates this app essentially replaces your lock screen with an agenda-based calendar and this allows you to really quickly see what to-do list items you have coming up in your schedule you can then mark the tasks as complete or even create new ones from the lock screen all together and there are also some minor customizations that you can make to the look of the lock screen within the app settings pretty cool all right very quick promo code plug and you would not believe how many promo codes i have to give away from the apps featured in this episode so stay tuned until the end of the video to see which apps have promo codes available but just make sure that you follow me over on instagram for a chance to win got it good moving on now if you love customization then battery indicators is an application that really lets you customize how your phone shows your battery status so you've got a range of options within the app settings including a battery bar that simply shows a bar at the top of your phone screen to indicate your current battery status you've got battery text which enables a little battery percentage text box at the bottom or top of your screen then you've got a battery ring which is great for those of us using phones with hole punch displays and finally perhaps my personal favorite is the option to enable a charging animation which allows you to select from a range of cool little looping animations which will show at the bottom or top of your screen anytime your phone is plugged in there are also customizations galore for each setting really allowing you to dial in an exact look you might be after so a super fun app that is definitely worth trying out after that is e-labels a pretty simple yet powerful application that might just level up how you organize your emails now first things first this app only supports gmail accounts so keep that in mind but with that out of the way once you link your account you'll be able to see all of your email labels on the app's home screen under each is a handy little counter so you know how many emails live within each label but then from there you can tap the app label icons to edit their names or to change the text or background color and this makes it really easy to keep your labels clean and organized there's also a really handy unread counter widget for separate labels that you can add to your home screen if you upgrade to the premium version which is pretty cool now before we press on just wanted to take a quick moment to thank today's video sponsor url genius so if you go down to the description of this video look at all of the links to the apps featured in today's video you'll notice that they're not regular urls these shortened urls are actually application deep links and they've all been set up using the url genius platform which i've actually been using for the past few months so on top of helping you to create short links you can actually use url genius to create links that open any application so whether it be social media apps or e-commerce apps or really any application you can think of url genius has you covered and the great part is that there's nothing to code or install and you can even use your own domain like what i'm doing with my links and speaking of my links the ones i have in the description will actually launch different actions depending on whether you have the app installed or not and even depending on whether you're using an android or ios device seriously impressive stuff you can also view pretty much any stat you could ever want using the url genius platform so if this sounds like a service you want to try and use the first link down in the description to create an account and your first 500 clicks are free okay given that you're watching a video all about apps i can only assume that like me you love finding new and undiscovered applications right well app hunt is an application that can help you to do exactly that so the app finds new and somewhat undiscovered applications and brings them front and center making it really easy for you to find them now obviously you'll get the occasional dud given that these are fairly fresh apps but it's still a really useful tool and the fact that the application itself has a phenomenal ui and design is a nice bonus as well and then we have i a really simple screen recording application that is outrageously easy to use there is literally only one setting that you can change within the app itself whether to enable or disable your phone's microphone during a screen recording but aside from that you just tap the big eye in the center there and the recording starts what's great though is that the app will choose the best settings to ensure you get the highest quality without any lag or buffer every recording i've done using this app is sharp and crisp and more importantly super smooth so if simplicity is what you're after in a screen recording application well this app is a no brainer now sky tonight is a fantastic application if you're someone looking to level up your knowledge regarding the night sky want to know what that bright dot in the sky is just open up sky tonight and point your phone at it want to know what constellations are visible in any given location again just use sky tonight it's actually a really fascinating application with a whole heap of additional features worth looking into as well and i can honestly highly recommend it from there we have radia walls a wallpaper application filled with an abundance of diverse and creative backdrops that are sure to spice up just about any home screen so like most of my go-to wallpaper apps of choice these days the walls found in this application are all abstract and whilst there's quite a bit of range in terms of look and design they all still give off a minimal and elegant vibe which i love the app gets new wallpapers every single week so if you're in the market for a fresh backdrop well this app is worth a shower and finally we have spotify tools a really handy application that as the name suggests adds a range of additional tools to spotify so whether you want up-to-date statistics on your favorite artists or perhaps a list of lyrics to your favorite songs or even for spotify to start playing automatically when a certain bluetooth device gets connected this app packs all of that in plus a heap more not only that but you can also see a recap of your own listening stats at any time of the year rather than having to wait for spotify to do its yearly roundup at the end of the year pretty handy and just like that another month's top android apps episode is over but as mentioned i have a huge number of promo codes to give away for a stack of the applications featured in today's episode so a big thank you to the developers behind the apps on screen right now as they were all super kind enough to send me promo codes to the paid versions of their apps so that i could give them away to you lot as always i'll once again be giving these away over on my instagram stories in the next two to three weeks so make sure that you follow me over there to have a chance at winning but aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching thank you to url genius for supporting the channel and i will catch you later [Music] you
