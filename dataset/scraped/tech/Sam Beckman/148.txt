so a couple of weeks ago I posted over on Twitter and Instagram about a course that I was putting together on the topic of how to create Technology reviews and guess what it's now life so I've teamed up with the team at graphi to put together this in-depth course for their new and exciting platform now the course is not fully finished yet by section one and two alive ready for your viewing pleasure and to give you an idea of everything that's going to be covered in this in-depth course I've put together a little trailer so sit back relax and enjoy what's up everyone my name is Sam Beckman and I am a youtuber with a passion for technology and filmmaking I've been producing content for my youtube channel for the past five years and in that time I've amassed a huge Bank of knowledge as to what goes into creating high-quality and cinematic and Technology reviews so in this graphi we're going to deep deep into the process creating high-quality and cinematic reviews that will help me to stand out in this otherwise saturated field on YouTube in section one we'll look at the wires and the house of technology reviews and we'll even spend some time talking about how you can get your hands on tech to review in the first place section 2 will cover pre-production how to actually plan well for your videos then in section 3 we're going to dive deep headfirst into production in this section we're going to talk oreo and camera equipment cinematic lighting techniques the process of filming in a range of environments and regardless of whether you plan to shoot technology reviews or not this section will up the quality of your videos in any field that you might be working in from their section 4 will be all about editing and we'll discuss file management and a few techniques that'll help to make this process as efficient as possible in section 5 we'll cover VFX work and then in session 6 we'll discuss finalizing our projects we'll even spend some time talking about the YouTube algorithm and how we can make our videos stand out on the platform so it's super jam-packed we're gonna have loads of fun so without further adieu let's get started I'm hoping that that excites you as much as it does me and just as an FYI the price that the course currently is is subject to change it's kind of like an introductory or discounted price of sorts if you purchase the course right now at this current price then that's it you've paid your fee and anytime a new chapter is uploaded you'll be able to view it at no extra cost to you so I'd love it if you consider checking out my course using the links down in the description below if you've been wanting to support this channel and me as a creator then this is probably one of the best ways that you can do that aside from that thank you all very much for watching thank you for your ongoing support and I will catch you later [Music] all
