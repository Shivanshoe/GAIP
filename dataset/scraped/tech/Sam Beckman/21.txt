[Music] okay last year i spent about a month using and testing the iphone 13 pro extensively for my full review and let's just say i was super impressed as an android enthusiast through and through it was actually the first time ever that i found it hard to stop using an iphone and that is saying a lot but ultimately i did stop using it and i went back to using and reviewing android phones and to be completely honest i haven't really looked back since however just recently i thought it would be fun to actually put my sim card back into the iphone 13 pro and use it once more as my everyday device i guess i wanted to see how things have evolved six months down the line but more importantly i wanted to assess whether or not it's still a solid option for purchasing here in 2022 and so with that being said here is my updated review of the iphone 13 pro six months later all right let's start by talking about the things apple absolutely gets right with this device the first being the display after spending a lot of time with both the pixel 6 and 6 pro over the past few months i've got to say i've really appreciated how much brighter this panel is in comparison i really just have no problems viewing this screen in any conditions including harsh daylight and the other underrated part that i love about this display is how dim it can go not by using the brightness slider mind you but by activating the accessibility feature reduce white point i've actually got this set up as an accessibility shortcut so that whenever i hit the power button three times it'll activate and this makes a huge difference whenever i'm using the phone in really low light conditions oh and of course the fact that this panel is 120 hertz is still very much appreciated although something to keep in mind is that i pretty much notice no discernible difference between 120 hertz on the iphone 13 pro and 90 hertz on the regular pixel 6. that is something i was a little bit surprised by anyhow the other seriously amazing feature of this device is battery life as i said in my initial review i can still literally never kill this phone in a day even if i wanted to and so for me this device and the pro max version they are still the gold standard in regards to battery life [Music] now i'm not going to spend too much time talking about design because my thoughts now are very much the same as my first review which i'll of course link to up in the cards and down in the description below but it's a very brief overview thanks to the flat edges as well as that beautiful frosted matte finish on the back it's actually still one of my favorite feeling phones in the hand but what i will say is that if you're wanting to keep your own phone in pristine condition after several months or even years of use then i can highly recommend picking up a screen protector and a case from the sponsor of this video rhino shield rhino shield have just launched their brand new lineup of clear cases for iphone and these are unlike other clear cases on the market because you can actually customize them this means you can swap out the colors of the buttons similar to their mod nx and solid suit lineups and for the clear cases you can even customize the color of the camera ring for a really unique look they also have these great removable lanyards that can take your style to the next level or even prevent accidental drops brighter shield has also somehow solved the problem of that yellowing that often plagues other clear cases and to keep you reassured these also come with that same super impressive lifetime warranty just like all of rhinoshield's other cases plus there's also free worldwide shipping for qualified orders just to put the cherry on top the rest of rhinoshields cases provide the same top-notch protection and are highly customizable as well and if you use the code samclear at checkout you can actually have 20 off their cases in the first week of this video going live or 10 after that now the other aspect of the iphone 13 pro that i really raved about in my first review with the cameras with my main takeaway being that they were just super reliable and my opinion on that matter remains largely the same i think apple have pretty much nailed the configuration with a fantastic main lens a really wide and consistent ultra wide lens and a sharp three times telephoto lens and all three lenses feel very much the same regardless of which one you're using and i think that's what makes this camera configuration so impressive and reliable you don't have to sacrifice on image quality when switching between each of the lenses and that's often not the case with most android phones since that first review apple has also now added in this new macro toggle which you can use to manually disable that aggressive macro auto switching that some of us had issues with but keep in mind you've got to first enable this via the camera settings for it to actually show up now whilst that is definitely appreciated apple still hasn't addressed my complaint regarding how tapping that three times telephoto button won't actually always switch to the actual telephoto lens unfortunately it'll still sometimes in fact scratch that it'll often just digitally zoom in using the main lens instead and for me i'd really appreciate being able to disable this functionality because i often much prefer the results from the dedicated telephoto lens so i'd love apple to also address that like they did with the macro functionality but six months down the line i'll be honest and say i'm not holding my breath the other thing i need to address in regards to the cameras is something i referenced in my camera comparison of the iphone 13 pro and the pixel 6 pro in which i said you couldn't switch between any of the lenses after you hit record when capturing videos and whilst that is still true when shooting at 4k 60 if you drop down to 4k 24 or 4k 30 the lenses do then switch even after you hit record now on android devices if you're shooting in a mode not supported by all of the lenses then they simply don't show those buttons which makes complete sense right but the other thing is you can shoot at 4k60 using every single lens with the iphone 13 pro including a selfie camera so there's obviously some sort of software limitation here that prevents apple from activating this feature when shooting 4k 60 but then in my mind they should just hide those other lens toggles which i think would make a lot more sense that said this is a very small quibble in fact it's not really equivalent but it is something i needed to address given i spoke about it at length in that camera comparison video as for features like cinematic mode or photographic styles i'll be honest i haven't really used them all too much since putting my sim back into this phone however i have noticed a lot of other content creators using cinematic mode to create short form content online like instagram reels or tic top for example so in my mind i still consider it a fantastic feature the last thing i'll say about the cameras is in regards to video capturing and whilst i still think that the latest iphones are the best performers all around i do think that the competition is catching up with recently released galaxy s22 devices doing some really impressive stuff and even the pixel 6 pro i think is able to trade bars at times with the iphone 13 pro as well depending on the scenario all that being said though without question the cameras on this device are still by far the most reliable and consistent cameras on any phone right now [Music] right the last thing to talk about is the software and look by and large things are pretty much the same compared to when i first reviewed the phone if you haven't already it's probably worth watching my first reviews so you can get a better insight onto my thoughts regarding ios on the iphone 13 pro but once again i have actually found myself largely enjoying the experience of using ios yes it's still a bit of a hassle to customize the home screen which is something i love doing on any device i own however it is still possible and in fact i've even now hacked the shortcut automations to switch my wallpaper icons and theme whenever i press just this one shortcut on my home screen i'm planning on making an in-depth video explaining how to achieve this as well as a new step-by-step tutorial video showcasing how to recreate this particular setup so if you're not already make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out when those go live oh and if you've been liking the wallpapers you've been seeing throughout this video they're actually from my brand new wallpaper pack called brush and what's really cool is that i've got versions of each wallpaper that will completely hide your dock depending on whether you've got the light or dark mode activated link below if you want to pick them up but again even after all this time i still really like the things i like about ios like the fluidity and the reliability and i still find myself somewhat frustrated at the not quite their features like the app library or the notification system but overall it's still a really great software experience even dare i say if you're into customization like me so with that being said do i still think this phone is a worthy purchase six months down the line i mean yes yes i do i am definitely wary that we're now halfway between the release of this lineup and the next iphone 14 lineup so if you can hold on a little longer i reckon it's definitely worth waiting but if you can't this is still a fantastic phone that you will no doubt love using even more than that this is a phone that will fit effortlessly into your life and i think oftentimes that is what i value more in a phone doing its job doing it well and not getting in the way and this is a device that absolutely fits the bill a big thank you to rhino shield for supporting the channel don't forget to use the code same clear at checkout to get 20 off your order for the next week or 10 after that but aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
