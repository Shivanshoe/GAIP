all right different style of video today so we bought a house actually we bought a house a few years ago now but we've just been treating it as an investment property and renting it out while we've been living here in sydney but we've decided to do the place up and move in and of course i just had to document it so in this brand new series we're going to unpack the entire renovation process and we're also going to discuss how we went about saving a heck of a lot of cash along the way and also some of the bigger mistakes we made so that hopefully you can avoid making them in your own renovations today's episode is all about assessing where we were at right at the start of the renovation and i'll also walk through eight different money-saving tips that you might want to consider when starting your own renovations [Music] tip one only change what you need to okay so a bit of context this is a three-bedroom house on a block of land approximately 600 square meters in size we had new carpet laid straight away when we bought the house a few years ago new ceiling fans put in a fresh coat of paint on all of the walls and so whilst there might be one or two things that we address later on with these rooms they're not going to be a priority at the moment the main areas that we needed to address were the kitchen the bathroom the flooring throughout the house aside from the bedrooms the facade and of course the brick garage at the back which was an absolute eyesore and in serious need of being addressed so going back to our tip at the start of your renovation you need to decide what your non-negotiables are what are the things that you definitely want changed rain hail or shine for us we knew the brick garage out the back needed some serious work and we were prepared to spend the most amount of money to transform that into a big beautiful actually we'll cover that entire transformation in another video we also had strong feelings about the existing flooring in the house not in the three bedrooms but the timber floorboards out the back and also the tiles in the kitchen living area room so they had to be replaced in our mines and we were happy to pay a little bit extra to ensure the flooring looked really nice but aside from that the kitchen had a really decent and open layout the bathroom had a pretty decent layout as well and so whilst these areas still needed a lot of work these were the areas that we knew we could save some money on tip number two keep your existing layout now a huge money saving tip that we used throughout the process was to where possible keep the layout as it was prior to the renovation why is this a huge money saving tip well as soon as you start moving walls or windows or bathtubs and stoves well your budget will start to increase big time a big part of this particularly with a bathroom or kitchen renault is the plumbing so when we approached our bathroom and kitchen renovations we knew that we were gonna keep the layouts as they were and this is a really quick and easy way to save a lot of money tip number three makeover don't gut in some cases there's just nothing that you can do to save a space but if you can a really huge money saving technique is to avoid gutting out a space entirely and rather just to give it a makeover so when we say makeover this usually implies things like painting or just simply redecorating and so this is the technique that we applied when approaching our kitchen renovation so rather than replace the cabinetry all together we decided that we just paint them instead the cabinets were actually still in fairly good condition it was just the doors that looked super outdated the color of them was super tacky and so we thought if we slapped a few coats of white paint over the top and replaced the handles if we did all this ourselves rather than paying other people to do so then we could end up with a really nice result just for reference it cost me about 250 bucks to pick up the primer the top coats and the satin finish for all of the kitchen cabinets and then another 50 bucks or so for the new door handle so that's 300 bucks and you compare that to what would have cost around 10 000 australian dollars to replace all of the cabinetry with brand new cabinetry that's already a huge saving tip number four do it yourself so as i just mentioned another money saving tip is if there's something that you can do yourself in your time availability then that's going to save you a heck of a lot of money but i do need to emphasize that there is a little bit of a balance here if you try and do the entire renault yourself then there's a good chance that that'll take months longer than if you just got a professional in and that is time that you lose as well as that unless you're some multi-skilled professional builder which hey you might be but for most of us there's just some stuff in the renovation process that we just don't have the skills or expertise to know how to do ourselves so you need to figure out what you can do yourself what you're happy to spend the time learning to do and then what you prefer just to get the professionals in to do so as an example i was originally going to lay the new flooring myself but when i realized that the more cost effective materials would actually require special drop saws and a whole heap of precise measuring and probably two weeks worth of my time i decided you know what i'm just going to pay a professional to do it in two days and i'm really glad that i did but that said if you have a bunch of time up your sleeve maybe you want to work on a project over a long holiday period or maybe you've just hit retirement well then laying the flooring yourself may definitely be a viable option and it will certainly save you a lot of money but we knew we had to pay a plumber to do the bathroom we knew we had to pay a stonemason to cut the benchtop we knew we had to get an electrician to do all of the electrical work and so those were costs that we had to factor in tip number five take your time now another factor that actually limited our money saving but that might actually work for you was timing we wanted and in some cases needed a lot of these jobs to be completed before we moved in and we only had a few months up our sleeves but if you've got more flexibility than us then taking your time with a renovation can save you a lot of money it means you can get plenty of people into quote on your various jobs and then just go with the most affordable regardless of their time availability it also means you can spend the time working on a lot of the projects yourself so taking your time and doing things yourself are definitely two of the most money-saving techniques that you can use tip number six project manage the renovation yourself now one area we did save money on was that i actually ended up project managing the entire renovation myself depending on the size of your renovation this could be a huge task or it could be a tiny task but cutting out the middleman will save you a lot of money what it meant for me was lots of phone calls lots of emails lots of back and forth shopping around negotiating and scheduling and everything else but if you can project managing the renovation yourself will save you a ton of money tip number seven miscellaneous ways to save now there are of course other money saving hacks that you can try out along the way as well such as paying your contractors cash reusing materials where possible waiting for sales before you buy various home decor items selling old items that you're getting rid of like lights timber or doors for example and all of these techniques will help you to save a little bit of cash along the way but perhaps one of the most helpful ways to save money is to create a budget right at the start and then stick to it so for us we originally in our minds had a budget of around 70 000 australian dollars for all of the work that we wanted to complete but then by the time we were ready to start booking in contractors we actually lowered that amount to around 60 000 australian dollars and of course we broke that up into fixed amounts per space so 10 000 for kitchen and flooring 15 000 for the bathroom and laundry 20 000 for the garage and then another 10 000 for various issues that needed to dressing around the house so that left us with 5k wiggle room should anything have changed down the line now the 60 000 did not cover the facade renovation costs as this is actually a job that we're going to complete later on down the line and it also doesn't cover any furniture items that we buy as well these are costs that we're happy to absorb on top of our 60 000 budget but having that budget clearly identified right from the start gave us a really clear idea of what needed to happen going forward if you don't set a budget that is when things can blow out but that's it we're now ready to start renovating our house now i have alluded to some of the changes that we made throughout this video but in the remaining episodes of this series i'm going to tell you exactly what we did and i'm going to show you how the spaces ended up as well so if you're not already hit that subscribe button and that little notification bell so you don't miss out when i release new episodes of this series for
