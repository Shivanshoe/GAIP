alrighty folks it's been five months i think since my last q a video and so given the time of year where we're all recovering and coming down from the high that was christmas and the new year i thought it'd be fun to do another q a and so once again i reached out to you guys over on twitter instagram and here on youtube to see what questions you had for me i'm going to keep my answers a little briefer than the previous offerings to try and fit as many questions into the video but without further ado let's get to the answers all right this first one is from jb over on twitter and he asks what's your tips for small tech youtubers just starting out first and foremost and you hit this one all the time but that's because it's totally true and that is to post regularly when i started out i just committed to making and posting one new video every single week and i found that having that regularity in my schedule seemed to be really beneficial in regards to building an audience and i also now think that it's actually super beneficial in regards to how youtube places your videos into the algorithm but that's a topic for another day the second thing is to try and find a way to make your content unique and stand out which i know is a really tall order given how many tech channels exist today but even if it's just a very little component of your channel try and find something that makes it unique but then the final bit of advice is to make sure you really enjoy making the content that you're making and that you're not just making it to hopefully become a successful youtuber one day if your main motivation for making content is to become a successful youtuber then i can almost guarantee that you're gonna burn out fast and you'll probably never get there but if you love making the content that you're making and you're striving to develop in your filmmaking skills or in the way that you make videos full stop then after six months or a year or even a few years wherever your channel is at you'll at least be able to look back and be really proud of the content you've made and of your development in your own skills hopefully that helps this next question is from farzine who asks will you ever use a budget phone as a daily driver and i'm not really too sure what you mean by budget but in the past year or so i've actually used and reviewed the galaxy a525g the oneplus nord 2 the zte axon 30 and even the pixel 4a back in 2020 and if you didn't know whenever i review a phone it becomes my main everyday phone for at least two to three weeks before i then make the review so i personally think the answer is yes but given how fortunate i am to have access to a lot of high-end phones as well i'll probably never end up using one of those budget phones long term like for several months does that make sense this next question is from lordkevin2010 who asks do you plan on making more best apps not on the play store videos and this is a super easy one absolutely that series is one of the most successful series on the channel in 2021 so i'll absolutely be making at least a few more episodes in 2022 and beyond this is a cool question sent in from schlock gandhi who asks during any app testing what are some of the red flags for you and what are the priority features requirements for the app to be featured in your videos well for one the actual concept of the application has to be one i find somewhat interesting although sometimes i realize it's been a little while since i've featured a weather app for example so i'll actually go on the hunt for a new slightly undiscovered one to showcase as well but i actually build up a short list of about 20 to 30 apps per top apps video based purely on the description and screenshots of the app from the google play store and then i'll actually go ahead and install every single one to assess firstly its design but then secondly its functionality and if both of those two features are solid and they appeal to me then as long as it's not filled with a stack of ads it'll most likely get a feature all right this next question comes from instagram from leswatch66 who asks what phone is your daily driver and why and the short answer for that is the regular pixel six mainly because of the software the performance things like the haptics but then i also much prefer its build over the more expensive six pro and that's pretty much down to the fact that it has mat rails and a flat display i suggest watching my full in-depth review of this phone to see more about all of those reasons in a lot more detail oh this one is huge comes from mr p534 who asks what is your favorite app of all time and this is a very tough question to answer i'm obviously going to skip out on all those super mainstream apps like twitter or instagram i'm also obviously not allowed to say my own app because that would be incredibly biased but link below to a video where you can learn more about that but i think if i had to say just one it would be an application i absolutely rely on to keep all of my tasks and reminders in check and that is memory i've mentioned this app many times on the channel but aside from the functionality it's the design and the animations just the flow of the app it's so damn impressive to me i love it this next one is from prashanth who asks do you use dark or light mode and this is an easy one i have my system theme set to a schedule so light mode kicks on at 6 00 am and then it switches to dark mode automatically at 10 p.m all right over to the youtube questions now and this next one comes from who's jmc games who asks what's your best technique to overcome procrastinating i actually made a full video that covered a bunch of tips to improve productivity for filmmaking which i'll link up the cards if you're interested but i reckon my top tip from that video that i think is still super invaluable is to create super itemized to-do lists like super itemized so instead of having create x video on your to-do list for the week ahead which is a massive potentially overwhelming thing to complete instead you should break that up into every little component you can think of like complete draft script finalized script film top down film outdoor b-roll film a-roll edit a-roll and so on and so forth and then that way you'll be checking things off your list left right and center which feels amazing and you'll also quickly learn how long each of those things takes to complete which means if you're doing this regularly you'll be able to really effectively plot out your schedule and maximize your time efficiency this next one is a really great question it comes from tanuge not sure if i'm saying that correctly but they ask why does every reviewer have light mode enabled when reviewing a phone i'd never really noticed this before but as soon as i saw the question i knew the answer immediately and i thought the answer might be interesting to you now there are actually two parts of the answer the first is reflections the second part is screen flickering so a phone's display is glass right and glass is inherently reflective right now when you put something bright behind that glass like a white screen then the reflection becomes pretty much invisible whereas when you put something black behind the glass it becomes as reflective as a window for example and for tech reviewers that is a nightmare we're trying to avoid showing reflections on the phone's screens and so we will do whatever it takes to eliminate that as best as possible and one solution is to make sure where possible whatever is on the display is bright and not dark so that's the main answer but i also find that phone screens seem to flicker just a little bit on camera whenever something dark is on the screen i'm not sure if that's the same experience for other phone reviewers out there but i definitely don't see flickering as much when i've got something light on the screen hopefully that helps but fantastic question right last question for today comes from blaine who asks is rooting worth it in 2022 i'm going to try and keep this answer short but if you checked out my recent how to use banking apps on rooted devices video then you'll know that my pixel 6 is in fact still rooted and it's still my everyday device so the definitive answer for me when using a pixel phone is yes i wouldn't find it as necessary to root other phones that let you customize the default home screen launcher more so than what the pixel devices do but as long as safety net is passing and i'm still able to use the apps i want to use without them breaking then yes rooting is definitely worth it here in 2022 but that's it a huge thank you to everyone that sent in questions
