[Music] so around two months ago i uploaded my latest what's on my phone video which featured the setup you're currently seeing on screen created using the oneplus launcher itself now in that video i said that if it reached 4 000 likes then i would go about creating a step-by-step instructional video unpacking how to recreate this setup on your own phones and not too long ago the video did indeed cross 4 000 likes much faster than i anticipated so well done you but here we are with the full tutorial so let's dive in and get our phones set up so we're going to start with how the oneplus launcher looks by default when you load your oneplus device up for the very first time and let's start by jumping into our settings to get everything set up correctly here first so let's start by turning off this add icon to home screen option then we'll head into our icon pack settings and change the icon to the white icon pack which of course will be linked below then we'll check that to set it and jump back into our settings now we'll tap on our home screen layout menu and change the grid size to 5x6 we'll then change our icon size to the smaller setting here and then we'll also hide our app names as well lock that in by tapping the check mark icon and now it's time to start removing everything that is on the home screen by default so all of our widgets the apps on the home screen and the apps on the dock and this will give us a completely clean slate to set things up exactly how we want it hey real quick before we move on just wanted to give a quick shout out to today's video

finding similar wallpapers and we'll just make sure to set it as the backdrop for both the home screen and the lock screen now that that's done we'll load in our first widget here by long pressing the screen coming down to the kwgt section and dragging a 2x2 widget to the top of our home screen now we'll resize it so that it fills out the entire width of our screen and we'll extend the bottom of the widget size by one grid length we'll now tap on that and launch into the kwgt menu so the first widget comes from the shadow kwgt pack and it's widget double one so we'll tap on that and then we'll head over to the layer tab and tap here where it says scale we'll adjust this number to 65 then we'll head back and go over to our globals tab and we'll switch off the fx card toggle to remove the white glow drop shadow which will just flatten out the appearance of the widget just a touch now we'll go back to the items tab and tap on the overlap group then we'll go to the layer tab and change the scale setting to 106. then we'll go to the position tab and change the y offset setting to 160 to set it right to the bottom of this widget then we'll go to the items tab and select card 1 and then we'll go to the touch menu and tap the plus icon at the top here then tap where it says none and then none again and change this action to launch shortcut then we'll tap the shortcut space below that scroll down to the settings shortcuts and then scroll down and select battery then we'll head back twice and tap on card two once again over the touch tab and we'll hit the plus icon then again where it says none then none again and then this time we'll change the action to launch app now from the app menu we'll scroll all the way down to the frog weather shortcut application and this has been linked below if you don't already have this installed okay let's head back twice and this time tap the bottom overlay group we'll head over to the touch menu tap the plus icon and the two none buttons and then change this action to launch app and then from the app selector we'll scroll down and select calendar then we'll go back into that overlap group and select the time text layer the one right down the bottom jump over to the touch tab go through the menus to select the launch app action again and we'll scroll down to the clock okay now we'll save that widget we'll head back home and we'll tap on each component of the widget so the battery information the weather information the date and the clock just to make sure that each component of the widget opens up the correct app or shortcut and as you can see this is indeed the case here with my widget so now we're ready to move on okay now we'll head into our app drawer and we'll start bringing in each of the icons that are going to sit on our home screen so for me it's the messages app the gmail application the phone application the youtube creator studio app twitter and google maps and these are laid out as you can see in a three by two configuration then we'll long press our home screen again and we'll head into the widget selector menu and we'll scroll down and insert a one by one kwgt widget we'll long press to resize just widen the width out so it lines up with the above icons then we'll tap on that and head into the kwgt menu so from here we're going to set up our search icon widget by going into the waffle kwgt pack and selecting widget 35 you may need to scroll down a fair bit to find it once you've selected it we'll then tap on this stack group here then select the top stack group and delete it then tap on the remaining stack group select the bottom stack group here and delete that as well then we'll swipe over to the layer tab and set the margin to 200 then we'll go over to the position tab and set the top padding to 75 now we'll head back to the items tab and tap on this overlap group then we'll go over to this overlap group's layer tab and set the scale to 175 then swipe over to the position tab and set the t padding to 0 and the b padding to 25 now we'll go back to the items tab tap on this top shape layer here and swipe over to the paint tab we'll tap the color selector here drag this over to the white then tap the white box to select that as the new color then we'll head back and tap this bottom icon here head over to the paint tab and change this color to black now we'll head back and all we need to do now is swipe over to the touch layer tap where it says launch app then we'll tap where it says launch app again and change this to launch activity now we'll tap where it says google and come all the way down to the google section tap on that and select the option that ends with query entry activity the idea here is that it will launch straight into the typing action for a google search rather than just a full screen google page so let's save that and come back home and we'll tap that widget to make sure that it works and lo and behold there we go okay with that done let's go about creating our second page we'll first need to long press our home screen to select the widgets menu and then we'll swipe down and select a 2x2 kwgt widget and drag it over to create a second page then we'll expand the size of this so that it fills the entire width of this home screen okay let's tap on that and here we're going to use another shadow kwgt widget this one is widget 0 13. so we'll select that then i'll swipe over to the layer tab and set the scale to 70. [Music] then i'll go over to our globals and turn off this fx card toggle here to again remove that white drop shadow while we're here we'll swipe over to our touch page tap the menu here then tap where it says custom action and change this to launch app then we're going to once again select the frog where the shortcut application is the app to launch then we'll go back to our items tab tap on this overlap group here and i'm going to select the top and bottom layers and delete both of them then i'll tap on the new bottom widget here the one labeled w2 swipe over to the position tab and i'll change the top padding to 550 so it lines up with the widget on the left then we'll head back and then over to our position tab and change the y offset to negative 20. then we'll save that come back home and make sure that that works as expected which it does okay now we'll start loading in this page's icons so this time it's a three by three configuration i first got the play store then the youtube app and instagram then google chrome whatsapp and microsoft outlook then spotify pocketcasts and finally a shortcut to my work timetable which i've created using the shortcut creator application and then i've changed the icon to a timetable looking icon within the white icon pack and that is it for our two home screens the next step is to launch into our app drawer swipe left to access the hidden space and i'm going to select every single app that i don't need direct access to so background apps customization apps and any bloatware or apps that are doubled up that i don't use they all get put into this hidden space which helps to keep my app drawer nice and tidy so i don't spend ages sifting through it to find the apps that i actually want this is seriously an amazing feature and i wish that google would implement this with their own pixel launcher now the last thing to do here is to replace all of these app icons with icons from the white icon pack so this is a fairly monotonous process you simply long press an icon tap on the edit button and select your icon pack of choice sometimes an icon will be suggested for you at the top which is so great when that happens but other times you'll have to sift through until you find an icon that kind of looks like the app it's representing and this is because the icon pack itself is yet to officially support that application now i'm not going to bore you with that entire process in this video so that is it for the entire home screen setup using the oneplus launcher itself if i could request two small things from oneplus it would first be to give us an even wider range of grid sizes to choose from even just an option to have six icons horizontally across and also to give us an option to either hide the dock all together or at least to hide this little swipe up arrow icon which i think kind of takes away from the really clean look of this home screen setup oh and if they could give us support for custom folder icons then that would be an absolute game changer but that's it for my home screen setup i hope this has been helpful in getting your own home screen set up to look like mine and if there are any issues definitely feel free to drop a comment down below and i'll do my best to hit you up with a response aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching thank you hostinger for the support and i will catch you [Music] later [Music] you
