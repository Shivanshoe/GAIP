so this is the expand adt a premium scalable bluetooth speakerphone from epos with some really impressive features built in if you watched my previous video on the adapt 660 headset and you'll know that epos is an audio and video company that creates products that are all about enabling consumers to communicate more seamlessly and the adt is another product in their impressive lineup created with this exact goal in mind quick disclaimer this video is sponsored by epos so as with the last one this video will also just be a showcase of the expand adt and not a proper review but with that said let's chat about the expand adt by epos as always we'll start with the design so the speakerphone was actually designed in scandinavia and you can tell it's been produced using super premium materials and yet it's fairly compact and lightweight at the same time the top is covered in this high quality fabric and it's also got a metal rail all the way around the top but the bottom is made out of plastic but overall it feels like a really well-built and solid speakerphone now in terms of buttons they're all located on the top side here and starting over on the left we have our bluetooth pairing button in the middle are our answer and end call buttons the ladder of which also doubles as our power button over to the right are our volume toggles and in the middle is our microphone mute button and then because this variant that i have is the t model of the expand 80 lineup on the other side we have our microsoft teams quick access button and this will act as an assistant toggle if you're not using microsoft teams and that's one of the main differentiators about the adt is that this has microsoft team certification and so with the regular version of this speakerphone this button will just act as a regular assistant button now if we flip the speakerphone over on the bottom here you'll notice that there's this recess section of the speaker and this kind of looks like it's meant for batteries but in actual fact it's this really neat cable management solution so you connect all of your various external microphones or usb cables as well as your power supply into the ports within this recess and all of the excess cables can be tucked away neatly within this section with runways incorporated every which way to allow the cables to run out smoothly and into whatever they need to run into it's a really neat touch that makes keeping things neat and organized an absolute breeze on the side beneath our microsoft teams button we have our usb dongle slot and this just helps to keep the bluetooth usb dongle that comes with the speakerphone secure and in an easy to locate position which is great now in terms of audio quality this is top shelf stuff here from epos a rich yet supernatural sound profile and it features this powerful ultra low distortion speaker that's uniquely suspended in this speaker box and this enables the expand adt to provide more than enough sound to fill an entire room yet with no distortion whatsoever so that's the basics but let's now talk about what makes the expand adt so good for meeting conferences so firstly it features what's called double talk performance now this is sometimes referred to as duplex performance but what it essentially means is that if you have multiple meeting attendees interrupting each other or trying to talk at the same time it does so in a really natural way now normally if you were to just leave everyone's microphones open and active all the time this would create sound loops and the experience would be chaos but epos combats this by using cutting edge audio cancelling technology which means the expand adt can actually leave everyone's microphones open all the time without any of those nasty sound loops really impressive stuff and then the next really incredible feature are the beamforming microphones there are six of these low noise microphones embedded within the expand adt and they're set up in a horizontal configuration which allows up to seven participants in a single meeting room to be heard clearly the six microphones essentially create an audio lens that can then zoom in on any voice that it detects within a 360 degree radius as well as that there's also a digital signal processor that can intelligently distinguish between human voices and background noises and so all of this combined means that anyone who might be talking in a meeting room at any given time well they'll be heard crystal clear to anyone on the other end of the call you can also use their additional expand adt microphone add-ons to increase the amount of meeting participants but what i want to try and do now is demonstrate just how impressive the microphones in the expand adt actually are so to do this we're going to do a really simple test using three devices firstly my 2020 13 inch macbook pro which i think is equivalent to what a lot of people end up using for conference calls these days then we're going to use a fairly inexpensive bluetooth speaker that i've owned for a while now and then finally of course we're going to incorporate the expand adt so what we're going to do is we're going to test each of these devices in two different environments firstly a controlled studio environment with a ceiling fan turned on and i think this will be fairly similar to a meeting or conference room environment so that'll be a fairly interesting test but then we're going to take each of these devices outside as well and i think this will be a really interesting test for background noise in particular but also just how each of the microphones perform in slightly trickier conditions i've also recorded an environmental ambient track using my studio condenser shotgun microphone running in to my zoom h4n and i'll splice this in at different points throughout just to give you an idea of the background noises present and this will give you an idea as to how each device is doing at reducing those background noises this is an audio test testing one two three testing one testing123 this is an audio test testing123 testing123 this is an audio test testing one two three testing one two three this is an audio test testing one two three testing one two three this is an audio test testing one two three testing one two three [Music] this is an audio test testing one two three testing one two three [Music] and there you have it in my mind the results speak for themselves and whilst this definitely isn't a scientific test by any means i'm hoping that they'll at least give you a little glimpse as to how impressive the microphones actually are on the expand adt if you want to learn more about the expand adt then definitely check out the links down in the description below but aside from that hopefully you found this video helpful thank you all very much for watching thank you epos for supporting the channel and i will catch you later [Music] you
