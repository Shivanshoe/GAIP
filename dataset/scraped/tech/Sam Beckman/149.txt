you know there's apps where you start using them and you're like how is this not been thought of before well say cheese is definitely one of those apps you simply install the app on to devices your own and a friends for example locate each other's device in the setup process and then BAM just like that you can now use one phone as a remote shutter to take a group picture in a flash pun intended with that we are back we'd get another episode of the top Android apps let's get cracking event flow is for those who dig a home screen calendar widget this app seems to combine the best of both worlds in that it's beautifully designed and it's nice to look at which is obviously super important but it also doesn't skimp out on the functional side of things either and it works just as a calendar or agenda widget should there are heaps and heaps of customization options within the app itself and honestly that's really all there is to say it's a very decent calendar widget application what else can I say movie clips is a fantastic video editing application that makes putting together a quick edit an absolute breeze and a huge shout out to the team at movavi that were kind enough to sponsor today's episode it's got a really clean PC like interface that makes organizing clips and making cuts ridiculously easy and it also has a huge range of additional features such as adding filters or adjusting the color of your Clips you can add in background music or record voiceovers you can also add sticker overlays or text plus there's a bunch more all of which will really help to make your videos creative and unique the app is available for both Android and iOS and it's completely free to use though for a small fee you can upgrade to get a few additional features and remove the watermark but it's a super useful editing app and it's definitely worth trying out valve is a no-nonsense application that makes catching up on news articles and impressively seamless part of the day so firstly the design of this app is on point the way you flick through articles is super satisfying and it just has a really overall clean look to it that makes navigating user interface a really pleasant experience but more than that what's key is how easy the app makes it to catch up on news each of the articles are curated and they're all around 70 words in total meaning that can be read in approximately nine seconds perfect for our somewhat limited attention spans these days Dolby on is a sound recording application that makes recording high-quality audio a really quick process what have you tap the record button the app will ask you to stay silent and it will then use that silence to analyze the background noises that might occur during the recording to reduce them after the fact the recordings also utilize a bunch of automatic studio effects like limiting or EQ enhancing spatial audio plus a bunch more and there's even a range of handy editing tools that makes refining your audio directly within the app a really fast process it's no secret that I'm not a big fan of phones with curved displays and one of the big reasons for this are the accidental touches that's so often occur but edge block is an application that is designed to help the app is fully customizable making it really easy to dial in which edges are blocked and how wide the touch rejection area is and you can also quickly pause the feature using the persistent notification it also still somehow works flawlessly alongside the Android 10 back gesture functionality which is an impressive feat in and of itself smash is another in a long line of online file transfer apps but this one is so clean and simple that it might just be my new favorite so the functionality is as to be expected you tap the smash it button select your file of choice and the file gets uploaded as a URL that you can share to whoever you desire you don't need to register to use the app your data is encrypted as you transfer it and amazingly there are no file size limits which is incredible the design is super minimal which I love but the best part is that it's completely free bundled notes is a fresh of the press note taking application that somehow finds a unique approach to an otherwise tried-and-true genre of application it features a fresh design language with cool little animations on show throughout but of course its functionality is what makes it shine the app uses bundles which are essentially containers that you create to group your differing notes together and this makes it really easy to sort through different categories to find the content you're looking for it's also online for cross device syncing there's also a bunch of other really cool hidden features it's definitely an app worth trying out action blocks isn't that made by an upcoming developer that goes by the name of Google and essentially allows users who otherwise may struggle to take advantage of the Google assistant to take advantage of pretty much anything that you can ask the Google assistant to do can be set up as a tappa boleyn using this app so whether that be calling a specific contact or starting a video call with someone or perhaps playing a particular video all of these actions can be set up and in place as a big easy to identify button on the users home screen I can see this being potentially a really handy feature for those with elderly friends or family for example who otherwise might have struggled to utilize the Google assistant so do them a favor set them up with a few action blocks and make their life just that little bit easier troop X is an app that makes finding unique homes setups just about as easy as searching Sam Backman Nova Launcher on YouTube you can sift through a range of really creative and fun looking setups and the great part is that when you click on a set up your life you're presented with all of the information you might need to load that set up onto your own device the launcher application the icon and widget pack used the name of the wallpaper and you can even tap on the various assets to be redirected to where you can download each of them if you love customization as much as I do then you will love this app but that's it if you liked the video and you enjoy this sort of content then a sub would be amazing and if you want to watch more up videos like this one then I'll leave a playlist linked in the cards and down in the description below but aside from that hopefully you enjoy the video thank you all very much for watching and I'll catch you later [Music]
