[Music] so this is the pixel 6 the regular version and for anyone who saw my review of the pixel 6 pro you'll know that that was the phone i was using right before this one so that made for a very interesting experience switching directly from what is the more expensive more feature-rich variant of the pixel 6 lineup to the still premium but definitely more budget-friendly variant and i've got to say it's been a very eye-opening and even surprising month using this phone and i've been chomping at the bit to share my thoughts with you so let's dive in as always we'll start with the design and without question this phone looks very similar to the six pro in fact from the back the two phones are nearly identical with the only real discernible difference being that the top section of the regular pixel 6 is about 30 smaller but despite it being a little shorter the phone still feels nearly as hefty so if you're a fan of big phones great but if you're used to a more compact form factor well this one will still take some getting used to now that said the phone actually feels quite a bit different in the hand thanks to two key design differences firstly these matte black rails along the side of the phone on the six pro you get shiny rails which actually makes the phone feel a little too slippery in the hand for my liking and so i've really appreciated having a matte finish for the rails on the regular six but then the second design difference is the flat display as we all know google opted for a curved display on the 6 pro i guess to emulate a really premium design language but from a functional point of view a flat display always makes for a much nicer experience both in regards to holding the phone but also in regards to using it or at least that's what i think and so save for the glossy finish on the back i've actually found that this phone feels very similar in the hand to the pixel 4 xl from a couple of years ago which was one of my favorite phones of all time in terms of how it felt in the hand i actually complained about the size of the pixel 6 lineup in my review of the 6 pro but in all honesty the flat display and matte rails have seriously improved how this phone feels in hand and i know the bezels are a fair bit thicker compared to those found on the 6 pro i'm not really too sure why google wasn't able to make them as small and consistent as they did with last year's pixel 5 which also had a flat display but despite this in terms of design i actually prefer the regular six over the six pro except for one thing so this speaker grille on the regular six is actually just ever so slightly bigger than the one on the six pro and it's resulted in this thing collecting a lot of dust and it's borderline impossible to clean as well as well as that as i mentioned in my review of the six pro i really do wish google had opted for a matte finish on the back of this lineup rather than the glossy finish we actually have gee they got close to smashing the design of the regular pixel 6 out of the park but if a phone has a glossy back it definitely loses a point in my books thankfully once again channel sponsor dbrand is here to save the day and they just released their brand new leather lineup of skins which i pleaded for them to send my way which they did and so i'm now rocking a black leather skin for the bottom section of the phone and this beautiful tan leather skin for the top section and boy oh boy does this combo look damn sexy and even more than that the phone feels so much better in the hand now no more fingerprints no more slipperiness just a beautiful matte finish that looks and feels incredible they also have a stack of other options to choose from on their website like this beautiful white marble and black leather combo i'm rocking on my 6 pro so if you want to pick up your own set of skins from dbrand check out the first link down in the description below or head to dbrand.com [Music] all right with design out of the way let's just quickly chat about haptics and one of the things i mentioned in my review of the 6 pro was that whilst the haptics were excellent they were just a little too in your face and i could do not as soon as i booted up the regular six and started using it the first thing i noticed were the haptics they still felt incredible but they were a little more subtle and to be honest they reminded me of the amazing haptics we had back with the pixel 4 flagship lineup which until now in my opinion has been unmatched in the android world so for me the haptics are actually better than the pro version thanks pretty much exclusively to their subtlety and i don't know if it's my imagination or what but i've actually also found the fingerprint sensor on the regular 6 to be ever so slightly more reliable compared to the 6 pro as well and what's given this away for me is that i've found myself thinking about it less with the 6 pro anytime i unlocked the phone i was always getting frustrated with the fingerprint sensor but with the 6 it really hasn't come to mind much at all now it's still not blazingly fast or up there with xiaomi's and samsung's top end phones and i really wish google would add a face unlock feature just using the selfie cam perhaps via a software update which might actually eliminate most of the issues i have with the sensor but either way the fingerprint sensor on the pixel 6 is still somehow definitely a step above the 6 pro and for anyone wondering about the speakers to my ears at least i reckon they actually sound better than the more premium 6 pro but you can let your ears do the talking [Music] so [Music] okay from there we turn to the display and this is the first real downgrade compared to the six pro instead of a 120 hertz refresh rate the regular 6 has a maximum refresh rate of 90 hertz let me be clear though the only times you will actually notice this difference is in one of two scenarios either after you first switch from using a device with a 120hz panel or if you're actually using the phone next to a device with a 120 hertz panel and let's be real how often are either of those two scenarios actually taking place so after a couple of hours honestly i really didn't notice the difference anymore and to me 90 hertz has still felt really smooth now do i wish that they went with a 120 hertz panel of course but 90 hertz is honestly still good enough for a phone i'm using every day so i'm assuming it'll be good enough for you as well aside from that though it's just as bright as the six pro's display and it actually has better off access performance with less of that blue shift as you tilt the phone in other words while it's not the brightest on the market it's still a pretty great display and what you might lose out on in regards to fluidity thanks to the 90 hertz downgrade i think you definitely make up for it in spades in regards to battery life my experience with battery life on the 6 pro was about average not bad but not great but for some reason battery life on the regular 6 has been far better i'm getting through every single day no problems at all and in fact with light use i've been ending some days with around 60 to 70 percent of battery left which is really impressive so if battery life is a big priority for you man this phone is actually a really solid performer and speaking of performance the phone has the same in-house tensor chip as the pixel 6 pro and so accordingly the experience of using this phone has been virtually identical very snappy very fluid and even the same bucks yeah that one kind of surprised me as well so that issue where the display clocks itself down to 60 hertz without rhyme or reason it's also been happening on the six and that occasional stutter of the keyboard yep that also happens as well and i've actually had a new bug with this device where once or twice a day my notifications will for some reason stop making sounds and they will only return after a reboot super weird so obviously we're still waiting on fixes from google for each of these issues but aside from that it has actually been a really solid performer i think a lot of what makes it feel so good though is actually thanks to the software i covered this in a lot of detail in my review of the six pro so i'm not going to go into as much detail in this video but the long and short of it is that with the introduction of android 12 google has implemented all of these beautiful yet subtle animations system-wide that just make using the phone a true joy now if you're wondering how i managed to pull off this slick home screen setup which looks nothing like the default pixel launcher well that's actually because i'm using a third-party launcher called launcher 12 in combination with an app called quick switch and if your phone is rooted this app allows you to set any supported third-party launcher which right now is only thought share 12 as the default home screen launcher this means it gets full access to the gestural navigation system meaning all of those super fluid animations remain intact and the reasons page feels as smooth as it should the cool thing is i've actually managed to root the pixel 6 whilst also simultaneously being able to use google pay and an app called service new south wales both of which are normally broken on a rooted phone so as someone who loves customization thanks to that and to the developers behind launch air 12 i've actually enjoyed the software experience of the pixel 6 more than 6 pro but let me stress that's not the six pro's fault it's only because i couldn't be bothered rooting that phone as well all right the last thing we need to discuss are the cameras and for me this is where you really see the difference between the regular six and 6 pro now firstly we do still have the exact same improved 50 megapixel main sensor that we have on the 6 pro which can capture phenomenal images and videos in pretty much all lighting scenarios in fact when it comes to daytime shots it's probably my favorite main lens on the market right now we do also have the exact same slightly under performing ultrawide lens which is far tied up than most other ultrawide lenses on the market as well as a bit softer as well but the two key differences compared to the six pro in regards to the camera configuration are firstly the lack of a telephoto lens and secondly that inferior selfie camera now when it comes to the photo side of things you can kind of get part of the way towards feeling like you've got a telephoto lens thanks to google's super resume technology although it'll never really get close to the real thing but for me the big downside is when you switch to capturing telephoto videos as someone who has two kids often playing in the backyard or at a park several yards away i really do like having the option to capture quality videos using a telephoto lens and that's just not simply an option on the regular six so that's definitely a letdown for me but then the selfie camera is also far worse compared to the one found on the six pro for one it doesn't have that ultra wide field of view which i really do love having on the six pro but it's also a fair bit softer as well post processing can improve things a fair amount but then when you switch to filming videos it's actually capped to a max resolution of 1080p whereas the 6 pro can capture 4k selfie videos now i can get over the selfie camera it's really not that big of a deal for me but the lack of a telephoto lens is definitely something i personally miss that said i can see why google admitted it to make sure there were just enough differences between this phone and the six pro but what i'd like to see in the future is google adding an additional zoom lens on their pro lineup like a ten times lens and then adding in let's say a three times lens on their regular lighter that would be amazing as for all of the other specialty camera features like magic eraser or action pan they're all still here and i covered them in detail in my pixel 6 pro vs iphone 13 pro camera comparison video so i'll link that up in the cards and down in the description below but look telephoto lens or lack there of a side whichever way you put it for me the regular pixel 6 really is a contender for phone of the year it's got a fantastic build top-tier haptics a really great display and the software experience is unparalleled the main camera is also one of the best you can get but more than anything the price is phenomenal you really cannot get a better phone at launch for the price that this one was at launch and so in all honesty if samsung and apple and other brands don't follow suit with the launch price of their phones in a similar tier next year then google deserves to take the crown in this pricing category and if they do match google's launch price then we can all be very thankful to google for essentially forcing their hands either way if you're in the market for a new phone at about this price category unless you desperately want a telephoto lens well the pixel 6 is a phone i have absolutely no issues recommending [Music] you
