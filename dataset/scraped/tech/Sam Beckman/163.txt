it's finally here this is the oneplus 8 pro i finally received it in the mail yesterday and i've been setting it up slowly over the past day or so trying to get it ready to switch over to using this device full time and i have just taken the plunge i've moved my sim from the pixel 4 xl to the oneplus 8 pro and i wanted to get a quick video up giving you my first impressions letting you know that i've got it in house but before we do that let's unbox it [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do [Music] as i said this is just a quick first impressions and unboxing video i will be working on the in-depth review which will be posted in the next two to three weeks so standby for that let me know what you want to see in that in the comments down below as well but i've been really excited about this particular phone the oneplus 8 pro mainly because i feel like it is a true competitor to what samsung's just released with the s20 liner if you haven't already seen my in-depth review of the s20 plus then i'll leave a link to it down below but the reason why i see this as a true competitor is that it's got a lot of the same features as the s20 liner so let's think about it for a moment the s20 and the oneplus 8 pro both share a very similar display it's got curved edges it's got the hole punch although this one is off to the left at the top not sure my thoughts on that i'll let you know in the full review and it's also 120 hertz oled it's also a very vivid sharp bright display one of the best if not a match for the s20 plus it might even exceed it and you'll have to wait and see in my full in-depth review for my thoughts compared to the s20 plus on the display on this phone but without a doubt the display and the design of the front of this phone looks very similar to the s20 liner one difference that you may or may not pick up on is the fact that you can actually run the panel at 120 hertz with its full qhd resolution enabled at the same time now that's gonna definitely eat into your battery life i have mine set to full hd at the moment and it still looks like a very sharp and vivid display we'll see whether or not i decide to switch over and feel like that improves the overall experience when it comes to using this phone for my full review but it is nice that at least we have the option here both phones have in-display fingerprint sensors i'm not really a big believer of in-display fingerprint sensors although this one i have enjoyed using more than the one on the s20 plus we'll see if that holds true for the next couple of weeks but again both phones have that same in-display fingerprint sensor functionality both the 8 pro and the s20 lineup also offer the highest end specs that you can currently get they start at 8 gigabytes of ram with 128 gigabytes of internal storage and depending on where you buy the s20 lineup of phones they also both have the highest end snapdragon 865 processor which is the highest that you can get at this current time so both phones are going to be the best android performers at this point in time both devices also have official ip68 water and dust resistance ratings which is really nice to have for the first time on a oneplus phone so it matches the s20 lineup in that regard and then also on top of that this time the oneplus 8 pro has seen a pretty huge upgrade in terms of its cameras and i think it is a really similar comparison to what we've seen with the photos and videos coming out of the s20 lineup of phones now of course we're gonna have to wait for the full review to have a really good look at the cameras on the oneplus 8 pro lineup and see if that assumption that i've made holds true but again from what i've seen online so far and just in my short experience of using the phone so far i'm really impressed with the upgrades they've made to the cameras on this phone in no way shape or form am i expecting these cameras to take the lead in any way or even match the quality that we see on the iphone 11 pro lineup and the pixel 4 lineup but that said the fact that they can potentially hold up to the quality that we're seeing on the images and videos taken on the s20 lineup of phones is a really promising aspect of the oneplus 8 pro lineup there are obviously lots of subtle differences between the oneplus 8 pro and the s20 lineup of phones but the biggest difference that i'm really excited about is the software now believe it or not even though this phone has only just been released it is already really easy to unlock the bootloader and root and in fact i have already done that now if you're wondering why i'd even root a phone as new or as flexible as the oneplus 8 pro then i'll leave a link to a couple of my recent what's on my phone videos where i explain why i do that in a little bit more detail but essentially when a phone is this easy to root and unlock the bootloader then i do it the short of it is it just gives me a little bit more flexibility down the road and that's particularly true for me living here in australia where sometimes the phones i get shipped are actually a little bit more locked down and restricted compared to the ones that are released in the states for example some features aren't enabled now that probably isn't the case with the oneplus 8 pro but again it just gives me some freedom to be able to tweak the phone and have fun with it a little bit later on but again the fact that oneplus makes it this easy for their phones to be rooted and have the bootloader unlocked is a testament to their whole mentality around software development and so on and so forth and that is also reflected in their software experience which for mine has viewed a little bit too far off what i generally prefer in terms of the whole pixel experience that's always been my preferred flavor of choice but again the fact that they offer you lots of flexibility in their software is a really appreciated factor i will say in pretty much every phone review these days i'll talk about the always on display implementation because it's one of my favorite must-have features when it comes to using a phone with an oled panel and i think because i'm so obsessed with the implementation that google has loaded onto their pixel lineup of phones and oneplus is probably the worst of the lot in this regard in that they are still yet to actually offer an always on display feature now after lots and lots of user feedback oneplus have finally said that they will bring back and always on display implementation for their oneplus lineup of phones which is amazing they said it's going to happen in the near future who knows what new future means that could mean next year potentially hopefully that's wrong and it's really soon that we see and always on display implementation because it's actually a feature i really miss not having but then the last really big similarity between this phone and the s20 lineup of phones is not a good one for the first time and it's the price man this thing was just as expensive as the s20 plus was for me to buy and you heard that right this is a phone that i purchased myself it's not a review unit unfortunately i didn't end up getting sent one but that said the price of this phone was pretty hard to swallow oneplus has always been known to undercut the prices of other flagship devices whilst being able to offer as good and sometimes even better an experience and so this is their first truly flagship priced phone and it is as i said pretty hard to swallow because we've known oneplus to be such good value for money in the past so that means we're going to have to hold a pretty high standard for the quality of this phone and again i'll be unpacking all of that in the full in-depth review now the good news is with that increase in price we do for the first time see the inclusion of wireless charging which i think at this price point is actually a necessity but the fact that it's here is great i appreciate it i use wireless charging in and around my house all the time so that's nice and as i said before we do now also have that ip68 water and dust resistance rating but at this point in time it no longer feels like that holy heck how is this phone this cheap sort of value anymore and so for the full review i will be putting this phone under a microscope and seeing how it holds up compared to the other flagships and whether or not oneplus has made the right move to move into this sort of flagship territory that is it for this first impressions video just a quick one some initial thoughts and observations that i wanted to share with you straight out of the gate and i'm really interested to start putting this phone to the test now and start seeing how it stacks up against the competition over the next couple of weeks if you want to see anything in particular in the full review video then definitely let me know down in the comments below but aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
