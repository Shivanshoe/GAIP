oh we're matching nice this is the Samsung Galaxy S 20 plus it just arrived in the mail yesterday and I wanted to get a quick video after you guys letting you know that I've got it in house a full review will be happening and I thought I'd give you my first impressions as well but before I even do that let's unbox it [Music] okay so with that out of the way as I said this is just a really quick first impressions video I've only just loaded my sim card into this phone from my pixel for Excel I've set up all my apps and I'm ready to start using this as my daily driver until at least the full review is out now actually pre-ordered this a number of weeks ago now and then sort of forgot about it until it arrived in the mail yesterday so I'm actually on the website just triple checking the specs of the one that I picked up as I said it is the s20 plus I've got it in clear blue it's the 4G variant because 5g is still very much a developing thing here in Australia and it's 128 gigabyte capacity version everything else is the top-of-the-line specs of what you'd expect on a samsung galaxy phone in 2020 there's a couple of things that you definitely notice straight away when you pull this phone out of the box the first being that ginormous display which actually doesn't feel that big in the hands but it is a big and beautiful display super bright and vivid and the big talking point here is the 120 Hertz : now I've just come from using the pixel for Excel which had a 90 hood's panel and initially the difference doesn't seem to be that big of a deal but it's after a prolonged amount of use that you realize that this thing really just stays at 120 Hertz once you set it up to be that way and that is an important thing to note is that out of the box it actually comes with 60 Hertz enabled and a lot of people wouldn't know to go in and actually change that setting over so they missing out on a really great feature in my opinion if you're someone who's ordered this phone that definitely make sure you go and change that setting even just to try it out because I think you'll definitely appreciate using the 120 Hertz panel now I haven't even used this phone outside yet really but I can tell already that it is a nice vivid bright display which is gonna be a really nice change from the pixel for Excel which is known to have not the brightest panel on the market so hopefully having a phone where I can see it in bright sunny conditions will be a nice change but again I'll let you know more about my experience of using this phone outside in bright conditions in my for review so stay tuned for that now one of the things that has always kept me from using Samsung Galaxy phones for a long stretch of time anyway has been the software because I'm someone as all of you probably know who prefers the pixel experience or the stock Android experience or even oxygen OS that really stock Android experience is my preference when it comes to Android software and Samsung software has always been a little bit hit or miss they even just using this phone for the past couple of hours I can already tell that there's been lots of improvement with the software on this phone that full screen gestures are very similar to what you'd find on the pixel devices which makes switching over very seamless and easy so that's nice I also really like the eyes on display implementation with the smooth animations in and out of the lockscreen that's also quite similar to what you'd find on the pixel devices so that's great so I'm hoping that I find that the software experience is really enjoyable over the next couple of weeks as I use this phone as my daily driver and hopefully to the point where it's no longer something that puts me off from using Samsung phones going forward now in terms of performance I'm really excited to put this thing through its absolute paces over the next couple of weeks coming from a pixel of phone they're obviously known to start stuttering and lagging a little bit over the course of their life and so I'm hoping that this phone just blazes through everything that I throw at it I did notice it getting a little bit warm to the touch during the installation and setup process that's somewhat to be expected of most phones so we'll see what happens there but again I've got high hopes for how this thing is going to perform in the next couple of weeks at the very least in terms of the cameras obviously haven't had near enough time to really put this theme through any proper testing at all I have taken some pictures which are shown on screen now so you can get some early impressions of just playing around with the different cameras on this phone but versatility is one thing I'm really excited for so having so many different lens options particularly coming from under to on the pixel for lineup is something I'm excited to play around with over the next couple of weeks but that said I am a little bit apprehensive because I'm always so content with the photos that come out of my pixel four and so we'll see whether or not I'm as content with the photos that come out of the s20 plus mic is probably not quite I'm hoping that it's not a big enough deal to where it makes me not want to use this phone for an extended amount of time the last thing that I'm particularly excited to put through its paces over the next couple of weeks and I know there's way more to it than this but the battery life now coming again from the pixel for which I know I've compared this phone to pretty much throughout this entire video but you've got to understand that is the phone that I've been using for the last six months the battery life on that phone is not something it's known for so I'm hoping this phone just blows it out of the water even with that 120 Hertz panel hoping that I can get to the end of every single day without having to worry about battery life at all but that is it for this first impressions in our boxing video of the s 20 plus as I said the full review video will be coming in the next couple of weeks so definitely hit me up down in the comments below and let me know anything you want to see in particular in that full review video aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and I'll catch you later [Music]
