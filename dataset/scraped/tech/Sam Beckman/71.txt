all right robot vacuums have been around for quite some time now but one of the most irritating parts of owning one is that you have to empty them pretty regularly and i think because they're robotic and they do the cleaning for you it can be pretty easy to forget to do this the big issue is that if you don't empty them regularly well they'll quickly stop working at their best and you'll be wondering why they've stopped cleaning your house like they used to and so eco vax has come up with a solution to tackle this exact issue with their latest robot vacuum the deebot n8 plus and that's because it empties itself yep you heard that right and so when the team at ecovax reached out and asked if i'd be interested in partnering up for a video i thought i've got to check this out now i've had the dbot n8 plus for testing here in the studio and in the house as well for the last couple of months actually and that's because i really wanted to put it through its paces before agreeing to let them sponsor a video and as always because this video is sponsored by ecovax this will not be a review it'll simply be a showcase of the dbot n8 plus so that said let's dive in and check this thing out [Music] so as mentioned the highlight feature of this robot vacuum from ecovax is the auto empty docking station but before we get to that let's cover off some of the other key features of this vacuum so firstly it has a 3200 milliamp hour cell inside which ecovax claims can allow the vacuum to clean for up to 120 minutes i've found that this is generally more than enough time to clean my studio but depending on the size of the space you're living in the vacuum may need to return to the dock to charge up but as soon as it calculates that it has enough power to finish off the job it'll get right back to cleaning from where it left off the vacuum also has upgraded suction power in fact a pascal pressure unit measurement of 2300 which is pretty high as far as robot vacuums go but this means it's going to deliver a much more powerful and in-depth cleaning experience what's also great is that it comes with a built-in what's called osmo water tank which means it can both vacuum and mop at the same time which is honestly for me a bit of a deal breaker if a robot vacuum doesn't have this these days now along with a washable microfiber pad the dbot n8 plus also comes with 10 disposable cleaning cloths which you can use instead for an even more seamless experience because you can just throw them out once they get too dirty what's really great is that if you use the ecovax app you can actually switch between four different flows of water depending on the floor type and your various needs and whilst we're talking about the app the level of customization you can have with this thing is next level so for example you can set up a cleaning sequence which means you can tell the vacuum which rooms you want cleaned and in what order which is really handy you can also set the suction level on a room by room basis and you can even set it up so that the vacuum will clean your space twice before deeming its cycle complete now of course if none of that interests you you can just leave it all set to auto and the vacuum will intelligently make these decisions for you but ebot n8 plus does have true mapping navigation built in which combines the use of precision laser technology and advanced direct timer flight sensors to automatically map your home really quickly in fact four times faster than standard laser mapping it's also got two times better distance detection and can actually detect objects as close to two millimeters away now as well as all of that the vacuum has carpet detection which means it will automatically detect when it is transitioned onto carpet and then not only boost the suction power for that area for a better clean but also turn off the mopping functionality at the same time which is fantastic now once your vacuum finishes a cleaning cycle as mentioned it will then of course return back to the dock for charging but then for a couple of seconds or perhaps a little bit longer you'll also hear this really loud suction sound which is actually the auto empty station sucking out all of the contents from the robot vacuum's dust dustbin and transferring them into this larger 2.5 litre dust bag ecovax claims that this larger dust bag can last for 30 days and to be fair i've never emptied it once since i started using it so it's been going pretty great for me now this auto empty feature alone is pretty game changing for me i'm one of those people who regularly forgets to clean or empty the vacuum so the fact that the deebot n8 plus system does this for me is really nice the only thing to keep in mind is that the empty dust bin is quite decent in size and so that can limit where the vacuum lives and in fact this is why the d-bot n8 plus now lives in my studio because in the house my kids were stepping on it and getting all in its grill but that definitely is a very small downside to an otherwise incredible feature and so as far as i'm concerned this is the new gold standard for robot vacuums having it empty itself and lasts for up to 30 days before i need to do anything is incredible and it covers off every other feature i need in terms of a robot vacuum customization within the app mopping and carpet detection if you want to learn more about this vacuum or pick one up yourself then you can do so using the first link down in the description below but that's it for this video hopefully you found it helpful thank you all very much for watching thank you ecovax for supporting the channel and i will catch you later [Music] you
