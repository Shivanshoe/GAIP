this white powder could transform the dairy industry it is real dairy protein just not from an animal scientists make it in a lab and it's already being used as an ingredient in cream cheese ice cream and milk unlike plant-based alternatives this protein promises to match the taste and texture of the real deal and without the environmental cost the sort of target audience isn't people that are perfectly happy with soy milk or almond milk or oat milk it's people that just want dairy but has dairy grown in a lab too good to be true or have scientists crack the code of a cow-free future the average american consumes an incredible 655 pounds of dairy in a year it takes 9.4 million cows to fuel that craving which is bad news for the environment livestock are the largest producers of methane in the u.s dairy cattle alone make up a quarter of those emissions and animal rights activists say these large farms offer cows only a lifetime of misery for years this was the only source of ice cream milk or cheese alternatives started to take off in the 80s with soy milk leading the charge sales exploded to 550 million dollars in two decades this opened the door for almonded oat milks that would soon dominate the dairy free market but these come with their own environmental problems almond milk production is notorious for its high water usage it takes 23 gallons of water to make just one glass of almond milk that's still less than cow's milk but far more than oat or soy it felt like the only kinds of solutions that people were talking about were yet another plant and so until someone came along and found a way to make that functional protein without cows nothing was going to change and that's exactly what perfect day does in this california lab [Music] we're in our bioanalytics lab this is one of the most important teams in the entire company what we're doing is making sure that the protein doesn't have any other sort of behavior that we might not want we're actually testing the the functionality of the protein in the actual chemistry the protein comes from a process called precision fermentation and everyone's familiar with fermentation at least in the context of making beer or wine like you've got these little microflora and they're eating something like sugar and they're producing something of value for people in this case the thing of value is whey protein and it's the exact same kind found in cows but this version doesn't come from an animal the dna sequence for whey is available online so scientists can just download it and they 3d print it using vials of synthetic nucleotides the chemical compounds that form all genetic material it's then mixed with microflora like fungi these microflora adopt the whey dna and start to multiply next they go into a fermentation tank full of sugar vitamins and minerals and once you add some sugar it's just that simple they eat the sugar and convert it into the protein that we care about after a couple of days the protein is filtered out and dry the science ends when you make the protein and from there it's an ingredient like any other that culinary experts are used to working with this is where perfect day tests out new recipes we started off in ireland in the summer of 2014 where it was like just us using glass beakers and trying to do whatever we could to having actual culinary experts who really know their art and science [Music] ice cream was the first product the company launched technicians combine the protein powder with water oil sugar and the desired flavor they pour the liquid into the same machines that make regular ice cream which means companies that use the protein don't need any special equipment the team is also experimenting with other uses for the protein like this milk that creates the perfect foam layer for coffee something dairy alternatives have always struggled to mimic perfect day doesn't sell products under its own name instead it partners with a number of different brands some of which the company owns like this cream cheese sold under the name modern kitchen that's already available at a bagel shop just down the street oh no not even anymore i had heard about perfect day a few years ago at some foodie event i went into it being pretty skeptical and tried it and was just wowed i'm like this tastes like cream cheese you know we've had it on the special today and it's been flying there's been a ton of people buying it before you pay if you'll check the screen but it's not the easiest product to market i'm calling it animal free and vegan but then when we say it has dairy protein it does cause some confusion the spread is technically vegan since it's made without animals it's also free of the lactose cholesterol and hormones that are found in cows modern kitchens cream cheese costs around five dollars roughly two dollars more than philadelphia's it's not really a profit center i would say for us now but that's okay to use it as a base cream cheese to replace the conventional that price would need to come down really far but hopefully it will as it takes off and the technology scales investments in fermentation-based proteins tripled from 2019 to 2020 by the end of that year perfect day alone raised 361 million dollars but it's hard to predict how much lab-grown options will disrupt the traditional dairy industry disruption is a big word right so at the moment plant-based dairy is only about 10 of the market and it's taken them decades to get there in 2020 perfect day's animal-free whey protein was the first in the u.s to be recognized as safe by the fda the only other places it's currently sold are singapore and hong kong the challenge is bringing down the price point for them to get to price parity they have to scale they're going to need access to manufacturing facilities that are as big as dairy is already using when perfect day's ice cream was first released in 2019 it went for 20 a pint and sold out in less than half a day data does show that people want to be more sustainable and that they are willing to spend more money to be climate conscious but now that the company has scaled up its ice cream falls under the brand brave robot and costs around five dollars and ryan feels their opportunities even beyond dairy there might be different food ingredients they might be in materials or even outside of what you and i might think of and that's really where we want to start to move our focus so that we can do a lot more in the future than than just this [Music] [Music] you
