refrigerators are one of the hardest items to recycle and they're filled with polluting gases that can leak out in the process but angel toledo is fighting to keep that from happening first they check whether a fridge still contains gases if there is gas they attach tubes and collect it then they fold up the metal sheets and a machine crushes them into blocks this rigid foam can't be melted and reshaped like other types of plastic ankhal says the crumbled foam could be used to insulate roofs or made into coolers workers also strip wires to sell the metals inside angel uses this machine to figure out whether each refrigerator's gas affects the ozone after analysis ozone thinning gases go into four thousand pound storage tanks if the fridge has a gas that doesn't affect the ozone oncal might reuse it in another refrigerator
