cbd gets you high cbd doesn't make us feel high in fact it can reduce the effects of feeling intoxicated cbd is a scam it's been used as a marketing tool so we really have to be able to weed it out no pun intended my name is dr shonda macias i am the ceo of alera holistic healthcare i've been working in the cannabis industry since 2011 and i'm dr june chen i've been an integrative cannabis physician for over 15 years i treat both children and adults and today we will be debunking myths about cbd cbd gets you high a lot of people think that cbd gets you high cbd doesn't make us feel high but it definitely makes us feel less anxious and more relaxed so when people say they use it to fall asleep i can understand why we feel that way cbd can be extracted from the cannabis plant but it doesn't have the same ability to create a high or a state of euphoria like marijuana or thc in fact it can reduce the effects of feeling intoxicated cbd works the same for everyone cbd does not work the same for everyone everybody has a different system physiologically when we think about patients using cbd and considering things of what's the right dosage you have to really consider how heavy you are your tolerance levels have you ever used it before if you haven't used it how long your cell receptors will react to the presence of cbd these are all the things we have to take into account and if you think about prescription medications or even supplements that's not the same reaction for everyone either so cbd is going to be very very different for each individual depending on our metabolism our body's own enzymes some patients will find that it works right away some patients will find that it takes a few hours i think that when people use cbd over the counter they get a little confused and their confusion might be because the product might be full spectrum the product might be at isolate or even broad spectrum and you'll have some patients that are very very sensitive about introducing their bodies to thc period because during accumulated use of thc you could have a positive drug test from an over-the-counter product you always when taking any new supplement or cannabinoid medicine you have to be careful and it's nice to be able to talk to your doctor or your pharmacist or even the dispensary retail workers to see if there is any possible interaction cbd doesn't have side effects so cbd does have side effects for some patients it doesn't intoxicate you but it can be really relaxing and almost produce an uplifting effect a small amount of patients will find that cbd makes them very sleepy cbd does improve your rem sleep patients that take cbd find that if they get a much more restorative night's sleep because thc can disrupt rem sleep so patients will take thc to fall asleep faster but if they concentrate on more cbd dominant doses they might find much more restorative sleep sometimes patients will find that when they're taking cbd they do have stomach upset you know that might change their bowels a little bit but it's usually due to the carrier oil that accompanies the cbd cbd and marijuana are the same thing cbd and marijuana are not the same thing cbd also called cannabidiol and thc tetrahydrocannabidiol are the most common cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant a thc and cbd are both in marijuana and hemp marijuana contains much more thc while hemp has a lot of cbd the main difference is i think preventative care versus active treatment using cannabis and if i have a patient that is facing more pain not preventative care then definitely thc helps with that more than a cbd absolutely cbd provides that foundational anti-inflammatory component so you're getting to the root cause of the problem especially with chronic pain and thc is also very valuable because it can help with acute muscle spasms acute pain nausea appetite increase so i think that the thc and the cbd work synergistically together and we can't stress that enough cbd is illegal so i need to debunk the myth that cbd is illegal in 2018 the farm bill passed the usage of hemp where we extract cbd from so the isolate and other cannabinoids extract leaks strictly from the hemp plant is perfectly legal today so what's interesting about legal cbd is that the percentage of thc present has to be lower than 0.3 to remain legal and to be sold over the counter all in all hemp and cbd oil are considered federally legal in all 50 states all cbd products are safe i have to debunk that myth because we know that cbd products are allowable on the regulated market but they're also available on the illicit market which are not products that are required to have testing and the identification of their different ingredients the problem with cbd is that it's not fda regulated so really anyone can come out with a product and put it on the internet to sell cbd eye drops have not been tested cbd aerosolized nebulizers have not been tested or the nasal spray have not been tested so it really is on the onus of the consumer and the patient to make sure that it is effective and reliable and third party tested it's as simple as checking the label looking for what's called a coa certificate of analysis because that coa will tell you the quality of the cbd source it will list all of the information that is key i'm telling you potency is there any bacteria or fungus or are there any solvents or heavy metals or pesticides that have been tested on the label you want to make sure that that lab has been accredited so it's tested by an accredited lab so unfortunately there's a lot of homework that consumers and patients have to do make sure that that cbd product is as good as what it says does when you purchase cbd make sure you purchase it from a credible resource like if you're in a pharmacy and they have it on their shelves usually there is some type of vetting of the product versus a gas station you know there might be a compromise in the quality of the product all cbd is the same i debunk that myth all cbd is not the same the molecular structure of cbd is the same but quality control could definitely be different and it also depends on the formulation some of my patients that use cbd for anxiety or for panic attacks and sometimes before that panic attack comes on before you start spiraling you need something to work within 30 seconds and that's when you would use an inhaled version of cbd such as the vape cartridge or a flower and some of my patients have terrible pain spasm and inflammation and they need something that will work throughout the day they can't leave work or take a break to go outside and use something that's inhaled so they need something that's long lasting and that's when they would use a capsule or a tincture cbd fixes everything cbd is not a miracle pill it's not the silver bullet is not a miracle elixir to all things it cannot cure everything that moves i have to agree completely cbd has its known benefits and we embrace those but if i lose my car key cbd is not going to find it for me when you think about cbd you definitely need to keep it within its realm and i think that it's definitely can lead the pathway to integrative health benefits but i think common sense needs to come into play when we use cbd i don't think cbd in cannabis cures parkinson's but for my parkinson's patients it decreases the tremors it decreases the muscle spasm and pain it increases appetite and gives my parkinson's patients better quality of life so i think it's a piece of the puzzle cbd is addictive cbd is not addictive but i can see why social media says that cbd is addictive because cbd is derived from the cannabis plant and many of people associated with marijuana and assumes that there's a potential for addiction on the contrary the world's health organization concluded that cbd is non-addictive with no withdrawal symptoms and i can say that as a clinician patients that i treat that take cbd are not dependent on cbd matter of fact i've seen patients that have been battling addiction has actually used cbd to help them in their recovery yes because cbd and thc can help offset some of those withdrawal symptoms and it can decrease pain decreases that inflammation that nausea feeling perhaps when you're weaning off medication so i often use cbd in cannabis to help patients wean off opiates benzos and even sleep aids cbd cures cancer i always debunk that myth but cannabis medicine can help you get through chemotherapy and radiation that much better and if it helps you with your mood if it helps you sleep better if it decreases some of your pain and inflammation and revs up your appetite or maybe it gives you a little bit of energy during the day so you can take a walk all of these things will help your body fight the cancer that much better there's so many wonderful benefits of cannabis and specifically cbd in helping the symptoms of cancer but we can't say with 100 surety it reduces the densities in different tumor sizes without that research element being conducted properly so to say directly cannabis cures cancer is a myth but cannabis can help you fight the cancer cbd is a scam i have to debunk this myth cbd does have its inherent anti-inflammatory benefits it has pain relief benefits especially for preventive care insomnia and anxiety patients use it for a lot of these reasons and it has helped and changed thousands of lives i can see why social media would label cbd as a scam because over the past couple of years cbd has been everywhere and it's been touted as this miracle elixir if you look at epidiolex which is an fda approved plant-derived cbd medicine for seizures but then you look at the beverage industry like budweiser developing beer or your neighborhood cafe you can add a shot of cbd to your morning latte and then you look at the beauty industry cbd lipstick or sephora has cbd mascara for thicker longer lashes there are some cbd creams and balms and lotions that work well but you have to look at if they have an other added ingredient maybe it's the menthol that's in the product or the arnica that's supplementing it and creating a decreased sense of inflammation and relief for your muscles and ligaments it's been used as a marketing tool so we really have to be able to weed it out no pun intended cbd won't affect other medications that is not true cbd may interact with certain medications and certain natural supplements and if you take it in extremely large doses it can actually elevate your liver enzymes so seizure medications if you're on blood thinners certain patients will find that if they take cannabis elderly patients that there could be a fall precaution maybe they're taking too much thc and they're a little bit dizzy or groggy and i think that's why it's so important that patients work where physicians specifically those that are educated in the endocannabinoid system so that they can help them on that path to wellness when patients come to see me asking about cbd or cannabis for their health and wellness i take it into full context of their medical history so i look at labs i look at their medical history i do a full physical exam to make sure that cbd and cannabis is something that they can integrate into their health and wellness now the problem is you can't always find a physician that is knowledgeable about cannabinoid medicine actually it's very very rare so what's wonderful with dr macias and her dispensaries is that regulated medical dispensaries tap into a knowledge base of physicians plant scientists cultivators and researchers
