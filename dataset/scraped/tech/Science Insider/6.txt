these are old printers computers and phones and this machine's shredding them to be recycled only about 17 of all electronic waste ends up like this there are hundreds of tiny pieces hidden in every device from toxic materials to plastic to gold and they each have to be separated and recycled individually everything that's not hazardous gets shredded it's a 400 horsepower quad shredder which means you have these teeth that are grinding up all the material here and those are nice printers that are getting eaten up and ground out [Music]
