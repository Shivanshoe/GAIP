caffeine causes headaches caffeine is a double-edged sword the best way to cure a hangover is hangover food the best cure for hangover is time oh boy migraines can be cured migraines cannot be cured and i am sorry to deliver this news today i'm dr deena kuruvila i'm a neurologist and a headache specialist with the westport headache institute in westport connecticut hi i'm dr cynthia armand i'm a neurologist and headache specialist at the albert einstein college of medicine and headache fellowship director at the montefiore headache center and today we'll be debunking myths about headaches and migraine migraines are just headaches that is just the most aggravating myth that i've ever seen and i'm sure many of my patients will say the same thing i 100 agree a headache is a very nonspecific term for having discomfort or pain in the head migraine is a neurological disorder that's not only headaches but is associated with nausea with vomiting with sensitivity to light with sensitivity to sound and so many other symptoms it's a disease just like asthma just like diabetes so within migraine disease there are migraine attacks and an individual can have many or very little of them it's very important to know the difference between headache and migraine because the treatments are different a nap will cure your headache there really isn't evidence to show that a nap is helpful for managing a headache or migraine many of my patients tell me that they take medication and then they go take a nap and by the time that they wake up the headache or the migraine attack is gone that creates a false sense of treatment i've certainly found that sleeping too much or sleeping too little is a big trigger for patients with migraine so i always counsel patients keep your sleep times your wake times the same every day so that you don't end up triggering a migraine instead of napping and this depends on the person you can start with medication that your doctor had prescribed to do some mindfulness and meditation and making sure that you keep your schedule consistent caffeine causes headaches caffeine is a double-edged sword yes caffeine can be a trigger to headaches but caffeine can also be helpful for headaches have fun drink your latte but it's really important to recognize increasing the amount of caffeine you take in can trigger more headache attacks or migraine attacks and also right after the period that you increase and you decide ah i'm gonna try and cut it down suddenly that abrupt withdrawal can also trigger a migraine attack or a headache now caffeine can also be useful in treating headaches or migraine attacks as well like excedrin that can have caffeine in it which is excedrin migraine just remember you're adding that caffeine from excedrin migraine to the caffeine you're already taking that could certainly produce a worsening of headaches just something to be cautious about dehydration is the most common cause of headaches that is definitely not true dehydration is not the most common cause for headaches in general the part that annoys me about this is is cause what you just talked about are triggers right so triggers are certain circumstances or situations that lower one's threshold to have a migraine attack in someone who's already susceptible well dehydration is a common trigger for folks there are so many different triggers that have been reported by patients the most common ones i hear about are alcohol too much caffeine or suddenly stopping caffeine not getting enough sleep and stress it's really important to keep a headache diary or a migraine diary because that allows you to know more about your body and that allows you to put tabs on triggers and when attacks happen and that helps you decide with your doctor what really is triggering you because what triggers one person may not trigger someone else oh boy migraines can be cured migraines cannot be cured and i am sorry to deliver this news today essentially migraine disease is managed migraine management consists of preventive treatments which may be a daily medication a monthly injectable or a procedure or treatment with a device which is a very popular non-pharmacological option now we always recommend as needed treatments to limit your disability with each individual attack and then we also talk about non-medication options we talk about meditation mindfulness acupuncture vitamins there are so many options available now that you can seek help to really get your life back the best way to cure a hangover is hangover food there's no cure for hangovers the best cure for hangover is time the duration really varies per person i've heard 24 to 72 hours that sounds like a really long time but everyone's body is different headaches are usually a symptom for hangovers because of two things the first thing is you know alcohol to be a trigger for migraine attacks and headache in general the body actually releases histamine with alcohol intake in general and that can certainly also cause migraine attack and the other portion is the dehydration of the alcohol dehydration is a trigger for migraine attacks and headache you could aggressively hydrate yourself with water or you can receive fluids through an iv you can take acetaminophen or an anti-nausea medication these are all options that are out there to use before a night of drinking but certainly not proven enough for that purpose taking advil will always treat headaches and migraines advil is an as needed over-the-counter medication which is meant to be used as needed only less than two days a week and is not used as a preventive treatment this is like the vein of my existence because when i see patients for the first time they're always on an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication what we call nsaids the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and these nsaids like advil treat the inflammation portion however migraine involves all sorts of chemicals and they wouldn't so respond to the over-the-counter anti-inflammatories if medications such as advil are used more frequently they can produce medication overuse headache the newer term for it is medication adaptation headache how i explain this is that your body kind of gets used to it so you take more of the medication and you get more headache and it's just this vicious cycle if you find out that you're using your as needed medications like advil too frequently please talk to your doctor about a preventive option that will overall cut down on your headaches you don't have to use so much as needed medications ooh all migraines are the same no not all migraine attacks are the same migraines come in all different flavors and we can differentiate them in terms of how often the migraine occurs like chronic migraine versus episodic migraine so chronic means any attack that occurs 15 or more days and then episodic means less than 15 and then we can differentiate them on the symptoms that individuals have there can be something called hemiplegic migraine where individuals have weakness on one side there can be migraine with and without aura and what aura is is a transient neurologic symptom which could be something that you see in your vision that comes along it could be numbness on one side of your body it can be difficulty talking and then there can be other specific ones like retinal migraine that's specific to the eye the different types of migraine have different risks and different management patterns for example people who have migraine with aura may be at a slightly higher risk of stroke there may be a specific treatment that works for that type of migraine so for counseling purposes and treatment purposes we really need to know what type of migraine you have migraines and headaches only happen on one side of the head it's definitely false but we always like a textbook definition of things if we look up what migraine is most commonly you'll find that it says it's one-sided throbbing headache that has nausea vomiting but actually again every individual with migraine is different migraine pain can be in the forehead sides of the head back of the head the face the nose and the neck around 80 percent or more of patients with migraine also have neck pain there are more rare headache disorders that only occur on one side of the head cluster headache happens on only one side of the head classically so the location of your pain doesn't necessarily pinpoint what your diagnosis is what i really find is it's a compilation of symptoms which is why i always talk about the diary having a headache means something is wrong with your body oh that's a very interesting question having a headache doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with your body headaches can signal more dangerous things going on in the brain like a stroke like a tumor like a tear within one of the arteries of the head or neck but there are everyday things that can cause headache ponytail headaches for example are very common you're tying your hair back in that really tight bun braids braids swim caps there's ice cream headache where you eat that ice cream and you notice that headache that comes on right away and that's because you're kind of stimulating the upper part of your palate with that cold temperature so important to know the red flags of when something may signal something more dangerous if you already have headaches or migraine disease you might want to pay attention to if there's a changing pattern if it's still responsive to the usual treatments that you take if you are having extra symptoms added to the migraine that you haven't had before those are indications you need to see your provider to make sure to do some sort of workup for any other secondary cause mental health has nothing to do with migraines no i just can't with this one so we have to set the record straight on this one migraine is the second leading cause of disability worldwide and actually 50 of individuals with migraine do experience anxiety disorders and what that's called is comorbid conditions we know that depression anxiety and other mood conditions are more likely to happen with individuals with migraine migraine affects individuals at home their ability to take care of their family their ability to earn a living their ability to enjoy and engage in social interaction and a lot of the times that leads to guilt that leads to a sense of worthlessness and if you don't treat one condition it's difficult to treat the other what we do is we treat both at the same time many of the brain chemicals that are released during a migraine attack like dopamine serotonin norepinephrine they're the same chemicals that are also involved in mood disorders like depression and anxiety so a lot of these medications that are first indicated for mood disorders actually work well in individuals with migraine there are individuals who specialize in both migraine and mood disorders that can help so do you want to do the honors sure i'd love to let's really rip this one up headaches and migraine disease are quite complex they're experienced differently in many different individuals so it's really important to keep a diary keep track of your individual triggers and what really makes your headaches worse and have that dialogue with your provider in order to help with proper management and treatment
