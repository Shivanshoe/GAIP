there is no birth control for people with penises we made a covet vaccine in less than a year you are telling me we cannot get birth control for people with penises my name is gina silvanasi pronouns i'm a sexuality and relationship educator hi my name is varuna i use shive pronouns i am a physician by training a public health researcher and i am interested in the intersections between mental health and sexuality in south asian cultures and today we are busting myths around sex and sexuality these are myths from pop culture broken hymen means a person has had sex before no absolutely not yes some women do have a hymen and some women don't but i don't think that we have scientifically proven that a broken hymen is the test of a virginity also why is it that only people with vaginas and high mens have this test what about people with penises i also want to call out rapper t.i men like him go to the gynecologist and say i need you to examine my daughter's hymen once a year to make sure it's intact this is something that gets me really aggravated this one definitely contributes to physical violence against folks with vaginas less common for people to have an intact hymen and you know folks who do have a fully intact hymen that isn't helpful for themselves either when it comes to you know if they're going to start their period the blood doesn't have anywhere to flow and so there are surgeries that folks would have to undergo in order for that the hymen to actually not be intact but the way i see it that like you know you have this like vaginal canal right so say this is like the whole um of the vagina and this would be like a slightly intact hymen in most cases this is really what it what it would look like where it's still an opening right but there's this would be like loose skin to me honestly it feels like a vestigial organ it's the appendix of the vagina i like to call it you don't really need it but it's there abstaining from sex makes you better at sports i'm assuming that again sex negative culture we don't want people to have sex and so it's like well if you really want to be good at basketball you better not have sex with you know at all because you're you want to reserve all your energy show that on the court but there's no as far as i know any study that shows abstaining from sex is gonna make you better at sports yeah i haven't read any study either but actually fun fact in the rio olympics in 2016 more than 450 000 condoms were distributed so athletes a lot of sex but i think if you're responsible and you are having sex responsibly in a consensual manner i think why not have fun have fun with sex and then go play your game your wallet is a great place for our condom [Laughter] hey you got a condom on you i know you have a condom in your wallet i think that we've seen this right where they're like oh i have a condom in my wallet from 15 years ago honey don't use that more importantly condoms expire in like five years there's like so check the expiry date never store it next to a sharp object never store it in a really humid place and never store it and really i think it's a tight place yeah your wallet and if you're going out for booty call you know you get that call and you finally it's your moment to shine just grab a couple of condoms put them in your pocket sex burns a lot of calories you know depending on the kind of sex that you're having it can certainly burn calories i don't think it's the equivalent of you know running a marathon by any means it's not as excessive of amount the way maybe people think of having like a full 30 minute exercise because your heart rate is not elevated to that degree the entire time yeah i totally agree with you jada i think that there was a recent time article that came out that said that you don't burn more than 100 calories uh in a single session of sex but for the most part do not do not think that this is your workout it is a workout it gets your heart rate pumping but we would definitely recommend still going to the gym and maintaining an active lifestyle these are myths we hear the most there are only two sexes found in nature that is not true well i think a lot of times of like flowers flowers that actually have both sexes quote-unquote sexes within the flower in itself we have labeled them as male and female we have to remember that that's a classification that was invented by humans and i also think that this is one of those dangerous myths that's out there especially for intersex persons because doctors who who function in this idea that there's only two sexes do this corrective irreversible corrective surgery to decide if an intersex person is quote-unquote male or quote-unquote female for the rest of their life and that can actually lead to a lot of psychological problems if someone is born intersex then they should be given the choice to decide how they want to live their lives what their sexuality is what sex they identify as what gender they identify as we definitely need to change this whole ideology a lot of people who still believe that there are only two sexes in society will go towards science as their claim right and science as their backup and this is the part where we have to remember that science is also problematic sometimes yeah this one's a tough one because it's like it's not just changing the culture it's literally changing the entire system that taught us this culture you can get an sti from a toilet seat medically and technically and scientifically speaking the bacteria that does cause you know syphilis and other you know stis can only live in those warm mucous membranes within your body suppose we took that bacteria and we you know put it on a toilet seat it wouldn't live there for more than a couple of hours it would die out so it's impossible for someone to go and sit on it and then get that infection and you also cannot get pregnant from sitting on a toilet seat either the word sti sexually transmitted infection and so it's sexually transmitted between bodies only older people should need lube oh god now we get into the ageist myths i just want to be like no it's not true everyone can benefit from using lube it's honestly i think the most underrated sex accessory if you don't purchase anything else please purchase lube this is for people of all ages so a lot of people with uteruses who go through menopause when you have decreased estrogen it reduces the vaginal lubrication and our body does have natural vaginal lubricants so having sex during that time can be painful can be hard and can be uncomfortable really and don't use vaseline so you don't want to put lotions which is meant to be on your skin your external skin the vagina the has a mucous membrane um it comes it's completely different from the skin on your body water base is going to probably be the safest bet for your own body and depending on if you decide to use toy it's usually not recommended to use silicone lube with silicone toys plastic can react to plastic yeah it's also definitely not recommended to use oil based lubes with condoms because you can't risk breaking sex equals penetration oh gosh people get to have their own definitions of sex i think a lot of times we think that sex equals penetration because you're using a vagina and a penis but obviously that is very heteronormative and doesn't apply to every single partnered relationship right and just because it's not a vagina and a penis having sex doesn't mean it's not sex we actually use our entire body during sex and so when we equate sex to only these two pieces of our bodies it's not accurate oh my god you kneel on the head what we really say when we mean sex is not that it's just penetration like you said penis and vagina but it's really just an experience that helps you get in touch with your sexuality that helps you form a deeper connection with the other person if you get an sti you can't get it again you can totally get the same sti a second time even after you have been you know cured from it and not all stis are curable put it out there that even hiv there is such a thing as reinfections and super infections is when you get a different strain of the same virus superimposed on the illness that you have from the first strain of the virus that can depending on your body physiology your wbc count can lead you to get a higher infection or a different type of infection please go get tested we want to destigmatize it but we also want to encourage disclosure um but it's important for people to know if you have an sti it's like even letting people know that you are on birth control are not on birth control giving people the information so that when they do consent it is fully informed there is no treatment for hiv um okay let's talk about this i think that this is a genuine myth that many people i think it's a question that many people have and there is no ultimate cure for for hiv but there does exist an antiretroviral therapy that as soon as you are diagnosed with hiv you can go on those medications and they are supposed to help you lead a longer and a healthier life um and there is also prap i think that you know the pre-exposure prophylaxis which you can take if you are at risk for hiv or if your partner is at risk for hiv so scientists are working really hard to find a cure you know this myth comes from that history of folks who were dying without treatment and a lot of times when you think about why the government didn't rush right to create treatment it's because it was mostly affecting queer folks and so i'm thankful that now we do have treatment for it not necessarily a cure and it's mostly again pushed by queer folks in the lgbtq community i think when we have a fear around an sti we almost like want to avoid it sometimes because we don't want to confirm the worst case scenario for ourselves but again we don't want to wait longer because we don't want the infection to get worse over time if you do have a partner or have sexual partners and you do contract hiv then doing enough research together so that folks can kind of again goes back to informed consent so that folks can have all the information that they can around this particular issue blue balls is caused by sexual arousal without orgasm this is an absolute myth in that i don't think that if if you think of people with testicles actually got blue balls they would think that all they needed to do was to have an orgasm and they wouldn't take anything else seriously about their health and b um i think it's also rooted in sexual coercion right because there's often that statement where you know the person the other person is like i don't want to have sex anymore and then they're like oh honey come on you're giving me blue balls over here at least like get me off you know at least let me finish if you need to like let up some steam if you have access to a bathroom definitely go in there and masturbate don't make the other person feel uncomfortable so if you've ever seen your fingertips turn blue or your lips turn blue it usually means that you have decreased oxygen to that part of the body um if that happens to your testicles i would call 9-1-1 or i would go into the doctor immediately sexual arousal like you're going to get blood flow to to your genitals that's kind of how it happens right you're going to get blood that that goes to there and so i can understand that maybe it might be uncomfortable it'll flow right back even if you don't have an orgasm assigned male at birth amab and assigned female at birth afab hit their quote unquote sexual peak at different ages people have sexual peaks all throughout their ages at different times of their life i think that sexual energy is something you can maintain across your life and some people maybe don't have a lot of it some people do there's too many different environmental factors cultural factors kind of internal factors that play a role into your sexual energy and your sexual arousal you know sexual desire i think is dependent on age and hormones to a big extent i think for many people it could be their teams when you're like 25 for some people you could even hit it at like 45 with decreased estrogen you have decreased desire increased testosterone you have increased desire decreased progesterone there can be increased desire i don't think it's fair to gender it and to say that men and women have their sexual peak at different ages having this idea of sexual peak excludes people who identify as being asexual watching porn when you're young can cause erectile dysfunction the mainstream sort of pawn videos show us are these really like unrealistic bodies we've also seen people having abnormally large penises having erections for longer than 30 minutes the usual time you can have an erection is like 5 to 30 minutes and you know coming multiple times these sort of create an idea within like young minds that my penis is supposed to be long it's supposed to be big it's supposed to give so much pleasure to someone and that you know i should have a heart on for like an hour and i think what these can do is cause a lot of anxiety and you sort of like there's this thing called spectatoring which is that you are essentially having an out-of-body experience where you're trying to watch yourself having sex and i think anxiety and depression is actually one of the causes of erectile dysfunction because we live in a sex negative culture a lot of us have internalized really negative ideas about what it means to be in our bodies and what it means to have sex and how we're supposed to perform so i could see those as more direct contributors to erectile dysfunction than just strictly watching porn and now we're on to myths from social media masturbation is bad for you this is a question that i definitely get a lot young men on instagram dm me and say that they masturbate x number of times a day and if it's bad for them it is good for you it has been proven to release endorphins and i think that you are building on a relationship with yourself there's no risks of stis there's no risk of pregnancy when you masturbate right make sure whatever you're using to masturbate is clean it's really like the least harmful way to enjoy sexual pleasure so i think most of these are like meant to shame you or scare you vaginas stretch out with use they don't stretch out with youth you know the vaginal canal is a muscle and our muscles do stretch and contract so when something is inserted into the vagina or when things come out like a human baby then it can stretch they don't necessarily lose their elasticity but elasticity can change over time with age with estrogen levels decreasing which causes the vaginal tissue to get thinner or drier that applies to all the muscles in our body all the muscles in our body change over time i also want to state that this is also a particularly harmful myth i think that this is also deeply rooted in the patriarchy that you need to have the smallest tightest hole for penetration and that you know the tighter it is the more pleasure it gives for your partner dr jennifer gunter had like this amazing tweet and it said that if if by your logic the vagina stretches out after every use then the penis should be a flabby balloon after the use right because of every erection but you don't hear anyone talking about that you know there are actually people who struggle with their vaginal canal not opening up or not stretching or it is a little bit smaller and that causes so much pain that's a condition in itself and so for us to think that it's something we should strive for you know is really harmful as well and kind of erases people who struggle with that particular condition mountain dew lower sperm count who comes up with these i i want to know i just want to talk let's talk a i don't think that it lowers the sperm count and b you have other things to worry about if you're drinking copious amounts of mountain view there are a lot of other things that can cause a low sperm count it comes down to temperature age any recent injuries whether you've had any sort of testicular problems as a child growing up also drinking copious amounts of alcohol or you know smoking a lot of cigarettes can also lower your sperm count does it come from a place of shame of trying to get people not to drink mountain dew or does it come from a place of someone using it as an excuse to not use a condom that's not gonna get you pregnant just because it lowers my sperm count you know what we would recommend is just that you have a healthy diet so that your body is functionally functioning as normal as it can if your sperm is ever yellowish that's a concern the consistency changes drastically for whatever reason and that's a concern i wouldn't necessarily equate that to like a specific food there is no birth control for people with penises so i think a lot of times people equate the word birth control with hormonal birth control but birth control and contraceptives include things like condoms another one is like a vasectomy a vasectomy is a form of birth control and something that people with penises can also undergo there has been clinical trials of an injection for people with penises um unfortunately that hasn't reached the united states yet birth control definitely exists with people with penises i think that as sex educators we are advocating every single day for shared responsibility the other day you want to protect yourself we made a covet vaccine in less than a year you are telling me we cannot get birth control for people with penises if you are someone who is young who's watching this and you believed any of these myths it's totally okay it's really the system until we live in a truly sex positive patriarchy free anti-racist society then we're not going to get to a place where we can have true sexual liberation
