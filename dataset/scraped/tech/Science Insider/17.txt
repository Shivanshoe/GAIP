baby teeth aren't important oh my goodness [Laughter] acidic fruits will whiten your smile oh please don't do this yes feelings last forever yeah they're kind of like relationships hi i'm dr john yu i'm a pediatric dentist in new york city and new jersey it was between this and k-pop oh my god hi i'm dr jason lin i'm an orthodontist in australian teeth for a living and today we will be debunking myths about teeth cavities are irreversible that's all you bud yes it's a myth that doesn't mean though that we've been fooling you guys in your entire life some cavities are reversible some are irreversible it depends on the depth of the cavity if you look at the three layers of your teeth the outer layer enamel has the capability to re-mineralize if the cavity is within the enamel technically it's reversible if the cavity penetrates to the second layer dentin which is made up of bajillion microtubules the bacteria can now shoot through the tubes into the pulp which is the center of your tooth where your blood supply and your nerves are housed if it goes into the second layer i may recommend the patient hey this is most likely going to get bigger we don't know how fast but we don't want to wait too long when we have to drill into the tooth and do a filling most times it is irreversible and if you have a small cavity limited to the enamel what can you do at home you want to limit your acid sugar intake your enamel is the hardest substance in your body over time just like the brick wall of a building may wear away with weather and storm patchwork is needed and what patches up the lost minerals in the enamel is the fluoride in your toothpaste acidic fruits will whiten your smile oh please don't do this yeah please don't do this guys don't deal with acid that you have in your refrigerator the acid will erode your teeth you may even develop cavities erosion is real put a picture of erosion up here in some ways it does get whiter what happens is like the chromogens which are like the pigmented molecules we talked about with the whitening the aesthetic fruits they disperse that as well it makes the teeth a little bit whiter but the worst part is you're actually weakening the teeth more than you are actually whitening the teeth so long term it's not great if you want to whiten your smile what do you recommend in office whitening maybe once or twice a year and then to maintain it like at home at home lightning kits the hydrogen peroxide the carbohydrate whitening product is a controlled short duration treatment not fruit stay away from your orange braces are just for crooked teeth it's a good one for you perfect most of my patients i would say it's for aesthetics but at the same time there's a lot more reasons than just crooked teeth that you get braces or aligners there's the functional aspects as well obviously underbites overbites cross bites deep bites open bites also like grinders traumatic occlusion any sort of spacing issues we usually do aligners in those patients because we have this extra protective layer over their teeth while straining and fixing their bites at the same time so many parents might say my kid's nine years old why does he need aesthetic teeth right he doesn't even care yeah the patient has severe crowding if nothing's done impaction will occur that's when the teeth get jammed up in the traffic jam and that makes the orthodontics or movement harder when they're teenagers they're in braces for a longer time so before the problem gets too big we try to fix functional components and then the aesthetics can always follow yeah a knocked out tooth is gone for good time is of the essence here it's important to know that a knocked out tooth is not a dead tooth this is considered an emergency because if the tooth can be reimplanted by the dentist within half hour one hour max yeah then it does have a increased odds of survival reimplantation if it's possible is step one it sounds crazy but put it back in the tooth because that's where it's home is now if that's not possible put it in a glass of milk also not a joke so what type of milk whole milk is the best choice the milk has a similar ph to the cells on the root of the tooth and if you can keep the cells alive for longer then tooth has a better chance of survival there is a common misconception that you could put the tooth in water don't do that in fact your saliva is better putting in a bag of saliva water will make the cells on the root pop diet sodas won't give you cavities myth guys smith i do like the effort why does it cause cavities not necessarily because they don't have any sugar at all but it's because of the ph levels being low and it's acidic there are certain drinks that are more harmful you want to look at the ph of them the sugar content sports drinks soda yeah wine these healthy things like orange juice apple juice they may be good for vitamins dental standpoint they are attacking your teeth sorry to rain on your parade if you look at the ph of milk it's a lot less acidic and it has more protective factors water is best water is best water and seltzer i agree oh that's kind of a sad list yeah i know enjoy moderation feelings last forever they're kind of like relationships uh your relationship with your wife that's gonna be forever but in certain situations they may not you actually see that a lot of the times where you need to redo a filling it's from an existing filling it wasn't sealed all the way it could be that there was a little bit of cavities underneath it and then it got a little bit worse and then you got to do the filling again even after you get a filling if you're still not flushing you're still not brushing you can easily just get another cavity where that existing filling was so the maintenance on the patient's side is also very important yeah oh dental cleanings aren't necessary this one's tough sometimes they're not yeah but let me preface it all right it is a preventive service along with the examination that is the most helpful great it's not that dental cleaning itself it's like getting an annual checkup for some patients even a six-month cleaning is not enough some patients come back every three months so it depends if you do have calculus or very hard plaque we use in the office scalers which are very sharp blades to scrape off things we use a cabatron which is an ultrasonic machine that sprays out water and bursts these things into pieces it's very satisfying our job as dentists is to maintain your oral health and there are certain things that you can't do at home that we can do for you so the cleaning is just one way for us to regularly check up on you and to make sure everything's going okay retainers aren't for life ah this this one hits home i've worn a retainer for about 25 years now in my life if you want to keep your teeth exactly where they are it's hard to say that hey you don't need a retainer so the purpose of a retainer after you get braces after you get a liner is to hold your teeth in that position so that your smile stays the way that it is but then secondarily we see a lot more grinders in the office and with those grinders it actually adds as an extra layer of protection so that if they grind they're going to grind away the plastic before they grind away their own teeth over time the relapse potential is less and less but it's never zero if you want to keep relapse incidents lowest then you should wear it for as long as possible so you could be on your deathbed with your retainers you should floss before brushing what do you do i i floss first i do too technically it doesn't matter i'm not going to make you floss before but logically it makes sense too you're debriding between the teeth you're removing the bacteria you're brushing after then you're rinsing makes sense there's no long-term study that's why there's no general consensus what happens if you don't floss and you don't clean that up to 40 of surfaces very commonly i have to treat what's called interproximal decay that's decay in between teeth that are not visible to the eyes and if the calculus builds up there over time you get that little bit of bone loss and if you don't clean it then that's what leads to like the gum disease in general i don't think it matters if you floss before you brush the most important thing is that you actually do floss baby teeth aren't important parents often ask why do we need to treat this cavity can't you just pull it out he's going to get a new one a couple years right baby teeth are like the space holders if you lose them a little bit too early your teeth won't know where to go and then they teeth can get confused a little bit kids can also have psychological effects from it losing two front teeth very early three-year-old might not care but a four or five-year-old might in these instances uh it's important to prioritize a child's development speech psychological well-being and of course the orthodontic preservation everyone has wisdom teeth myth myth that's a myth not everybody does the wisdom teeth are the most commonly congenitally missing teeth that means that some people aren't born with them how many do you have i have four i had three so i'm less wise than echelon they're the third molars they're the ones all the way in the back typically you see them if they erupt between 17 and 21 and very commonly they are removed because they become impacted it's a good idea to remove them before they become a problem like maybe in your like late teens early 20s college because because the bone isn't as dense as if you were in your 30s or so so no not everybody has wisdom teeth and when it comes to whether or not you need to get your wisdom teeth out that's also a myth not everybody needs to get them out hydrogen peroxide and baking soda are good toothpaste replacements myth yeah myth yeah it's missing a key ingredient which is fluoride let's say that you're lost in the woods you've lost your toothpaste yeah tragic i know can you use these things i feel like it's better than nothing it's more important to brush it off the hydrogen peroxide and baking soda are parts of your toothpaste but it's not the whole thing so you're missing the one the muscle yeah that is remineralizing your teeth is keeping them healthier so do yourself a favor and grab some fluoride toothpaste you're too old to get braces myth 100 i have patients of all ages it's not even just like a functional thing i think self-esteem plays a lot for adults and kids so there's no such thing as adult braces braces that we use for teenagers and adults are the same but one thing i will say is we do do a lot of aligners for my adult patients so these are aligners so basically something like this you get little bumps on your teeth and then the tray goes over the top of it and these this is basically the clear alternative to braces the issue is the compliance 90 of the time will the patient wear it that's why i do braces more in teenagers and aligners more than adults so even though we give you the trays for two to three months at a time as orthodontists we still want to monitor their progress um just to make sure that the teeth are on track they're moving the right way and you're not at any increased risk to lose any teeth teeth that had root canals can't feel huh myth yeah myth but that seems logical because a root canal procedure removes the nerve of the tooth the reason they remove it is that the cavity progresses into the center of the tooth infecting the entire chamber where the nerves and blood supply are housed the root canal is actually a really good option for keeping that tooth in your mouth for as long as possible it can still feel because the surrounding ligaments the attachments to your bone for example periodontal ligaments are still intact technically you can still feel sensation pressure but it shouldn't give you tooth pain if that's what you had before it may sound really strange that you're leaving a dead body part in your mouth that kind of sounds kind of gross i know but the alternative is no tooth or an implant which is an artificial tooth where you're screwing it into the bone you can ask any dentist in most cases where the root canal is an option they will choose the root canal but i will mention that because the root canal is so technique sensitive it's important to find someone who does it well you'll lose all of your teeth when you're old i think it really depends on how you take care of your teeth i have patients in their 50s 60s their teeth look better than some of my 20 30 year olds honestly so that's why we emphasize so much hygiene good habits there's also a genetic component to aging some people have less bone density some people are born with really amazing teeth if you have impeccable hygiene and good genetics you'll be okay but if you don't it'll come faster the goal is to get the most mileage out of your teeth as possible before we need to intervene so try your best to take care of it that's the only thing you control you can't control genetics so there's one thing you can take away from this video it's important to brush floss and you wear your retainer that's a good one for me the takeaways use fluoride toothpaste baby teeth are important and just try your best
