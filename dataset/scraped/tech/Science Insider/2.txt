everyone's armpit stink it's rude not mine sweating is a good way to detox may i have that one go for it this is a good one smelly foods only affect your breath this is false hi i'm dr michelle henry i'm a board certified dermatologist practicing in manhattan new york and i'm the founder of skin and aesthetic surgery of manhattan hi i'm dr devil bonacelli a board certified dermatologist here in new york city and today we'll be debunking myths about body odor dermatologists are the skin experts so who knows more about sweat glands than us sweat is smelly so this is not true so we actually have two types of sweat we have sweat that comes from our e-crying glands and so those are the glands that are everywhere and it helps us with thermoregulation so it helps to cool us down when we're working out when we're getting too hot and then we have apricorn glands so those are sweat glands that we see in areas like the underarms the groin the chest all the areas that we sometimes associate with being smelly but the actual sweat from the african glands does not smell why does that area smell it's the bacteria in those areas so the bacteria in those areas will use what the gland produces as food and it's the byproduct of that that actually smells stinky that was the most beautiful description of sweat i've ever heard in my life thank you i try so fun fact there are thousands of types of bacteria and fungus and yeast and things like that on your body it's completely normal it's part of our microbiome so some quick tips to remember to help with the with the smelly odor so number one it's okay to shower every day i promise you number two is eat a healthy diet you know if your body is not producing at an optimal level it will tell you it will show you and you will smell it if anything becomes excessive there are certain medical conditions that do cause it's okay to go check out and make sure everyone's armpits stink it's rude not mine that is a myth there's actually two percent of the population that has a special mutation i believe it's the abcc 11 gene they don't have smelly odors so not everybody's armpits stink there are a lot of different treatments for treating quote unquote smelly armpits number one you know showering using antibacterial soap is probably the easiest hack for all of it we have oral medications we can give we can have prescription antiperspirants and we even use botox i know i know you're going to be thinking botox like that's for the other stuff you actually can use botox to minimize the sweating in the area it only lasts about three months or so so you have to kind of come in regularly but often our patients just do it in the spring or summer time and then kind of do their own thing during the winter time and usually they're fine smelly feet mean bad hygiene no this is incorrect smelly feet means smelly feet doesn't mean bad hygiene we know that we're producing sweat everywhere and that sweat then becomes bacteria food well the feet are really a unique area it's one of the highest concentrations of sweat glands on the body and although there are more kind of acrylic glands in the african glands and still creating a moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria and yeast and because our feet are often enclosed in shoes in dark areas that's literally yeast food so this is why we see a lot of fungus and a lot of yeast on the feet and because of this the feet are going to be a little bit more prone to having a smell agreed and it's a very common thing we see a lot of our athletes gym rats all those people in between the one thing i tell my patients always make sure you wash your feet when you shower using antibacterial soap is actually a great idea just make sure everything is cleansed and you pat dry as quick as possible before you put on a pair of fresh socks yes socks are important as well so wearing cotton socks that are absorptive and they're going to kind of lick away that moisture from the feet that helps a ton your signature scent never changes this is incorrect and so just like we are dynamic beings we're changing our hormones are changing our micro environments changing our diets are changing and all these things play a really critical role in how we smell you know as we get older and our hormones change you know we all know that teenage boys smell a little bit different than they smelled when they were six and i wish they could put those like new baby smells in a bottle oh that would be amazing that's my favorite smell remember babies covered in amniotic fluid for months and months and months and months you have this certain scent that people equate to that new baby smell also as we get older our skin barriers tend to deteriorate a little bit and there's more oxidation of certain things on our skin itself so that old person smell i hate to say that it's actually due to changes in how our skin is protected from the environment around us and the oxidation of these certain chemical compounds can actually cause a specific scent so next time you go visit your grandparents things like that just keep that in mind the more you've been around a certain smell the more you get used to it right and so it's really when your body kind of hits a shock system where you smell something you're not used to smelling that's when you kind of form an opinion about it so just remember if there's something you don't necessarily agree with does not mean that it's incorrect it's just your perception of that odor and everything kind of going around that really forms your opinion of it sweating is a good way to detox you may have that one go for it i don't like that so this is a huge myth so you know our body is an amazing machine and 99 of how we detox is through our liver and our kidneys and that's why it's really important to keep those organs very safe that's how we get rid of all the negative toxins and byproducts in our bodies your body's job is to kind of maintain this equilibrium keep the steady state and that's what the sweating does it helps you kind of keep this normalized temperature and so if you go up too much it's its way of bringing it back down and while i love a great sauna it's amazing for my mental health it's amazing for my relaxation i know that when i go to asana i'm not going there to detox so it's really important that we understand that we have really effective ways to detox our body and sweating is not one of them how crazy are some of these like the marketing around some of these things i mean it's believable sometimes i have to ask myself like i have to revisit my medical school books you won't sweat if you put on deodorant this is a myth so there is a big difference between deodorant and antiperspirant deodorant helps to mask the odor so it helps to reduce the smell antiperspirants will actually help to reduce sweating they contain aluminum-based ingredients that will clog those pores those glands and help to reduce sweating one thing about natural deodorants is that sometimes they can have a lot of salts and other ingredients that can be a little bit harsh on the skin so sometimes it's a little bit of trial and error to find the right natural deodorant for you deodorants with ingredients like ceramides to help to protect and fortify the skin barrier deodorants with ingredients like vitamin b5 which helps to soothe the skin and reduce inflammation ingredients like you know coconut oil which also can help to kind of soothe the skin use it for two weeks and decide if it's good for you or not the idea becomes once you find a good deodorant stick to it if you keep switching things up and moving things you're going to have more of an inclination for having a reaction or having some issue with tolerability here's a fun hack for you if you're using an antiperspirant you can actually put it on at night time to get a better overall result and less sweating throughout the course of your day at night time our sweat glands are not as active so that those aluminum-based ingredients can actually clog the pores a little bit better put it on during the day when you're already active then something's blocking them and they can't really settle as well as they can at night antiperspirant is dangerous so what do you do when you hear all these people say that aluminum causes cancer and it's dangerous and all that kind of stuff yes so i give them a little science lesson so the presence of an ingredient does not necessarily mean causation for instance during the winter months i start drinking tea it makes me feel warm i also tend to get colds in the winter months does that mean the warm tea caused my cold you know so the presence of something or the correlation does not always mean causation so what we see is that when we biopsy breast tissue breast tissue that's in the area around the underarm which is a common area where we do see breast cancer we will see aluminum there in that tissue it's there because it's adjacent to where we're using aluminum containing ingredients however currently we do not have data showing that it causes cancer and while many feel that they're uncomfortable with that they can choose to use other options but right now we do not have data showing that aluminum containing ingredients specifically contribute to breast cancer so why aluminum well aluminum is currently the only fda approved antiperspirant ingredient that's not to say that there are other alternatives out there for you if you're more comfortable choosing them but it's just always important to educate yourself and continue to monitor the data moving forward and part of our job as doctors is to understand where the fear comes from and then look for alternatives right really you should only do what's comfortable for you and what you feel you're okay doing on a day-to-day basis so if you block all the sweating from the armpit area do you sweat in other places more well that is another common question i get that a lot when we do botox in those areas the truth is we have so many sweat glands that it kind of just distributes evenly and so the idea becomes again the sweat does come out at some point somewhere so we just minimize the amount in an area where the bacteria might be feeding on it to create more of the odor or the scent oh this is a good one smelly foods only affect your breath false so we know that foods can affect your breath but it can also affect your body we know that some of those foods especially those cruciferous foods like cabbage cauliflower broccoli can affect how we smell overall that produces sulfuric acid that's so that's similar to that rotten egg smell that we all know and the same with red meat there are some studies showing that those that eat a lot of red meat may smell a little bit different eating lots of fish will produce a byproduct called trimethylamine that's right trimethalosaurus and so that's a very characteristic smell alcohol produces acetic acid which you can also smell and we do excrete components of our food which then will interact with the bacteria and we will smell differently because of that so there might be certain foods that might alter your smell in some way shape or form but just remember always have a healthy balanced diet and don't let the scent of what may come afterwards dictate any part of that as a girl who loves cauliflower pizza and all things cauliflower i have yet to let that cruciferous smell keep me from eating it i don't think i smell no not at all listen cauliflower pizza no joke so good generally i've learned in life everybody is different and it's okay to accept that i think what we're highlighting more than the fact that the smell is good or bad is that the smell is different to someone else it smells like home it smells like all the goodness that they know and so we need to always keep that perspective when we encounter new people and new environments because it's a personal experience i like the idea of smelling like home i'd like you guys to take away that being a little stinky sometimes is normal it's a part of being a human it's a part of the human experience be kind to yourself be kind to others but also if you find that it's outside of what's normal for you talk to your dermatologist talk to your family physician figure out what's going on but give yourself grace because we're all a little stinky sometimes
