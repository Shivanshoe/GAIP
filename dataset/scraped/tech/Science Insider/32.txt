at its simplest lava is molten silicate rock but add a little spice [Applause] seasoning lava with things like ice water crystals and metal can lead to explosive results here's how lava reacts to four different factors ice and lava might feel like an odd couple but frozen volcanoes are a real hazard in places like iceland and it's important to study this interaction for evacuations especially because lava can move faster and farther on ice ash from the volcano can settle on the ice creating an insulating barrier slowing the lava's cooling the ice can also melt which can reduce friction and the steam can give the lava this bubbly look the more the ice melts the higher the risk of flooding yokolips are floods that happen when a glacial lake overfills in 2010 iceland's ayafyadla yokold volcano caused a glacial outburst flood that forced 800 people to evacuate in the same vein glacial melt and debris are a perfect recipe for lahars these volcanic mudflows sweep away homes infrastructure and even people without enough preparation like the 1985 eruption of nevado del ruiz in colombia which led to 000 fatalities lava has some pretty unique reactions to seawater as you can see in this ocean entry footage shot on the coast of kalapana hawaii this steamy mist is actually laze a cloud of toxic gas it's made up of hydrochloric acid the result of steam reacting with lava heated salt particles there are also bits of volcanic glass swirling in there the water cools the lava which gets crushed up by the waves into volcanic glass and swept up into the plumes not something you want to be breathing in lava that doesn't shatter will start hardening into a delta an inherently unstable new landmass blobs of pillow lava pile one on top of the other forming a shaky foundation when water gets trapped among these hot pillows it causes a steamy violent explosion called a molten fuel coolant interaction [Music] this can sometimes trigger the whole delta to collapse and to hurl rock and debris over an area as large as multiple football fields even when the flow looks slow and unthreatening you don't know what's happening under the surface this can apply to the lava itself too crystals form as lava cools generally the quicker the lava cools the fewer crystals will form and the smaller they'll be but scientists have found that bigger crystals with more sides slow lava down giving the lava more surface area to cling to as it flows around this is important to understand the lava's viscosity generally less viscous flows can move faster and travel farther knowledge that helps public safety engineers plan hazard maps so scientists are researching how minerals and unique environments and unique temperatures create different crystals at syracuse university they used metal bits of varying size and shapes to represent olivine one of the most common minerals in igneous rocks it has a high crystallization temperature so it can start forming seeds in the magma even before it leaves the volcano and the seeds will generally keep growing as the magma flows out of the volcano and slowly starts to cool but when lava cools instantly like when it's suddenly exposed to water or air seeds don't have time to grow this is why igneous rocks like obsidian are smooth and glassy and no two volcanoes are exactly the same time temperature and minerals all matter that's especially true when it comes to volcanoes on other planetary bodies in 2022 nasa plans to send a spacecraft to psych an asteroid between mars and jupiter that appears to be made of nickel and iron researchers believe that if psych has volcanoes they may be metal-based features called pharaoh volcanoes that spit up metal instead of silica rock or spurious pharaoh volcanoes which combine the two pharaoh volcanoes are actually still theoretical at this point we know they're possible we just don't know what they'd look like that's why the folks at syracuse decided to make a spurious volcano using rock and metal they found that metal moves faster and sinks lower since it's denser than silicate rock this means ferro volcanoes might look a little different volcanoes shape themselves as layers of lava build up along the sides so a pure feral volcano would probably look flatter and sprawl farther than the typical conical shape we see here on earth by demonstrating how a pharaoh volcano would work and look scientists should be able to recognize and interpret formations found on psych or any other metal bodies that make up the complex geology of our solar system [Music] you
