[Music] this gray 3d printed face is my actual face but this white one is based solely on my dna that's not what i expected at all it's not an exact match to say the least but forensic scientists are tirelessly improving their ability to identify people without ever seeing their faces why in criminal cases involving unidentified remains recognition can be the last chance to develop leads after traditional methods fall short and if they're lucky giving a victim their identity back could close the case that's what happened in 2017 when a company called parabon created this facial reconstruction the image got 26 year old shaquana caldwell recognized and in turn caught her killer after months with no leads parabon combined two methods of facial reconstruction forensic sculpture and dna phenotyping forensic sculpture uses skull remains and population samples to create an idea of what the victim looked like but this method won't ever be 100 percent accurate dna on the other hand could get us as close as we can to a copy machine that's how we ended up at shriver lab at penn state this is just envelopes and envelopes of hair in any other place this cabinet full of hair would be really weird they're collecting data about people's hair type facial features and more to build an algorithm to take my dna and spit out a replica of my face does everyone sound like this or they do it i'm nervous i'm not going to recognize myself when i see it on the screen not because it's not a good reproduction but because i have a different vision of myself than reality ready i'm ready okay that's not what i expected at all this final image is a composite of my genetic info and the collected data from people who share my genetic ancestry right now the algorithm works best meaning the predicted face is most recognizable when a person looks well statistically average so you can get ancestry axes estimated from the genotypes and then we layer on top the feature-specific genotypes gotcha there are some big differences between my actual and predicted faces which is telling me that we need more information in the model humans share about 99.9 of dna but what makes me look like me is in the last 0.1 and that's thanks to single nucleotide polymorphisms the variations in base pairs throughout our genes this is easiest to see with our eyes i have two adenine at the base pair most associated with having brown or hazel eyes which i do now if you take the a's out and you replace them with two guanine then that likelihood shifts towards blue or green mark and his team are building a database of which snips affect which features we're really at an early stage i mean we have 200 genes that have significant effects on the face at the moment their formula isn't perfect a lot of traits are controlled by multiple snips so it isn't a simple one to one connection you know the distinctive features that we really rely on to identify each other are not are not necessarily coming through small details are missing like my cheek mole and my nose is a bit pointier in reality i don't usually think i look like my dad but without the mapping the texture mapping i think this looks a lot like him and those are probably genes with big effects because you know those differences that you see that make somebody distinctive often stand out in their siblings like you said your face looks like your dad plus snips are associated with different traits not definitive proof of them like i have all the right snips for not having a cleft chin but tell that to all of my bullies who called me butt chin growing up with so much variation to get this closer to this mark and his team need data from as many people as possible and so if you already have our dna what are we getting here in order to inform our research we need to take measurements and data on many phenotypes the idea is that hopefully by collecting all of this data and associating it with what you really look like we can then use that to inform an algorithm to predict on someone that we don't know this information about so i decided to offer up my data to the algorithm all right snip away hair can make or break a case but the most common form of forensic hair analysis isn't scientific the most common forensic form of hair analysis often uses racial categories to categorize hair and so in this way we're able to study hair more objectively we're going to embed your hair in a low melt point plastic and then cut that embedded chip in half and that'll allow us to look down the shaft of the hair and so we call that cross-sectional and we can look at the elliptical nature of your hair whether it's more circular the thickness see if you have a medulla because some people don't have a medulla in their hair the medulla is the center portion of the hair you kind of think of it as like the bone marrow of the hair this is really important forensically because if you are a forensic scientist you get up on the stand you say it's an african hair type then you're going to sway the jury into thinking that the perpetrator was a specific race they also sample your skin pigmentation so what this does is it measures the melanin in your skin i'm going to need three parts i'm going to need this part of your arm right here with your palm facing up because it's not exposed to a lot of light you're gonna need your forehead because that's exposed to a lot of light i've seen and we're gonna need your hair because we're gonna be also looking at your hair pigmentation this little thing is sort of like what they use in makeup stores yep that's right for weight and bmi the danita scale shoots a small amount of electricity through your body okay we're gonna electrocute you okay small what about my mic pack it should be fun okay you don't feel it i know i'm just nervous because i'm a participant in the research they need to know what my actual face looks like so this is essentially our low-tech zero gravity machine oh i feel it i'm in space gravity affects how your face lies on top of your skull so getting photos from all angles provides a more accurate final product basically what we'll do is we'll take all the photos from all the angles that we took put them into our vector software and actually stitch them together so we'll get something that you can actually revolve around on a computer screen you're going to put this up next to the the recreation from my dna and see how they match yeah we're going to see how accurate we can predict your face by using known faces to check their work they can hone the accuracy of the algorithm when predicting unknown faces and the more times they see snips correlating with different traits the more definitively they can connect them do you have to sample everyone on earth to get this perfectly accurate we don't need to sample everybody to understand how something works we need a representative sample ethnically or population appropriate i wouldn't take our methods and the data we've collected and go to finland and say okay let's set up a big phenotyping lab here without sampling finnish people there's still a long way to go before this technology can become mainstream one of my deep concerns over the forensic applications of molecular photo fitting are the premature deployment of the methodology it's important that investigators understand what you found and will use that information that you found appropriately otherwise you give the investigator an image of what the person might look like and they can say well that image is not the same as my defendant the team needs to collect more data improve the computational power of the algorithm and simply more time to get things right but even then dna is just your blueprint not the final product as we mentioned snips rely on probability plus there's plenty of environmental factors that come into play we don't expect every tree feature is predictable even identical twins it can't tell us things like a person's gender if they have scars or if they dye their hair or wear makeup some might enjoy the sun much more than the other twin and you can see those kinds of differences emerging because the environment the key to using dna phenotyping to solve crimes isn't perfecting the tech it's understanding its limitations this has been a 20-year project already and you know i expect we'll continue in the next uh five ten years we'll have you know more than double our current sample size and be able to say a lot more about appearance all right so much sure do i have a medusa medulla sorry oh is that what you're trying to do
