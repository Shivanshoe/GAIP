you shouldn't swim in the ocean because a shark might smell you i want to do like [Music] pms is made up myth tampons can get lost in the vagina that is a complete and utter myth the vagina is not that big it can do lots of magical things but it's not that big i'm dr wendy goodall mcdonald i'm a board-certified obstetrician gynecologist and i specialize in caring for humans with vaginas i am dr kiara king i'm a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist in the chicagoland area and i see women throughout all of their reproductive stages from adolescence through menopause and today we will be debunking myths about periods myths from social media periods should always last a week a normal period can last anywhere between two and seven days so if someone has a five day period that's okay if someone has a two day period that's okay if someone has a six day period that's okay it's all within the realm of normal if we're getting past that seven day mark if you're going into eight nine ten days two weeks of full bleeding that can be abnormal tampons can get lost in the vagina that is a complete and uh utter myth the top of the vagina is literally almost like we call it an apex but there's like a dome shaped space almost and the cervix kind of hangs down into that space but that's it it can't penetrate that tissue it can't get lost inside of your abdomen occasionally a person will come in saying that their tampon is lost and they don't see it and i don't see it well you probably took it out or it fell out or it will be there kind of tucked up in you know in a ball behind the cervix but it can't get lost inside the vagina the vagina is not that big pms is made up hmm myth who is saying this it is not a person with a vagina saying this it can't be pms is very real it stands for premenstrual syndrome it encompasses both physical and emotional symptoms related to the period often the symptoms will arise anywhere from 10 to 12 days prior to the period depressive symptoms anxiety stress just feeling not yourself or cramping headaches body aches very real and some women even have something called pmdd which almost takes some of those mood changes to kind of the next level regular exercise has been shown to improve pms symptoms birth control sometimes can help sometimes it can make it worse sometimes people can take supplements or increase their plant-based component of their diet decrease their simple sugars it's so important to acknowledge that these symptoms are real so that people don't then feel like there's something wrong with them for having symptoms that are physiologically occurring in their body severe period pain is normal up to about 80 to 90 of women will experience some period pain but the thing that i look at most in terms of quantifying pain is how it's impacting someone's life is it causing them to miss school are they incapacitated and in bed all day are they not able to be present in their lives that is not normal to be in such pain that you can no longer function severe period pains can sometimes be relatively genetic but it can also be due to endometriosis fibroids can cause severe pain you'd be surprised how much menstrual discomfort is also related to constipation or diarrhea ibs symptoms can kind of coincide with menstrual symptoms but i would definitely want a person who is having severe pain to see if there's a possibility for an ultrasound or other evaluation to try to manage that pain better our lives are so much more than our cycles and we should be able to do you know our regular activities even when it's happening menstrual cups are one size fits all menstrual cups are one size fits most a person that's looking to use a menstrual cup may want to try one or two sizes to see what fit is going to be best for them you may have to go within one or two different brands to find a cup size that is right for your cervix and for your vagina there usually are at least two to three sizes within any particular company if you were to give just the gentlest of tugs on that stem if the menstrual cup moved out of place it's probably too big if you feel that there's a little bit of resistance and a little bit of give and it doesn't seem to be moving then it's probably a good fit for you myths experts hear the most you can't get pregnant while you're on your period partial myth and the reason why i'm going to call it a partial myth is because technically within a person's menstrual cycle you ovulate if you don't get pregnant 14 days give or take after ovulation your period comes the lining sheds the hotel room is turned over and is ready to receive a pregnancy next month so when that period comes and when that lining is shedding you should not be ovulating meaning releasing an egg that could be fertilized however every person's bleeding is not necessarily a period i think a period tracking app can be very helpful so if you know really what your menstrual cycle looks like and the timing of it that can help determine if any other bleeding times are period bleeding or not i have no reason to tell a person to not have sex on their period again other than making sure if they're unprotected that it is their period and that they're not gonna be surprising themselves in nine months take-home message irregular bleeding and irregular periods is not birth control having a regular period is necessary for your health i'm gonna take your your line dr wendy i'm gonna go with partial myth when young girls start um getting their periods it's like a vital sign that the brain is sending the proper signals to the old reasons the ovaries are signaling the uterus to do what it needs to do so in that respect it is normal to have a period every month and there are a few times where it's not essential for example if someone is on a form of hormonal birth control with a birth control pill you're technically having a withdrawal bleed and not actually a period that is regulated by the brain and the ovaries and the uterus with something like an iud the lining of the uterus becomes so thin that there's really not much to shed tmi because i'm a gynecologist have not had a period in five years that's fine but i have an iud that is progestin containing that is keeping my uterus nice and you know thin the lining nice and thin so i haven't needed this thing i bought it i haven't even used it whether or not you have a period has to do more with who you are as in what stage in your life you're in whether or not you're on hormonal birth control and a conversation with your health care provider because either option whether you have periods or don't can be healthy and normal but it can also be potentially very harmful to your health you shouldn't swim in the ocean because a shark might smell you i want to do like [Music] more than likely a person that is menstruating will have in a tampon or menstrual cup if they're going swimming even further decreasing the amount of blood that could potentially be detected so that's one thing two sharks kind of hunt for their prey and humans aren't typically shark prey and so when they are looking for their next meal they are looking for very specific like amino acids that they will be able to detect so it's probably safe to go out in the water you know if you're on your period but i mean is that are people just swimming with sharks these days just randomly i don't know and if there's like shark signs beware of shark i'm probably just not gonna go out in the water anyway having a regular period means you're fertile so first of all a period cycle it's normal for it to be anywhere from 21 days to 35 days day one to day one if they're shorter than that or longer than that then that's not necessarily considered a regular period and it can bring into question whether or not a person is ovulating meaning releasing an egg every month and you need to ovulate and release an egg in order to be fertile but there are other factors that are involved when it comes to fertility it's the uterus and whether or not there are you know structures polyps fibroids in there that can impair fertility what are those tubes doing what's that cervix up to you know is it healthy when's the last time you had a pack a regular period that falls in that kind of category that i mentioned is suggested that a person is fertile but it's just not the end of the story a person who is menstruating can spoil food by preparing it if you want to eat or not you know what i'm saying like no that is a complete myth your menstrual flow has nothing to do with whether or not you're going to spoil milk or eggs that's not a scientific phenomenon so so i'm just gonna make my mac and cheese and i'm keeping it to myself if you believe that dough will surprise canned goods will not spoil mayonnaise will not curdle in period blood it's not unclean it's nothing there's nothing about it that emits anything that is spoiled that can spoil things or that is unclean or unsafe myths from pop culture people's periods will sync up if they spend enough time together i had to actually do a little investigation on this one because my initial thought was that this was true there was some research done back in the 70s by a woman named martha mcclintock and she did a small study of about 135 women and found some evidence that when women are around each other in close settings let's say a dorm they're on sports teams together that their periods were starting to sync up and it was actually dubbed the mcclintock effect subsequent research has been done and one was using a period tracking app that had about 1500 women in the study another was of about 180 plus or so women in china that lived in a dorm together and what those larger studies found was that there did not seem to be a sinking up of cycles based on the proximity that you were to these other people so i think there seems to be some anecdotal evidence you know moms and daughters sisters you know they're living together but it seems that there that it's more coincidental that their periods just happen to be occurring at the same time versus syncing up due to maybe hormonally mediated causes periods are dirty periods are not dirty menstrual blood is just that it's menstrual blood it's a physiologic process it signals that a pregnancy didn't happen and it's getting ready to make that uterus a welcome home again potentially um and so that blood has to go somewhere but it's not inherently dirty blood can potentially carry pathogens viruses so we certainly want to be um cautious in terms of how it's handled we have to manage it just like we would manage our armpits you know our underarms or our breath and our teeth to keep ourselves healthy but not because it's dirty people often feel the need to go on overdrive when it comes to vulvar and vaginal hygiene and it's really not necessary there's absolutely no need to douche that could potentially disrupt the normal vaginal ph which can make you more prone to infection so i would generally recommend just a mild um soap and water externally on the vulva i usually say if it's not hair bearing leave it alone only women get periods humans with uteruses and vaginas get periods but that could be a trans man that could be a person who is non-binary blood comes out of uteruses cyclically if a person is off of birth control and within reproductive age and maybe not cyclically if a person is on hormonal birth control or has had their uterus removed but any human with the uterus and the vagina can have a period a period is a physiologic function it does not define womanhood by any means the biggest takeaway i would like for anyone watching this video to come away with is that our periods are healthy our periods are normal it's okay to not have a period if you choose to not have a period and you are navigating that space with a healthcare provider you came
