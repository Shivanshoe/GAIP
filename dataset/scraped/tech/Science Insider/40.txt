kind of love this one my teen purposely pushes my buttons your teen is not consciously pushing your buttons playing certain sports can make your teen grow taller if there were a sport like that everyone would probably be doing that sport parents shouldn't talk to their kids about sex children have riskier behavior when they don't talk to their parents about sex and sexuality it's not the reverse hi i'm dr blair hammond general pediatrician at mount sinai hospital where i've been for 18 years i'm also the co-founding director and director of medical education of the mount sinai parenting center hi i'm dr elisa pressman i'm a developmental psychologist i'm an assistant clinical professor at mount sinai hospital and the other co-founder of the mount sinai parenting center i'm also the host of the podcast raising good humans today we'll be debunking myths about parenting teens and we're both parents of teens yes adolescence starts at 13 and ends at 18. this is a myth it feels very comfortable to keep adolescence in a small window puberty can start as early as eight or nine it doesn't just end at 18 where their prefrontal cortex is at full growth and they're ready to go out into the world they still are experiencing changes into their 20s and this prefrontal cortex that we talk about is this area right in the front part of the brain that's involved with judgment inhibition even morality it's important to remember that adolescence is a time of tremendous growth in fact it's the second largest brain growth period after that first zero to three period all teenagers are risk takers who want to try drugs and alcohol this is not true certainly adolescence is a risk-taking time as we know and it's a time of experimenting but many adolescents do not try alcohol or drugs one thing that happens in adolescence is they are more all gas and no breaks and so it can mean that their impulse control isn't mature enough to make decisions particularly with groups of other adolescents and the other thing to remember is that the teenage brain hyper rationalizes so their tendency is to look at the positive outcome so if you're going to get into a car and you've been with people who are drinking you've been drinking an adolescent brain that's hyper rationalizing is going to say there's only a 10 chance that something bad will happen what you want them to do is move to just thinking the bigger picture what does that 10 percent look like and is that what i want for another human being or me putting their life at danger putting my life at danger and of course the answer is no strict parents raise well-behaved children if we could change this to strict parents sometimes raise well-behaved children in front of them that would be the only way this would be true strict controlling parents may have kids who seem like they behave but they have covert behaviors that are terrifying because they are more scared of getting in trouble with you than they are the actual danger if you have no boundaries and expectations you also can get kids who get into a lot of trouble and make poor decisions high expectations of children is great having boundaries setting limits for your child in a warm and sensitive way where you collaborate and you're like okay does this seem reasonable what's considered authoritative parenting you are less likely to have kids who act out and misbehave in ways that are dangerous i think that's what every parent is trying to teach their child to have that intrinsic motivation to make good choices on their own teens are addicted to social media for a lot of teens it's not about addiction it's just about connection addiction happens when you get rewards intermittently and you keep seeking those rewards and you can't stop yourself from wanting to seek those rewards and i think the word addiction is commonly used when it interferes with a teen's ability to function or to do other things they want to do that's when it becomes something that you need to look at more seriously and then the other thing is remember more than what you say what you do influences what your children do and so how can you make it something that you both sort of learn together and so it seems more of a discussion and a collaborative decision about social media playing certain sports can make your teen grow taller that is actually a myth if there were a sport like that everyone would probably be doing that sport so sports like volleyball and tennis might give the appearance because it is helpful to be tall in those sports but it is not the sport that has actually made them taller the number one thing is actually genetics so looking at the height of each parent we talk about something called mid parental height it is important to get good nutrition adequate calories calcium and vitamin d and also getting good sleep at night to help with growth i encourage sports but unfortunately the reason for encouraging sports is not to make your child taller playing video games will rot your teen's brain mostly a myth so of course the research on video games and phones and social media is tricky because there are a lot of confounding variables but for the most part the damage from video games that people talk about are being sedentary that so much time sitting is very bad for kids and that violent video games are connected with or associated with more aggressive behavior but actually only slightly teenagers do connect over video games which is something different than when we grew up playing video games they now have these headsets and it's a way for them to actually have social interactions instead of thinking of video games as all bad try to understand them and maybe even play them with your team so that if that's something that they're into they can explain to you what's so exciting about it and play it with you teens don't need to take vitamins i would say for some this is a myth some teenagers they have very healthy diets and they get everything they need from their diets but there are a fair amount of teenagers who are actually deficient most commonly in vitamin d and in iron especially menstruating teens so iron is something you need for your red blood cells if you are bleeding every month you are using up red blood cells and eating more iron stores and it's also been shown recently to help prevent inflammation iron is often high in meats green leafy vegetables but if your child is having heavy periods in particular that can make them at increased risk for being iron deficient and in that case i would recommend a multivitamin my teen purposely pushes my butt your teen is not consciously pushing your buttons they need to move away from their primary caregivers and toward their peers that's part of the natural evolution of being a teen it hurts the other reason is to vent and they need an outlet and they need a place to just let go so oftentimes it feels personal they're pushing your buttons but actually you are their safe haven they know you're not going anywhere no matter what they say to you hopefully the repair is more important than the disconnect and that strengthens the relationship and also builds their skill at coming together after a disconnect parents shouldn't talk to their kids about sex this is a common myth actually that if you talk to your kids about sex you're going to make them more interested in sex but actually what has been shown is that parents who talk to their children about sex and have open discussions have kids more likely to engage in sex later and are more likely to practice safe sex meaning decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases decreased risk of teen pregnancy children have riskier behavior when they don't talk to their parents about sex and sexuality it's not the reverse not talking about something does not stop a behavior and in fact it can be dangerous you want to be a person that they can ask questions to and that you can help them find the knowledge because if you don't they have the internet they have many ways to look it up on their own and they can also feel like you're disapproving and are not interested if you never bring it up there is no one right age to start talking about sex but what can be important is thinking about relationships about communication about bodies about puberty about sexuality about intimacy and those are going to be part of a long and wonderful relationship that you're going to have with your child because you're an askable parent being depressed is a natural part of being a teenager first of all it is absolutely true that teenagers feel feelings bigger and so they come across sometimes as more emotionally charged so a sadness that occurs might sound like a louder sadness and that can be confusing when you actually have a teenager who's experiencing depression versus a teenager who's experiencing the natural much higher highs and lower lows that are part of the adolescent brain separately depression is an epidemic in adolescence 80 of the diagnoses in adults were available and visible in adolescence depression is so common as you mentioned especially right now sadly suicide is the second leading cause of death in children ages 10 to 24. and there are specific symptoms of depression if they're really feeling sadness to the point where they lose interest in things they're usually interested in if they're socially withdrawn depression can present as irritability if you have a child who seems really angry and really irritable that should be something you should investigate further and have them talk about their feelings it lets them know that you're interested in knowing how they feel and where they are and if you have suspicions that your child might be having depression please make sure you contact their doctor and let them know because there is such great treatment out there i also try and encourage every teen to think about mental health like they think about physical health in a preventive way exercising every day helps release endorphins and neural chemicals which make people feel better and happier that's important teens are lazy all teens are lazy is actually a myth one of the reasons why teens are perceived as lazy is because they have an altered sleep wake schedule their circadian rhythm is different so your team when you want them to wake up at 7 00 a.m to go to school seems so sleepy and lazy and unmotivated however if you wanted to have a really in-depth conversation with them at 1am they might be really into it and that of course is because of the altered sleep cycle of teens only girls struggle with eating disorders eating disorders do not only occur in girls body image is a big thing for teens really in general and obsessions with being thin is classically thought of with anorexia nervosa where people have restrictive eating and they take in less and have significant weight loss and still have this obsessive thinking that they are not thin enough and have to lose more weight there's bulimia which is binge eating and purging either through vomiting or using laxatives and then there's exercise disorders and so some of these other types of eating disorders you wouldn't be able to tell just looking at them of course building muscles and being physically fit is good for your bone strength but we want to emphasize it from a position of health and wellness and balance and another thing is there is a genetic and behavioral link between parental eating disorders and adolescent eating disorders and so if you have an unchecked eating disorder there's a great motivator to get help so that you can model healthy eating behaviors boys will be boys we've all learned that this is a ridiculous statement except people still say it so what do they mean i think it's a justification for a lot of negative unhealthy behaviors when parents feel out of control and they can't figure out what to do with their son they might say something like boys will be boys they're talking about excusing impulse control behavior problems they're talking about how there are myths about boys sexuality and their developing sex drive and how they're looking at other people and none of those things are actually true are there differences between female and male birth assignment and adolescent developing brains there are minor differences when you look at the statistics they're not big enough to brush it off as boys will be boys and it's super toxic to blame behaviors and have lower expectations of an adolescent simply because their sex assignment with birth was male the only person you can control is you and so as a parent you have to think of how you can change your actions to help your child remembering that the adolescent brain is going through a huge huge amount of growth changes and renovations and that with your support and understanding along with all of the appropriate boundaries that you provide they're gonna do great yeah i i love parenting and adolescent me too
