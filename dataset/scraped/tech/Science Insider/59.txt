by deloitte here's our host co-editor-in-chief business insider matt turner hi i'm matt turner and i'm excited to be your host the scientific consensus on climate change is almost unanimous and our planet is already experiencing its effects beyond the risks for businesses across industries including labor shortages supply chain disruption and higher production costs climate change poses an existential threat to humanity at the same time more and more business stakeholders employees and executives are demanding action we can no longer ignore the issue before we dive into this important

founder of the world economic forum and we're here to discuss the universal approach to measuring progress in the fight against climate change now over to insiders senior strategy reporter marguerite ward thanks matt hi everyone and welcome my name is marguerite ward and i'm a senior reporter at insider writing for this section called better capitalism today we're talking about the corporate fight against climate change here with me to talk about everything from how to avoid corporate greenwashing to the esg movement is professor klaus schwab founder and executive chairman of the world economic forum and author of the book stakeholder capitalism klaus thank you so much for joining me great pleasure to be with you margaret there's more and more recognition that a viable economy not only relies on treating people well but treating the climate well as you describe in your book do you think ceos have fully adopted this mindset that treating the climate well is good for shareholders certainly those executives who have a longer-term thinking have clearly adopted this mindset and if you look at the reasons they are very obvious so it's first an economic reason i think what we have learned from the corona virus is that prevention the cost for prevention is much lesser compared to the cost of removing afterwards the damage so we have a situation where you have a kind of free ride because you don't have to integrate all your external costs into your into your business model but someone will have to pay for it or we will be in a situation like tobacco companies where down the road you will have class action and already today investors recognize this dangerous risk those are investors who hesitate to provide capital to companies who really are damaging the c environment so you you really believe that investors are recognizing the risk i said investors who are thinking long term of course if you want to make a fastback it's a different matter but at the end i think companies will recognize that they will be better off even economically if they take care of the nature because young people i mean at least my employees don't want to work anymore for a company or foreign organization which is damaging the nature and i think clients customers do not want to buy products of such a company so um i think it's in the direct commercial business interest of companies to take care of the planet absolutely in your book you write ultimately it's actions rather than words that make the difference in becoming a stakeholder company when i think of accountability in climate change i think of esg metrics environmental social and governance criteria here in the u.s the sec just created an esg task force to promote the disclosure and transparency of esg criteria and a report by proxy review shows that over 300 esg proxies are headed to vote this spring how do you feel about the surge in attention to esg reporting i think it's a great evolution some people would even say a revolution but we should not forget that the esg metrics of measuring esg responsibility is only part of a total integrated system it starts with defining your strategies where you have to take into account the present and maybe even future expectations of your stakeholders so it's a strategy formulation it's the responsibility of support it is of course execution not only inside the company itself but throughout the whole supply network and at the end you have the measurement system uh cesg metrics so we should not look at the esg metrics just as some kind of a formal let's say additional reporting system i think to do cesg performance in the right way you you have to look at it as an ecosystem which integrates the company as a whole so esg is part of the is the tail system if i may say so but it starts by the integration of environmental social good governance criteria into your strategic process now there are those who are still against certain esg metrics for example billionaire investor warren buffett recently urged shareholders to reject proposals for more transparency of climate-related risks and diversity and inclusion efforts what would you say to buffett and others who reject more transparency i would like to have a discussion with him i would tell him look particularly since you are very heavily exposing insurance business why don't you engage actively into more esc responsibility because it may backfire to you one day in your insurance business you may be caught by not having an integrated policy where you pursue profitability but also you take care of people and the planners the three piece profitability people and planners three pieces you mentioned that esg reporting is just the tail end or the part of a system to care about the climate people profitability do we need more do we need a global task force to fight climate change president biden is asking congress to approve hundreds of billions of dollars to remake transit in the u.s overhaul power grids expand clean energy in a plan that the white house says will it will fight climate change what do you think of this kind of package it's not enough to hold only corporations responsible i think we have a common responsibility all stakeholders of global society which means corporations of course have to absorb a lot of responsibilities in this respect but it's also as individual consumers and as you rightly say it's a government and the government has to contribute to fight a climate change by creating the necessary incentives but also this is incentives i think so still too many governments around the world who provide subsidies for activities which actually are damaging for the climate and i think we need the government to step in to build the necessary infrastructures and i have seen in the programme of president biden a great emphasis on the electricity grids if we want to use wind power or solar energy the place where we produce energy maybe not not very close to where we actually need the energy so you need to create as a distribution system so what we need is an integrated approach we cannot fight climate change by doing here a little bit serve a little bit we need a really integrated ecosystem approach and i think here the government has a major role to play and to provide a kind of integrated vision for the future going back to the corporate world for a minute doesn't the case of danone and the recent ousting of its ceo show that focusing on esg metrics can lead to a non-confidence vote of shareholders yes of course we have the famous case now of dannon the ceo was ousted and criticism was he has been [Music] devoting his time and his attention much much much too much uh to the esc dimension and not to his shareholders but i think it's a long uh economy we we shouldn't make an artificial let's say polarization between profitability on the one hand and people and planet on the other hand i think the art of good management today is to create the right balance and not to be too much just keeping in mind his stakeholders or keeping in mind his or her shareholders and i give you a practical example if we compare that on with unilever unilever is certainly recognized worldwide as a company which is at the forefront of esg thinking but at the same time the share price of unilever has doubled more or less in the last 10 years the share price of done on has quite had some difficulties to evolve or even had a negative with development in the last year so you can you can serve your shareholders are also stakeholders so you can serve your shareholders as well as your other stakeholders let me ask you this do you think dennon made a mistake yes i didn't pay uh sufficiently attention to develop also the business um at the end i mean it's very clear you you have to create profitability but when i talk here about a profitable business i think of long-term uh a long-term dimension and not just short term and so it's it's a balance um and management good management is always a balance uh so you just have today to manage an additional dimension which means the balance to pay attention to your shareholders and at the same time at two euros stakeholders it's undoubtedly a hard balance to strike what company stands out to you as doing especially well when it comes to tackling climate change what are they doing right can you give me an example i would say if if you ask me companies of course i'm i'm looking at the most at the hardest hit companies hardest in terms of being confronted with a major need of transformation and here if i look at the oil industry i just take as an example total as a french oil company total is one of the 70 companies which the form brought together to commit to to report on metrics which we have developed uh in our international business council under the guidance of um cryomonians the ceo of bank of america together with the four audit companies now total is one of the first companies if you look at the report 2020 where they have applied our metrics a bank of america is another one and 70 companies will follow but even if we take all our goodwill it will not be enough what we need is innovation in order to decarbonize the world or to make it carbon neutral by 2050 a lot of new technological progress has to be achieved our present technology does not suffice so i i see here a great opportunity we can move into an age of green innovations and those innovations will also uh provide an impetus into economic growth so many people have a tendency to see our climate our fight against climate change as a cost under something which is negative yes it may be to a certain extent but it's also a great opportunity and it fits into a general development which we i see in the world i think we move away and if i look at the young generations the world economic forum has a community of young leaders 10 000 if i talk to them they have a different mindset they have a different picture of the world it's not only the material dimension income or gdp and so on it's well-being and climate change is interconnected with pollution it's interconnected with a lot of health issues so if we want to invest into our well-being then we have to invest into fighting climate change you mentioned innovation who's a leader that's really paving the way in terms of climate change and what can we learn from this person so many or many leaders in their own fields if you take a company a danish company a scandinavian company like westers who transformed itself into a energy company mainly based on renewable energies uh wind power solar power and so on but and here i come back to the esg's it's not enough to have a good intention you have to uh a measurement system which shows that you make good steps towards the final objective which is carbon neutral so if you if you explain you want to be carbon neutral in let's say in 2030 you have to reduce your carbon emission already next year by 10 percent uh if you want to be credible many good examples and what we need and what's the world economic forum by the way uh is providing our platforms to exchange best practices we all talk now very much about this notion of machine learning we need what i would call institutional learning where we exchange good practices as much as possible and we do not have a situation where some people are pioneers and the rest is very far lagging behind speaking of pioneers gm america's largest car manufacturer said it would go carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040 apple committed to be 100 carbon neutral for its supply chain and products by 2030. do you think these timelines are realistic and are they fast enough of course we speak about a carbon a carbon free world or calm neutral world by 2050 that's the objectives of the paris agreement and most countries have subscribed to this objective and many many companies have now also issued statements that they would achieve carbon neutrality now we have to be aware that the situation is not the same for each company we have let's say the energy companies we have the exxons chevrons and so on who will have much more challenges to reach this objective of carbon neutrality in 2050 compared to google or even compared to a car manufacturer which understands already the technology but again i come back setting objectives is not enough being measured in the execution is important and here's the esgs come in again do you think the energy sector companies like chevron exxon are fully bought into the stakeholder capitalism model have they bought in enough to fighting climate change i would answer it the following way if they haven't bought in yet into the stakeholder concept they are on the wrong side of history i'm deeply convinced that we are now really at the inflection point where society as a whole does not anymore tolerate companies which are damaging nature or which are not upholding diversity and social justice and so on i think we have a completely new social consciousness and we have now also a world where every let's say deficiency can be reported very fast and can create a negative reaction so if i were exxon and so on companies who who are really challenged we should not forget those companies need a complete transformation of some business models i would i would commit to the to to stakeholder concept but would also try to create understanding in the public that for me being in the energy sector it may be much more difficult compared to a company which is already providing products which do not necessarily damage the environment so it's a communications effort looking forward besides watching esg proxy votes and corporate pledges what else are you excited about when it comes to tackling climate change because as you said you know you don't see it as only a negative or a a burden you see it as a possibility for innovation what are you excited about i'm very excited because as i just mentioned we have a new we have a new mindset we have a new social consciousness creta and turnberg and other people um we got very aware that something is wrong here in in in our lifestyles and we will have to suffer down the road or our children will have to suffer or we are directly affected so we are now in a situation where a climate change or the the attention given to climate change uh provides us also with a higher sensitivity for other deficiencies which we have i mentioned already a lack of inclusion a system which is not necessarily fair in providing everybody with the necessary opportunities and i think see the pandemic has contributed to this new alertness to this new sensitivity it's a it's a wake-up call to adapt and to make sure that we have all at the end better lives that's what we are fighting for it's true we're absolutely at a turning point i want to thank my guest professor claus schwab for joining us today he shared valuable insight on the esg movement and how it can advance the fight against climate change how important accountability is to stakeholder capitalism and what companies are doing well in the push to becoming more green i encourage everyone to check out klaus's new book stakeholder capitalism and to follow insider's better capitalism section thanks so much for your time klaus thank you margaret sir matt back to you thank you marguerite and thank you so much professor schwab for sharing these insights on the note of sharing great insights on esg sustainability and climate action insider is launching a brand new sustainability newsletter so you can get the latest intel right in your inbox you can sign up using the dashboard below our next session highlights the corporate voice in the climate action conversation but first we'd like to play a brief video from deloitte to set the stage for this session this year we have been challenged as a global community reminding us again there is no viable business in a declining environment taking better care of our people and our planet has moved into the c-suite as top-level priorities because sustainability is smart business there is no turning back only forward join us in rewriting the future as we guide you on the path to real change through sustainable business practices that protect our planet our people together [Music] welcome and thank you for joining what i know is going to be a really interesting panel discussion from commitment to action i'm david sproul deloitte global deputy chief executive i've always been a big believer that business has a responsibility to be a force for good in the world to genuinely put profit and purpose in balance and the topic of climate change is at the top of the agenda for all ceos and leadership teams globally i'm thrilled to be joined by two other business leaders who i know share the same sentiment so let's introduce them firstly we have judith batula she's the director of corporate responsibility sustainability and public affairs at sainsbury's one of the uk's largest grocers and retailers and we're also joined by rebecca marmot chief sustainability officer unilever judith rebecca i'm delighted you can both join me today to share your perspectives on how business leaders are responding to the expectations of stakeholders customers or employees in meeting client commitments and i'm going to just kick things off with a data point from the recent deloitte survey climate check-in with over 750 executives globally now in this report 82 percent of executives said their organizations are concerned or very concerned about climate change and my first question to you is given you're both focused on sustainability fairly or unfairly there's a lot of sentiment among commentators journalists the media that the business community is also no action so what are your views on that and rebecca maybe we start with you thanks david uh well i think there's lots of action there's been a massive acceleration in in recent years initially paris and the sdgs and i think all of these topics not just climate but the wider sustainability agenda has become much more mainstream we've seen it with a huge ramp up in esg investing uh selling report i think yesterday predicted for the growth of 53 trillion by next year and we've seen it with consumer behavior as well we know now kantar put out a a report recently showing that brands with a strong purpose grow about 175 faster than those where they don't put that front and center and i think that's because consumers really really care about that and we've certainly at unilever really been taking action on that since this company began but but really formally since 2010 with the unilever's sustainable living plan and again to back to what i just said with canter we've seen our sustainable living brands so when we put sustainability and purpose front and center grow twice as quickly i think on climate change in particular um there has been an awful lot of action it's been hugely accelerated i think by the pandemic and the realization of how much nature and society are completely interwoven certainly at unilever we've made a lot of tangible actions starting internally in our own business we've got 100 renewable energy now across all our global operations it saves a lot of money over a billion euros billion pounds for us since 2008 they're crucial this is about business as well as about doing the right thing we've reduced our total waste per ton by nearly 96 percent since 2008 and we've really most recently put out a climate transition action plan so we're taking that to an advisory vote at our agm in early may to really actually mapping out short medium and long-term goals around how we're going to achieve our climate targets and for us that's about being that zero across all our operations by 2030 and right the way from sorting to shelf by 2039 we've looked at our own supply chain we're going to replace all the fossil fuel derived carbon that goes into the cleaning products the laundry portfolio and replace that with renewable recycled carbon be deforestation free just two years time we've said that and half our use of all of our plastic virgin plastic by 2025 so i think there's a ton of action going on i do understand that there is some skepticism i know there was an oxford not zero research recently that said i think it was just over 20 percent of the world's biggest corporates have set net zero targets which is brilliant it's great progress but obviously that means that we've still got nearly four fifths to go um but i think companies are waking up to that we've seen that with the open letters of the biden administration and the states 300 businesses calling on the president to cut ghg emissions so if we can do that before cop i think that will be a really really massive step rebecca thank you and there is definitely in that server i'm into the deloitte climate check survey that there is a lot of feedback that uh reinforces your point companies are taking action isn't just words but we know there's some skepticism there i mean judith maybe you could tell us from a sainsbury's point of view what sensors are doing to drive climate action in response to climate change and and how as in doing that you're also trying to address that that skepticism that some commentators have that there isn't really action behind all the words well well like rebecca the there is a lot going on and you can see that in the commitments that people have made and some of the actions that are being made but i think one of the the key things in all of this is a lot of the action that's taken place so far is in company's own operations because those are the things that it's easy to fix so whether that's the decarbonisation of your energy or heat or refrigeration what you're doing with lighting and all the other things transport electric vehicles and those things aren't particularly customer facing the things that our customer facing that we're all working on require us to work across a long and sometimes complex value chain because we're going right back to agriculture upstream and then trying to influence consumers downstream and that's difficult so i can understand why people think that there isn't much progress we do know though that there is a massive consumer demand for those things and therefore um all the motivation for a business to do the right thing for our customers i would say though that as you progress along this journey to net zero one of the things that is really obvious is that it's very complicated and you have lots of false starts and i think one of the things that that we've learned in that journey with the complicated evolving science evolving data so the more information you get the more you know is that actually it requires a great deal degree of collaboration and and therefore you can't actually drive things in isolation you have to drive things together and as you all know um collaborating is easily said and difficult to do in practice for all sorts of reasons but i think everyone should feel really reassured that all of us you know whether it's unilever sainsbury's and the broader system um is working hard together with coalitions of action coalitions of the willing coalitions of the ambitious to really work together because of course whether it's climate change or whether it's the nature crisis that we're experiencing and and these very real emergencies um they know no geographic boundaries so whether that geography is sainsbury's shops and stores and our supply chains or unilevers or those boundaries are the geographies of the world those things disappear because actually these just are global problems that require us to collaborate as i say i think people should feel reassured that we're doing those things but it is very complicated and managing the trade-offs between whether it's water whether it's greenhouse gas emissions whether it's plastic packaging um all of those things um require us to be very thoughtful and considered and if you look at any of the the plans that are out there everyone would say i probably know how to do half of this the other half is going to be research it's going to be innovation it's going to be seeing what works in practice but there's certainly no lack of commitment across the sector i want to come back to uh near a term because it's really reassuring from both of you that there is action there is real genuine action taking place to uh to move forward one of the things in the survey that i mentioned that surprised me was that over two-thirds of the respondents said that cobid had caused them to slow down climate action i'm interested in both your perspectives whether they're pandemic which of course everyone's had to reprioritize but that's actually been an impetus to do more and go faster whether whether it has caused um things to slow down rebecca maybe you could go first you know i completely understand over the past year everyone a lot of businesses have been focusing on their own employees their own operations um thinking about their supply chains and dealing with the immediate shock of the pandemic but i find it genuinely really mind-boggling that people wouldn't actually continue to realize now even more than before what the impacts of a global crisis have been you know we've seen it with covered on society millions of jobs and livelihoods at risk terrible terrible health crisis people dying just it's so hugely upsetting and from an environmental perspective we've seen an increase for example in the use of plastics again so you know really now the message for me is prevention is far better than the cure this is a crisis as well the climate crisis and we've got got got to take action now and you know certainly we haven't or i'd like to think well we haven't taken our eye off the ball there's a climate crisis in isolation but actually everything that's happening around nature around biodiversity around water migration biological is also interconnected together so i think actually really now is the time more than ever to actually double down and take action and i think even if you know you're not switched on to being able to to project two three five years into the future if you don't take action now certainly thinking from a consumer goods perspective there's already an impact from climate change thinking for example about how growing seasons are changing around the world actually you know we talked a little bit earlier about agriculture the impact of different kinds of pests the floods of droughts you know changing water availability in india and brazil and california that impacts the way that people are living their lives that impacts the way that people would certainly use products for example in the unilever portfolio whether it's to do laundry whether it's cleaning whether it's cooking they're really thinking about that combined with the livelihoods of people who are very much impacted day-to-day by climate change so i started thinking about the farmers again that interconnection between between social and environmental so i i certainly wouldn't advocate holding off at all i think as well again i i mentioned at my first dancer this point around esg investing and certainly we know the pandemic seems to have accelerated the move on to esg and greater importance being placed on companies that are able to show they can survive negative shocks and prove viability and sustainability in the long term and we've seen that fidelity recently with a study that they put out saying companies with better esg ratings less prone to market volatility have fared better during the pandemic judith maybe a quick comment from you on it has covered caused you to slow down and accelerate as you think about those actions you've already got actually the reality is it's forced us to become even more focused because i think what the pandemic has shown us is what we're capable of both individually as a business so what sainsbury's have delivered throughout the corona virus in feeding the nation staying open keeping our colleagues safe keeping our customers safe doubling our online deliveries all of those kinds of things um showing us what we're capable of as a business but also showing us what we're capable of in collaboration with others and indeed the way that government and the private sector have worked together throughout the coronavirus to keep the nation fed has been exemplary i think and and unprecedented and i know that word's been used a lot and it feels a bit like an understatement given where we are on all of this but i think if you take for example the shielding of the clinically vulnerable within the space of 36 hours every single retailer in in the uk shared their online information with a independent third party those data points were cross-referenced with um the clinically vulnerable that had been identified with 1.7 million people with their nhs records all in the public interest and then 65 of those 1.7 million were identified and prioritized for online shopping all in the space of say of 36 hours that is a phenomenal piece of data sharing work in a pre-competitive environment with government um facilitating that in the public interest and if if that's in the public interest then certainly the climate and environmental crises are definitely in the public interest for us to sort so i think there's some really good examples of what's happened over the last year that should give us confidence that we can work differently um to deliver against this additional set of emergencies and and i think is is probably surprising to us all um because if you had said to me would you predict that you would work with your competitors and government in the way that you have i'd that would have been a large stretch for my imagination but but we've shown it's possible yeah now i think it's a great example of the print we both made around the new normal has to include far greater collaboration whether it's commercial collaboration or with government and other stakeholders one of the things that we've all seen is both bigger bolder net zero goals being put out there by company leaders sector leaders but also more scrutiny more scrutiny on es esg measurements more demand from investors is that extra scrutiny is that extra focus on long-term goals is that helpful to you and what you're trying to achieve or unhelpful in terms of trying to stay focused on what's got to get done now uh the answer to that question david is definitely yes because i think the more scrutiny the better and i say that because no single person can work this out on their own as we've said it does require a great degree of collaboration and transformation requires systems shift and quite often when we talk about the system we don't identify all the stakeholders that are required to make that shift and it is the ngos it is the policy makers the regulators it is competitors working more collaboratively and unless we have the uh input from all of those stakeholders into the debate we will not create the system shift we need to see and of course we need to see that quickly and we need to see it at scale and unless we can convene all of those people and and investors included because finance plays a huge role in this and investment with things like the race to trillions will play a huge part in this unless we have that dialogue that conversation then we won't move at the pace and scale that we need to so i welcome it i think we will all be the better for it and the more that we can create those safe spaces to have those conversations and to create that system in the room as it were the better and also the point on collaboration as well i really agree with you we we often at unilever talk about what we call them the multi-stakeholder model and i think that focus on climate is really we're seeing it from all the different stakeholders that judith you were just talking about some of them are people as well you know really when we do employee surveys at unilever pride in working for a company that puts sustainability front and center there's 94 um in our last employee survey we did at the end of last year as to why people want to work at unilever and i think that's even more to the forum more prominent actually when you look at german millennials they want to work for companies that are taking action around issues that are important to them definitely we've seen it with consumers again consumers wanting to buy from companies or from organizations or brands that represent issues that are important to them whether that's around climate or whether it's around society tons and tons of data that came out during the pandemic around people taking views on companies and organizations as to how they'd approach the pandemic i think over a third of people in the edelman study that was done recently said they stopped using the products or services of companies that they didn't feel were engaging around sustainability i've already talked a little bit about shareholders and in the increasing flow of capital into esg funds but you know on this real transparency point i mentioned at the very beginning the climate transition action plan that we are taking to an advisory vote at the agm you know that's really laying ourselves open to scrutiny because we're saying these are our targets and this is the trajectory for how we're going to get there to do this point you know this will require operating in a different kind of way it's going to require working pre-competitively you know things like sustainable sourcing ensuring deforestation free sourcing of all those key crops and commodities that are important really a massive shift as well judas you talked about customers at sainsbury's there are consumers too we've put a billion euros fund out recently to invest in climate and nature solutions to help us reach our targets and we're going to bring that to life through the consumer-based marketing that we're doing so really for example through ben and jerry's they've had a campaign recently if it's melted it's ruined we've been doing this with personal here in the uk we've been dealing with seventh generation to really using the power of our brands to talk about a the importance of climate change but also b what can i do as an individual to make a difference i think also you know lastly governments as well more and more government setting that zero targets china u.s uk maybe eu's new green deal and again i think with that we'll come scrutiny and pressure from stakeholders to say well great you set these targets but how are you going to deliver them so um yep i agree with you dude 100 i think it's great so rebecca what advice would you give to those businesses who are just at the start of this journey are just recognizing the need to change what advice based on your experience you give to them is that how they have to approach this so that get to that point of really embedding the change in their business model whatever business they're in uh well david i'll get on my books about this because it's something that i you know often i'm talking about and thinking about you know i think for me there's four main areas actually the one is you've got to have an aligned business and sustainability strategy so exactly to your point this isn't anymore there's nice standalone charity initiative that you know is on the side it absolutely is core to the business we relaunched our what we call unilever compass just a couple of months ago which is our joined up business and sustainability strategy so definitely has got to be joined up as the first point i think the second part is it's got to also drive sustainable growth so you know this i would like to think outdated conversation about well is it sustainability or is it growth they are and can be one of the same you know i think you do that by making sure it's totally aligned into your business so you know for us in future foods it's about thinking of plant-based alternatives being better for the planet good for your health or it could be positive beauty which is what we're doing in our beauty and personal care portfolio really thinking about our consumers and how they enhance their own well-being remaining treated our values etc etc we've launched as i said this billion euros fund as well so absolutely linked into driving growth i think the third part is it really has to be integrated right the way through the organization so that means into the government governance sorry into the way that you're doing your external counsel into the strategy into the structure make it part of your reward i think that's hugely important as well you've got to actually hold people to account within the company and of course when you do all of that it really helps to then change the culture around sustainability and then i think lastly really proving the business case so we've done a ton of work over the years on what we call our growth cost trust risk model and when we're looking at business decisions we put that matrix onto it and actually ideally sustainability is going to be driving at least two or three of those different metrics in all the big decisions that we're making judith your view from sainsbury's it's that the advice you'll give to those who are in the foothills of this based on the experience you've had yeah and and again i agree with everything that's been said i suppose the things that i would add to that is it starts at the top so um boards have to lead by example and i think one of the things that we've done is a massive effort in upskilling our board and some of that with um deloitte and um chapter zero and basically bringing all directors up to the same level of understanding because this is quite technical and it's complicated and it's all new so you know you have to move together on that or people get left behind so yes get get the board up to speed and get the board leading from the front i think data is incredibly important because again you have to prioritize where you put your efforts and materiality is everything in this so making sure that you're investing in really good data because that's the management information that the teams that are actually operating level need to be able to make sure the interventions that they're going to make are timely cost effective and and create you know the biggest impact i think that's easy to say um because again it's difficult and the science is evolving so the other thing i would say is bring in the experts so um spending a lot of time getting the outside in to come and talk to all levels of our management around very specific topics and of course because we're a retailer that sells tens of thousands of products sourced from all over the world there are no generalizations so every um product every every country at source rom every commodity every situation we find ourselves in is a unique combination of data from greenhouse gas emissions to biodiversity water or all of those things coming together and unless the teams that are working in those areas have got that data they can't make informed decisions and i think the other thing is don't underestimate things i think it's bill gates that said most people overestimate what technology and innovation can deliver in the short term but underestimate it in the medium to long term so i think aim high on the basis that in the medium to long term you can deliver those things and and share successes because i think we haven't got time for us all to individually learn by trial and error and best practice and what works actually is fundamentally important in this because as say we need to move at pace that was excellent uh judith rebecca thank you i think this has been a really excellent conversation thank you for being candid and sharing your experience we all recognize tackling climate change and creating a more sustainable responsible future is our collective responsibility it's not easy but i hope you've learned from the feedback and the comments from judith and rebecca it can be done we've had some great anecdotes of how two leading organizations are putting it in place it's not only the right thing to do it's also the right business thing to do so thank you all for joining us thank you again to judith and rebecca and thank you to business insider organizing this event thank you thank you judith rebecca and david for this important conversation i want to take this moment to remind our audience of the official event hashtag act to impact please help us spread the word around these conversations around climate action and feel free to take our attendees survey any time during the event just click on the survey icon at the bottom of the page and now another exciting session with insider's voices of color editor you kenya talk about climate justice and how society at large can act in the fight against climate change the best storytelling are those that center the communities most impacted by the narrative that's a common philosophy in race and identity reporting and our mission at insider's voices of color where i do have the honor of serving as editor good afternoon i'm kenya evelyn and while the statement may be common knowledge an unfortunate reality is that similar to newsrooms oftentimes the communities most vulnerable to climate change are left out of positions of leadership policy even panels such as black and brown communities where youth are leading environmental justice movements like those of elizabeth john pierre co-chair of the climate justice alliance as well as ruth davis who partners with activists and advocacy groups in her capacity as director of ibm's call for code in fact this very site you see is often a rarity three black women leading a discussion often times even though our communities and those who look like us are the majority of climate activists so what's the source of the disconnect and that representation doesn't always equal agency autonomy or authenticity and what can all of us do stakeholders politicians activists and even journalists to combat it welcome let's get started right away elizabeth how is it that communities of color are unintentionally even silenced by our initiatives in climate justice and activism even though they're the majority of climate activists well thank you for having me on the show i wouldn't say that it is unintentional i think that a lot of the ideas that are coming from the front line of the climate crisis everything from what we call a just recovery a just transition of building the bigger we and fighting the bad the solutions that we've operationalized in our community are being extracted by uh by businesses they're being extracted by big organizations and it's almost as if uh people want our ideas they just don't want us at the table and so we're at this position right now where we're saying that if we're not at the table we're going to build our own the truth is that our fingerprints are all over everything from infrastructure to policy from a city-wide to a national level we are the ones that are actually changing the landscape in our communities and nationally and throughout the global south so i think that the idea that uh leadership looks like us uh is is a problem for a lot of folks and so i would say that it is intentional um it's really once we say it's unintentional we give people a pass for bad behavior and it's that bad behavior that put us here in the first place i'm glad you mentioned that a common philosophy also even and so thank you even for the correction is that some it doesn't matter intent what matters most is the impact our intentions matter not so much as the impact of our harm or our action and so we know even like we mentioned regardless of intent tech has worked in in tandem with these issues that can unintentionally or intent silence communities of color but what are those lessons learned and the ways that tech have perpetuated harm ruth i'll leave this to you but we know that often times tech has worked in in tandem with communities but also have worked to silence communities and so what are some of those lessons learned and how we can move forward with communities and amplifying that agency well thank you kenya and we are certainly focused on amplification we realize that because of racial inequality that climate change is already disproportionately impacting black and brown populations and this is going to continue to be exasperated as the effects of climate change continue to grow and unfortunately as you've already stated the very same people that are most at risk from climate change are those that have the fewest resources to come and this is where technology can really help we know that they we need to have creative solutions that are not only accessible but scalable and then customizable down to the community and neighborhood level to have impact we also know that the activists and advocacy groups and individuals that are in the communities tackling these issues on the ground can benefit from the data and information and insights that can be leveraged by technology so we at ibm are really committed to fighting back against climate change against racial injustice and i'm here today to ask other companies to join us but we know similarly that the work is being done is being done at the grassroots at the local at the street level with community organizers with people that often are left out of that conversations that are happening at the table at the decision making table um so how important is that in terms of the work that's already being done in amplifying the change makers elizabeth how does your organization even work to amplify the change makers that are doing the work right now and how can all of us be better at amplifying that work well thank you for asking that question um ruth is absolutely right that the people most impacted um are the people who have not contributed to climate change but they're also at the forefront of the solutions so in our community for example we launched the first community on solar cooperative in the state of new york we just recently got support of 200 million dollars to invested in offshore win in south brooklyn so the projects are big and they're small we are building leadership and we are shaping policy we helped pass with a state coalition of over um close to 300 members of the climate leadership and community protection act it's the um it's the legislation that is now being used by the bright administration for justice 40 and our communities are involved in a multiplicity of ways everything from sharing information to making recommendations about climate adaptation mitigation and resilience looking at industrial waterfronts and thinking about how do we engage in a green reindustrialization of the waterfront so that instead of dropping co-pollutants and and carbon into our into our atmosphere and into our lungs we are building for the climate future these are all recommendations and solutions that are coming from the grassroots mostly women of color led all over the united states and you mentioned these are women of color led these are the voices that are leading the movement and we've had similar discussions between even just adapting our language to improve better agency and autonomy and equipping communities in terms of you're not giving folks voice they're demanding their voice how can we as stakeholders as tech as activists even myself as a journalist how can we be more intentional even in something as our language and making sure that folks aren't being given a voice but communities are demanding or being invested in and provided the platform to demand their voice and this can go through okay all right thank you kenya well i i agree that ibm is working to provide tools to help amplify the voices of those community change makers we cannot do it alone but technology certainly helps enable it we have with call for code for example it's a tech for good program that has impact in multiple ways we look at it from a three-fold approach we are not only looking to address areas such as local impact and climate change but also advancing policy legislation and reform for racial justice issues but we do this by equipping the estimated 24 million developers globally with open source powered cutting-edge technologies that makes it accessible and customizable and scalable for the communities and then we actively partner with a diverse ecosystem to help make a difference and then finally we deployed these solutions and i love hearing about their solutions elizabeth we'd love to get you engaged with us and we can help scale those solutions but technology makes a big difference there we talked briefly about the importance of of open source and i'll just mention just recently and having the voices come from those with the lived experiences we had a call for code hackathon with howard university just last month and it was focused on environmental justice and one of the finalists and i want to get the name of their solution right was global flood equity extended reality they were focused on creating a solution that looked at addressing inequities in areas of greatest risk and particularly around of floods and we want to make sure that these types of voices and these solutions are both created from those that are being impacted the most and then available to scale globally to have the impact that we want to see now and look at this excuse me ruthie mentioned elizabeth as well elizabeth i would love to get your thoughts as well is there even i i realize we started with the premise of even assuming there is a responsible means is there a thought responsible way that those of us stakeholders in this fight against climate change can be better in checking ourselves to make sure that we are providing the platform or others to demand a voice in this conversation and not feel as though we are giving folks voice well i think solutions really need to be centered on racial justice and equity and i think that while we're talking about building what we call adjust transition which is a move away from extractive economy to renewable energy we also need to talk about building just relationships and what that looks like there are opportunities for people to be able to use their resources and their privilege in a way that adds that supports that amplifies and doesn't supplant local leadership doesn't compete where we can be creating literally a culture of practice around collaboration and i think climate change is demanding a different kind of citizenry a different kind of interaction between people if we're going to win this together and and i think that that's one of the biggest challenges this country was built on competition and on people running to the front and having the best ideas without understanding that the people that are most impacted really have to lead um we're we will be the majority by 2042 and we don't want to have the situation of a climate apartheid here in the united states our folks need to feel about climate change the same way that the people before us felt about the civil rights movement and that happens by building these just relationships and by making sure that all the solutions are centered on racial justice and equity and that we are pushing and investing in frontline communities which are the ones that are most likely to be impacted by extreme by recurrent extreme weather events now elizabeth my follow-up to you then even is we understand that there have been missteps made we understand that oftentimes we've seen the ebbs and flows of community interests we see the parachuting organizations that come in and throw resources or throw some temporary measures of investment but then you know they disappear there isn't that consistency what can what measures of accountability are there to ensure that that isn't a matter of a trend or something that we're seeing that is temporary but then those investments are disappeared so long as there is no longer a white face to attach to it well we're seeing new groups that it's really exciting we're seeing new groups that are coming into this movement uh like dsa and sunrise and indivisible these are groups that are looking to figure out how you support communities that have deep roots that have been at the forefront that have basically been dealing with the intersection of all the isms that our communities have had to deal with and what we're asking for them to do is not to lead but to ask how can we serve uh what kind of data collection should be done what kind of policy research can be done that will add value or will make it possible for us to collectively move faster we're seeing that the movements are much more intergenerational and look more like our communities and sort of the power dynamic that exists so there is a cultural shift uh all over the united states and we're seeing that that cultural shift is also coming together with a culture of practice that is radically different than the past and so that gives us hope uh and it also makes it possible for us to have victories for us to have winds which is so necessary in the age of covet and climate change um and so it is possible to build those just relationships we've seen that happen in our community and we're seeing happen all over the united states and the gulf south in california and detroit um we we are seeing that there is a whole new generation of young white folks who are rejecting capitalism and are rejecting white supremacy and are looking to engage in a way that is different um than the way that they were conditioned to be in community and and that um that is what we're going to need because climate change is going to disrupt everything and if we continue to engage with each other in the way that we have in the past and embrace old models that got us to where we are today we won't win and and literally everything is at stake so so those emerging groups make me feel uh that there's hope and and and i've i've seen it happen we have been building the kinds of relationships that we need across race and ethnicity that is going to be necessary if we're going to thrive and now survive you also put out a challenge to your colleagues to your peers out in the industry what role and what investments will be required for stakeholders or tech to do what they're doing now as we saw and as we see doing the work of engaging with communities but to continue and even accelerate that work as climate change becomes an urgent matter of our lives yes climate change is already urgent and it is important that we do this together so elizabeth's point about coming together and not trying to lead but asking i'm asking right now elizabeth for you and the organizations that you're associated with to engage with us with call for code it is a tech for good program it is all about having local impact and the way that we can accelerate this is through the expansion of our ecosystem this year we added for our climate change focus heifer international and charity water we were already working with the the u.n of disaster disaster risk reduction the united way a world food program working with black girls code and caribbean girls hack what that does is provide that diversity of thought and ideas that come together to make a difference we have the subject matter matter experts and those with the lived experiences helping to create these solutions around the things that are most impactful for the vulnerable communities so as we look at moving forward we have to deploy these solutions and bring these ideas to life in the communities they were designed to serve and we're looking to do that in a continued way and just another example that occurred that it's so exciting last year our winner of our climate change global challenge was a group of students and one of the students was the son of rural farmers in india so they developed an application that allowed farmers to make smarter decisions based on what to plant and where using the weather company data now that solution has now been deployed and over 500 rural farmers have been test testing it out in india and brazil and mongolia so the challenge is to continue to engage become a part of the ecosystem and work with us to have impact we are committed to this as elizabeth said the ideas are already there in the communities the solutions are out there let's leverage this open source platform through call for code we can make a difference together and so i want to ask you both and elizabeth i'll start with you but we've had this same conversation we have had like we've mentioned ebbs and flows throughout social justice racial justice movement especially in recent history that have called us to question our entire premise of institutions whether they can be reformed and whether they should simply be abolished we've seen that applicable to so many different issues related to race and social justice but how is that approval to climate change you mentioned in elizabeth youth that it may require us to completely renew our thinking on how to approach what progress we're using to approach uh climate change and climate policy this is one of those examples and how so where perhaps we need to be considering not reforming the system but abolishing it all together yes absolutely um you know we you know a lot of times people apply uh the principles that they learned during the civil rights movement where we had to compromise justice and when we compromised justice lives were lost we're talking about the biggest threat to our ex to our existence and we're talking about a threat to the existence of the global south to the global majority you saw that happen with katrina with superstorm sandy with andrew uh with hurricane maria and puerto rico uh literally entire communities with deep historical roots completely obliterated and so um and so absolutely we can't we have to accept the fact that the systemic that systemic racism um that the history of extraction on the backs of our communities that profit on the backs of our communities is what has gotten here to this thing called climate change and so it's going to take a very different kind of economic structure a different kind of civil society if we are going to be able to to survive this and and a lot of people are not ready to do that they want to continue to hold on to old practices old systems and put a green patina on it and because because because profit is more important to them than humanity and so that is not enough we are now at that point where we've tipped where everything literally is at stake and what is required is a radical transformation even from the business side you know we see companies like patagonia that work really closely uh with communities and are constantly asking how are we doing how can we do better how can we engage our of the people who work with us are our products um you know within the carbon uh living within the carbon footprint and so there are businesses that are looking at radical ways of working with community and we're going to need that from everyone we're going to need that from people in governance who are used to being working with grasshopper organizations and being top down and managing expectations from the front line they're going to have to share power and governance so so so yes it's it's uh what's required right now is being demanded by climate change and and negotiating our lives and our future is no longer is just not an option and then ruth i'll leave it to you for our last question then what more can all of us stakeholders tech policy executives journalists activists what more can all of us be doing so that panels like these where those leading the discussion are actually representative of the most vulnerable communities disproportionately experiencing the effects what can we do to better equip our communities with agency and autonomy to effect change well we need more of us in the room that is absolutely the case and ibm is working to do that and other companies need to do the same we need to leverage platforms as i mentioned call for code we also have call for code for racial justice those solutions were born out of the social unrest of 2020 and now they focus on three key areas around of racial justice in terms of policy and diverse representation as well as legislation and reform so we need to continue from the ground up to have the representation and also the technical skills and just the ideation from those of us that are living the experiences and the impact of climate change it is about collaboration and coming together for this critical critical cause and i agree with you elizabeth it's not about for profit these are issues that are affecting all of us they're affecting most of some of us disproportionately but we can come together to leverage technology other stakeholders coming together as a group to have a positive impact and move forward because that's what matters most as we know centering the communities most impacted as a journalist by the narrative of our storytelling or even the outcome of our activism the performance of our policies so what story are you telling in your communities and those most vulnerable to the narrative or the consequences of climate change give us your feedback and let us know for now take care and thank you for joining us thank you kenya and thank you ruth and elizabeth what an interesting conversation around climate justice and what communities and tech can do to act for our final session we want to introduce you to another driving force when it comes to climate action art art can have a great impact on how we see the world please welcome alice sharp artistic director of invisible dust and kasha mulga design fusionist and artist hello i'm alex sharp i'm the artistic director of invisible dust welcome to this session which is all about art and how we play a role how it plays a role in the climate crisis um i just wanted to say a little bit about invisible dust we work with artists and scientists looking at climate change and we're a believer that art can make the invisible visible um in that we feel that scientists struggle to communicate in a lot of ways it's all about facts and graphs but actually artists can enable us to understand things through our heart for our emotions and that's where we feel that the the invisible can be made visible and we work and we're based in the uk we work internationally we work on oceans we work on climate change biodiversity and we also work on air pollution which we're going to talk about quite a lot today and so i'm delighted to also hand over to say hello um kasha who's one of these amazing artists that i work with and does make the invisible visible thank you so much ice and thank you very much for inviting me it's absolute pleasure to be part of this conversation so my name is kasia mulga and i am a designer artist creative technologist with a passion towards environment and my work can be described as panning on the intersection of disciplines i also am founder and director a creative director of creative art studio which is called well studio molga we work across creative industries academia and naturally with cultural and art institutions and our specialization i think can be described as communicating how we relate to natural environment and how can we collaborate with nature and also how can we use accelerating and present in all layers of our reality technologies for better understanding and then connection to subjects such as climate change fixed extinction environmental transition or pollutions and our work is excreted all over the world i'm based in margate which is small town sit down very close to london but we have a site also in rotterdam and our work takes various forms from multi-sensory immersive experiences to interactive sculptures and audio-visual installations and all of which i guess is about how we and other non-human makers and species can work together thanks very much kasia and what i wanted to do was to introduce a really extraordinary piece of work that kasia has created um as part of our work at visible dust and it was when she was brought together with a team of scientists from king's college london um frank kelly andrew grieve and so then the sort of magic began and um kasha created this piece which is very interesting because it enables us walking on a city street to see these wonderful costumes which she has created and they change color with the air pollution so these really harmful gases that we're all bringing in a lot of people now are very understanding that air pollution is causing a huge amount of harm to our bodies and actually um you know it's causing fatalities in our communities and cassius peace enables us to kind of see the actual air pollution in action in the sense that it actually the costumes change color with that air pollution and one of the problems i think for all of us in our cities is we can't actually see the air pollution coming out of our vehicles we don't have big black clouds okay you might have small black cows but not massive big clouds which actually would tell us what what the the harm the air pollution is doing and the other thing i think that's really important about this piece is that as humans we like to pretend that we're very logical you know we see a graph that shows air pollution is bad therefore we'll do something about it actually i think we'll find that most of us are moved much more by our motions and the great thing about art is it enables us to connect to those emotions and to kind of understand why we might need to act and why that impetus to actually doing those things in the right way and becoming more sustainable and the other things that are really important with human sensor is that it's enabling us to sort of see that data and if you if you meet us air pollution scientists they may show you some of these amazing tables where pollution is worse in one part of the city or another when we see the this costume um change color we can actually see this air pollution in action and and the damage it's doing to our bodies and so finally just before i introduce the video the other point about human censor is it's something that resonates throughout the world and what we found with this piece is well once we had a video of an action we were seeing it being shown in new york tokyo istanbul all around the world and everybody in their everyday streets could relate to what this video shows and it and it really shows human sense as a universal language throughout the world so i'll just show you the video for a few minutes now and then we'll continue our conversation what would be the best way to convey the fact that our body is this sort of sensor and you know how to connect the body to environment and how to convey the information and and since then i was looking at the wearable is this kind of interface which connects our inner parts with with the outer world we depend on air but we can't say it and so we can't see the pollutions we've been working with the artist kasha mulga the amazing costumes that she's developed are responsive to the air that's outside them so what she's done is making these invisible air pollution into something visible we decided that are going to look at the black carbon because it is one of the most dangerous pollutants and very present on our streets because it comes from diesel cars houston road is the source of an incredible amount of air pollution which we think is unacceptable for people who work and live in the area so we're trying to create a green link between houston station and regents park and the human sensor is an amazing creative way to raise the issue of air pollution in houston art and design is a perfect platform to kind of create new narrative or test ideas and i hope that the human sensor can be one of those concepts i really hope that what i do will have this kind of very important public function as well to kind of make invisible visible so that people are much more aware of of the issue or the problem it just draws your attention to a different way to walk through houston it was fascinating to watch the procession kind of brings it home in a real real life passion about this is the area we live and breathe if you live in london for me that really um hit me when i first saw human censor as a mother of children and their exposure to walking down streets in our busy streets in our cities and how they are breathing in you know without unwillingly this air pollution that we're all creating um and i think it just encountered up me in a very strong emotion um about the effect this is having on us all and i just wondered for you um kasha just to tell us a little bit more about your inspiration for creating this work um so i just wanted to add to that that in general uh climate change and science behind it or in fact um science in general you know the knowledge of biological physical or chemical processes and technology which permeates all layers of our lives and then to to add to all of that you know the changes in environment warming global pollutions extinctions and their implications on political economical and social system all of this are hyper objects as philosopher timothy morton calls them that is concept so big that human brain cannot contain them at once and on top of everything all of them are entangled and so no wonder that sometimes we feel really overwhelmed when we are surrounded by all those information and it's very difficult to feel positive and you know and and and move towards um change and and and so i feel that art has always been excellent in navigating through these complexities and capturing their essence um and so all those intricate and abstract and often overwhelming concepts can be related to a more intimate and emotional manner and in my um in my practice in particular i think i am really interested in finding connections between human body and bodily functions and environment because we are part of it and so the human sense or you know very naturally grow from that besides my own experience of suffering from asthma i look at human breasts as a connector between inner and outer environment and i also feel that people with asthma are sort of superheroes because we can um detect changes in the chemical air composition much faster than anybody else so we are natural detectors of of heads of an of the environment and i think that was the key thing for me that we all have a power to learn and to know um how important is our surrounding and and the connection between us and and the environment um and i think the thing that was really um amazing as well was the kind of um your um use of the of the dancers so that there is this wonderful kind of dramatic feel to to to the actual um human sensor and um you know it's kind of really giving you an opportunity to kind of work with dancers i think for the first time that's true and we have to obviously mention amazing choreographer ruse jones who uh came aboard and and help us you know to to create this beautiful movement but basically you know when we kind of brace properly our it reflects it is reflected in our posture you know when i have asthma attack i do something like that with my shoulders coming very close to to my ears you know and and my back is very very tense when we have access to clean air that also is reflected in how we carry our body we are much more open um and so you know we can learn a lot about our surroundings just you know from from that and also besides um besides that alice you said to me two days ago and and i i'm still thinking about it that the performance is made out of few dancers so it is a metaphor for we are in it there so that the act of breathing intimate and individual action however the air belongs to all of us um also i think dance was very important rose made this really great um great uh quiet and and humorous movements that brought to this very serious effect um a bit of uh and positivity which i think are really needed in in such a you know serious issues you know to make them more potable and and relatable yeah absolutely i think that's really really strong and the thing that was really interesting for us is that when we were um organizing this the performance of the actual work um we were very mindful of what time of the day it was so when we were at certain times of the day we had all the commuters coming past and obviously at that point not only do you have the commuters on foot but you have more vehicles and so people are exposed to much more higher levels of air pollution during that commute and now obviously with covid and the mask that we have on the faces of that piece has a very different feel than it did when we first did it which was a pre-covered and so there's also this kind of resonance with breathing and the importance of having clean air that which i think is um very very strong now in the in the sort of pandemic environment that we've got and we had a question from the audience which was um about art being a tool in terms of um addressing climate change and i um both of us i'm sure have lots of different views about that but i don't know if you want to just speak briefly about your idea about how art can be something which is really important in kind of looking at climate change and you know and encouraging people to take action yes um i i think other than that that that art is an excellent way of helping um people to unpick certain very complex issues you know to encourage them to ask questions um and maybe even find answers for themselves but um it is about navigating through a very complex and complicated in such a way so that we can make a story for ourselves you know because there's a huge power in knowledge and and storytelling obviously art shouldn't be really deducting that it shouldn't be at all um for king however uh it should be it can be used for the inspiration for intriguing people um you know about certain issues and then inviting towards certain actions so art also can be an act of the actor absolutely and i know your work um has also looked at a lot of issues to do with nature and in the previous um events that we've seen today there's quite a big discussion i think the lady from um unilever was mentioning the importance of nature to people in the sort of current um situation with covid and how people have connected to nature in a much stronger way people have got much more attached their pets they spent a lot more time in their very local park or their gardens and they're noticing the birds much more and i think from to me art can bring some of those connections together and i feel that um what you're saying as well is really important that art isn't something which is um just an adaptive thing when i bring an artist and science scientists together one of the first things i always say to the scientists it's not going to be a literal translation you're not going to be talking about your ocean science and then the artists will make a piece there'll be a communication there'll be a collaboration and there'll be a sort of movement and of ideas between the two the other thing that i think is important is that kind of looking with humor and being able to like you were saying ruth was able to put this lovely little thing where the hands of the dancers all sort of like fluttered a little bit like clouds and and it was really nice to have that humor in the piece and i think one of the things that's really tricky about for scientists is they want to get these really important messages out there but as human beings actually we respond to humor you know we respond to something that's um you know makes us kind of you know feel kind of um you know in or something or excited about something and i think it's quite difficult for the scientists because does does does you know a scientific report or a statement actually get you your heart ticking actually it doesn't and i think that's that's really what we're saying with with art and i think um i think klaus webb at the start was saying the importance for us in looking at the long-term picture for climate change and he was talking about in particular looking at businesses and if they look at the long-term picture that's where you know things are going to change and i think for us in terms of art i think that art does make this bridge between climate change and action it kind of forms this bridge between the two because of the um i mean the connection that i was saying about the emotions that we all feel when we see something if we see a human censor going down the street and we start thinking for example me i was thinking about my children other people might think about elderly relatives who are bringing in that breathing in that air pollution and what better way to change because you care about something rather than hating something and i i would say that this is much more long-lasting and sustainable change that you get through arts and through being moved through care okay so i think that that's a really nice nice nice part of it so and is there any anything else cash that you wanted to say on the on the climate change perspective um i i like to i'd like to um maybe mention um that idea that the theory by joseph boyce who said that uh art he has a social sculpture that his art can have a deep function and a such potential to from the society and i just wanted to i always said that what i can do is to bring the intimate and emotional links and connections lacking from news reports or scientific scientific conversations or research but they are extremely important for us to feel connected to issues absolutely and i think one of the things that came through to me in the different sessions we've had we the session just before they were actually talking about the importance of technology which obviously comes through very very strongly in your work to sustainable solutions in the future and the wonderful thing is that a lot of artists like yourself are doing really fantastic work with you know looking at machine learning uh bringing in different elements of vr or ai as well so there are new ways of using um with art and looking at the climate and looking at our environment which i think are incredibly valuable and i think people will really um you know get a lot from from from experiencing those things in different ways and looking at the future and the other thing that's really i think really really important is that long lasting resonance that i was saying earlier so i think that art does give us that opportunity to connect to those emotions and i think i'm really really hopeful for that that we can have a much more hopeful message as well because i think one of the difficult things is both climate crisis and covid are things that people could be seen as having very sort of negative connotations and actually what we can do is look at something really positive which is living more sustainably in using technology much better there's some very very positive messages in that first few sessions about um business and how a lot more businesses are seeing it's really vital to their future and this is the sustainability of their future of being of looking at these things in the right way and you know for example attracting young employees and i think that if art is able to be part of that picture part of that shaping of the picture of businesses changing and governments changing and also consumers changing and that for me is it is a really important role for us and you know i really hope invisible dust continues to be able to work with people like um kasha and other artists who are doing this such fantastic work for the future thank you alice and kasia and thank you again to all of our speakers for these interesting and important conversations around climb action and to our sponsor deloitte a big thank you to you
