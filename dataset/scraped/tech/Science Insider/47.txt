here we go this is lava and this is also lava one's man-made and one's well coughed up by mother earth but both these scientists are working toward the exact same goal figuring out how to predict the unpredictable to be able to make the best decisions about how to keep people safe it's important to be able to predict what is lava going to do once it starts flowing out of the van one tenth of the world's population lives within the danger zone of a lava flow which means knowing how lava works and reacts to elements like water metal and ice is key so on this episode of science skills we're going to look at two ways scientists study lava starting with diy this huge furnace behind me is syracuse university's personal volcano and brainchild of an unlikely scientist and artist duo that's professors jeff carson and bob vysotsky and they didn't feel like waiting for a volcano to spit up lava so they decided to make their own the project originated really when bob came into my office and said he wanted to make lava i thought that was pretty crazy a suggestion at that time but the more we talked the more we saw that he had a really good idea of what needed to be done and the first thing that needed to be done figure out what to make the lava in which is where this came in the tilt furnace is really the statement piece of the whole operation it can hold hundreds of kilos of lava and execute experiments about viscosity morphology structures and formations but she's a little bit finicky when it comes to lava making the furnace literally melts itself and tears itself apart over a very short period of time these were originally made to melt bronze and aluminum but the lava project has repurposed one of them to melt up to 800 pounds of billion-year-old basaltic rock shipped all the way from wisconsin the process takes hours bob and his team pile the rocks into a receptacle called the crucible turn up the furnace and gradually bring the rocks up to temperature we were doing just lava and melting and stuff furnace would be on about medium and we would just never turn it down or up what temperature it just runs medium is a sound out there that i hear the flame i can adjust the furnace blindfolded and tell you what it's doing and it's all sound there's just a butterfly valve in here and you can hear it that's it we look this up later medium is also somewhere between 2000 and 2400 degrees fahrenheit so pretty darn hot which means these scientists really have to suit up these suits made of aluminum can withstand radiant heat up to 3000 degrees fahrenheit we used to wear welding leathers but it dries out from the heat when you start to smell barbecue because it's pigskin you knew that you were too close to something because you're cooking your clothing is cooking how do you know you're too close with these guys you don't you don't these are the spats the apron which i wear around my waist the jacket which put your arms out right because you don't need it in the back no it's like a campfire style exactly and it's just cool so there's that and then the helmet it looks like it's a regular tinted thing like sunglasses but this is 24 karat gold um that is the sheet of it what is it about the gold is it just the reflective so it's so highly reflective and it's why you see satellites and stuff why they have the gold foil and this is really similar to some of the stuff that uh like volcanologists would use in the field right same stuff yeah but maybe with a back they have a back on it yeah in case the volcano's behind them do you want to show us how it works yeah let's go do we need any of the gear it is sweltering how hot is it up here well that bright the bright yellow you see back there that's about 2 800 degrees fahrenheit so right now the lava in there is too hot when we jump it out of here about the meter it falls from the spout to the trough and through the trough we lose about 275 degrees fahrenheit by the time it hits the end we want to be at 2150 fahrenheit and that's the magic spot for the wabo researchers are looking for that sweet spot between 1600 and 2200 degrees the range for natural lava knowing the lava's temperature at what time and where is crucial so the team has an array of ten digital cameras to capture 3d images of the flow and a thermal camera which can read up to 3 600 degrees fahrenheit that way researchers like ariana soldati can analyze both the lava's movement and temperature leading to a key piece of data viscosity is possibly the most important property in volcanology it really controls everything from eruptive style to appearance of the flow and the main physical property that controls viscosity is temperature the hotter something is the less viscous it is and the cooler it is the more viscous so it's really important that we can tell what temperature the lava is because we want to match that with the viscosity with this the team can study how different variables like metal or crystals affect how fast the lava cools and therefore its viscosity but there's the lab and then there's the real world where unplanned and unpredictable factors come into play that's where this guy comes in well this is a piece of the earth that we call the mantle this is the piece of the mantle and and and this is one of the sort of side lights that make some volcanoes incredibly important to study this is ben edwards and he likes to get lava data straight from the source here's him collecting a sample from a flow in russia back in 2013. as you can see ben's protective gear has more coverage than what they use at syracuse because sampling from a natural lava flow can be a 360 degree experience if you're going next to a lava river to sample even in this suit like i was doing this in russia from a lava river that's maybe 10 15 meters wide and after being there for a minute or so making some measurements i could hear my russian colleagues saying ben move back you're smoking but it was getting hot enough in the suit that even after about you know 30 to 45 seconds i had to back up when ben's around to witness an eruption he's prepared to collect data a lot of data am i going to focus on taking lots of lava temperatures am i going to focus on getting lots of samples of lava am i going to focus on i'm using drones and trying to map very carefully how fast the lava is coming out to pull a sample out of the flow ben usually uses a rock hammer but if i was trying to collect really hot samples i would probably use some sort of a an iron bar that wouldn't catch fire like this is okay for sure yet yeah here's a clip of ben's colleague alexander bellusov using an iron bar to collect a sample he rests the bar on top of a rock and he uses a lever to pry the sample out because it's kind of non-intuitive it's a lot stickier than it looks if you're just watching it flow by it's like wow that must be pretty fluid because it's moving pretty fast that dollop of forbidden honey is then dunked into a bucket of water not just to cool it down but to cool it down fast because as the sample cools you know naturally it does produce these crystals the crystals yeah and if you want to see what was in the sample as it was moving down the lava stream then you want to you want to cool it like that to kind of take all the heat out and basically turn the heat off so that you kind of preserve the sample and you preserve the crystal content and the sizes of crystals that were actually in the active lava flow crystal size impacts viscosity so extra growth would lead to inaccurate measurements to take the temperature of that flow ben might use a handheld fleur camera like ariana did in the lab or a four channel data logger each one of these yellow things is a separate thermal probe so with this with this recorder i can record four temperatures at once for example if i'm interested in figuring out how fast the lava is cooling right so here's my lava surface i might want to put one of these in you know just barely in and and the other one i might want to have a little bit deeper so i can put two of these together and i'm measuring different temperatures now in that same cooling surface but you probably won't get those probes back i've got wires that are buried in kemchatka because you know once you get two feet of this underneath the lava flow like you're not gonna get it back out that's not yours anymore no it's one of the great things about the syracuse lava lab right because i make i do a lava flow there in the end i take my big hammer and i recover my equipment if you don't have probes to spare you might try thermal mapping the flow from above and so drones are really revolutionizing what we can do to study active earth processes you can strap a floor camera a regular camera or gas sensors to a drone potentially even all three if you get a drone big enough that basically become a volcano observation platform as opposed to just a drone and one can envision even someday a drone that would have some sort of a tool that would hang down that would allow you to you know if not sample lava because it is tough to get your little sample bucket out you wouldn't want your drone to get pulled into the lava flow but you might be able to catch volcanic ash you could hang a big piece of duct tape that's 20 feet long from the drone and fly it through a dilute ash cloud and some of the ash particles would stick to the duct tape it's just like a fly trap exactly but until robots officially take over we'll need humans on the ground risking their lives and arm hairs to study lava flows you know it's like the lava domes of montserrat the only reason we know there have been three or four domes i can't remember which is because you've been people watching and sampling and yep there's a dome and then boom oh the dome blew away oh there's another dome oh then it blew right and if there wasn't someone there to watch we wouldn't we might not necessarily know so it's important to be in the field for posterity well and for science right if we're trying to understand if we're trying to understand that volcano and what it does over time to predict it in the future and and that's the challenge we face when we go to older volcanoes and try to understand what we see in the older volcanoes because there was no one there watching data gathered in the field helped shape safety plans for people in specific regions but applying those learnings around the world would be almost impossible without careful testing in the lab as geologists we always need that starting point of what happens in the field what happens in reality but unfortunately you know in nature there's no repeatability every time there's a lava flow every time there's an eruption it's going to be different you have no control over any of the parameters here we can vary things in a systematic way and this allows us to isolate what could be the cause and what could be the effect and tie them together roasting marshmallows is an art form i would say the science all right all right
