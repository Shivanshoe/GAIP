you are the first person to see a bit of sue's blood vessels yes you're gonna be the second it's this hollow branching shave that zoo in question is sue the t-rex and we're about to see proof that she was warm blooded [Music] we went to the field museum to see how they work their magic our first stop was so here is our dinosaur and oversized collections that's jing may o'connor and she you know what i'll let her tell you yeah i would say i'm one of the world's experts on mesozoic birds not to brag or anything i'm just kidding and one of the key questions she asks with her research is why birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the cretaceous paleogene extinction we need to look at birds and we then we need to like back up from birds and look at the dinosaurs closely related i think it's kind of funny but we have a drawer full of bits of soup when you have the edge of the puzzle that's the easiest part to do right the inside of the puzzle is harder to put together so these are like the inside puzzle bits you can't figure out where they go but this is to our advantage because these are the type of fragments that it's okay for us to do destructive analyses on the destruction of these rare and one-of-a-kind fossils can involve slicing or dissolving in acid slicing allows the scientists to study specimens histologically you have to cut a piece of the bone remove it grind it down so it's really thin so that light can pass through it so you can study it under a microscope it's a cost-benefit analysis essentially right what are the questions you're trying to answer is it worth it to damage this extremely rare important fossil to show me how it's done they demonstrated with a prehistoric bird bone you're going to bring it to in our case akiko shinya she's our chief fossil preparator she's amazing akiko starts by taking a small slice of the specimen you then take your little chunk of bone that you removed and you drop it into resin and then this needs to cure for several days i mean can you imagine playing like dungeons and dragons with like dinosaurs exactly then you glue your d6 to a microscope slide and slice it down even more i did a terrible job with the saw i i almost destroyed everything with this eye actually i feel like i'm pushing too hard okay i did it i still have quite a bit of ways to go so yeah it will take a while at this point it's too small to slice so akiko will grind away extra layers rem here so that's where the grinding surface is if you bring it tiny bit a little by little [Music] the slide ultimately needs to be between 30 and 80 microns thick thinner than a sheet of paper akiko basically uses finer and finer grinders like varying grades of sandpaper to slowly shave off extra layers straight down that's the key i will try my best not you scared me now though there's a polishing stage to smooth out any major imperfections that might obstruct the sample you're not getting away from me and a second polish for fine tuning this one feels like someone is like pulling carpet out from underneath the block [Music] even with your naked eye you can learn about a specimen here's a piece of sue's rib and you can see how sue grew almost like rings on a tree you see these faint lines yeah yeah it'll be much like ag yeah it'll be much clearer once we get it under a microscope but those are the lines of arrested growth [Music] do you want to look in yeah and here we're looking into the rib of sue the t-rex you notice that the space between these lines of growth is becoming smaller and smaller so when it was younger and really having to bulk up right it was growing very quickly and as it reaches adult size growth slows down the thinness of these sections was surprising because it shows a fast growth rate a key indicator that sue had a high metabolic rate meaning she was probably not as cold-blooded as scientists previously thought scientists also looked at another indicator of high metabolism which is actually color more diverse colors in a species tends to mean a higher metabolism here we are looking at an sem image of a sample from a feather of a 130 million year old bird called ao confucius soreness the pre-extinction so the only fossil bird older than this fossil bird is archaeopteryx a scanning electron microscope relies on electrons instead of light to magnify even more detail and so if you look closely you'll see these this is literally what we call them sausage looking structures they are all melanosomes so ale melanosomes are responsible for the color black melanosomes are organelles found in animal cells that are associated with different colors when they fossilize they leave behind distinct shapes if they're very nicely aligned with each other we can tell it's iridescent black if they're kind of more oval shaped ao melanosomes that's gray and then if it's a phaomelanosome we call these ones meatballs literally this is like in papers they're like the meatball shape i'm hungry the meatball shaped pheo melanosomes are responsible for a rusty red color many of the genes responsible for melanosomes are also linked to things that affect metabolism so evolving one most likely evolves the other and with both meatballs and sausages a confucius ornish shows way more melanosome size diversity than modern day cold-blooded lizards so we can say that the dinosaurs that are becoming smaller that are getting these these large extravagant ornamental structures that are then able to evolve flight are also becoming more colorful but these melanosomes can only tell us so much they're an indicator of warm-bloodedness but not definitive proof this is where yasmina comes in everything that yasmina is doing five years ago that didn't exist i'm a molecular paleobiologist my passion lies within the clade of dinosaurs including modern birds people tend to think of bones and shells and these kind of like heart tissues that preserve much more readily but if we want to get a complete picture about the diversity of life on our planet should we really depend on soft tissue preservation soft tissue is the squishy stuff like skin blood vessels and other non-bony materials that scientists didn't even think could preserve until recently so about 30 years ago paleontology vertebrate paleontologists tried for the first time to extract soft tissues from dinosaur heart tissues her name is mary schweitzer and people did not believe her findings it was very critically perceived and people thought for a long time that while these soft tissue structures very much look like the original biological structures they could not possibly be related but soft tissues do preserve why do they preserve this is absolutely paradoxical based on what was known scientifically at that point in time you can actually see traces of it under a uv light [Music] what we're going to do is just shine the light and look for things it looks like some of these may be scales that are preserving soft tissue not all of them once soft tissues are suspected demineralization will isolate them if they're present so you can see the structures this is where i got to try something with sue's bones that has never been done before so you mentioned that you would like to dissolve a suit fragment and help us look for organics because every bone is going to have the tissues that we're looking for if they are in fact preserved but sue has exceptional preservation so we are quite hopeful we're taking this bit of soo and dissolving it in hydrochloric acid the acid will dissolve any inorganic rock but leave behind the organic soft tissues starting to look like a hazy ipa seen anything it's all still in suspension you will have to me too give it a little bit of time after about 15 minutes the precipitate settles and yasmina pipettes it onto a slide from here we go to the microscope let's go oh and this is looking good what are you seeing we have a couple of extracellular matrix pieces blood vessels large blood vessel fragments are you are the first person to see a bit of sue's blood vessels yes i was the second person to see sue the t-rex's veins right now take a look okay you see the blood vessel structure is right in the focus center it's this hollow branching yes shape that is definitely one of like the bone vascular canals oh i see it real good now hold on they've just been in there the whole time they've been sitting there around 65 million that was rad because we can look at this of course fascinated by the fact that you know soft tissues preserve in deep time but there's actually a lot of information in the molecular composition of these materials demineralization shows us that there are soft tissues present in a specimen including the proteins lipids and sugars that indicate a high metabolism but to concretely say what soft tissues are present and prove that this vein is really a vein and that these metabolic stress markers are actually here we need to study the chemicals found in the tissues this requires a brand new method an application of raman spectroscopy developed by yasmina and her team it's the brightest pure screen that you will ever see why the green light we're using a green light that is exactly 532 nanometers that is particularly good for characterizing organics with many unsaturated carbon bonds it's a non-destructive technique so you can stick entire specimens under the laser without having to prepare them at all we popped in a piece of suit taken from her femur core we want to make sure that we're looking at a spot where we don't have too much surface texture we have a lot of carbonaceous material preserved the laser excites the different materials in the sample and so these chemical bonds start to vibrate in direct response to their chemical environment and these like very specific little wiggles um are then detected in form of a spectrum now if we want to for example learn something about the metabolic rate of su we collect you know the spectrum for soup and for all other kinds of dinosaurs that have this mode of preservation i can show you like basically like what it looks like when you compare these different spectra this is sue's ramen data compared to data yasmina got from other dinos so every individual line basically represents evidence of the total composition of one of the fossils we've looked at so these numbers are sort of different wiggles yes so you get a different wiggle at each of these different wave numbers and that then evidences a different kind of molecular bond vibration so different kind of chemical compound present in the sample different compounds tell us different things about the dinosaur we're looking at for example theo ether's sulfur heterocycles and nitrogen heterocycles in the soft tissues signal high metabolic stress we have very high amounts of these metabolic stress markers in warm-blooded animals and we have very low amounts of these metabolic stress markers in cold blooded animals this peak here in combination with this peak here and this one here tells us if we're looking at a warm-blooded or cold-blooded extinct animal this wiggle here is proof that sue the t-rex was truly warm-blooded [Music] and it once again changes the story of evolution that scientists have been telling and re-telling since the early days of paleontology it has been suggested that the high metabolism of birds eventually like helped them to better adapt to the changing environments the changing conditions right after the mass extinction event what we basically realized here once we start putting these this new physiological data in a context is that this incredibly high avian metabolism is actually not an avian innovation it's not just sue either yasmina's work has definitively found that most dinos were warm-blooded practically upending what was once common knowledge i have been coming to the field museum since i was a little kid being able to come to the field museum and see how the field museum works was like a dream come true for tiny paleontologist abbey oh
