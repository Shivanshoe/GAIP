more you wash your face the better oh no no no no no no no you don't need to exfoliate oh man oh i love this one myth if you feel a tingling or burning sensation it means the product is working oh my gosh i had to say no when i saw this myth my name is nikita wilson and i'm a cosmetic chemist and my name is dr claire chang and we're here today to debunk a few myths about skincare let's get started drinking extra water will make your skin look better ooh take it away dr chang although drinking an adequate amount of water is important for your overall health there's actually no scientific evidence that drinking extra water goes straight to your skin or that it can improve your skin hydration excess water is most likely just filtered out of your body i can personally attest to the extra water just passing through our next myth your skin will get used to the products you use and then they'll stop working oh i love that one it's not a matter of your skin getting used to the products a product can only do but so much there comes a point where those ingredients have done all they could possibly do for your skin if you've noticed a huge improvement when you first started using a product and then noticed less improvement over time just like nikita said it may be because over time we reach a plateau in which her skin's visibly improved and at this point the ingredients are still working but they're maintaining a new normal the order in which you use your skin care products doesn't matter order definitely matters in general you should apply your products thinnest to thickest and those with the active ingredients should go on first agree 100 if you have a water-based serum it's going to be hard-pressed to fight its way through those barriers that we created in the cream in order to get into the skin to work so definitely thinner more active first and then build up heavier later so i recommend doing a cleanser first then a toner essences or ampoules then do your thicker moisturizers and your creams then your facial oils then your sunscreen and then your makeup our next myth is pores can get smaller oh no your pores do not get smaller there is also a circulating myth going around that cold water can shrink the pores but this is just a myth your pores are the same size what can happen is your pores can swell up you know oil can bring dirt debris dead skin cells can get in there and swell they get engorged you know from all the stuff that gets stuck in there and then when they're cleaned out they just get back to the normal size but the walls can also get compromised and so they can kind of lean and become weak and that also could change the appearance of how your pores look you don't need to moisturize your face if it's oily this is definitely a myth there is a difference between skin oil and skin hydration so skin hydration is the water content or the moisture levels of the skin whereas skin oil is the sebum content so sebum is secreted by your facial oil glands or sebaceous glands and it helps protect the skin barrier but sebum can contribute to that oily greasy look on the face so people don't like it the important thing to remember is that oily skin can become dehydrated and have a low water content so moisturizing is still important i advise that you use the right moisturizers oil-free moisturizers that are non-comedogenic also look for lightweight lotions rather than thicker creams the lotions have a higher water to oil content whereas creams have a higher oil to water content most recently i've been using sorwatu which is a korean brand s-u-l um w-h-a-s-o-o you didn't know this was gonna be a spelling bee too did you you don't need to wear sunscreen even when it's cloudy you need to wear sunscreen when it's cloudy when it's sunny the only time you don't need to wear sunscreen is when there is no sun it's night just because you can't see the sun the uv rays are still there they're still present and it's the uv rays that are doing the damage and it doesn't matter what your pigmentation load is you need sunscreen i recommend 30 and above because if you're using 15 and then you're using a little bit you're not going to get the level of protection that you need the more expensive the product the better it works absolutely false many of the products that i use and that i recommend are very affordable and found in the drugstore i say that the efficacy of the ingredients and the formulation matter a lot more than the price i agree you know as a chemist i want you to buy the most expensive products we make but the reality is it really does get get down to the ingredients and what you're looking for you can go to the drugstore and you can pick out really great products that can really help you and really make a difference in your skincare the next myth is the more you wash your face the better oh no no no no no no no your face is not that dirty you know you wash it in the morning you wash it at night you don't have to overdo it actually the more you wash your face your skin could be worse off one you are getting rid of the microbiome you're throwing at all of balance and when you do that you compromise your skin barrier and when your skin barriers compromise that can lead to irritation sensitivity over washing your face especially with harsh soaps or scrubs the ones with those beads in it can really dry out and irritate the skin i just recommend washing your face twice a day and then also after sweating heavily because sweat can clog the pores and irritate the skin further you don't need to exfoliate oh man everyone can benefit from some gentle exfoliation exfoliating can help renew and brighten your skin even your skin tone declog pores it helps in anti-aging and it can actually improve the absorption of other topicals you're putting on your skin i love exfoliation i love it for every reason you just named and for me again because i have very oily skin and acne prone and also hyperpigmentation exfoliation really helps you're reminding me i need to go exfoliate today if you're using a very gentle exfoliant you can do it every day if you tend to have sensitive skin and you're or you're using a higher concentration you might want to limit it to two times a week even one time a week and then if you're using in office kind of chemical peels and going to a facial list or your dermatologist you may want to limit it to every two to four weeks because they're using much higher concentrations of chemical exfoliants i can't end this without giving a shout out to dr uh dennis gross in his aha bha pad beautiful beautiful the next myth is you need to use a lot of skincare products to get good skin again as a cosmetic chemist i wish that were true you don't need to use a lot of products you just need to find the right products to work for your skin needs sometimes actually using too many products can do more harm than good oh i love this one myth if you feel a tingling or burning sensation it means the product is working i had to say no when i saw this myth i was just like oh i always say actually your daily skincare should typically not be uncomfortable at all and if it is it's a sign that your skin cannot tolerate the product it's not always good to ask someone what are you using and then go and buy it because your skin may not have the same tolerance level as there so you may have a different reaction and i know a lot of people who try to use the best the most effective ingredient and they try to kind of stand through it they want to persist because they want to get their skin looking shiny and wrinkle free but your skin again is different from all of those people out there and it may not be able to tolerate it so you want to find the right product for you acne is only a problem during puberty can someone sell my skin that please you could have not had acne during puberty and all of a sudden as you enter 30s or 40s you all of a sudden start to get it you know your hormones are changing and i'm a living breathing testament that that is not the case adult acne may be persistent from puberty but a lot of times it's late onset in patients who've never had acne before the reasons for acne in adulthood are genetics hormones clogged pores inflammation stress can definitely worsen acne certain diets can worsen acne including you know high sugar high carb diet pregnancy can sometimes trigger acne i definitely had acne during my pregnancy cosmetics too it's nice to really kind of localize where the acne is because those might be triggers that you can remove and see if your acne gets better by removing those triggers you just want to be patient with it remember that any treatment for acne can take six to eight weeks to work so you just really want to stick to it unless of course you're getting that burning tingling or irritation from it dark under eye circles are always due to a lack of sleep they can be actually due to a lot of different issues and everyone's different so sometimes it's due to lack of sleep and puffy eyes in other patients it might be due to you ate a salty meal the night before or had some alcohol and it's causing swelling but also maybe due to genetics a lot of patients have dark under eye circles even since they were younger allergies can also cause dark under eye circles so if your eyes are itchy and you're rubbing it all the time or as we all mature we lose fat in our cheeks and our under eye area and that can create a contrast and a shadowing effect knowing the cause really is the key to finding the best way to go about treating it the next myth is you shouldn't use eye creams unless you have wrinkles no actually i know a lot of younger people who are using eye creams as more of a preventative measure because they're trying to prevent their skin from drying out they're trying to keep the skin elastic nikita i think you said it beautifully prevention is key in skincare and the eye area is often the first area to show signs of aging actually late 20s early 30s is when you start losing collagen i have to go tell my daughters to start using a cream [Laughter] serums and oils are a waste of money no serums are actually what i spend the most money on serums are highly concentrated with active ingredients like antioxidants and hydrating factors that really benefit your skin serums are really are what's doing the brunt of the work agree 100 you can budget your cleanser you can budget your moisturizer and even your sunscreen but where you should think about spending the bulk of your budget should be on the thing that's going to give you the biggest treatment and that's the serum there's a huge range of skin issues that serums can really help with you can get rid of dark spots i do this every day at work it takes time it takes discipline and it takes you truly truly being committed to understanding the source and why you're getting your dark spots dark spots often have a component of deeper pigment in the skin and that's where laser treatments come in brown spots can always come back and you can get new bronze spots so sunscreen is the most important thing you can do to help prevent and treat dark spots one thing about skin of color is we were always told that you know lasers are not good for our skin because it'll end up causing more dark spots have they improved the technology now where somebody like me can come to you and say hey dr chang how about these spots it is true that skin of color is a little bit more sensitive to laser and the reason is that there is more pigment in patients and skin of color or darker skin tones there are resurfacing lasers that are lower in energy and gentle but can help improve brown spots over a series of treatments i'll make an appointment with you as soon as we wrap this up what do we have here losing weight will help get rid of my cellulite oh so cellulite it's one of the most common complaints i see but one of the most difficult to treat you have to remember that cellulite is not just a condition of excess fat or being out of shape and in fact i see cellulite in all weight groups we don't know exactly what causes cellulite but it can be associated with genetics hormones and then lifestyle can also play a key component on a more biologic level cellulite is due to poor circulation it's due to inflammation so again a lot of reasons why people get cellulite physical activity may actually help a little bit with cellulite by increasing circulation and blood flow but weight loss in and of itself may not improve your cellulite when it comes to the beauty industry and products to solve it there's no silver bullet in a cream or serum and give to you and i've seen some of the most in shape women have cellulite if you don't get eczema as a kid you won't get it as an adult i don't believe that to be true i actually just saw several cases of new adult eczema patients this past week so it's very common eczema is especially common in adults who actually have work related contacts so health care workers construction workers or hairdressers who wash their hands frequently or come into contact with a lot of chemicals eczema is managed primarily by a really good skincare routine dry irritated skin can make you more prone to eczema so you want to make sure you're hydrating and moisturizing very frequently k-beauty only works for east asian customers that's not how skin works k-beauty is definitely not just for asian skin you have to keep in mind that in terms of ethnicity though there are slight differences in terms of pigmentation and moisture levels between ethnic groups the basic structure of the skin and the aging processes that the skin goes through is essentially the same no matter what your ethnicity differences in distinct skin types oily skin versus dry skin versus sensitive skin is likely more significant than ethnicity when it comes to skin care i created my products and i was looking at certain things like i know in black skin the level of ceramides is lower than in any skin types so i include ceramides overall anybody can use the product if your skin doesn't need it it won't use it if there's one thing people should take away from all these myths is just know your skin i believe in having a relationship with your skin you know you're in a relationship with another person you know what makes them happy you know how to push their buttons have that same relationship with your skin and then a lot of these things you won't have to rely on you will know what works for your skin be patient skincare always takes time and if you have any questions feel free to reach out ask your dermatologist or ask your physician really just choose a good skincare routine that will take you over long term and work well with your skin
