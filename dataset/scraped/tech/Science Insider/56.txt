if you get your back cracked you'll always need it cracked oh man i hear this all the time sitting at a desk all day will give you bad posture we need to get away from the notion that there's one good or one bad posture massages will remove knots in your back first of all the misconception is that you have knots there to begin with hi my name is dr tom walters i'm a physical therapist based in santa barbara california and i specialize in the treatment of patients with general orthopedic pain and injuries and i am dr david song and i am a chiropractor based in toronto ontario and the patients that i mostly see are weight lifters and other people who are experiencing issues with their daily activities and today we'll be debunking myths about posture and back pain myths people hear growing up good posture means standing or sitting up straight so this is a myth that comes up a lot in the clinic there's this really ideal good posture tuck your chin in pull your shoulders back the current pain science injury rehab evidence just doesn't support that thinking there isn't really a bad posture if you were gonna label a posture as bad maybe it would just be that posture that you're in for too long you get you want to do anything for eight hours and chances are it's not going to be comfortable by the end of it so slouching in itself is not really the problem it's why you're doing it for so long or not even that it's about not doing anything else really there's actually some really interesting research where they actually put people in slouching and showed that in the low back it actually improved nutrient and fluid delivery so we just have to keep moving stretching will give you good posture oh man i don't think anyone has ever achieved good posture through stretching by all means do it it's better than just sitting there doing nothing posture is not really determined by how tight your muscles are there are a lot of other aspects that go into posture for sure genetics are a part of it activities that you're involved in especially during development your actual skeleton will change depending on what activities you expose it to in your teenage years like one that we talk about a lot are baseball pitchers you know they if they start at a young age their actual upper bone their humorous bone and their arm will actually twist because of the stresses they're putting on it we might have mobility type work or interventions and stretching could be a part of that and the only way you can permanently really probably change your posture is to be consciously aware of it all the time and hold that new position but doing that all the time is probably going to create other problems for you so just be dynamic a stiff mattress is better for your back there's always questions about pillows and mattresses i mean you can understand we spend a lot of time sleeping a stiff mattress might be great for some people but horrible for other people the best way you can gauge if something is good for you is if it's comfortable this goes with shoes mattresses pillows all those things so you really have to think of your own body almost as an experiment and test things and see where you're most comfortable and what's best for your body myths from the internet this one should be a real doozy massages will remove knots in your back first of all the misconception is that you have knots there to begin with there's not some balled up muscle that we can mri and see we have a bunch of muscles that are just long and skinny and if you rub on them like this they feel like a lump don't worry about it it's just a muscle in your body so massages can help to loosen up a tight muscle it can influence how that muscle feels and how that muscle perceives you know digital pressure applied to it but will it get rid of the knot well i mean the knot wasn't there to begin with so body braces will fix your posture dave i'll let you go first they do have their place don't get me wrong they can help assist you in a position that you need to hold much like a crush what assists you standing up to not weight bear on that broken foot and so it can help to deload some of the muscles while you wear it they can temporarily improve your posture while you're wearing them but when you get any permanent changes is a totally different story we need those things sometimes medically to let something heal but anytime you have something passive holding your body it means your neuromuscular system isn't doing it and it doesn't need to anymore those muscles that would have held you back that are now being held by something else will quickly atrophy and decondition so even if that brace gave you some relief we might say okay yeah maybe use it temporarily in certain times of the day or activities but it's only for short windows it's not a permanent solution because it's going to create all kinds of other negative physical body side effects you want to be able to condition the body up and strengthen it as opposed to rely on something external influence mris and x-rays can always diagnose your back problem oh man i need to buy myself an mri if that's the case mris and x-rays are often over utilized for diagnosing back problems yeah a lot of the research shows that a structural issue with mris or x-rays and whether or not that person has a disability or pain that correlation is pretty low likewise you can have someone experiencing a lot of pain a lot of issues and again mri and it's completely clean it just looks like a healthy spine when we look at the spine and spine pain we don't recommend mris until the person's done in like a six week course of rehab because they've actually found that when people get those images if there is something there it can create fear and anxiety and they've actually shown that outcomes in terms of recovery are poorer when somebody sees their mri often a patient will be like hey i have this mri report and i'm like hold up let me see everything else about you first but i don't want to let that mri determine everything else about you because it's just one aspect about what you're experiencing myths we hear the most sitting at a desk all day will give you bad posture we need to get away from the notion that there's one good or one bad posture and just really realize that the research doesn't support that really the best thing you can do from a posture standpoint is just move often change postural positions often in the past they've done studies where they got a bunch of people riding this recumbent bicycle while doing their desk work and it turns out that after eight hours of doing that their back was killing them because they're just doing the same thing for eight hours straight whether or not you're sitting moving biking standing even the treadmill desk guess what if you're walking for eight hours a day it might end up hurting your back a little bit your nervous system is pretty good about knowing when you need to change posture so you just try to take breaks every 38 minutes every hour something get up and walk around just changing those stresses is going to change how your nervous system perceives your physical body it's going to change blood flow it's going to change nutrient delivery to tissues it's just implementing the right stresses at the right time if you get your back cracked you'll always need it cracked oh man this i hear this all the time i think the idea that you need to get your back cracked once it's cracked it's rooted in the idea that the cracking itself is shifting your bones into place and that if you don't get a cracks again it'll shift out of place and then you need to get a crack back into place that in itself is kind of untrue what we know now is that those cracks what we call our cavitations is just gas bubbles being released out of the joint spinal manipulation is just about introducing movement back into those joints it's literally no different than cracking your knuckle and then not needing to crack that knuckle ever again it's the same mechanism all it is is to open up a small window of time where you can move like pain-free or move with a little bit more ease and then you know reinforce that type of movement on your own let's sum it all up no you you don't have to get your back cracked to infinity and beyond wrestling is the best remedy for back pain the problem is is that we see that when people are immobilized or rested for too long they just decondition and atrophy and in some cases it can make the pain system sort of ramp up and be more sensitized if they rest too long rest is very important when it's needed like if you just sprained your ankle i'm not going to get you weight bearing on that same day but your the goal is to eventually get back to what you're doing pre-injury or even better than that rest in itself won't get you there rest is not rehab this is why when you have surgery they don't let you stay in the hospital and sleep there for multiple nights anymore you're pretty much in and out and you're starting rehab right away and the the best way to approach that type of thing is to just slowly level up your body i think a lot of people go from like zero to 100 way too quickly way too often your body needs to be symmetrical another doozy this is one that comes up a lot especially on social media the truth of the matter is asymmetry is normal there's lots of examples of that in the body approximately 90 of people for example have a difference in their leg length we write with one hand right versus the other we have a dominant leg where one legs dominant over the other and our body adapts to those things so asymmetry is just a normal part of life oftentimes i think people are really quick to write off that their back pain is because of their scoliosis that might be an attributing factor but i would be very cautious to say a hundred percent it's because of the structural thing it's really case-by-case dependent if you feel pain it always means something is damaged such an important one to clear up here pain is a signal at its most basic level your body's saying i don't like that but it doesn't necessarily mean any structures damage like the most easy way to think about is if i just take my hand here and i just pinch it that hurts if i look at my skin nothing's damaged this has been a really hot topic in the last 15 years in rehab and in the pain science research i think it's really important for people who are in pain to know that pain does not necessarily equate to tissue damage sometimes it does if you sprain your ankle that pain is probably associated with tissue damage but there's so many other cases where there's not a good correlation between pain and actual tissue damage this is why we have a biopsychosocial model now the bio has to do with tissue but the psychosocial is other complex elements and so this is why it's really important to address all these other aspects and to understand uh when you need to collaborate with another healthcare professional in order to increase the outcome of your patient we all are going to experience pain at some point i mean if you look at low back pain there's an 80 lifetime prevalence which means 80 of us are gonna have back pain at some point in our life when people understand pain they have better outcomes and they're less likely to have chronic pain conditions develop so it's really important to know that what matters more than anything else is like what is your movement diet looking like like what are you doing on the daily and how's that contributing to all the things that you're feeling
