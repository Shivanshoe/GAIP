you can't pop your own pimple i want you to pop your pimples thinking that you have a hot date in a half an hour acne breakouts only happen on your face not true face mapping can identify the cause of your acne this is not like reading your palm hello everyone my name is dr love i'm a board certified dermatologist in new york city i've been practicing for about five years and i specialize in both medical and aesthetic dermatology my name is josh zeikner i'm a board-certified dermatologist and an associate professor of dermatology at mount sinai hospital in new york city and i specialize in the treatment of acne rosacea and cosmetic dermatology and today we will be debunking myths about acne eating greasy food causes acne so theoretically if you're eating very greasy food and then you're immediately like wiping your face and with your hands you can clog your pores but for most people if you're eating your food you're washing your hands you're having good hygiene it's unlikely that the greasiness of the actual food that you're eating is going to have an effect on your skin instead it's the sugary food we know that foods that have a high glycemic index cause acne breakouts in some people and it's thought that raising blood sugar promotes inflammation and drives oil production so when you go to the restaurant to go buy your milkshake and your burger it's not the burger but rather the bun and the milkshake that are causing breakouts i in general tell my patients that by following a general healthy diet you're also following a healthy diet for your acne if you drink eight glasses of water a day you'll have clear skin okay well hydrated for our overall health but it is completely a myth that you need to drink eight glasses of water for hydrated skin let alone clear skin there's no data showing that drinking fewer than eight glasses of water is associated with dry skin or acne breakouts either i do think it matters what you eat what you drink i think it matters what your exercise routine is and i think it matters what your topical routine and maybe even your by mouth routine it's by your dermatologist all of these things are factors that contribute to our acne but there's no kind of magic cure that just drinking water will cure your acne the only time i have found that water clears up your acne is when you're using that water to swallow your prescription acne medication that your dermatology given you in the office acne breakouts only happen on your face not true acne breakouts are definitely more common on the face but we also know that they can occur on the chest the shoulder the back and then you can even get acne like breakouts on the scalp acne develops in areas where we have a high concentration of oil glands also known as sebaceous glands the most common reason that i see acne on the body is sweat related acne so for this type of acne making a habit of changing out of sweaty clothing and maybe even using an acne fighting body wash after workouts can really help acne on the body isn't always actually true acne i know that everybody talks about buttony or butt well guess what butt acne usually is not even acne it's folliculitis which is a little infection a hair follicle and that happens when your skin barrier is disrupted and bacteria on the skin make its way into the hair follicles people typically develop red bumps and pus pimples if you don't have any big nodules if you don't have any blackheads or whiteheads then you may have folliculitis face mapping can identify the cause of your acne everybody loves a good story on the internet saying that if you have acne in one particular area that i can tell you exactly what causes it this is not like reading your palm unfortunately there's no definitive way of mapping the cause of your acne based on where it's developing now that being said we know that adult women tend to develop acne along the lower one-third of the face and the jawline we know that hair care products are associated with acne breakouts along the hairline on the upper part of the face and sometimes if you are using a dirty phone or if you have a chin strap or a face mask you may be developing acne in areas where those are directly coming in contact with your skin but other than that there's not much science to face mapping acne can be asymmetric and so i have patients who will have more acne on one side than of their face than the other side and they will drive themselves crazy trying to figure out what specifically is causing the acne and it's just how we're made think of your face as having thousands of pipes connecting your oil glands to the surface of the skin in patients who have acne all of those pipes are somewhat clogged the problem is we can't predict which one will become clogged enough to form a full pimple so when we treat acne we really want to address the entire area that tends to break out to get rid of pimples that we have and to prevent new pimples from popping up if you don't get acne during puberty you won't get it as an adult it's completely a myth that you're free from acne if you didn't have it during puberty acne most commonly develops during puberty and in adolescence and for most people it goes away but there's a subset of patients who actually had clear skin as a teenager and then sometime around the age of 25 or older start to break out but it may have to do with changes in hormones diet or stress many adult women who are developing acne actually have dry skin which complicates the way that we treat the acne sometimes adult acne particularly that deeper acne can be resistant to topical therapies and that's when we consider by mouth options my preference is there is a hormonally based medication called spironolactone that is highly effective for adult onset acne particularly the hormonal driver for the acne bad hygiene causes acne there's no data to support that it's a hygiene problem that's causing acne we know that acne is a really complicated medical disorder with a complicated pathophysiology not at all related to hygiene but this is also can be a damaging myth because i find that a lot of my acne patients what they try to do is they try to over cleanse their skin and essentially when you start scrubbing your skin and over cleansing your skin you increase inflammation at the level of the skin and at the end of the day acne is an inflammatory condition but for the most part the people who are most at risk are people who have oily and acne prone skin to begin with if someone else's acne treatment works for them then it'll work for me some people with acne have oily skin some people with acne have dry skin some people with acne have sensitive skin some people cannot remember to use a topical for the life of them some people prefer by mouth medications and so there are a multitude of different ways to treat acne and the one that will work is one the medications that are designed to treat the type of acne that you have but also to the medications that will actually fit into your life and your lifestyle masturbation causes acne i have no idea where this comes from i i i honestly know is the answer to it but i would love to know dr zeitner do you know like where the origin of this is i'm not really sure is it because teenagers get acne but i actually would think that masturbating might help clear up your acne stress relief right but there's no data to show that masturbating will or will not affect your skin at all you can't pop your own pimple if you pop your pimple the right way it's okay with me but the problem is most people are not doing that patients often try to pop like the super inflamed pimples which just sometimes don't want to be drained and sometimes the best way to treat those is with actually an anti-inflammatory in office and so don't try it it may cause more scarring it may cause more trouble if you're going to pop something it really needs to be blackheads number one don't do it at night that's when you're tired and you're going to bed i want you to pop your pimples thinking that you have a hot date in a half an hour and your face needs to look good because if you think about it that way you're not going to put too much pressure on your skin you want to make sure that the skin is clean and your fingers are clean and you can take two cotton tip applicators like q-tips and just apply gentle downward and inward pressure around the pimple and if you're trying too hard and they're not coming out then leave it alone and abort the mission putting toothpaste on your pimple will make it go away toothpaste was formulated with a preservative known as triclosan and this was an ingredient that helped prevent bacterial contamination and because it has antimicrobial properties that's where or why toothpaste was originally used to treat temples but guess what as it turns out triclosan led to a lot of allergies in the skin so it's been removed from toothpaste so the reason that toothpaste was being put on the pimples isn't even there anymore and it contains harsh ingredients with an alkaline ph the hydrogen peroxide baking soda and all of these things will dry out your pimple but it's also going to dry out your skin in general and cause a whole big mess but the reality is that toothpaste was not designed to be used on your face and they're much more effective acne fighting ingredients that can be used in the same manner my personal favorite is benzoyl peroxide as a spot treatment to both dry out the acne decrease the inflammation and decrease any microbial or bacterial growth aspirin will help get rid of breakouts we take aspirin all the time to help treat a fever because it has anti-inflammatory properties it's actually made up of an ingredient that's similar to salicylic acid which is a really commonly used treatment for acne because it helps remove excess oil and dead cells from the surface of the skin to dry out the pimple even though they're cousins aspirin does not have those same effects in the skin instead of using aspirin i would recommend actually using salicylic acid as a spot treatment or benzoyl peroxide as a spot treatment and if you're looking for something natural then a cool compress is an easy option acne always goes away on its own about 85 of people between the ages of 7 to 24 will develop acne to the point where we almost consider it something called physiologic so for the majority of those people their acne will resolve with their teenage years but there is a large number of people where their acne does not self-resolve even acne that goes away within the teenage years can sometimes leave behind scars that can be permanent i recommend treating your acne when it gets to a point where it bothers you emotionally or physically because those emotional or physical scars are permanent and stick with you for the rest of your life so if you're suffering from breakouts and you're trying over-the-counter products and they're not helping make sure to visit a board-certified dermatologist like myself for dr love because that's what we're here to do to help treat your pimples josh i'm never doing a video with you again you're like a super pro oh my god no you are awesome this was great
