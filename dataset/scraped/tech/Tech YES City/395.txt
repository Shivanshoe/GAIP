you I spy with five to five the cpu beginning with I hey Bros got an i-5 in it sure got an eye for five in it like white man mostly iPhone doesn't have a nice wife Jason doesn't have an almost three years ago here at Tech yes city we took a look at the I 5 2400 and I found it to be a decent CPU at the time if all she wanted to do was play 1080p 60fps even with some of the latest titles back then though fast forward to 2020 we've now got Call of Duty warzone which is free to play very popular title we've got doom eternal and we've also got Red Dead Redemption to three games which require your hardware to be at least decent I'll also be throwing in fortnight since it is a very popular title for someone who would be putting together a cheap high five system so in today's comparison we're going to be getting these two eye fights and coupling it with a gtx 1650 super and then comparing it against the 99 hundred KS to see how much performance you're losing out on if you go with something that costs twenty dollars or in the case of the i5 3470 something that costs near thirty dollars in today's current market rates and most likely if you are looking for one of these CPUs you'll find them a lot cheaper locally that's just the Aliexpress prices which are readily available there's that being said are these CPUs like this shirt here wanting to come out of the dumpster or are they something different let's get into those benchmarks and find the answer so you might be thinking about getting on 18 cores perhaps well if you are then the asrock x 299 create a motherboard is the perfect choice for you with the tanking a bit on board a queen sheer nick 13 phase power design with dr. Moss 60 amp MOSFETs and 60 amp chokes integrated Wi-Fi 6 and 2 native Thunderbolt 3 ports inside this choice is pretty obvious links in description below to find out more so with these four games being tested will pull up first for you guys Red Dead Redemption 2 where we saw here an average of 94 FPS with a 900 KS and then comparing that to the 3470 we got around 63 and then I 520 400 scored in the 60 mark the minimums were significantly lower compared to the 99 hundred KS on both the i-5 s and this is on low settings at 1080p with a 1650 super not exactly a really powerful gross car by today's standards so in this particular title the i5s are falling behind quite heavily moving over to fortnight on low settings with epic view distance a hundred percent resolution scale this is the settings the pros like to use we saw here the 9900 KS was getting some pretty impressive FPS at 246 with good 1% and 0.1% lows the i5 20 434 70 scored 133 and also 162 respectively we're also the 0.1% lows were quite bad so if you're really passionate about fortnight the i5 s would make a decent stepping stone and then of course if you're starting to play for money you can probably afford to step it up to something bigger but there's definitely some performance to be gained even with a 1650 super in this title and one thing that really surprised me was the 1650 supers pretty much perfect fit for 240 Hertz gamers in fortnight at these settings anyhow moving over to call of duty war zone here at 1080p high settings we saw a massive difference between the I 9 and also the 2 I 5s and we even saw quite a big difference between the 34 70 and the i5 2400 this title can get really demanding on a CPU even with the gtx 1650 super to the point where the i5 2400 in my opinion did kind of fail this test the i5 3470 did a lot better especially with the point 1 percent lower than 1% lows but the i5 2400 did leave a bit more to be desired in this particular game though the last title we got up here is doom eternal where we saw pretty much same FPS across the board though I did have a problem with loading River tuna in this particular title after they updated the game before it released it worked fine but they updated the game and then all's I could get is really a static FPS of the average number and it pretty much worked out the same in the same spot meaning doom of course is a really well optimized title in the Vulkan API so it's no surprise that something like a 1650 super at high settings 1080p didn't really see any difference between these three CPUs anyhow coming out of these results I thought the difference between the i-5 34 70 and the i-5 2400 was actually quite substantial in the latest and greatest titles if you for either of these two I definitely pick the 3470 over the 2400 in 2020 especially since it only costs a few more dollars and it will work on the same motherboards that an i5 2400 will work on now some important differences between these two CPUs is that you've got a 3.2 gigahertz all boosting games versus a 3.4 on the i5 3470 so you do have slightly higher clock speeds but you've also got IPC gains of around 5% between the 32 nanometer and 22 nanometer chips the IMC also officially supports 1600 megahertz versus 1333 and you've also got PCIe gen3 vs. PCIe gen 2 on the i5 2400 power consumption states that the TDP is a 95 watt versus 77 what but loading up I 264 on both these CPUs actually saw quite a big difference in power draw we're talking 37 Watts versus 63 watts meaning not only is the 3470 a better pick for gamers but it's also a lot more efficient and if you're on a budget you're probably gonna be going with the budget power supply so that extra 30 what saved may make a difference for you anyhow tying things up for you guys my recommendation would be if you want to go out and get like a gtx 1650 super then I'd be coupling it with an i7 2637 70 at the very least we saw these i5s were better suited for something like maybe a gtx 1050 in 2020 especially if you want to be playing some of those latest and greatest titles like Call of Duty warzone or even if you want to play for tonight competitive settings you're not gonna be getting the most out of your 1650 super to the point where it most likely is wasted money so the i5 2400 and even the i5 3470 they are starting to look a lot less appealing than they did three years ago and in fact I'd say 4 cores 4 threads is finally starting to be phased out at least with the latest and greatest titles coming out to the point where you at least want 4 cos 8 threads and yes in today's benchmarks I did use the inspector I did try to raise the performance as much as I could on these i5s but they just couldn't go any higher though ultimately they are a good chip if all you want to get 60 FPS even at 1080p but of course with the latest cards like the 1650 super being out like I said before you will be wasting that money where your GPU simply won't be getting maxed at 100% so my recommendation with these chips is yes they can play games at 60fps but don't go out wasting more money than you need to on a graphics card something like a gtx 1050 or even 1050 Ti would be the max I'd be coupling with these CPUs in 2020 and if you're on the AMD side maybe an rx 560 above that you're just simply getting wasted performance also the last thing about both these CPUs is they don't support the avx2 instruction set that was introduced into CPUs in the next generation has well for instance the i5 4440 so basically if a game comes out that requires a vx2 instruction sets you could lose even more performance with these chips anyway with that aside if you guys are enjoying the content around here then be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comments section below what's your favorite CPU of 2020 so far and also I didn't really talk about the Zeon's the equivalents like the 1220 v2 and also the 1225 v2 because the prices are coming in very similar now to the i5 s the demand really just isn't there for I 5 s at least the older i5 s in 2020 though do comment as I love reading your thoughts and opinions and speaking of thoughts and opinions we have the question of the day which comes from Paulo hoard and they asked Russ must be because of humidity never seen rust on PC parts where I live and there fern to yesterday's video where we cleaned up some graphics cards and talked about common faults on GPUs we're in that video there were some GPUs with rust on them and basically in Australia I live at a place called the Gold Coast and we live close to the beach and basically we get salt in the air and then if that gets on PC parts over time it causes the rust and corrosion especially if you live close to the beach I've seen some pretty bad messed up PC parts especially people who live right on the beach even after six months some of their parts can fail and break down because of that corrosion anyway I hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this bah and you're enjoying the content then you know what to do and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
