usually with faulty hardware i'll try some quick 
tricks to try and get it to work if it doesn't   work after that i usually put it in either a bin 
which i'll donate to someone or i'll just simply   chuck it out however in this case i've noticed 
that the market recently people are paying good   money for faulty products and you may be stopping 
there and thinking like brian you're selling   people faulty pc parts that's just straight wrong 
and there's nothing wrong about it if you're being   transparent and putting in the title faulty you're 
putting in the listing look this part simply i   can't get it to work and i don't know exactly 
what is wrong with it and you can even make   yourself some decent money to people who want to 
try and repair it or people who think that there's   something simple to fix and they think they can 
fix it especially if you've taken good photos and   there's no visible hardware damage on the paths 
themselves but let's go over some of the prices   that people are paying for faulty parts right now 
and how during this time especially if you want to   buy another pc or save up for something else you 
can actually make some decent money on this stuff   and put it towards your next purchase we've got 
here the z590 motherboard that's right this is   the z590 phantom gaming itx with thunderbolt 4 usb 
3.2 gen 2 front out double shot pro combining your   neck and your 6e wifi together for double speeds 
and the hyper m.2 gen 4x4 if you're looking for   the best mini rtx motherboard that has it all then 
i'll put some links in the description below so   the first component that we're going to talk about 
is easily the graphics card right now people want   to buy graphics cards especially cryptocurrency 
miners and so they're willing to pay even for   faulty cards in the attempt that they can get them 
working and then put them on a crypto mining bench   it's actually getting quite bizarre to the point 
where one of my friends here on the gold coast   sold a gtx 1070 which was faulty for nearly 
300 aussie dollars and that shocked me because   over a year ago you could pick up a gtx 1070 that 
was in good condition and working for 300 and in   fact in a part time that i did over a month ago 
i got a gtx 1070 that was working for 350 dollars   so there's definitely this rush that's coming 
through the market where people really want to   get a graphics card and they want it so bad to the 
point where they'll even pick up faulty cards in   desperation of trying to get them to work in that 
they can get better perceived value if they so   fix those graphics cards up however on the flip 
side if you've ever tried selling products even   if it's for spare parts say for instance someone 
wants to get the fans off this graphics card   or they want the nice io shield that's not 
rusted and perhaps their one is a bit rusted   but their card still works they'll generally give 
you a really low rate for that card anyhow so in   the past when i've tried uh selling some graphics 
cards that i had come through in a big bundle and   i tried selling off some faulty ones especially 
locally people just weren't interested in those   cards period and then if you try selling on ebay 
it's not worth the time you've got to deal with   for fees and messages and posting things off and 
you don't get any money for it so basically the   market right now for selling your faulty pc parts 
transparently looks like it's extremely good and   it's actually funny in ways for me personally 
this does correlate with other markets out there   for instance i've noticed me and dadman we've gone 
around looking at some of these auctions for homes   just to gauge the real estate demand where i am 
locally and we were shocked because there would   be some houses where we'd be at these auctions 
and we're thinking like this place won't go for   say for instance 450 000 this wouldn't even go 450 
000. and then there's these people on the phone   they're bidding and they're bidding all the way up 
to 600 000 for this home that's absolutely messed   up and there's so much risk involved and that's 
coming from my dad who was a builder and he said   you can't make any money even if you're in the 
flipping game on this real estate purchase because   it's just that bad and deteriorated and the risks 
involved are simply not worth it so it looks like   not only in pc parts at the moment there's also a 
lot of other markets where people are just going   crazy and paying ridiculously high prices for 
what i would consider garbage though getting   back to the pc parts the graphics card would 
easily be the most popular but if you've got   things like cpus right here on the desk we've got 
some i7s that i've actually saved over the years   and they haven't booted so i've got an i7 6700 
got a 4770k and also a 4770 and these parts just   simply give out a black screen when i put them 
in the motherboard and so if you've got a heap   of cpus that don't work sometimes people like to 
buy these cpus because perhaps they would work   if they were a particular type of i7 i have 
seen this once in the past i think it was   with like with a dell machine where the i7 
that i7 would only work with that motherboard   and i've never seen anything like it to the point 
where that i7 perhaps had a different micro code   and it was programmed towards that motherboard and 
so perhaps people are like well i know the code on   that cpu and i can get it to work so they can pick 
up a bargain and in your case you're never going   to come into that scenario so you can sell it off 
and make some decent coin but on this case we've   got here a motherboard that boots up but it's 
a little bit faulty and i've tried everything   i can to get this motherboard working properly 
100 but there's i think a faulty part on board   so if someone's looking for say a replacement 
heatsink on this and then they can get that and   you can turn that what you would otherwise perhaps 
throw out in the garbage you can turn that into   something especially in this market right now 
anyway guys with that aside i think the market   is great right now for selling off some faulty pc 
parts and just being transparent about of course   don't hose anyone down don't try and scam people 
down i mean i've bought parts in the past where   people say the part works you get it home and it's 
completely bricked and in fact i'd say in the last   year the amount of hosings that i've got is at 
an all-time high where i've been hosed on three   separate occasions as opposed to before that where 
i've only been hosed like once in three and a half   years so the be careful of especially if you're 
buying something off the used market right now   that people will sell faulty hardware and they'll 
try and sell it under the guys that it is working   but please don't do that if you are selling faulty 
hardware just be honest about it and in terms of   what you're pricing it at you can just leave it 
up on free auction and let people do the bidding   but i think in terms of the market itself 
it is a great time for you if you've got   a lot of stuff that's just sitting around and you 
know it hasn't worked in the past then you can   still get some decent money for it and uh put that 
towards something or just minimalist down as well   in the process and especially in terms of like 
what i'm doing now i'm trying to clean out my   studio a little bit but in terms of these parts 
right here i'll probably just put them back in   the bin and then uh donate them to someone who 
wants to fiddle around with hardware and uh get   some usage out of it anyhow guys if you enjoyed 
today's video be sure to hit that like button for   us and also let us know in the comment section 
below do you have any faulty pc parts of your   own and what do you usually do with those parts 
or have you sold anything like a faulty pc part   on ebay recently like the story of the gtx 1070 
that my friends sold here locally for nearly 300   all our eyes were really opened on that one but i 
love reading your thoughts and opinions as always   just like this question of the day here which 
comes from mike lawton and they asked do you   sell the builds you make i'd love a video of you 
selling some of the stuff so yes and no i do sell   pretty much all the used builds that i do here on 
the channel i do re-flip them and yes i do make   some profit on that and so i'll use the profits 
and the original cost to put into the next used   build or of course outside of the channel i'll 
buy myself some new clothes and things that i like   but in terms of the new builds that 
come through here a lot of the times   i have to send those builds back say for instance 
from azus or gigabyte they'll send in their builds   and i'll do these new builds and i'll have to 
send those parts back but if i'm building a   new build from parts that i've bought myself then 
anything that i buy myself i usually re-flip that   to free up space in the studio and also go towards 
the next project hope that answers that question   and if you've stayed this far and you want to see 
the tech yes content the moment it drops be sure   to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll 
catch you in the next one peace out for now bye you
