when it comes to water cooling there seems to be a stigma on the internet and that is bigger is better however for me personally that wasn't the case in previous water coolers i tested where i actually preferred a 280 mil water cooler like the h115i rgb platinum over the h150i elite capelex but today marks a brand new for me personally and that is a 420 mil water cooler with three 140mm fans so this is the h170i elite capellix from corsair and when i first saw this thing my eyes opened up like a kid at a candy store because i knew what i was in for where i like the 140mm fans over the 120s because they give you a quieter noise profile and i think overall they do a better job of giving your balance of cooling and noise performance but let's get on to the numbers here where we're going to be testing this with an i9 11 900k against my previous favorite cooler the h115i rgb platinum and we'll be talking about the new additions that corsair have added in so let's check it out so first thing is first when it comes to the performance numbers we tested with an 11 900k which we've got two different profiles here but we're actually going to show up three different graphs for you guys where we've got the first one coming in with the default power consumption profile this is pulling about 215 watts direct draw to the cpu itself through the vrm of the motherboard and what we can see here is that the temperatures are winning against some of the best competitors that i've had in previous chart topping performance and it's actually beating it by quite a long shot and another thing about the h170i is that it also does this with some of the quietest noise profiles i've ever seen especially given this cpu is on full throttle now moving over to another chart that i decided to throw on the mix and this was when we started to overclock it and here is where the h170i elite capel x shone where i was really shocked the fact that when we overclocked this and we're pulling over 300 watts directly to the cpu and i will say yes it does look a little bit weird we're going from 4.8 gigahertz to 4.9 gigahertz and we're drawing an extra 80 watts that just shows you that the level 900k really tops out at 4.8 gigahertz after that you're getting serious diminishing returns even on good water cooling and so what we saw here was that again the fan noise was really low given the performance of the h170i with its extra 140 mil length on the radiator and the cooling solution versus the 280 mils and even a 360 mil so the cooling performance basically in a nutshell if you guys want to get this cooler then it's going to be that absolute top tier cooling performance for your cpu so i really am impressed with what corsair have done here but let's talk about straight away before we get into the other features and what they've done with this cooler i will say the expense it's going to be around 320 aussie dollars or in the us around 230 us dollars so it is a step up in comparison to say for instance the h115 rgb platinum that has previously been my favorite cooler on the block however the h170i elite capel x trumps all that completely with both its noise profiles and its cooling performance where basically out of the box if you don't want to do anything you're going to get really quiet noise and really good cooling performance it's even got in the software they've added the zero rpm mode as well as adding the features of linking all the cooling with simple profiles that if you've got a corsair keyboard you've also got say corsair dominated memory it can all link together and then you can have easy tuned rgb profiles so the iq is one of the biggest benefits of going with corsair's rgb profile but of course the cooling performance is the most important thing and corsair have simply nailed it with this solution though one thing to note with the software and the zero rpm mode if you want to access this then you will have to enable it after you've installed the iq software as it's not enabled by default though out of the box when it comes to the profiles you will have the quiet profile on the pump itself which i do recommend keeping it on quiet i found turning it up just makes noise a little bit more noticeable and it doesn't give you really any benefit to cooling though when it comes to the fans leaving them unbalanced is really good solution in that you might need to drop it down to quiet or even zero rpm because for me personally i could barely hear these fans on the balance profile out of the box i'll let you guys take a quick listen [Music] so there it is with the h170i elite pellex the performance is exceptional the price is also very steep and the noise is also exceptional too though before i get on out of here there are some things to talk about and that is the sheer size of this cooling solution you will need a massive case to fit it in in that it's not just 420 that magical number where people like to uh smoke it up and um it's actually quite the contrary with the h170 elite compelling in that it's keeping things cool and not really smoking up anything and those are not my duries and another thing is too is that the radiator length will go up to 450 mil actually it's slightly over i'll put the dimensions up on the screen for you so you will need again quite a big case to accommodate this cooler though that being said it marks a new era for me personally where before this i really liked the 280 mil solutions but now the 420 solution is going to be my new top favorite the problem is is that again around here there's not many cases to fit this thing in in fact i've only got one case that's coming in where i will be installing this cooler so limited mounting options but if you're willing to build the best of the best this is certainly going to be a cooler that will accommodate that you've also got the option on the cooler itself to refill the pump and that's got its own little screw and you've also got the ability to change the top plate but they give you an additional white diffuse solution that you can change over if you want a different look coming out of those 33 capellex rgb leds in terms of what this cooler will mount to there's lots of different solutions to choose from tr4 am4 lga 2066 i'm sure it'll even fit the upcoming z690 older lake solutions but it has been leaked that 1700 will maintain lga 1200 compatibility and that's about it for today's video if you enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comment section below what you think of the 420 solution versus the 360 versus the 280 versus the 140 versus the 120 which solution have you been rocking yourself or are you just strictly no water cooling at all love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from past squizzle the shed man and they ask hey bry what's your preferred mechanical keyboard switch type tactile linear clicky etc so when it comes to the mechanical switches i actually like the clicky the blues i mean nowadays they have different colors with the actuation points i think but but i actually don't use the blues personally because they annoy people around me people just get triggered by the noise which is sad because you know there's always a trade-off right that beautiful clicky tactile feel then you got the noise that accommodates it some people don't like the noise i love the noise but it's just what it is nowadays i actually prefer the shape of the keyboard where i'm using an ergonomic keyboard for when i'm doing a lot of typing but when i'm actually not using my ergo keyboard i'm using the cherry mx silvers which are a linear switch so in a nutshell it doesn't really bother me what switch i use i can type on anything i guess that probably wasn't the answer you're hoping to hear anyway i hope that answers that question i'll just catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] oh
