[Music] if you like drinking coffee every day but you don't want to go to a cafe and pay those high prices for a coffee then perhaps today's video might be a helpful hand to you where we're gonna be buying a two dollar junk coffee machine from this place right here and seeing if we can clean it up and fix it up and then after that if we can get that working we're going to see what kind of coffee it can produce so let's go on in there and go grab that bargain [Music] are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below and coming back now to the tech yes japan studio we have this two dollar unit right here it is very basic in operation which is actually a good thing for a two dollar junk item because there's not a whole lot that can go wrong and in fact i've just turned the levers both ways and the led lights coming on that means power's going through i think this thing is going to work however you're probably thinking what's the deal with this what coffee machine is this and how do you know or how are you so confident that you'll get it working well i've actually had experience with a similar model before one of my friends had a i think it's a very popular coffee machine it's called the mr coffee and i remember they they were teaching me how to make coffee one day and essentially you just turn the lever that way for your brew and then you turn it the other way for your froffer so very basic machine and function in that it gets electricity from the wall converts it into heat and then that heat then heats up your water and then that creates a closed chamber for the steam pressure to then be forced out through the filter making your coffee and also forced out through the frother which then froths your milk but as you can see here this unit's actually pretty dirty so we're going to clean it down on the outside with gif and then on the inside i'm actually going to be running a few times water through the system and just cleaning out the internals before we decide to try and make a coffee we're going to leave the drip and the filter to soak in detergent while we do all this there's actually one thing missing and that's the measuring cup which usually goes here and they included the top for it but there's no bottom but that's not a problem because we can just use here a standard cup to basically drip the coffee into [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] so now we're off to the part where we are going to clean the internals down and for this we're going to use some vinegar and we're going to pour about a hundred mil in and then after that we're going to pour some water in and then we're going to run that through this coffee machine and so what this is going to do is just really clean out the internals make sure everything's uh disinfected then we put our lid back on and turn it on and just let this all drip out into a cup and also with the froffer we'll then froth that just in water [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so now the initial cleaners finished i'm going to run through two more times the same process just with standard water though just to clean everything out make sure there's no vinegar left in there because yeah i don't want to exactly have a vinegar tasting coffee [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] and now our coffee machine is all clean we are ready for our first coffee and what i'm using here is i know people probably going to hate me but i drink decaf i don't actually drink caffeinated coffee i love the taste of coffee but caffeine just doesn't agree with my body probably some people are going to switch off the video right now like how dare you you got to drink coffee with caffeine in it but what we've got here is already pre-crushed beans you do have to make sure that it's not too finely crushed otherwise it'll just leak out of the actual filter if it's too coarse you won't get good coffee as well so this is just the beans from local market here relatively cheap i think like 400 grams is 5 bucks and we're just going to fill this up about half way because i think this standard here is it's actually got a measuring component inside the actual filter where we can see it's got four cups two cups and anywhere in between whatever you want so we're just gonna have two cups here that'll fill up a big cup of coffee and then we're going to put the milk in after and froth that up [Music] so [Music] [Music] and there we have it with our coffee smells amazing and it tastes amazing too and so what the point of today's video was is that i i love price performance and you guys know with tech i love looking at budget parts i love building budget pcs i love everything where there's value and i believe getting a machine for two dollars spending maybe 40 minutes cleaning it all up and then getting out of coffee that tastes just as good as a cafe would taste is just to me it's just really fun the whole process is fun you're getting tremendous value out of something that someone just didn't want at all they just dropped it off at a junk store probably because they maybe didn't know how to use it it ultimately was just so much fun cleaning this thing up from start to finish so if you guys enjoyed this video do let us know in the comments and hit that like button for us and also let us know if there's any other product categories you want me to check out and sort of dive into from start to finish where i feel like me going into the realm of a coffee machine definitely has its uh purpose if someone's out there and they love drinking coffee but say they can't afford a 200 machine or something like that they may wish to look out for a cheap coffee machine and knowing that fixing it up is actually quite easy and not that time consuming and you can get a very good morning coffee that will help your day out anyway guys hope you enjoyed this one and we've also got the question of the day here which comes from su casa02 and they ask would this board work with a 5900x and they're talking about the asrock b550 mini itx and that will definitely work with the ryzen 9 5900 x 12 core cpu in fact it'll handle that cpu absolutely fine so if you go out and buy that combination you're going to have no problems even out of the box hope that answers that question and if you're enjoying that tech yes use value lifestyle
