all righty we should be live here guys i um it's been a while and today we're gonna be talking about some really good news and that is the intel three nanometer they're gonna finally with their all their woes in place they're going to be jumping over to tsmc's goodness we're just going to talk a little bit a little bit what's going to be talking about the dg1 graphics card and uh how that apparently is a massive fail so igor's labs have a exclusive on this and we're going to wait for some chat to pop up here as well oh you guys are coming in already what is going on we're going live so youtube um youtube gives me the option just to go live now so i don't have any time to schedule it for you guys or anything like that it used to be a different system here with youtube where you could like uh show your viewers that the live was coming up and now it's just like the only option you've got is to get the stream ready and then just go hit live and away we go so we got a uh massive stream here for you guys but not actually i actually the the streams as we go on i'm actually i've got the chat up here so i'm just going to chat with you guys as well if you've got questions drop them below if there's any big topics you want to talk about from what i looked at in the tech space it's mainly um the the intel graphics card being a fail which we'll get onto very soon and then the three nanometer thing is very uh interesting that is one of the crazy developments that we have to look at because it's big news for enthusiasts providing all this stuff uh blows over um so we got here the first question is how fluent are you in japanese i could i could speak um i can speak japanese but like i don't i haven't spoken in a while so there's actually quite a few words i forgot so uh there's that uh do i live stream on twitch uh not at the moment i i like i really with youtube there's so much going on and i'm pretty much a one-man band so like i'm just focused on the youtube right now my like i don't post up on facebook enough i don't post up on there's a lot of other stuff that i just sort of don't think about too much but youtube's like the main one that it's the main it's the main prize right youtube's the one we gotta focus on so um yeah man you guys are going crazy in the chat already it's heating up you guys must have wanted a live stream like yo where's this tech yes live stream coming it's right here brothers it's right here let's uh let's get on to this first piece of news though let's just get the news out of the way because seems like you guys want to chat a little bit so i uh i think i got this up here so eagles labs they got the exclusive on this this is the dg1 intel's graphics card and it looks so bad like apparently they're using ddr4 if i can read this right they're using ddr4 memory on this graphics card which makes it like apparently it's around a gt 1030. so it's like everyone was hoping for something from intel to maybe even if it was like a gtx 1050 even if it was something that could just play games like basic games and sort of fill that quota of maybe a hundred and something dollar graphics card i think intel would have been getting a lot of praise but this is just looking like it's complete fail but i mean that being said intel haven't made graphics cards for like 20 years and the last time they made it they failed as well so i'm hoping that this is sort of like their practice run and then next year they'll be ramping up something heavy because from what i see here it's basically the nutshell of this the gist of it is that the dg1 i mean for gamers right if we're looking like this channel's focused towards gaming sure there might be it might be a good graphics card for people who need graphics for something else but uh gp compute gpu compu but this is for gamers this thing's like a gt 1030. so it's like that's the news with that and it's like wow can we how do we turn this into a positive you know like this is a thing right so the whole thing about my channel is i like to give it a positive spin so it's like we'll go a little bit positive on this graphics card right we'll we'll try and do something here so hey guys the gg1 just got launched i absolutely love ddr4 i mean i buy ddr4 i mean i was just hoping though intel if they had the ddr4 chips with rgb on them this would have been a graphics card to get i mean they've got the rgb and the logo here so why didn't they put rgb on the actual chips on the graphics card intel this was the card i was hoping for ddr4 rgb on gpu anyway um going to go so that's um so we've got why doesn't the bogan shop for use but we're going to do used parts very soon so don't worry we're doing used parts very soon we're just sort of getting through this news here and just uh after this live stream i'm going to be actually parts hunting so there's a little hint i i just actually to be honest in in january and uh towards the end of december i did have a massive gaming session like on the uh 4k like i i got sidetracked and i played a lot of games and it was it was pretty intense man pretty intense i had to really i think i had to relax because 2020 was just such a busy year it was so busy and i haven't had a year like that where it was just like content uh hustling pc flipping content content you know it was just it was a full-on year i think i just got burnt out so bad to the point where i was like okay need a break here need a break so um yeah anyway let's move on to this this is so the dg1 sorry to spoil the news for you guys but it doesn't look good but another thing is too you guys have been requesting it you guys been asking in the last live stream here he is jar jar mug that's what we're bringing to the show right now the jar jar mug um best mug ever by the way best mug ever and it's funny how many people how many people like the turn in jar jar it's funny because in the comments section yesterday there was the turn for judge like in the last few years i think initially people hated jar jar now there's this big turn for jar jar people i like dude i was always like low key i didn't mind jar jar but then when judge i started getting a lot of hate i was like you know what i i like jar jar he's cool a mess and then i heard the darth jar jar storyline i was like yeah i'm sold on that that was amazing like they'd give it credit i wish they have i wish they did darth jar jar that would have been unreal but um it's much like the from the comments yesterday as well there's a thing about the intel we'll move over to the cpus because this looks really promising but the thing about the intel you guys yesterday in the comment section of yesterday's video i was really surprised like what are you guys like yeah man price that's all that matters right who cares about the brand name i think we're starting to win here as a tech community and it looks like you guys are starting to agree the the intel versus amd argument a lot of you guys are like yeah intel is cheaper right now they're offering better value on their budget cpus go with that and a lot of like people are saying like builders are saying yeah i've switched from uh using amd cpus to intel cpus and that's kind of what i've noticed as well like i've been like a lot of people building pcs i want an intel cpu and then when i'm selling an i7 10 700 thing goes really quick as well so it's moving off the shelves so yeah like good like kudos to intel for stepping up i guess like stepping up to the plate and starting to offering that value so that's what we got there so um okay so where's i say we got a question too uh where's the win performance dollar per ram the moment ah i've heard some stories as well like through the grapevine i've heard that maybe maybe ram and like ssd prices and stuff may be going up as well like that's what i've heard in australia from my supplies i actually contacted some of my suppliers i got some like you know very loose supplies in china the prices are still okay for ddr4 and ssds and stuff like that um prices have gone up a little bit they're not that much i think like maybe for instance like during last year during that plow down after the big covert rush you could get ddr4 memory say 8 gigabyte sticks for maybe 20 usd like base 21 22 usd based now it's gone up to around 26 27 so there is an increase in the base price there on one stick of ddr4 memory so that that's probably like parts may go up there but uh we'll talk about that a little bit later let's go on to this last article here where we've got the uh tsmc this is the three nanometers so now tsmc are making their three nanometer process and apparently it's coming into mass production in 2022 which isn't bad honestly considering they've got um i hope that didn't come out on stream man some of these websites man some of these websites they play this music in the background it's like yeah so it's muted anyway that's good so mass production 22 2022 right three nanometer tsmc they've already provided all that goodness they're providing all the goodness with um with their seven nanometer right we see that with amd right people can't get enough of intel stuff so what's going on now is that the intel's intel's like rumors have it that intel is booking out tsmc's three nanometer process and if this is the case right what we're seeing is we're looking at trends here right and this is why a lot of people put like in the title i've read some news out there there's some articles like is amd going to be in trouble and that's straight away that's when you look at like the chess pieces on the board you see like well tsmc are booked out like heavily booked out on seven nanometer to the point where it's affecting amd's retail cpu sales and that's what i've heard through the grapevine that's actually a real thing they've got a they've got obligations to hit the contracts on um the consoles from sony and microsoft and this right here if this comes into play right if intel are like going yeah we're booking out three nanometer for our cpus then this is going to spell the point to the amd where they're like okay we can't go to tsmc and source as many cpus or source as much three nanometers as we'd like so that could cause supply issues for amd potentially in 2022 so it's all fair game i mean when tsmc is making the best stuff and it's affecting intel to the point where they can't keep up on their own fabs then of course they're going to outsource and start getting on that goodness so this is one thing that's why people are saying look it could cause uh problems for amd but according to the article intel is like going ahead with their own fabrications but they're also outsourcing more so they want to just basically expand more and more and there's in moore's laws everything's more right moore's law is not working too well but more more and that's what we've got now in the industry so there it is with intel what do you guys think in the comments do you think this is going to spell danger do you think this is going to spell danger for amd with this three nanometer so if but again this is a rumor right this is a rumor but apparently intel's ceo kind of did give it some weight where he said here and this is his words but the proportion sorry i put back to the i'll put it back to the wording here this is the intel ceo's words so the majority of 2023 products will be manufactured internally but the proportion of outsourcing will still increase so they did sort of give you like of course that's the typical like ceo um i think is he the ceo now pat gelsinger so he sort of said look we're going to be making more but we're going to be outsourcing more so you guys don't really know if this room is 100 true because when it gets to when it gets down to rumors like this it has potential to change and the one thing this has potential to influence is of course the stonks and uh there's been a big blow up and so they can't like as a as a ceo they have to be careful how they word things very careful how they word things otherwise it could send the prices of stonks through the roof and that's one thing you've got to be careful about when you're a ceo and you're like sitting there and you're like yeah we sourced we sourced tmz tsmc's three nanometer we've done that amd's going down now if they said that then yeah stonks would just go crazy so they've got to be careful what they say in relation to stonks so um and then people in the comments are like yeah they're just trying to screw amd with no vass um that like that's that's what goes on like sometimes that's competition right they all try to get each other into the fray like they're all trying to beat one another and that's how it goes so i've got a donation thank you so much john krause he says hey brian are the xeon e5 1650s and a hp z420 any good for gaming yeah like that's that's fine man if you get if you get a e5 a 1650 i think that's six cores 12 threads and you put in some ecc ddr3 you can have a real budget like i'm talking real cheap outfit there and then you just whack in a card man like you could even do an rtx 2060 on that thing providing the game support avx2 you're gonna be absolutely fine on that thing man don't let uh don't let all the like the new stuff like as much as i like the new stuff the reason i'm recommending the new stuff a lot more to you guys is because like we look at the price of an i3 10 um 10 100 f it's 120 aussie dollars i think in the us i've seen it as low as 100 bucks 100 bucks for a four core eight thread is super cheap man that that's why i've been recommending that more because the value in the new stuff has gotten a lot better except for graphics cards so i think like when we're talking about intel's dg1 here when we're looking at this intel dg1 i think a lot of like i was secretly hoping intel would pull like even something like a gtx 1050 but they just failed so like this was the most disappointing news of recent times i was just hoping intel could have done something there to alleviate that market because it seems like nvidia and amd just don't really care at the moment like they're not addressing that that market that there is so much demand for it right when we look at the games when we look at the games coming out they don't demand an rtx 3080 except cyberpunk 2077 that's a different story when we look at what people are playing right fortnite uh cs go all these popular games they could if they had a gtx 1050 equivalent for 100 bucks they would have nailed it man like pc sales would like pc builders would have been like yeah this is awesome we can now get a cheap graphics card cheap rgb case low power consumption i3 10 100 f slap it together there's your new meta and not only that not only is the build going to be cheap but it's going to be helping out a lot of people man because you're building cheap pcs people are happy they're going to be buying them up they're going to be playing these games everyone's happy but uh no one wants to service this market man like it's actually like frustrating that intel sort of i mean it's not like intel is not intel's fault that they couldn't do it right they're making their first graphics card but at the same time it's sort of like amd and nvidia can you guys step up to the plate a little bit can you guys do it can you guys help us out a little bit here help us out so what we'll do is we'll move over to chat now they're the two like literally that was the two topics i kind of wanted to talk to you guys about was um the dg1 kind of sucked and um where people ask in the comments where the chinese gpu makers and say like i'm like you look at what's happening so that's a that's a good question but it's an easy answer right we look at what's happening on the cpu side of things they can't really get a cpu right right we looked at the i'll put a link in the video after the live stream we did an actual video on a cpu made in china and it wasn't good like it was bad so gpus i would say require a lot more r d to make properly and even if any look at this intel can't get it right if intel can't get it right um and it's taking them a while to do gpus then there's a lot more to graphics cards than cpus potentially i don't know the business in terms of engineering this stuff but from what i can see it's very tough game to make a gpu so in terms of china getting out of copy gpu i wouldn't be expecting that anytime soon uh we got 10 donation from chris as well uh hello brian from pittsburgh pittsburgh is it pittsburgh pa just showing the tech yes city some love thanks a lot man that's some tech yes loving right there um let me know how to pronounce it too pittsburgh pittsburgh pittsburgh i'm a bit of a noob sorry with that one uh but yeah let's move over you guys hot questions hot pressing topics let's just chat with the jar jar mug and let's get on if you guys have any topics about tech that you want to discuss um ah pittsburgh okay pittsburgh i'm such pittsburgh i was like pittsburgh anyone got the wheelbarrow and then we can go like dig up pittsburgh and put it in the wheelbarrow and pittsburgh so yeah pittsburgh okay i got that one okay so uh did you hear about carl from bitwit i thought you could contact him since you went through the same thing yeah man a suit uh like it's it's his thing like that's his thing to talk about right and the thing about that is it's like i've been through the exact same thing so i reached actually i reached out before i even announced the news and i just i knew that face man i've seen that look i've seen that face before and i knew something was up and so we've been i talked to him in dms and i just said look man i'm here any time for you dude just give me a call it's all you got to do because i know exactly what you've been through with that stuff exactly what you've been through and my advice was you know it does get better that's all you can say this is just like um it's a it's like it's it's a real personal thing so it's like something i'm not gonna talk about much at all like that's up to him and um yeah so like i wish him i wish him all the best to get better and just it's one of those crappy things where you feel like you're on top of the world everything's going great and then all of a sudden you get hit with this big you know gut-wretching kidney shot and you're like oh where did that come from and then you kind of like now he's kind he's been hit with a kidney shot and now it's kind of time to just be like oh okay got to get back to normal so as always with a kidney shot man it can bring you down permanently but that's the one thing you want to make sure you don't get put down permanently so uh you know speaking from a guy that's copped a kidney shot before they hurt man they hurt oh man good old kidney shot um anyway so i've been through two oh chris king and you've been through two bro i feel his pain there's like the live stream's just gonna be talking like it's just gonna become like talking about all our divorces in the past yeah i've been divorced just another statistic fellas i think it's like 50 percent of people get divorced though like that's uh like or something like that in the new age um yeah so like justin halen yeah he got he got a kidney shot bro like someone punched him in the kidneys that's like what happened to bit with so he's just recovering at the moment um and uh but he's recovering really well man he's doing really well so that's good like i love carl i love his content as well he's awesome so go support him as well if you guys haven't seen him already his channel's bit wit go check it out awesome guy i've i've met him a couple of times he's such a cool down-to-earth dude i really like what he's about um also he's got a one dollar dono in there from chris k thanks a lot brother i appreciate the one dollar so we also got dab man also from the last stream we got dab man a carton of beer i should have posted a picture up on socials for that we got dadman a carton of beer with the last donation money you guys are so good um that was so good with that so uh we got from chris k hey brian i ordered a one and z mobo and an e5 26 98 core 16 thread and 32 gigabyte combo for 200 us what do you think of the price performance yeah i mean if you've got the 32 gigabytes of ram in there for 200 us with that a core 16 thread and the one and z mobo that's a good buy man like you can't go wrong with that especially if you're in a place where you can't um get tech for good prices and even in america from what i'm seeing with you guys at the moment like the a lot of the ryzen cpus are getting priced stupidly just like they are in australia like you can't even get a ryzen 9 5900x here it's just sold out and even though amd's charging like literally 1500 or 1400 aussie dollars for a 5950x you can't even buy them either so at the moment that's how much the um that's how much it's that's how much uh supply is a problem right now and what you're gonna see like what you're gonna see in the grand scheme of demand and supply if i asked you which was more important demand or supply in my opinion which would be like let us know in the comments do you think demands more important or supplies more important that's the question i'm going to ask if you're and that's that's the thing right this is an interesting question because this is almost like a paradox is demand more important or is supply more important so here we go we're going to get a few answers yeah it's as i it's as i expected it's as i expected right you guys the majority of you guys are saying supply and the reason being is because you're a customer if you're a seller demands more important now in the grand scheme of things hear this out okay hear me out before you go crazy so if you're if you're a seller demand's more important if you're if you're a customer supplies more important easy but if you're looking at the bias between the two it favors demand buyers always favor demand because if you have a product right say for instance you've got a jar chart mug let's do the jar jar mug and we've got people here who want to that no one wants to buy this jar jar mug it's completely irrelevant therefore it's worth zero dollars right it's pretty much worth i chuck it in the tip it's not worth anything but i mean look the jar jar mug's worth money let's be honest jar jar mark's worth some real money but if we look at demand if there's no supply but there's demand there then there's technically money ready to go so the bias falls inside of demand and that's how it is with supply and demand i therefore i'm there's my tech yes math demand is more important than supply that's it that's how we're moving with that so there's my uh this is the bias it's because the bias is in favor of demand when it comes to money anyway that's just uh let's just there's a there's our little look at supply and demand so it has to do with that i've actually been um as well someone said in yesterday's video like brian you look a little bit like uh tired i was actually watching all that um that gme stuff like the gamestop stuff because i studied finance and uh that was my major in university was studying finance with stocks and i looked at that stuff and that was crazy what was going on it all made perfect sense and all of it makes sense but it's crazy to see that in like 20 years of finance 20-something years nothing has really changed when it comes to finance it's still the same crap that goes on in the world so that's uh with the stonks anyway so we'll get back to this stuff so uh we got here cheap ryzen one gen or cheap zeons so cheap ooh see with me if you ask me if you come us we also got a donation we'll get back to that so i have uh waiting for two more for a 5950x on back order when do you think i will see it oh dude no idea on your back order that's like you'd have to contact the retailer i'd actually give the retailer a call and just say look when can i expect my cpus to come in just to right they should be able to give you a rough estimate too they should be able to say look mid-march or mid-february or something like that um but we'll get back to the first gen ryzen or the cheap xeons first gen ryzen's one of those things where like i think that was a stage right first gen ryzens and xeons are pretty similar like i'm gonna give them but like of course people want to go with ryzen because of the upgrade path right you get on ryzen first gen you've got all those a lot of those motherboards will be able to upgrade all the way up to 5000 series even some of the x370s which was impressive so i think the biases like a lot of people are going to say with ryzen first gen but xeons man they come in so cheap you look at the prices of xeons they perform so well at face value right you get a zeon a cheap even the aliexpress motherboards are proving to be actually solid buyers they've stepped it up a lot of those aliexpress boards i mean initially when they were coming out years ago you were like oh man i tried a heap of them years ago i tried them and i was like you might want to stay away from this yikes but now they're actually becoming solid and when you look at the price and what you're getting for the price the aliexpress xeons are actually and the motherboards associated with that are really good and the good thing about that is the ecc ddr um three registered works on a lot of those boards so the cheap xeons have you can't say one's better than the other because one's offering i think better price performance that's the xeons at face value then the others got better options in case you want to upgrade and do stuff like that you've got a bit more freedom there plus you've got newer instruction sets but you can go with the 4th gen haswell xeons and they offer phenomenal value as well so we have a donation here from mike the weirdo or mike the w3do three euro and they ask is 11th gen intel going to drop hyper threading except for the i9 just like in the past generation ah i do not think they're going to drop hyper threading men if they dropped hyper threading they'd be like is the dumbest move ever if they did that because they've already introduced it on the i5 and the i3 now and um to be honest they're going to be gaining i think they've got uh surprise like i think their revenue is already surprising people because they were meant to be like people were saying it's the end of intel because amd was doing so well but then like you're seeing the problems that going on uh tsmc7 nano is booked out people can't even buy an amd cpu now there's a problem with that so what we're seeing now is intel's got good value now they're like hey here's the choice if you want to buy a cpu they're doing very well they're doing and so intel's numbers you look at their revenue they're doing absolutely fine as a company and i think if people want to um crap on that then it's like bias only runs so far sooner or later people are always going to talk and they're going to talk with their wallets and so when amd starts charging a lot more for their 5000 series cpus people aren't stupid man people at the end of the day i mean there's going to be always die hard fanboys on either side or nvidia so three ways you can have nvidia die hard fanboys amd intel they're always going to exist doesn't matter which industry it doesn't you go to cars you're going to have nissan fan boys you have toyota fan boys you got me now i'm like a new school like outsider i'm a kia fan boy like believe it or not this is the crazy thing if you asked me 10 years ago brian would you become a kia fan boy i'd be like dude you're out of your mind are you serious like that would have never been a possibility in the back of my mind but lo and behold here we are 10 years later i'm a kia fanboy and that's and that's because of the stinger i'm a stinger fanboy but that's the thing right that's how quickly things change but don't be uh i'm just joking with the kia thing by the way like i'm not a fanboy i love the case thing but don't be a fanboy of things just look at the price and what you're getting and the value and if you're always getting value out of something go with that brand i mean when we look at cpus intel one thing intel does have is a very good track record of stability and you can't deny that man like out of like a lot of the pcs i've built intel cpus and their motherboards like i don't have problems with them and a lot of times if things come back to me it's never because the cpu put it that way so they make a good cpu intel i'll give them that uh we've got a five dollar donut here from stefan hart thank you so much and they say i got a 580 and a 5700 xt building a 1080p pc for daughter want to use 5700 xt in but the market is calling to sell microcenter close for upgrades thoughts are close for upgrades thoughts uh yeah i mean um you've see you've got an rx 580 if you've got an rx 580 just put that in your daughter's pc and flip the 5700 xt and just say look here's what we can do sit your daughter down and just say look this is how life is we can give you an rx 580 right now with the option you give her an option right you give her a call option and you say look this is a covered call and you can have the option to strike at a better gpu on a future date and we're talking 4k give a seller the works or you can say look you can have a better gpu now the 5700 xt choice is yours but i think right now the smart player would be to sell the 5700 xt recoup that overpriced money because look i'm not gonna if you guys want you know one thing i'll say to you guys if you can make a good dollar out of this stuff go do it right the market at the moment has been distorted and it's gone up in air because of crypto mining crypto mining is the big problem why the gravis cards aren't in stock and it's happening with new gpus which of course wants that this is the big thing about crypto right once the gpus get bought out on the newer side of things that demand is still there people still want to buy a graphics card so where does it go it goes to the used market and so that's why you're seeing the used gpus are now overpriced well because people just want a graphics card so so that's why i was trying to help you guys out in the last few videos i'm like look just use your rx 580 use your rx 570 for the time being and yeah if you've got one of these cards and you can sort of lean it out if you can stay lean for a little while then stay lean because i think what's happening now and this is one of the things that's happening in the market right now is is you look at what's going on and just a general broad approach is that people just aren't doing research and they're throwing money at things and that's what they call the late stage of a bubble believe it or not we could very well be in a big bubble right now this could be the tipping point of a bubble and so that's what happens at the end of a bubble people just throw money around without doing much research and it's um i think they call it the euphoria stage or something like that coupled with profit taking so if you can be on the side of that if you can be on the other side and take the profits take the profits brothers take the profits i always give you guys always sending that tech yes love someone's give me a virtual hug man yeah i'll give you a virtual hug here let's do a virtual hug and jar jar can join in as well let's do a virtual hug right now jar jar will join in look at that there's a mesa misa for real so if you guys can be on the other side of that profit-taking right sell your 5700 xt take that profit because when things go crashing down and they inevitably do when the money changes hands and all the sudden it fizzles out the dumb money isn't flowing around i call it the dumb money when the dumb money's not flowing around anymore you want to have the smart money money ready to buy up the deals so that's when you look at it trust your gut so that's why i've been staying there's another reason why i've been kind of like i saw it as a as a good opportunity in the last like month and a bit just to have a bit of a break because the hustling was just getting stupid right people are so hungry for deals right now i think this part time like i'm just predicting we're going into this month's part hunt we've got a another like 13 14 hours to do this parts um parts hunt but after we so after we jump off the live stream we're gonna go parts hunting but uh this past time it's gonna probably be one of the worst ever because the deals like there's gonna be deals right but it's not gonna be on graphics cards and i'm desperate for graphics cards and so that's what that's what's happening so uh 5700 xt's are going for 600 is that that's us are you talking us like if you're saying if that's us 50 5700 is gone for 600 us like please if that's usd are you is that united states dollars let's have a look like let's actually have a look here what hey we'll jump over and we'll see what's going on here uh 50 yeah 5700 xt is that 500 that's a 56 oh no that's 550 dollars for a 5600 xd wow all right yeah this is just stupid man this is absolute stupidity absolute stupidity oh there's one there well like you better like if you want a gravis card are currently unavailable oh i was like we did that during live stream we're like oh we found it we found a 5700 oh it's gone it's gone oh it's gone you still like that that's the good thing about live stream you can't fake that look at that only 10 in stock so i bet you someone saw that and they're like hit 10 order like 10 bang in the cart gone someone was someone snapped that up really quick um 25 donation from rc cnc command and conquer might uh crash soon they're talking about uh hold on what was that comment sorry i didn't i missed that one uh market will crash and we'll see a flood of graphics cards eventually that's what we're all that's what we hope to be patient just be patient remember like what you've if anything if we've seen anything right the people can if we all band together the power of the people is in is incredible so in other words if we all just lean out and starve a little bit here in terms of buying graphics cards you watch the prices will come down remember demand is the most important thing without demand we don't have a bias towards money and and profits and all that so anyway we'll get back to the chat here man so much easier looking at the chat when it was bigger so okay so that's uh that's what's going on gpu market if you see something this is exactly what's going on with this 400 5700 xt as soon as something comes up for msrp it's like hit get that in the cart all gone and this is the the craziest thing here is is that what i'm seeing is with these gpus is is like people are saying like this is what i heard from the comments as well people are saying things are on sale now things are on sale right this is on sale and it's like msrp it's like mate that's not a sale made that is not a sale that's just normal business and i've seen this is the thing right like because in marketing we learned about all the strategies that a lot of the companies will employ uh or deploy should i say these companies will um we'll get on to some of these questions too too like i've seen i'm seeing them there what would be the best uh new 30 series graphics card to pair with an overclock c700k 360 ti that's an easy one um uh yes man can you please unban me from your discord server uh telling me on a tight budget to consider xeons bear me for telling someone did the elder bogan tell you to ah man if that's like if that's not a troll i'm gonna get on the discord and i'll tell elder bogan to man what's he doing you don't ban people for recommending zeons on my discord server what the oh man okay so let's talk about marketing let's talk about one of these strategies that's used like i see all the studies that all the stuff that i got out of marketing was great like if you guys want to do university and you want a course that's going to help you see the world for what it is marketing is really good because you then get on the other side of the fence and you see what's going on with marketing so them saying a sale on msrp that's that's nothing new right you look at everyone loves a sale like the word sale there's a massive bias towards a discount and a sale that's why a lot of these um discount retailers do so well is because everything's always on sale you go to you go to buy a t-shirt and it's on sale it's down from forty dollars to twenty dollars that's a that's you're saving fifty percent right but then you look at the value of the t-shirt it's still 20 bucks how much does that t-shirt cost to make it's just you look at the actual price for what you're getting and if you start thinking like that if you start thinking what am i actually getting for my money then you'll start to see things more clearly because that's what's going on right now a lot of places it goes on everywhere right there's a bias towards this crap where you mark something up instead of this is the msrp and a lot of the times you don't even get told what msrps are on products uh we're actually kind of in ways we're blessed like blessed are not blessed because of the supply issue right now the graphics cards but say for instance let's go back to 2016 or 2017. we got told what an msrp was we can expect the price to come around there so it's good that we're at least getting the msrps because what's going on with a lot of industries you go to a restaurant you don't know what the msrp is for a chicken parmesan no one's ever set that msrp so what happens is with the restaurant is they'll say look we should be selling this meal for 20 bucks but let's mark it up to 30 dollars and then say look this week only we're selling the msrp of the uh chicken parmesan for 20 bucks there it is that's what happens that's that's your sale right so that is what goes on with sales a lot of the time it's there's a massive and i mean massive bias towards companies marking things up and then saying it's on sale because people see the word sale and especially now like what we said before there's a lot of dumb money flowing around people are just getting loans and getting free money and that's where it works best so you're going to see way more of a bias on sales everywhere you go now there's going to be a sale they said get ready for it all right in the next few months everything's going to be on sale apparently so just be aware of that but always take a look take a step back and say what am i actually getting for the money i'm outlaying so we've got stefan k here with the aussie five dollars thank you brother take a look at my 5700 xt she's the only one i got cheers for the content bro um where is your 5700 xt i have to see it so i uh i mean are you saying that you've taken a look at it that like if so yeah just sit back look at your graphics card and say to yourself i got one guys i got one as scarce as they are right now i got myself a graphics card let's have a look what else is out there at the moment like um 30 60 ti we'll we'll quickly move over and have a look let's have a look skis ah 30 60 tis none are available um we got here 11 like there you go guys you get a hdmi like you get for 1130 you get a hdmi cable included with that 3060 ti isn't that just amazing so um oh man what a market right now guys what a market damn so uh so we got to ask a good question as well just came in uh is there a huge difference between an rx 584 gigabyte and rx 580 a gigabyte no not like uh off the top of my head we're right here we can just check oh actually well before we quickly check we've got today's sponsors as well elgato wave 3 this is the microphone i've been using for all my live streams uh quickly i love this thing super good mic awesome microphone you don't like the good thing about this mic is you don't have to worry about tuning or anything it's just super easy to use has a pop filter built in has an attenuation filter built in too so you don't have to worry about clipping so it's absolutely awesome for live streaming and then we've got scd keys bringing in the windows 10 key use the promo code bftyc get that discount 14 windows 10 retail key even though they say oem in the title i checked out all the oem keys i bought came up as retail keys so that's when people say oh it's an oem key i don't know why they do that man i've asked them i'm like look these are actually retail keys all the ones i bought i bought heaps of them so there's that one there but uh let's get back now to uh what was i i was gonna look up something sorry i was gonna i was gonna look up ebay my bad and we got a donation here too from uh wicked fatigue uh five euro thank you so much brother uh what can we do about crypto miners trying to sell overused gpus with high mileage later on at the same price as gpus that were less heavily used really good question and i'm actually gonna have to make a video about this i think but talking in depth about it would be damn man like that's a hard one right you're gonna have to then see um it's hard to tell the only way you're really gonna tell is looking at the capacitors right and a lot of sellers aren't gonna show that on the photos so this time around like back in 2018 when the crypto market crashed it was a lot easier to i just say look a lot of these carts probably didn't have a lot of mileage on them because a lot of people i know for a fact especially in australia a lot of people bought up gravies cards and they were crypto mining on them for like literally like three months and then it went all bust so the mileage on them was not much but this time around it's a big problem it's a big problem because a lot of those gpus coming out now are gonna be like they've probably got a few months left on them because this is the thing even when the g there's a thing about crypto mining even when a gpu is on its way out it'll still work for crypto mining you just underclock the crap out of it and it'll still work but then when you go to revert back to stock levels that card is bust it doesn't work for gaming but it still works for crypto so i'm actually going to be surprised if you are buying these gpus this is the thing if you're going to be buying these rx 570s and 470s make sure you buy from somewhere where you've got some sort of guarantee like even if it's a three-month guarantee trust me that's a lot better than having no guarantee at all so there will be a you will if you're picking up deals locally on gpus once the next bus comes around which it will there'll be a bust on crypto um once the next bus comes around they will like you'll look around and you'll see these gpus and if you're checking them out locally make sure you check out the gpu and make sure it runs a stress test my my guess would be a quick one to load up would be combustor fur mark even just load up fur mark if it passes five minutes of fer mark the gpu is decent but that's going to be a big problem big problem going forward once this crypto thing goes all belly up then it's going to be a huge problem when all these cards get dumped on the market because a lot of those cards especially if they're rx 570s or rx 8 gigs and rx 488 gigs if they've been mined on for like two years straight man they don't have a lot of life left in them it's different to 2018 now it's completely different if those gpus have been spinning like all day every day something's gonna give ah yeah jar jar so someone commented jar jar binks mug yeah bro this is this is like this has been around for ages man jar jar [ __ ] smug brother it's just how it is so oh man so anyway guys we'll check out some cards right here check out what's going on ebay just ebay.com so we'll check it out um gtx 1080 ti is this going to be gold now gtx 1080 ti for the win 3 gaming 700 is that how much was it 1080 was it a 1080 ti what was the 1080 ti's msrp the 1080ti msrp ms msrp [Music] 6.99 and that was i was in 2000 wasn't that in 2016 four years ago oh man oh man this is bad it's like you guys they come get it guys four years later four years later come get it fellas yeah come get it fellas four years later that's right just you're getting a 10 discount under msrp for a car that's two generations old no three generations because we had the super we had the supers there damn i mean look at least at least we're getting a 500 here on a duke at least i think the duke was released later in the series as well juke wasn't one of the first ones released so at least this guy look at least you're overpaying for it but at least you're not overpaying for it as much as this guy right here oh man 1080 ti prices are bad like last like this is just look at this gpu market man 25 sold let's have a look we'll just quickly go sell a refurbished man people are like dude he's had to up his prices on his 1080 ti's because people were just buying them out at 550 us okay yeah the gpu market is completely upside down right now damn damn man it's a 1080 ti like it's it's ancient it's almost getting into retro let's check out a gtx 980 ti you always count you can always count on the gtx kind of 300 us like that's what i was saying about the g like the cheap gpus right right now when we look at the absolute premium on the cheaper gpus are the way to go right that's like get make sure you just get it's like 980 ti the problem with the 980 ti is that it's a heavy power consumption you're using card so the problem with it someone's like dude stop spamming the mushrooms someone keeps spamming mushrooms i'm just like the comments are getting held back i'm just going to keep on like this is all right i let one mushroom go but like you want to keep spamming mushrooms in chat like look at this dude he keeps spamming mushrooms in chat like come on man that is not mario stream this is a tech stream it's like you're gonna get banned bro stop spamming the mushrooms so anyway 90 ti so yeah 90 tis and 980s be very careful um be very careful because the mushroom guy oh man i guess in ways i don't know what he's trying to tell us there maybe like you should be like just on mushrooms in 2021 because the whole market's not going to make any sense i don't know like james skyont is there any is there any reason for spamming mushrooms i don't want to hear the logic behind it so anyway 980tis 980s just be careful okay because they're the cards where they were they had high power consumption and same with r9 290s and r9 like as we saw in the the latest can yes fix it the r9 290x was just gone skis so a lot of these high power consumption cards that came out they're gonna start hitting the deck soon they're like gonna start you know chucked out on the deck they're gonna be done so be very careful with that and so like even as much as i love a good used deal some of these used deals just you got to be careful with them tread lightly so that's kind of like we're in the crux now right when we started doing used parts in 2016 we were all for the used parts but now we move on to 2021 we've got to look back and say that's five years you know that's five years in that time you know you gotta understand that if a tech product gets used for five years straight there's a good chance that it might not be working for another five years so um yeah we just got uh boy i just bought two keys thank you for the code yeah no worries brother i had one on ebay yeah and then the ebay that's what i mean the ebay keys man that's yeah that's a different story that's why that's why a cdk sponsored the channel and i believe in them because i've tried their keys that's the thing i've tried their products and that's the thing about sponsors man whenever a sponsor comes on here i try the product i trial it out before i don't just get a sponsor and go yolo i get a sponsor and i'm like i'm going to try it out if it's crap take your sponsorship and leave i'm not interested in promoting that to my viewers but i'll see if i check the sponsor i'm like okay this checks out it's really good then it's good to go the next month um didn't tsmc address that supply issue intel won't be getting special treatment is what i've heard so far um it depends like i don't know man i heard tsmc were booked out like pre-booked for went from two months to six months if that's right like um you gotta remember like demand for tech products no one saw the covered thing like basically with the covert thing you can't just suddenly spin up a whole new silicon lab it takes a lot of time maybe for three nanometer they might have a lot more going on there but if intel's go on like preemptive and booking all the three nanometer out then that's the that's the argument right um this is it this is the report uh tsm's lead time for seven nanometer chips is still six months or more so like that's huge you know that's big news sorry that was that's an old article i don't know maybe something's changed since then um no this is from october okay it's forced to delay for two months so yeah like um these are i mean you just look at the rumors and then you look at what's going on right trust me trust me when i say this a 5600 x a 6 core like in australia like 500 bucks it's costing more than the previous generation 8 cause when that happens you've got a problem on your hands with supply because amd want to trust me when i say this amd really want to be selling 5 900 x's 5800 x's 5600 x's they want to sell those chips in the 59th they want to sell them as much as possible they're making good profit on them but they don't even have the quota to fill those price points so it tells you that supplies is bit messed up there we got chill times thanks for the 4.99 don't know what do you think about the new 11 900k heating the 98 degrees i love the channel and keep it up man it was going up thanks for the donation it's going up to 98 degrees oh damn we got a bit of a problem here man 98 degrees like that's the 9900k kind of all over again so i don't know what they're thinking is there but they're trying really hard to be the the gaming king like they really want to take that title out i think because intel so heavily connected to the streaming and the streamers they want streamers using their cpus because then that's massive influential uh territory that they can take over and so if everyone's using intel and their streamers right they're gonna have that that market there where oh my favorite you use a favorite guy uses an intel because it gets more fps and then they go to school they tell their buddies everyone's got to buy an intel cpu they they're not stupid they want to capitalize on that gaming market and they want the streamers to be using 11 900 ks at whatever cost and that cost is 98 degrees so like i mean at one stage i can i can tell why they're doing it but 98 degrees is a tech enthusiast really man that's not cutting it you know what i mean it's it's a joke like so i mean if that's true right so i'm gonna i mean i i will check out the the card for you and then we got uh no i noah uh duafler thanks for the five um pound donation and he asked hi i was overclocking my gpu my pc restarted during the port royal bench now my pc boots abnormally slow on my 980 pro how can i fix this 980 pro what's your 980 pro you like i gotta understand nowhere i've got to understand if your pc restarted and it's it's running really choppy after that either two things happened your overclocks are bad you're gonna have to reset the computer so reset the pc just reset it make sure it works fine again or if your pc randomly restarts out of nowhere it's rare but your windows can become corrupt i've seen this before oh it's 980 samsung pro okay so yeah that's what happens your windows can become corrupt so your 980 pro might have a corrupt install now i've seen that before as well um so yeah so you're basically saying that your ssd is running slow after it restart on a port royal bench so it could be yeah i just try i mean try um resetting your pc just without any overclocks if it's still running really bad pull up task manager make sure there's no apps on there or no programs that are juicing the drives or juicing anything and after that pretty much reinstall so yeah or it could have become as sir lance potts says it could have become a slower state drive that's that's the one thing your ssd but could it could have went from a solid state drive to a slow state drive that's a good one sometimes i love you guys in chat you know sometimes you're og you're original ah slower state drive anyway it's a good one all right so what are we looking at now chad what are we going we are we piping down the stream because it's crazy you guys just keep tuning in you keep tuning in and the more we stream the more views we get it's crazy so you guys are coming in here you want to pile on in and you want and you want to chat so what do we got here we got jacob how well will the up-and-coming rtx 30ti non-ti variant compared to an rtx 2080 or an rtx 2070 super they're going to want to have it be a 2070 super like just so my guess is it's just going to be the 2070 super that way they can use the the marketing right the marketing is going to be like 30 60 beats the previous generation 3070 super if it just beats the 2060 super people are gonna be scratching their heads and they're like well that's not that big of a news right so my guess is it's just gonna edge out a 2070 super there's my bet 3060 ti actually beat a 2080 super comfortably and so i've predicted it's around 20 to 25 percent faster than the 30 60 so that's 360 ti so you're probably looking at around a um you're probably looking around at 2070 super in performance plus you got 12 gigabytes of vram right there's the sale pitch you got eight uh four gigabytes more vram than the 2070 super ever had so and then you guys are saying it as well love the coffee mug jar jar did nothing wrong that's right jar jar didn't do anything wrong man he just came up through a time when everyone was edgy everyone was hating and they needed a target and jar jar was the target of that error now people are like damn i think we went a little bit too hard on jar jar especially i mean mind you mind you especially with the crap that's been coming out lately right you turn on the tv and you're like damn that judge you know that jar jar plot that was that was genius compared to what's coming out right now you're like you look bad damn that don't judge our plot i kind of miss that stuff man like i mean it's funny like i i mean look the mandalorian was good i liked the mandalorian that was that was solid but uh that's still only one series out of how many botched star wars retakes have we had so i mean mandalorian was good but like the movies themselves like uh seven eight and nine seriously like if it comes to re-watching those movies i'm nowhere to be found if someone's like oh we're going to watch episode 7 tonight are you in brian i'm going to be like yeah guys sorry just something's come up tonight um sorry guys i got something i just got to go and then yeah let him watch the um let them watch seven episode seven and do uh if people are doing marathons on seven eight nine man times have changed uh chill times 499.00 thank you so much brother uh yeah the cpu was running 98 on an entry level uh 360 all in one as well yikes it was boosted to 4.8 gigahertz and 250 watt they were testing it with ida 64 but still yeah it depends on the instruction sets i have heard of the new cpus using the avx-512 if we look at that actually if we go and check that out avx-512 [Music] if they're using avx-512 instruction this instruction is going to heat up a cpu so it depends on the the instruction sets used but if you're using these new instruction sets when you're doing the benchmarks i don't know right that's why this is why i got to check out the cpu right i can't say like without i can't say with certainty i can only comment and speculate on what is going on here but if it's using these newer instruction sets and the clocks are too high that'll make anything go to 100 degrees so be careful on what we see there and what's out there but definitely wait until like you get a full picture of it right what's the temperatures when it's gaming i think intel really care about with this cpu the most thing that they care about is what the what's the temps going to be like and what's the fps going to be like when our favorite streamer is gaming and when this and that um and uh saddar uh kapedia you asked one of the best questions i was gonna say that as well what is an entry-level 360 all-in-one cooler there's there's nothing entry level that's that's true you get some props there brother there's nothing entry-level about a 360 all in one man uh an entry level 120 all in one fair enough but yeah there's nothing entry level about a 360 all in one man that's like a that's a pretty premium purchase so yeah it's a level i love you guys so much eh you gotta call out you gotta um you gotta call out the uh the stuff when it's gone and then we've got mike sorry he's trying to run racism through as a slang word so like man come on guys this is a tech stream try to keep that stuff out so but your entry level 360 level uh 360 mil all in one love it you guys are awesome keep the jokes coming so have you seen the latest wan show uh not yet i'll have to what what happened is there any big news that happened on the latest wan show i'm sorry i've been watching stonks a bit too much and i've stopped like i researched it all i was like yep i i was staying up until like 5 00 a.m because uh funny thing is like if you guys didn't know i do trade um currencies now when you trade currencies you kind of know what goes on with the stock market the the trading and all the things involved in brokers it's all very similar so i was definitely watching that um with all the ah liners bought fifty thousand of gme oh wow okay so that's what's going on so he's joining in what price did he buy it at did he tell you what price he bought in 50 000 of gme um man that's a huge bet wow so put 50 000 in gme yeah so what's okay so the situation right now with gamestop do we want to talk about gamestop because i i i figured a lot of you guys would switch off if i started talking about finance that's kind of why i didn't want to talk about gme and also amc and stuff like that um moving frag thanks for the 5 donation brother uh we can even pull out some um uh okay so let's have a look here what's going on with gamestop okay so what is a hedge fund do you guys know what a hedge fund is because truly like do you know what hedge a hedge is when you want say for instance you've got ten thousand dollars coming in next month usd you want to convert that to australian dollars i'll give you a basic definition of what a hedge is you want to secure that price now so you lock in the opposite side of the transaction so you sell 10 000 usd right now because you've got 10 000 usd coming in you put in a contract to sell 10 000 usd that hedges the bet that locks in the price now so when you get that 10 000 usd you then close out your other trade that's what hedging is so now a hedge fund the definition of a hedge fund is that they're tracking they want to track their performance they're hedging against the market in the way it moves so basically you'll have a stock market that'll go up and down over time so a hedge fund's idea is to pick a stock that's going to win and then pick a stock that's going to lose so regardless of which way the market's moving they're always going to be winning if they're picking out the best stocks that are going to outperform versus the ones that are going to underperform in any given market at any given time so they're hedging against the movements in the markets themselves so take for example a hedge fund in the in the scene they would be buying amd stock and they'd be selling intel stock short selling intel stock that would be them hedging their way and saying look amd is going to outperform intel but tech doesn't matter which way the tech market moves we've secured in our bet and we're going to let out the market instead of letting the market test our performance we're going to let our analysis test the performance so now that was the traditional sense of a hedge fund right that was what it meant to be a hedge fund you picked out the best stock and you picked out the losers and you short sold the losers and you bought the best stock now game stop this is one this is where it all comes to gamestop and since that time i'm going to tell you guys since that time hedge funds hedge funds have become something different nowadays it's completely different right the original meaning of a hedge fund got lost in translation ever since the 1990s hedge funds had the pressure to compete with each other they got money from the index funds they got money from the banks they get money from rich investors their goal is to compete with one another and outperform each other so how do they do that man hedge funds they have so much freedom for instance a hedge fund is able to do things banks aren't able to do they're able to go set up surveys and then get biased results manipulate markets the list goes on on the dodgy hedge fund does they do so much dodgy stuff and how many hedge funds go to jail for it like literally none so what's happened with the latest and in japan they call them fundal and it's funny because japan's pretty much uh getting rid of hedge funds because of all the dirty stuff they pull but what they'll do a strategy that a hedge fund will do is they'll pretty much have a short position for a stock and what they'll do with that is they'll then have that short position and then they'll put out a news article and then they'll say oh this stocks are terrible it's going to perform terrible stock of tank then they buy the stock back and they've made the difference uh so also we've got a five dollar donation from all the work youtube uh just a quick one what's your opinion on the combo ryzen 5600 and 3080a uh yeah good combo brother uh quick opinion thanks for the five dollar nation that's a good one it's a good combo can't go wrong also get a 4k lead 120 hertz hdmi 2.1 really utilize that uh please talk about xeons we'll get to xeon soon but we'll quickly get to the crux of this a short sale basically you're borrowing stock from your broker and then you're selling the stock and then you buy it back cheaper now the short sale can go against you right and this is the thing the key term here and this is what's happening with gamestop the key thing here is that the broker this is the thing the broker has lent melvin capital and citadel and stuff like that they've lent them the stock so now the what people have to understand is that the whole system the whole thing is at risk now if the brokers go under there is going to be market turmoil and what a lot of people haven't spoke about with this whole situation is that the brokers are really at risk now because they and this is the thing if you guys go deep into finance you'll know that there is uh formulas and this is going to get advanced okay so this is going to get really advanced now because you guys want to talk about this stuff let's talk about it there's all formulas everything you do in finance there's a formula for it there's the uh formula for pricing up options there's formulas for how much someone can borrow how much margins available now hedge funds will typically use uh two to one leverage that's a safe hedge fund four to one leverage is considered risky extremely risky hedge fund eight to one leverage that's what the brokers will offer them now the uh broker will lend that stock to melvin capital for example now melvin capital's like yeah we're going short gamestop we're going short a heap of them and the the formula will state within three standard deviations the worst that could happen with game stock game stop stock is it'll go to sixty dollars a share right that's probably what they count something i'm giving you guys rough figures here just to understand the concept the worst that a gamestop stock will ever go to is sixty dollars now what you're seeing here with gamestop and i'm going to say this is an anomaly it should have never happened but it did and the reason it happened and this is the reason gamestop happened was because there was this stock was undervalued and people on reddit wall street bets they were saying this stock is good the news is just really hammering this stock when i think the new consoles are going to come out and the stock is going to perform better than what people are saying but then the hedge funds they came in and they said no this stock is terrible it's going to do bad yet they had short positions on it it was such a bias and it was so dirty that then reddit got together and they said all right you guys are going to play this game we're going to play this game in retaliation it was fire fights fire and what happened was with the the game of short selling it's a checkmate sum game whoever's short sold and is caught in that position and we're going to go on now to short squeeze gamma squeeze infinity squeeze it's a checkmate sum game where the hedge funds will go bust they've already and i tell you i've looked at the numbers there's a hedge fund that already went bust when those brokers shut off the ability to buy the stock you'll see that in amc and also gme at the same time there was this massive spike massive spike that's what happened they went bust there was hedge funds that had already gone bust now after the hedge fund goes bust that then the onus lo it goes on the broker the broker is now at risk of going broke so the broker has to say okay crap we've got this bad debt now that we we secured these loans for these hedge funds they've gone under we're gonna go under if we can't fix this problem we're done so now you've got this big problem that's gone past the hedge funds it's gone past their greedy and their bs and all that it's now gone to the brokers and so which broker i'd love to know which broker lent these hedge funds the stocks that's what i'd love to know i think robin hood's at the center of it but it goes much deeper than just hedge funds manipulated mug and there is so much dirty stuff that is going on but let's get on to the short squeeze all right so basically we'll explain what the short squeeze is going on here um the short squeeze happens when there's not uh basically they've run out of uh they can't cover the the sale right so they've shorted at four dollars the stock's gone up to forty dollars they've now got a one thousand uh percent return loss now remember that eight to one thing that we spoke about hedge funds are allowed to borrow eight to one margin but this is on their their game stop would have amounted to only a small portion of their short stop positions so when it goes up to 400 they've now gone bust on their whole capital all this stock they're gonna have to sell down all their stock and pay for that margin call and they're they're bossed the hedge funds are broke now and so that's what a short squeeze is they don't have the ability to cover the buy back the stock because there is no stock to buy back so the stock just keeps going up now there's another thing called a gamma squeeze and because people have put out and this is the this is the next thing right it goes more than just short selling the stock it goes on to i'm looking at the views here they keep going up so obviously you guys must love the explanation the the gamma squeeze is now another problem that's on the back of a short squeeze so it goes in hand in hand basically what happens in in the world of finance is people sell call options so there's two things we'll talk about what happens after we've done with this whole explanation we'll talk about what needs to happen in the market right and how you can fix this in the future but we've got the gamma squeeze now people sell call options they either sell covered calls where they own the stock and they'll sell call options because they're like okay i like steady returns on my money if things start going wild i'm happy to make a bit of profit and i'm also going to make continual returns on selling call options then there's naked call options if you sell a naked call option you don't own the stock but you're selling a call option which gives the person the right to buy a stock at a particular price so if the stock runs past that price here's say for instance game stop at forty dollars it was four dollars someone bought a call option at forty dollars it's now gone to eighty dollars they can then exercise that call option and profit forty dollars on the stock it's a lot more than that because every call option is a hundred shares so on every contract that they've made for a call option they can then make 40 say for instance 40 goes to 80. they can make 40 000 per contract it's it's ludicrous but that's a very that's the anomaly thing when they price up all these models they don't account for a bunch of guys on wall street bets banding together and saying no this is what we're sick of the market we're sick of this crap that goes on and all this pricing and modeling we're going to show them what's up and they've exposed the dark nature of short selling they've exposed the dark nature of um naked calls and so what happens with the gamma squeeze is when you've got enough people who have sold naked call options and people want to exercise those call options you've then got the sudden urge for people who sold those call options they have to buy the call up they have to buy the call the stock but the stock doesn't exist to buy everyone's bought up the stock it's running in low so low supply so that is shooting the price up as well then we've got those guys that originally can't cover their short bets it's going up as well so that leads on to the third thing and that's called the infinite squeeze the infinity squeeze is when you've got this you have to buy back the stock so whoever went bust which the hedge funds have gone bust now they've been margin called the brokers are now in a situation where they have to fight the infinity squeeze so it's just going up and up and up and up and up because there's no stock to buy so the price is going up infinity and that was a theory that wall street bets wanted to put to the test and their theory was right on the money the brokers shut down the ability to buy the stock they shut down the ability to buy the stock so wall street bets put into practice something in theory with the infinity squeeze that was that would have worked and it would have collapsed the brokers and that's the reason the brokers won't tell you this but the reason they they shut off from buying the stock was because the brokers would have went bust that's the reason and it would have collapsed it would have coll i'm telling you now it would have like probably collapsed like a lot more i don't even know what would have happened the the see the outcome from all that i would have no idea but basically it shows you exposes weaknesses because in the past people say well people say oh short squeeze is nothing new back in 2008 there was a company called well there is vw they make the cars right porsche basically short squeezed out hedge funds back in 2008 it was a real there was like rules were off the tables right so in 2008 everyone was just going at each other there was so many blame games but the retail investor got screwed in 2008 as well i got screwed the reason i haven't touched on stocks too much is because in 2008 i just came out of uni and all this theory that i learned i learned all this theory about stock markets and i was like cool man i'm going to buy some small cap stocks i'm going to have my little investment strategy and i went into the stock market in 2008 and i lost all my money and i remember my girlfriend at the time she just said look you didn't lose 30 grand you paid 30 grand to learn a tough lesson and i'll never forget that advice i got given because that's the truth i got a lesson i never touched stocks markets again i vowed never to touch stock market skin because they were so dirty you know what i got in 2008 you know the articles i got recommended as the stock market was crashing i was like cool there's a good opportunity to buy in i got recommended these five stocks that were going to do really well and then i bought them as an idiot i was like okay this looks pretty good i bought them like an idiot and three of the five stocks went broke they went bankrupt where was the accountability there who is accountable for these people recommending complete crap advice there's no accountability in this financial system no accountability the average guy ends up getting screwed time and time again and that's what that's what's going on in 2021 now the average guy at wall street bets is sick of getting screwed by the media the seeker getting screwed by the hedge funds they're sick of getting screwed period and i got screwed in 2008 i know the pain that's why i've been following this whole wall streets bets dilemma and i'm all for those people on reddit they're sick of the crap that goes on they're just sick of it and that's what there's no accountability yet if i like let's take a look if i sold you a car right if i'm a dealer and i sold you a car i can't sell you a dud i've got a warranty that there's regulations in place if i sell you a dud if you're recommending people buy stock then how is there no accountability for that if you're putting out articles saying this company's crap there's no accountability for anything now in the financial world it's just a free reign and so that's what the wall street bets exposed it and so that's that's what's going on and it's just such a crappy market that's out there right now and so what needs to happen now and this is what needs to happen in the financial markets stop the ability for people to sell naked calls how are people able to spell uh sell naked call options oh but the market needs it the market needs people to sell naked call options really if you don't own the stock why are you able to sell naked call options because of the potential right they need to impress something to stop that right now short selling how is it that a hedge fund is able to sell hedge funds or they all collab how are they able to short sell over a hundred percent of the floating stock available this is the problem with gamestop right now there's people taking out positions shorting stock they don't have and it's over a hundred percent of the float interest so of course there's going to be a short squeeze of course the system is going to go bust there should be limits on how much people can short sell it at least how are people able to sell so short sell so much of the stock and i know it's an integral part of hedge funds but hedge funds have been corrupt for ages and ages and here's some of the stories you know in 2009 um i went out on the town anyway like in japan it was funny in japan i met a couple of these guys that worked for a hedge fund they went out for a night and they told me that's where i go that's where they told me about all the how much hedge funds leverage how much hen um they told me like you know what happens at a hedge fund right they work the young guys there so hard they work them so hard promise them so much money in the future it's like the recruits come in they're doing all the dog work but they're actually doing all the brilliant work as too and there was a chick at a hedge fund this is what i heard she had been worked so hard that she grew a beard this chicken of hedge fund grew a beard so that's the kind of crap that goes on where's the regulations here man i'm pretty sure that like anyway the whole gamestop thing it's opened up a big loophole and there needs to be like you know that's what when when people say that someone needs to go to jail for this yeah it's not someone at wall street's bets it's someone at the brokers or someone at the hedge funds when they put out their articles and then you know this is the thing this is why i think gamestop went so high the person went out on twitter or something he was making a live stream saying why gamestop is going to go back down to 20 of course and then he's like touting reddit he's basically he's allowed to throw shade at a whole subreddit yet when they come back and throw shade at him it's suddenly a problem it's suddenly a problem so that's the whole situation right there it's a messy situation but i will say with the brokers one thing they're not telling you is that they will go broke over this whole ordeal if they allow people to keep buying up the gamestop stock and keep holding on to it so that's what's going to happen now you're going to see some serious crap go down and you know i've never seen anything like this before vw was an anomaly back in the past vw was hedge fund versus rich porsche it was rich man versus rich man this time around it's a whole community of pissed off people versus the hedge fund and the pissed off people aren't stopping they're not letting them tap out they're not saying look you've had enough they're just that's the anger what you're seeing with gamestop is people speaking they're angry and they're angry for all this crap that has gone on in the last 14 years everything that's gone on since 2007 people are just angry about it and no one's addressed it and as i said in the big short if you guys haven't seen the uh the big short movie if you guys haven't seen that movie at the end that what they said at the end of that movie was so true who was held accountable for the 2008 collapse i think one poor schmuck went to jail one guy some young dude went to jail over it all like what 2008 there should have been a lot more people accountable for that one person went to jail one person and that's what they said nothing was fixed from 2008 nothing was fixed and i think that anger is flowing through now in 2021. people don't forget man they don't move on they don't move on when you know and i feel like you know i don't i didn't move on i lost all my savings and i remember at the time i was so stressed i'd go to work i was working as an english teacher in japan and i'd go to work man and that 30 grand that was so much to me man it is so much to me that was all my hard work and i'd lost it all for some bs articles out there where no one held any accountability so there it is that's if you want to know about the game stop the whole ordeal with short squeeze infinite squeeze and gamma squeeze all the technicalities there but um moving frag donate five dollars thank you so much short selling was an instrument to correct hype stocks to reduce risk of bubble boss but since then it is abused for profit now is a problem yes that's exactly right traditionally a hedge fund traditionally a hedge fund was a good thing back in the day now since the 90s again since the 90s there's so much corruption and you know another thing that goes on i bet you guys haven't heard of this one before you know another thing that goes on with these companies hedge funds will pump the stock they'll buy into the stock they'll then run a heap of laundered money through the company earnings will suddenly get a massive surprise earnings season and then they'll sell the stock dump it on the market there's so much dodgy crap that goes on in this in the stock market it's not funny so that that's like that's what goes on and it's like you're like wow that crap goes on you're like yeah because the whole system's corrupt and it's like but when it's and that's a funny thing and when when it's suddenly corrupt in favor of the people it's suddenly a problem isn't it and that's what people are that's what people are angry about now they've exposed how the corruption of the system can work in their favor yet it's suddenly a problem when the money jar is starting spitting out and i've read some of the stories on the wall street bets forums it's so good so good that people are making some money off this gamestop stuff and then going donating nintendo switches to the local hospital or they're paying off their student funds and it's just funny hey because you know hedge funds could have really taken a different course of action over the last 10 years they could have really fixed things up but instead nope they just got as usual with the with the with the elite rich people they just got to keep on taking taking taking and the last stream i talked about it's funny i talked about that in the last stream i had that run in with that rtx 3090 with that that rich guy on the gold coast who gave me his word that he would buy my rtx 3090 if i secured him one and there was a little bit of profit in it for me sure i'm going around running around getting the graphics card and i had to secure it off off someone i knew up an ipswich and then he just turned around and like nah forget about it that's how these people operate man they don't care it's almost like they're emotionally void and that's the problem and at the end of the day a lot of you guys out there would be like i wish i was rich and sometimes you don't wish you were rich i honestly i don't think you would want to be rich because if you had that lack of eq that lack of emotion imagine the person you would be you probably couldn't imagine the person you would be if you had that lack of emotions that emotions is what makes us human it's what makes us people who care about one another and instead of going out and making a buck we'll go over and see our friend who's feeling down at the moment so that's don't worry the actions that make those people elite rich are the same actions that make them bad people there it is i mean i'm not saying that i'm not saying that all elite rich people are bad by the way but a lot of them say they um they lack a mo they do they they're just lacking emotions so um that's the rich elite so you know at least you guys a lot of you guys out there who are normal people you have a lot of emotion man that's good keep that keep that emotion it's what makes us and what makes life awesome at the end of the day don't worry so yeah of course not all rich people are emotionally void but a lot of them are man that's all i'm gonna say a lot of them just don't have the basics to understand how someone else is feeling because if they did they'd be using their money for a lot better purposes than they do that's all because at the end of the day do you want to live in a world where the streets are just rust like and i raised this question to some of the rich out there the real elite rich if you if you want to continue this trajectory of having a poor society if you want to continue that where i mean they should be paying their fair share of taxes and i'm like this is the thing a lot of the a lot of the elite pay a lot less taxes than you and i in percentage terms they'll pay like two three percent taxes and so the instead of paying more taxes there's this whole system that's rigged for the rich where we pay say 25 taxes they don't pay anywhere near that if they pay 25 taxes that's fair yet they don't and if they paid that society would be a lot better of a place so i think people instead of saying okay tax the rich more you don't have to do that you have to tax them 50 but tax and fair what we're paying in tax the rich should be paying in tax and so that's that's one thing i'm saying and then another thing is too i raise this question if you're elite and you're a rich person and one day your your child goes out and runs to these areas where the poor are and suddenly something happens whose fault is that you see so in ways it's always better if society as a whole benefits from prosperity than the elite few gaining a few more percentage points of prosperity so that's one thing i think that needs to be dropped out in the whole media right now is there's a lot of people are angry because they they see these people on social media and all this stuff on these rich billion dollar investments and million dollar yachts and they're sick of it and it all comes from at the end of the day it all comes from ripping off guys like you and me anyway that's all i've got to say about that topic it's a big one but damn we went down there we went down that rabbit hole but at the end of the day to the guys on wall street bets i'm going to send you guys a direct message keep doing what you're doing i absolutely love it and i've been up the last few nights watching it watching it all unfold and i admire it man keep up those diamond hands and keep going man but don't forget the things that make you who you are that's all it is yeah so anyway there it is guys we we covered all that one let's get back to some tech and then we'll close down this stream it ended up turning it ended up turning you guys want to talk about i didn't know linus good and kudos the linus for buying fifty thousand dollars worth of gme great prop up there that's that's awesome and a lot of people have been talking about that but um yeah there's a huge one man there's a huge one i gotta get on to uh i gotta get onto parts hunting now but uh uh thank you zulu warrior thank you brother for the five dollar singapore dollars the worst part of this is that the government will bail them out by printing more money for them and that will inevitably crash the economy yeah they're printing out like 2008 um in 2008 they got bailed out right that was at the expense of the taxpayer all their all their ridiculous like loose um gambling essentially loose gambling because that's what it was in hindsight all their loose gambling was paid for by the taxpayers and that has to be paid sooner or later right so it was it was sad right um yeah so it it's just be careful but that's what i say with stock markets this is why i haven't invested in stock markets i just invested in myself over the last few years and i couldn't be happier so at least i know what i'm getting at least i know that my hard-earned work is paying off in terms of what i get and what i do and so yeah like i just i don't generally touch the stonk the stonk market um i don't really believe in it anymore so it's just full of it's just full of like you know full of just corruption so yeah but also yeah make sure you hit that like button for us guys we're telling it we always tell it to you straight so so but that's it racer boy says the joke's on them i didn't pay taxes in 2008 no the joke is on you race boy because those taxes aren't from 2008 their accrued national debt which you will be paying for sooner or later that's that's that's the way the borrowing works so race boy you kind of did yourself up with that comment there bro so that's what happens when the borrowing happens you pay for it later that's why they say later generations pay for this crap and they will so yeah anyway guys that was the whole situation i'm glad i got that off my chest because in ways i had to vent about that i had to vent about the whole situation because um but just understand now that the hedge funds a lot of those hedge funds that did that short selling on gamestop are now bust and the brokers are trying to save themselves now they won't admit that because it's almost like che again wall street bets got onto a checkmate some game that's what it is it's checkmate you have the pieces out on the table wall street bets have checkmated wall street so a subreddit has checkmated the market and they can't handle it that's what's happened i think at one stage i actually looked through some of the things at one stage there was proof of the stock going up to 2 600 that's how nuts it went at one pin point 2 600 i think someone partially filled an order for that's the infinity squeeze that they're talking about that infinity squeeze that was happening that was actually happening in real time so good on you guys over at wall street bets but um at the end of the day i do at the end of the day i do technology around here i did um i did study uh finance and and marketing at university and it's funny to see that a lot of those theories that have been around for 20 years nothing has changed it's all like i was surprised actually when i did a lot of research in the last five days i was surprised to see that nothing has changed in the market it's still the same stuff that's going on from 20 years ago except now you've got high frequency trading which is a whole nother thing altogether where they um they're so fast between the different exchanges that they can get in the information before it hits another exchange and what not and then they can trade before that so high frequency traded is another problem in the market and there's there's so much crap that goes on but that's the probably the newest development in the last 20 years is um high frequency trading and then there's other ones as well but there was one guy in the uk who learned to gain the system and he got jailed i'm pretty sure there was one guy who learned to gain the system and he got jailed for it so again the system the system apparently is a free market until it's not and then someone goes to jail for it like so yeah anyway darth jar jar he salutes wall street bets as well but yeah the whole thing's it's a crooked market man so it was um it's sad but yeah you'll going forward i don't know like again i'm not going to give you guys investment advice but um i'm just hoping ethereum crashes because that's directly related to what we do here at tech yes city uh is in and this is the thing right when we look at crypto currencies now look at crypto the same thing crypto was meant to be fighting it was meant to be a system of payments crypto was meant to be a system of payments that couldn't be interrupted by government but now look at it it's getting regulated it's getting speculation all the same crap from wall street is carrying over now to cryptocurrency so cryptocurrency now has been infected it's just another market just another stock market really that's what cryptocurrency is becoming i mean institutions all the hedge funds that you guys hate are now investing in bitcoin and whatnot so yeah so in america there are 520 billionaires we've got a good comment here uh in america there are 520 billionaires and around 100 100 000 millionaires wow why do we in america allow a hundred thousand sociopaths to tell 200 million workers what to do why do we bend the knee to these sick yeah um it's and that's like that's a big problem at the moment man there's there's um i'd say like dude like there's difference between a millionaire and billionaire like a lot of millionaires out there like i've got some friends who are millionaires and they're lovely people man they just worked hard they worked hard a lot they made you know like they're not elite rich but they live comfortably and i think in in ways a lot of us people would love to have a comfortable life you know where we could maybe work a part-time job instead of a full you know have to work every day but a lot i think the dream for a lot of people is just to have a comfortable life so i'd say like a lot of millionaires aren't like you know a lot of millionaires would be there because they've worked hard and they haven't partaken in dodgy stuff but um billionaires like i mean yeah a lot of the billionaire club is is just they're too far from you know drawn from reality where they'll just screw people over so anyway anyway guys i love you guys a lot just know that tech yes city we're going to go forward go back to tech but yeah let's get on now 9400f versus the ryzen 3500x price point i'd say the 3500x would be coming in a lot cheaper i'd go for the 3500x i love that cpu when it was a hundred dollars when it was a hundred dollars i love the 3500x i don't know what the price is of the 3500x right now but um we'll get back so yeah that's the whole thing right the at the end of the day i love you guys so much with the with the finance i'm willing to talk finance if you guys want but at the end of the day it's a tech channel like i mean a lot of us here a lot of people will be watching and going i don't even like stocks i don't even want anything to do with it but it is an important thing to talk about so i'm guess i'm glad instead of making a dedicated video towards it i'd rather just talk about it in a live stream but yeah all the dodgy stuff that goes on in the stock market is just yeah it's incredible man it's incredible so um make a new channel okay uh make a new channel man if you guys want to make a finance channel i can make that so what i do personally i've got also marcus fish uh five dollar donation thanks so much brother just flipped my 60th pc today thanks for inspiring me brother awesome news man good stuff that's huge 60th pc nice man good stuff um that's crazy did i lose weight uh i guess in the last week last two weeks i probably have lost a bit of weight i i have been relaxing a little bit in the last two weeks as well uh so we're going to go full on after this we're going back february is going to be the month where i just turn it on again turning on the switch i have been gaming a little bit been relaxing a little bit but uh we got here i scored an rx 570 for 83 in the last crypto bus yeah like in the last crypto bus was great um hey bro house queensland queensland is amazing i love queensland if you're in australia come up to queensland have a holiday it's actually funny this summer has been a lot cooler than other summers so this summer has been amazing as well so let's have a look 3500x we'll get back to that 3500x question and see here's the 3500x it's 140 you know man this cpu it was coming out it was hitting at 110 like that's why i made that video like that was in 2019 i believe i made that video with the 3500x i wish i'd bought more 500 x's they were like going for 115 bucks 110 dollars and i remember and this is the funny thing at the time at the time people were telling me they were like brian 3 500 x for a hundred to 115 dollars is an absolute joke bro it's terrible get a ryzen 5 2 600. i mean people are buying this thing at 140 the 3500 exit 110 was amazing but we'll check out the to answer that question they're pretty similar price so like if you had to get one or the other and they were a similar price i would go for the 3500x because you've got the bias towards upgrading simple as that the 9400f you stuck on a 300 series mobo like complete dead end in terms of a motherboard so that's my advice there um so anyway uh do you know the about the biggest crowdfunding game star citizen oh man yeah i know about star citizen like yeah you guys probably don't want to hear my opinion on that but there was a guy who was very skeptical from the start and he copped a lot of crap for it but what he was saying makes sense and i mean i don't know what's like star citizen's taking way too long for that man that's like you know i i would say it's not a scam but i'd say like it was it was almost like a scam because the people managed the game so poorly that they never got anything out like i remember at the time in like 2013 or 2014 it was like everyone was talking about star citizen and i had my opinions on it i was like wow okay the demo looks great but when are you actually going to be able to play the game when is someone going to be able to play alpha and talk about the alpha like just an independent source you know because i remember when starcraft 2 was in development and i saw the alpha of that and i was like oh yeah the hype is real that was back in like 2008 or something i saw some alpha footage for starcraft 2 and i was like hyped i was super hyped so like if you're gonna hype a game up that ba that big show some alpha footage man show some alpha footage so we never got like back in the day we never really got alpha footage of star citizen and then like i just ever since then i lost track of it and i don't know how much um oh man starcraft 2 is awesome it's free to play as well now starcraft 2 they've really improved it like you can go play starcraft 2 for free and jump into the multiplayer it's actually kraken like i actually played it the other day and i realized man i need more starcraft 2 in my life it really helps me like in terms of you got to multitask right i got to get back into multitasking so um we'll see star citizen let's have a look here what what's going on with star citizen robot space industries uh about the game download oh they got an alpha out okay they got the star citizen alpha package out um okay star citizen development i mean wasn't the alpha meant to be out yeah so they funded the game in 2012. the alpha should have been out just saying by like 2015 2016. like i mean i don't know man okay star citizens 400 million dollars spent on star citizen development ah okay so board gamer he's like yo when are we getting this star citizen okay i'm gonna watch his video later on let's have a look where has the money gone all right that one that one's i'm gonna watch that later after stroll we can watch it together if you guys want um i don't know like i don't know about the copyright laws there so uh where has the money gone so uh so yeah 3500x is not multi-threaded uh the the 9400f isn't as well so i'd recommend like at these price points right i wonder how much on like actually on aliexpress how much can you get a 10 400 f for like i looked this up the other day [Music] if you guys are in the us and you want a cpu right now like this is where i was saying from yesterday's video yesterday's video 155 dollars for a 10 400 f like it doesn't even matter about the newer generation stuff you're getting a 6 core 12 threaded cpu that is actually good on power consumption this thing will use up that tdp so when you're gaming you're using under 65 watts this is a really good deal the 10 400 f is gonna easily if you're playing high resolution too if you're even if you're going for 4k like 4k oled 120 hertz this cpu will do fine with an rtx 3080 easy or a 6800 xt easy that's how good this cpu is so that's that's an amazing buy i would jump like if i was in the us i'm jumping on it in australia we got it for 220 aussie dollars i'm building 10 400 fpc's and 10 700 fpc's right now that's my metal even though even though i love the um the used stuff this stuff here is amazing a lot of people are saying how does it run with 2066 uh megahertz memory on a bh board runs really well i've done videos in the past about i've covered this exact topic uh the final roman i've covered this and what we've talked about here is with the 10400f get the 3200 megahertz memory right get this stuff right here and a lot of boards you can lock this stuff in right get this stuff here maybe rgb if you plan on reselling in the future just get the rgb stuff and then chuck that on and lock in cl 14 at 26.66 it's the easiest thing you'll ever do if you can lock in the xmp profiles you can quickly go to the timing tab and drop the timings down two notches and you'll get very good performance out of the 10400f on a budget motherboard like even on a h410 so like this is easily one of the okay that's 90 i was like this is gonna be amazing value pull it up it's like ninety dollars it's like come on stop buying up h410 motherboards fellas i think you guys are smart now you switched on i think you guys are switched on gigabyte okay 70 bucks okay fair enough 70 bucks i'll give gigabyte that it's like yeah it's it's right you should be able to get at h410 for like 55 dollars that's h310 don't buy that that's h310 make sure you get an h410 if you're gonna go with the 10400 f okay so people are really you guys are smart you're realizing the metal intel has the cpus they can supply the cpus but they can't the motherboard manufacturers are like uh-oh intel's really ramping up production of these 14 nanometer cpus i guess that's one good thing hey we should be thankful for intel with their 14 nanometer at least in the fact that they still got cpus available on the market that's um that's actually i think maybe that's one like unexpected good thing that came out of 14 nanometer the fact that we can still buy a cpu because this motherboard demand this motherboard demand right here come on an asrock h410 it's like bottom of the barrel motherboard it'll do the job like i've used this motherboard it's fine but it should be worth like 55 it shouldn't be worth 90 and there's only one left in stock i mean 65 here on new offers but again i think isn't that you like buying from like some store that you've never heard of before no [ __ ] by amazon okay so you can get one for 65 bucks the asrock h410 you're paying a 10 premium but you are saving big time on the cpu so that is um that's actually a good deal right now so that's a really good deal uh we gotta ask a question here do you think the ryzen 5 3600 for 200 is still a decent buy in 2021 uh yeah sure let's check out the ryzen 5 3600 uh that's 200 so again you're paying 45 more dollars let's take that into account that you're paying 45 dollars more than that over the 10-400 f you're still getting in games in games i think the 3600 is a little bit better in productivity but in games you're going to be getting very similar performance out of these two cpus and you can also overclock the ryzen 5 3600 so 50 45 extra it's a little bit like i'd say if it was about 20 extra go for the 3600 but the 10400 f at 155 bucks is definitely kicking it um we can check out a320 motherboard prices because you can believe it or not 60 bucks okay it's a bit of a toss up here at the moment if that's ryzen 3000 ready that's not a bad combo to look at as well 60 bucks for the a320 ryzen 5 3600 and you'll be able to lock in 3200 megahertz on that so it's it's actually they're both they're both the players right now so 10 400 f if you can get a really cheap motherboard is definitely the that would be the play that i'd be going for but the motherboards on the h410s have gone up you might even be able to buy a cheap z490 c490 nope can't buy a cheap one of them spoke too soon so there it is h410 or an a320 plus a ryzen 5 3600 or 10 400 f that's the play right now i think the ryzen 3 3100 is sold out nope that's gone up to 180 it's almost as much as the 3600 that's the logic a usually more cores has a premium but not today fellas less cause has a premium so anyhow guys i'll um we're going to wind down the chat now because i actually got to get this parts hunt started otherwise i won't get a part-time out this month and that's a ritual dude parts hunting like dude parts hunting is a ritual here at techy sc use parts hunting let's go see what we can find here we'll answer a few more questions we'll finish off the stream is a xeon e3 1280 plus a mobo for a hundred bucks a good deal e3 1280 oh what is that cpu man you hit me with a curveball here e3 1280. what is the e throw okay yeah it looks alright okay four cause eight threads 3.6 gigahertz that looks okay e3 12 yeah okay e3 1280 and then mobo yes that is a pretty good deal that is solid okay so we'll wind it down we'll wind it down here james hardwood thanks for the five bucks bro do you think ddr5 in 12th gen will jen will gen will change will uh too many wills here man i'm getting confused i just read this message it's like will will will will change the mother change of integrated graphics by relieving the memory bandwidth bottleneck i flip all the time yeah so that's the the integrated graphics is bottlenecked by the ddr4 exactly and that's why i said in a previous video when we looked at integrated graphics don't expect the reason why amd didn't release the new rdna 2 on apus is because there's no point the ddr4 memory is the bottleneck they're not like you're going to be putting in an rdna 2 gpu and you're going to be like people are going to be reviewing it then they're going to be saying oh our dna 2 sucks on the apu's when it's not the case the rdna 2 is good it's just it needs ddr5 and even then ddr5 is probably not going to alleviate the problem integrated graphics has been checkmated by the speeds of the ddr5 in the sense that you need that fast memory it gets to a stage where you just need the fast memory period and you're not getting it on integrated graphics so there's that you know that's why the consoles went with the designs that they went with consoles had to go with uh gddr6 so anyway there's that there's that fellas we are going to wind down the stream right now thank you all for tuning in so much i love each and every one of you guys i've got some last minute james harwood thanks for the two dollars again so do you don't keep me on live stream by donating that's a that's cruel i'm gonna go i'll get it onto parts honey or i can buy a dab man of beer have two dollars for dealing with that mess of a message okay thanks man uh so yeah you guys awesome and i'll uh tech yes me please i'll give you guys all love hearts don't forget to hit the like button make sure you drop a comment after the live stream too let's get this video trending a

love each and every one of you guys and i'll catch you in the parts hunt very soon so stay tuned get ready we gotta use parts hunt that's it man that's it stay poor bro stay hungry say fred brown stay poor stay hungry man and you know metabolism is a good thing for your health there you go you wonder why the yes man stay a bit thin and a bit trim because that yes man want to live as long as dead

change because people are getting sick and tired of crap anyway catch you guys next time tune in for the used parts hunt that's coming soon and we'll go hunting let's get it on peace out for now i gotta wait two seconds as well so peace out for now bye
