in yesterday's video we took a look at the core i9 11900k from intel this was their new flagship and unfortunately there wasn't much flagship about it however they did release another cpu on the stack that is a lot better especially when we compare it to the 11900k and that is the i5 11600k with six cores 12 threads it's only two cores and four threads behind its big brother but at that same time it's a lot cheaper literally coming in at under half the price and still being overclockable and still having all the perks the 11900k does to the point where it does have the unlocked gear ratios in the motherboard bios and with a little bit of tinkering i got mine to 4.9 gigahertz however in today's comparison we're going to be throwing in two more cpus into the equation that of course is amd's counterpart the ryzen 5 5600x with his six cores 12 threads and its ability to overclock this was one that made the rounds as being amd's value gaming champion when that was released and then we got the one that's most interesting to me personally and i think it's honestly one of the best value cpus even before this 11th gen launch and even after this 11th gen launch and that is the 10700f this cpu is packing eight cores 16 threads and at current street pricing you can get this cpu for cheaper than both the 11600k and also the ryzen 5 5600x so let's get through all those gaming numbers productivity numbers and give you the verdict on the 11600k versus the 5600x versus the 10 700 f let's get it on if you want to get rid of this annoying activate windows message then today's video sponsor scdkeys has you covered for as little as 12 us dollars after you enter that coupon code bftyc you can cop yourself a legit single end user license today links in description below kick starting off this round robin of gaming benchmarks we had f1 2020 where the russian fire 5600 is coming out on top here out of these two six cores and then the 10700 f scoring a very respectable score here and i'm noticing the one percent and 0.1 percent lows where i'm going to be paying attention to these because we're testing this with an rtx 3090 and we've also got 32 gigabytes of ram clocked at 3 600 megahertz across all three different setups here using the same memory so it's pretty much apples to apples on these numbers that you're seeing here as well as all the benchmarking it's done on the same spot and moving over now to dota 2 this is where the 10700 f performed pretty much the same as the 11 600k very close to that of the ryzen 5 5600 x the one to fortnite showed the dx12 competitive settings at 1080p showed that the 5600x was coming out on top and then the 11 600k again followed by the 10 700 f on the call of duty showed the same scenario here as fortnite with the ryzen 5 5600 yet again coming out on top and the last game that we're going to pull up here is cs go where we had the results falling like the rest of these results here straight in tandem with those cpus and not only their clock speeds but also their ipc but i will state one thing here and that is the 10700 10700f while it's gaming it's only using us especially if you look at the cs go benchmark it's only using around 40 to 50 watts and this is going to make an argument for the 10700 f here where we start to go on to the productivity scores where in v-ray we had a victory here for the 10-700 f coming out with an impressive 12.994 and then onto 7-zip it was another victory for the 10-700 f scoring 72 158 and 82 168 over the 11 600 k and then on to geekbench 5 the single core score here was behind that of both the six cores but the multi-core score here did come out on top by a big margin they're looking at geekbench five with its multi-core test i do relate this to value because it does test a lot of different cases through one benchmark and so i'm able to get a dollar per point score here and here's where the 10-700 f we pull up the value chart this is pretty much getting some real chart topping numbers here in raw value so that's my argument for the 10700f though moving on to the corona benchmark the 10700 f did come out on top here by a few seconds scoring one minute and 50. though moving on to cinebench it was a similar scenario except for the single core score which this two six cores did do a better job since they do have that maximum boost frequency so summing up all those benchmarks with the gaming and the productivity numbers the 11600k is sitting a lot better on the pedestal than the 11900k is the 1100k just really is making no sense and in fact it's letting intel show that the enthusiast market that they're in ways i feel like they don't care about enthusiasts when they're just making an i7 an i9 but then changing a gear ratio around and giving you a slightly better bin but then calling it an i9 when it really is a traditional i7 it's got eight core 16 threads especially since it has two less cores and four less threads than the previous flagship mainstream desktop cpu the 10900k and the thing is the 10900k is coming in at much cheaper street pricing than the 11900k but rant aside with the 11900k the 11600k is going to be a decent cpu if you have a good motherboard keep in mind you will need a solid z590 because when i tested this cpu the power consumption out of the box was around 160 watts and then when i overclocked it to 4.9 gigahertz the power consumption went up to nearly 200 watts it was in the 190s so it does demand quite a substantial amount of power especially for a 6 core 12 thread it makes a much better value proposition for someone who wants to go with the z590 route and maybe in your country amd processors might be out of stock and this is the only available option then this is going to be a decent buy you're not going to be getting ripped off like i feel you're getting ripped off on the 11900k and it seems like in 2021 that is the theme going around it's just there's this general like ripoff culture everywhere you got to be careful if you look left you might get ripped off you look right you might get ripped off but don't worry if you're staying tuned to tech yes city i'm always going to be trying to point you in the right direction so you're not getting ripped off and when i look at it the 11600k sure it's great but the 10700f in my opinion is one of the best value cpus you can get right now not only using less power when you're using it for productivity but you're also using less power when it comes to gaming you also get an included cooler and you can use a cheaper z490 motherboard and get all that extra stuff that you would get from a z motherboard like the extra memory overclocking as we saw here today we've got the memory to 3600 megahertz however you will lose pcie 4. you don't get pcie 4.0 on the 10700f but you will get it on the 11600k and it will work just as good as it would on 11 900k so basically if you need pca 4.0 and you want a decent value for money cpu 11 600k is going to bring that and also if you want sort of a even better value for money proposition which i feel most people will be able to take advantage of 10700f is going to be an option for you and as for the 5600x and look i don't have the box i'm not one of those guys who hoards boxes i just chuck them out pretty much after a few months but the 5600x it's going to be that choice for someone who really wants to get the most fps in a lot of games and they can manually overclock now if you have the extra money i've said this in the past and you want the best gaming experience out of the box i feel that's the 5800x but you will be paying a premium for that cpu but in terms of these two six core cpus and the eight core f cpu i feel like these pack a much better value proposition for the average gamer and also the person who wants to get more productivity for their dollar however i will say one thing as well and that is a 10400 f when it came back to that review i gave that a positive review i thought that was a solid cpu and a lot of people came on that review and they were beating it down but if we look at the pricing now the street pricing of a 10 400 f that thing's also coming in at a bargain so always look at the price for what you're getting and i feel like going into the rest of this year those fcpus are going to be bringing the value hard so when i do get the 11700f and also the 11400 fn i will take a look at those cpus for you guys so make sure you stay tuned and you want to see those videos at the moment to drop hit the sub button ring the bell but in terms of this review here today i hope you guys enjoyed it if you did be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comments section below what you think of the three cpus in today's comparison which one would you go for personally love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here it comes from corrupted data and they ask can you please test this with dual xeons i wonder if it will benefit my dual e5 2667 v2s and they're talking about the windows custom iso that we made here at tell your city put the link for that video up here and also put the link in the description below for you guys anything that we talked about today so basically this version windows cuts out the crap so it will help the dual xeons but i don't imagine it will help it any more than it helped those cpus when we did the gaming comparison i'll put the link to that video up there so basically to save you guys time yes it's a good thing to have these custom versions of windows especially if you're playing games but in terms of giving you a magic answer for more fps it's probably not going to do that it's going to help with a smoother gaming experience and also a better user experience in windows hope that answers that question and without aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
