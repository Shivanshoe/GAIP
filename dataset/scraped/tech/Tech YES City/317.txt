you'll notice there's a lot of cuts here
and so i'll plow through that quickly at x2 x4 speeds stop start stop start
and you'll notice also the cpu in this regard it's very
up and down this is where you need latency
on a cpu it's very important for snapping quickly between different
actions when you're doing this kind of work over the last five years here at tech
yes city i've gone from using my main rig
which has had a 4 core 8 threaded cpu all the way up to 32
cores 64 threads and i love just trying different rigs
to see how they handle 4k video editing my previous rig
was an x299 system and actually just recently i switched over to a 10900k
however here today i'm now going to be switching over to a 3950x
because i love experimenting what the latest and greatest can do
for a workflow not just for me but also when i'm recommending pcs to other
people i get an idea of the strengths and
weaknesses because i'm going to say one thing straight up and that is that
there's no magical cpu that can do everything the best it just
doesn't exist there's different types of parts
for different people with different needs
hence i guess why there's so many different product skus out there more
than there has ever been in the history of technology and i guess
the reason for that is there's much more users with much more
peculiar needs so over the last few years
my personal needs out of a cpu i need something that's
lightning snappy i need it to be quick when i'm doing a lot of actions per
minute cutting footage editing and then throwing footage over
the top of that i want something that's really responsive
something that can quickly drop clips in and so in relation to this one need
in particular it's not always about more cause more threads because the more
cores and more threads you add to a cpu you are actually adding latency anyhow
in today's video we're going with the 3950x 16 cores 32 threads
i feel for me personally this is going to give me the best balance between
calls and threads versus latency so we will talk a little
bit about that later once we give this rig a trial run
then for other parts we're going with the 280x from corsair great small case
as well as having good airflow and good build quality then for the cooler we're
going with the h115i pro xt series this is similar to the rgb
platinum except you're getting a newer pump head
and you minus the rgb on the fans themselves then for the
drive gen 4 pcie x4 nvme one terabyte ssd i want to utilize
what pci gen 4 has to offer since amd is currently offering this and intel's not
i feel like it could help me for video editing for the motherboard we're going
with the b550 phantom gaming itx from asrock i recently reviewed this
motherboard i really liked the numbers it was
putting out not only that it boosts all these 16 cores out of the box over 4
gigahertz which is going to be great for me for video editing considering
that is a stable 24 7 4 gigahertz that i can reliably use
when i'm video editing though i know some of you guys out there will be
scratching your heads like why are you using a mini itx board
in a micro atx case and to answer that question straight up i'm going down a
tangent of latency again i do go down these tangents here at
techya city because i like to just gain my own knowledge and gain my
own experience with things so i can make recommendations off that
and i feel like mini itx all other things equal is going to give
you the best latency first bigger motherboards i've actually
seen this in tests in the past where i've tested a320 budget boards and
because they've been so small they've actually given out slightly
better numbers than their bigger atx counterparts and because we're using
them in the itx motherboard we only get two slots of memory available so we're
going with two 32 gigabyte dimms of corsair vengeance pro rgb memory and
this is clocked at 3 000 megahertz xmp now when you're going with 64 gigabytes
this much memory will start to put a strain
on the imc so if we're going with a 16 gigabyte kit for example
we could easily put 4 400 megahertz xmps on this thing
and it'd be fine but because we're going with 32 gigabyte dimms we do have to be
careful with those xmp profiles though the last components in this build
rtx 2080 ti i need this for video editing
because adobe now supports rtx studio driver set
and that does give you a massive boost in the premiere pros especially in final
render times but also gpu accelerated effects and everything else that's gpu
accelerated within premiere pro itself you are going to be gaining a lot by
using an nvidia rtx card where they have done
a lot of work on the driver set and the last piece is the power supply we're
going with the sf 750 small form factor power supply even though this fits a
standard atx power supply i've just got this lying around the
studio which i pulled apart my whole travel pc because
let's face it with the world situation right now i don't know when
uh traveling is going to be the restrictions on travel is going to be
lifted so i wise we'll make use of parts instead
of them collecting dust however with that aside let's get this
thing built and show you guys all the tuning
and also first impressions after i edit some videos
on this thing to see how it goes [Music] so
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Music] so now cut the first bit of this video
the voice work and you'll notice there is a lot of cuts
here and that's because i don't script my videos like i
very rarely do a scripted video here at tech yes city
and so this is what it's going to look like because you're going to make a few
mistakes when you've got absolutely no script to go off
but at least that being said i like to give you guys the videos
straight from the heart and so that's what you're getting here all the time
but you'll notice with the cpu utilization
here it's really taking the cpu through all
these twists and turns it's not just all cores utilized all the
time when you're editing videos and so for
other youtubers they might have a different workflow that's great for them
but what you'll notice here from the cpu utilization on performance manager
is that i'm still using quite a few calls and threads
but because i'm snapping and doing so many actions at once
i need that initial latency there as well because i'm going from sometimes
x2 to x4 speeds monitoring the voice work back and forth
so this is very important to have that cpu
that's not only fast but i guess can turn the corners if we're going to go
for an analogy of a car here we've got to have a car that's not too
heavy and can still take the corners fine but at the end of the day still has
the acceleration and speed to get to the finish line quickly but
now we'll get on to editing the build montage footage for you guys and this is
a different process to the previous process we just did here
with the voice work because we're going to be adding so many
different layers on we actually need to utilize
now a bit more memory bandwidth than we did before
so how's the 3950x going to pass with first impressions
let's give it a go [Music] [Music]
so here's the next stage in a typical edit if i especially if i'm doing a pc
build now we've got the montage right here
and this is where there's many different layers and i'll show you how
the cpu is bouncing up and down here in utilization
where this thing is starting to get worked this 3950x
it's getting worked now this is probably sometimes this is the most strenuous
part of an edit especially if we're dropping in
effects color inverts and whatnot and i do notice there is a little bit of
a struggle but that does also happen on intel as
well i can push this cpus even like the 7980xe overclocked to 4.4
or core 10 900k running at 5 gigahertz these
cpus i can bring them to their knees in this part and i'm happy to say here
this is easily and i mean easily the best experience i've had on
an amd cpu it's in a different league to second and first gen cpus that i've
brought through and tried to run as my main rig and this
is one of those things where we'll move over to a conclusion soon and we'll talk
about this whole process first impressions already but i'm
definitely going to be staying on this because
it's really nice like it's good to see amd are competing with
intel with third gen like really competing at the fine details on the
fine line and this is really impressive so far
like me smashing through my workflow i noticed these things and that's why in
the past i went from an 8 core xeon for example which was overclocked
to the 18 core and that was my main rig for quite some time here at the channel
but now with the 10th gen going at 10 cores 20 threads being ring boss
versus that mesh architecture and now amd with the third gen
i want to try these things out at the same time and see
which is really the best but anyway with this piece aside
let's sit down and talk about this rig and everything going forward
with the 3950x 100 organic 3950x
that is what this experience is so far first impressions
that first impressions do last and i do say like like i said in the montage
footage before the first and second gen ryzen i feel
weren't anywhere near as good as the 3950x
experience i've had here today and the reason i say that is because
people have said okay you've got to do this tweak you've got to do this you've
got to do that and basically all i've done here is
installed amd's chipset drivers i've installed the basis and the
baseline stuff the nvidia drivers and this is what i did on the previous
amd systems and this is a big difference i haven't
disabled threaded optimization or anything like that people are telling me
oh you've got to disable threaded optimization in the nvidia drivers
i haven't done that and i'm getting a much better experience now over the
coming months i'm going to try all these tweaks that
people recommend and see how they apply to my setup and
my workflow and that's the big thing when i come
back and report to you guys in a few months time what it's been like
on this system right here i'm gonna come back
and say okay this tweak made a difference or it didn't make a
difference but bottom line is when it comes to
comparing apples to apples to the previous amd systems i've used
3950x is awesome and i do say amd systems you probably notice why
i've said amd systems because the intel systems are doing
very well on this workflow too the 10900k
and the 7980xc i had before that they were really good and the 3950x is in
that league that's how i feel that's how good this thing is
and that's a great thing because when people come to me i don't
like there's no fanboy arguments around here i do not
care one bit about the fanboys because when when it comes down to it
i'm building people pcs locally here or people asking me for
recommendations i want to give them the right recommendation
and that's what it's all about giving people the right recommendation whether
it's value for money and in that case i do recommend ryzen a lot
but now when it comes to video editing i'm going to be telling people you might
want to consider the 3950x because it's really good especially if
you want the most for your dollar it's coming and it's
comparing to the 10 900k it's comparing to the 798xe now i won't know this
recommendation for another couple of months once i've given it a full test
drive but there are things that i'm noticing
is a lot better already anyhow going forward from here latency
it's a real thing it's a big thing for me personally anyway i don't know
about other people and their workflows but i feel like this is one area amd has
improved a lot on and i'm hoping with zen 3 which i know
will get better performance out of but i'm also hoping they improve the latency
even more to make them just top dog in every
single category because that's what as a tech enthusiast that's
what i want personally and i know a lot of you people out there
you're just like me especially the guys who have subscribed over the years you
don't care about the brand name you just want the best experience and
you want the best product especially for the money
and so this one here is definitely hitting hard
in terms of being a workstation beast of a cpu anyway with that aside do let
us know in the comment section below did you
enjoy this video and i know there's not any gaming
figures or any gaming benchmarks in today's video but
this was more of a personal video where i'm showing you guys what i actually do
with the computer most the time and i actually don't play
games a whole lot around here besides benchmarking even then i'm not
playing the games i'm just hitting the benchmark start
benchmark stop very repetitive very boring compared to the real thing
and the thing is you can't do the real thing
because it's then not a equal comparison so that's my gaming life at the moment
hopefully this 3950x will free up more time so i can play
some more games anyways don't forget to hit that like
button also if you're a hater don't forget to hit the dislike button all
helps with engagement and if you've stayed this far and you're
enjoying the content as always and you want to see the moment it drops hit the
sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you guys
in the next tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
