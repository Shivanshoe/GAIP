OLED is undoubtedly the best screen technology in the market right now though if you want the best of the best without blowing a house deposit what do you get? Well right here on the table we've got the latest lg cx series tv and i've expressed how much i enjoy the 55 inch cx and even the b7 that i use as my main monitors yes monitors plural i have two of them that i use every day and well turns out lg notices and they've decided to send out their 77-inch cx which is what i've got on the table next to me right here this tv is simply amazing but i'm going to tell you why you're missing out if you're a gamer and are PC gaming without an oled [Music] for gamers first of all 120hz 4k is ridiculously good to look at especially if you've been on 60hz your entire life doesn't matter if you're a casual couch gamer or a competitive fps gamer this battle is perfect for everyone it has variable refresh rate for xbox series freesync premium amd gpus and g-sync for nvidia gamers it also has low latency mode in the form of instant game response and the game picture mode which really makes input lag under 10 milliseconds which is absolutely fine for pushing a panel with over 8 million pixels for every frame the 10 bit panel provides an incredible hdr experience and it also means if you turn on hdr in windows you won't get a washed out mess and speaking of windows i know what you're all thinking you've probably even typed it in the comments before watching what about what about the burning what about burning well with screen shift enabled on my personal oleds and without having the taskbar disappear using a moving background the burn-in is non-existent after two years usage on one monitor and three months on the other but quickly if you are considering picking up this tv here are a few of the key selling points that you'd want to know on the hdr front the cx has support for dolby vision hdr 10 and hlg which is what youtube natively prefers but more importantly will be useful if broadcast tv ever switches to hdr content in terms of connectivity we have four hdmi ports which are all capable of 4k at 120 hertz one of which supports the latest er standard which means that you can not only run a soundbar or amplifier through hdmi but it can also pass through uncompressed surround sound high bitrate audio as well as dts x and dolby atmos object-based 3d audio then built-in wi-fi rj45 toslink 3.5 millimeter audio aux and video composite in and three usb ports and if smart devices tickle your fancy then you have either the choice of google assistant or alexa built straight into the remote or if you're not into voice assistant then it also has airplay and chromecast built in and of course you can use the lg tv plus app if you've lost your remote or if your phone is just easier to reach the latest web os 5.0 has support for your standard apps such as netflix spotify apple tv and more the built-in wi-fi performance is also quite good being able to stream 4k content without stutters and you can use the built-in bluetooth to connect headphones for a silent watching experience the cx model in particular also features the gen 3 alpha 9 ai imaging processor offering a large range of adjustments to choose from whether it's the preference for color accuracy calibration or it's a better upscaled image from 1080p to 4k and speaking of calibration oled is definitely the way to go for anyone working on color critical work like photo and video editors and seeing as i use two oleds every day i'm going to highly recommend it for professionals and gamers alike however all that previous information was just the entree if you're interested in getting an oled let's get into the deep down technical information or should i say the oled with the main course on the side so oled it stands for organic light emitting diode yes still an led but it differs greatly from traditional white leds in the back of gaming monitors for oled each individual pixel emits its own backlight of color formed from organic more power efficient red green or blue light giving the user the truest form of hdr and infinite contrast ratios though this is far from the only benefits your eyes will receive typically older led technology has used blue leds with yellow phosphor layers to provide an artificial white light that is then passed through an additional polarizer liquid crystal and then a color filter and another polarizer before the light source even reaches your eyes so not only is the blue light source literally the worst source of light for your eyes seeing detail where the human eye is actually programmed to see detail through green and red spectrums but also in relation to traditional led monitors there is an additional four layers of filtration that oled doesn't have nor does it need meaning your eyes are not only getting a much better pure light source but is receiving that light source more directly every day with the older traditional led technology and monitors compared to oled it's like eating your burger with the peel i know which one i'd be doing 100 out of 100 times so not only does it look fantastic but it's also saving the health of your eyes and at the same time giving you one of the best experiences science can provide forza horizon 4 battlefield 5 and cyberpunk 2077 were all games that offered an extremely immersive hdr experience however we do still need strong peak brightness to be able to push out an incredible hdr experience and seeing as the r in hdr stands for range the d for dynamic and the h is for high for the range we have the lowest point being zero that's the pixel switching off completely and for a max brightness we have over 500 nits and for the dynamic range we have the 10 bit support offering much more color depth in that the colors chosen by our game or the software essentially are picked and have more colors to choose from to begin with versus 8 bit so lg cx oled tvs pretty much deliver the best hdr experience you are going to get and remember folks watching movies on this is unrivaled sure going to a cinema you might have a bigger screen but the picture isn't going to be anywhere near as good my suggestion save your money on a ticket and wait for the movies to come out on oled though what about if everyone wants to go now to come over to your house to watch movies on your oled say you're the new popular guy in town because you have just got yourself an oled and suddenly you have all these new found friends coming around well in that case viewing angles are literally the best a flat panel can provide as we talked about with those minimal levels of filtration if your eyes can directly see the screen you are not going to be seeing any color shift that as for gamers and more specifically competitive gamers they want low input lag and it is not just gamers that need low input lag but also if you are watching movies and even editing videos photos this all adds up audio visual synchronization of voices to a speaker's mouth on the screen can get very annoying if the person's lips aren't synced with the actual audio coming to your ears and as for working if you are saving time on every single action you do then do i need say more time saved is time made and in a professional environment then time saved is money made though in direct respect to gamers having low input lag can be the difference between scoring the victory winning the pot or on the flip side literally raging against the machine though jokes aside here is where the numbers on our in-house testing were phenomenal showing under 10 milliseconds input lag at all times and considering we are pushing 4k with over 8.29 million pixels which is four times the pixels over 1080p this is an impressive feat where input lag is usually slightly higher as you increase the resolution of a display too however input lag is not only one important piece of the holy trinity of a gamer's base requirements you also need higher refresh rates which in this case you get 120 hertz 4k 10-bit rgb that is it's native resolution and it's uncompressed running over hdmi 2.1 with the cx model of lg oleds as well as the previous 9 series 2 though you will need either the new generation consoles in this case we are using an xbox series x or an rtx 3000 rx 6000 series graphics card so now we're two for three here we have the incredibly low input lag the high refresh rates though what about the response times here is where the oled is literally uncontested in the monitor game older technologies simply can't compete with the cxo leds you get under 1 milliseconds response times that's each frame completely transitions to the next frame in under 1 1000 of a second as opposed to even a 360 hertz monitor we took a look at on the channel recently that struggled to hit three milliseconds response times and these types of tests are done in an extremely fast paced fps game that is cs go a game that has some of the darkest colors contrasted against the brightest colors making transitions not easy to pull off and very strenuous for some monitors to hit good times for instance other monitors will always test slower than their advertised speeds printed on the box because they are testing a very specific scenario in a controlled environment which is usually not indicative of real-world performance this oled however pulls it off in under one millisecond meaning each frame is nearly instantly transitioning so if you are like me and not a fan of motion blur and turn it off on every single game you play if it's got the option then this is the pinnacle of giving a clear easy to read and sharp picture and so there it is we have it three for three for gamers your next generation monitor is here there are some caveats to oled it doesn't come cheap nor does it come without its disadvantages both however nowadays are being heavily mitigated the cost of the cx and also the bxo leds have come down considerably since the technology was first introduced where the cheapest i can find an lg 55-inch oled in the usa for was twelve hundred dollars and depending on the size they can go up to three and a half thousand for the cx-77 inch we are using right here as for the other disadvantages of oled they are susceptible to what is known as burn-in that is when the same pixel is left at high brightness intensity on the same color for too long it can essentially permanently stay that way meaning your picture will be weird going forward though lg in particular have done a great job of combating this on their oled monitors with implementing what they know as screen shift technology which enables the oled to shift the pixels slightly while in use as to stop them suffering from burning they also have implemented the screen saver setting which in turn will turn the brightness down if left on a static bright image for too long both of these technologies have worked extremely well in practice at least for me personally the b7 showing no burn in and with the cx series being used in the studio here years later this technology has only improved as well though if you get an oled you may be wondering what settings should i use for gaming video editing or watching my favorite flicks well this is where we'll have a dedicated video coming out with what settings are used personally as well as some of the presets for gaming editing and watching movies these will all be personally recommended profiles you can use in different situations though make no mistake when it comes to lgo leds there is simply so much customization to choose from from temperature settings to gamut to raw brightness to individual rgb and cmy saturation 6 bands to gamma settings and motion smoothing that's artificial frame insertion the choice is simply yours you can make this picture very unique to your usage scenario so now let's finally show off some gameplay and see what this oled can do which in the case of the cx series we have here has support for both g-sync and freesync which is variable refresh rate technology meaning if the frames are below 120 for example on this native 120 hertz the oled monitor can reduce its frame rate to match the graphics card frame rate output meaning you will also get no screen tearing with this tech turned on and screen tearing is essentially where half the frame has been pushed out and the monitor displays it then the other frame hasn't been drawn out yet so you can get especially in fast action-paced games is what is known as the screen tearing where the two frames are essentially glued together on the same frame output of the monitor but it doesn't look good and just like that after playing games on the xbox series x and also the pc i can confidently actually i can definitely say around tech yes city we're now going to be synonymizing yes with oled so like low key you can now call me tech oled city and there it all is with oled if you are either in the market for a big tv or a high-end gaming monitor and you're on the fence about whether you should purchase an oled or not then hopefully this video has steered you in the right direction those cheap blue leds they've been going in monitors for over the last decade and they're terrible for your eyes oled is not only giving you a better picture but it's also taking care of your eyes in the process so you're getting two benefits by switching to oled and the human eyes and the sense that that brings is one of the most if not the most important sense that your body has in this existence so take care of it if you can sure there's a premium but it's definitely worth it especially around here i've been switching everything lately over to oled and i will not look back that's all i'm gonna say and a big thanks for lg for sending out this cx 77 inch to be honest this cx-77 it's been on my wish list actually ever since i bought the cx-55 inch and i've been using that with the b7 that i bought years ago as a main gaming dual monitor and editing setup so basically with oled if you guys can afford the extra premium then it is definitely worth getting especially in the long run so hopefully you guys have enjoyed this video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also if you have any questions or comments about lg and their oleds then be sure to drop a question in the comments section below and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content around tech oled city be sure to subscribe ring that bell and i'll catch you on another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] ah
