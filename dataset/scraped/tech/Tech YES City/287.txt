this video is a quick update for those of you on dming me about the crypto currency mining of the rtx 3080 and i put it on a benchmark and basically the bottom line is this thing is really not that desirable for cryptocurrency miners and the reason being is because simply the profitability versus the power consumption isn't as good as say a 5700 xt and basically they initially reported mining rates of around 110 to 120 mega hashes and if that was true then it would have been very appealing i feel for miners however the realism is i've put it on a mining account that i had like ages ago and i've benchmarked it and what the benchmark does is it goes through all the different programs that can hash out with your gpu then it selects the most profitable and this program showed that it was s or ethereum and that was mining around 87 mega hashes so it wasn't profitable when we looked at the numbers or it was like two dollars a day after i accounted my power cost which is about 17 cents kilowatt hour and if you're in the us you may be able to get 10 cents a kilowatt hour of course the usd is stronger but these cards were really only profiting about two dollars a day and of course you've got to run the risk of your card essentially having a shorter life as well as just running a lot hotter and you have to turn on your aircon to accommodate for all the extra heat being dumped into whatever storage facility or wherever you're putting these mining rigs so it's good news good news for gamers they're not going to be basically in mass demand from crypto currency miners so you don't have to worry about that element like we saw years ago when the cryptocurrency miners were just buying up these cards in drove even paying double for them uh for what they were at retail market value however that being said with the demand on the uh rtx 3080 it's not going to really come from cryptocurrency the miners this time is going to come from pc gamers who just really want to get their hands on these cards like i've spoken to a few people around and they're basically going to be in supply proper supply later in the year towards the end of october that's what i'm being told however back on this cryptocurrency mining thing the good news again it's not really profitable for miners to do this over say them getting a 5700 xt or a 5700 or some of the amd cards which will provide them better not just profitability but better power consumption too i think with the seven nanometer for ethereum mining anyhow hope that clears that up for you guys and if you've stayed this far and you're watching that content and you want to see more of it make sure you hit that sub button for us ring that bell and also hit the like if you enjoyed this video and i'll catch you in another one very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
