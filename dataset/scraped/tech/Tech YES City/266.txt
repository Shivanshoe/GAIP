just because the used market has taken a bit of a downturn recently that does not mean i'm going to give up in fact i'm never going to give up where we've got deals already on the table before we even start this used parts hunt so what happened this morning was i got through 28 ssds for 700 aussie dollars half of those being 256 gigabyte drives then the other half 128 gigabyte now although these are used ssds they're all tested they're all confirmed working and another benefit of these ssds is that they have mlc based flash and they've also got burst banks on board which a lot of the cheaper ssds coming in nowadays don't feature these two things and then we've got after that a combo here they've listed it as an i7 3700 but it's also got a motherboard included they're asking a hundred aussie i just said look if everything's working i'll pick it up for a hundred so we've scored that deal we've also got a 780 ti and a 9800 gx2 now the 9800 gx2 is a really old potato but they're willing to take a hundred dollars for both these gpus of course the 780 ti being the one that i'm really interested in in this deal right here then next up we've got a motherboard cooler eight gigabytes of ram 4th gen i5 they're asking 150 i put in an offer of 120 they said sure come and pick this up now it's mediocre value at this price but i feel like the cooler the rgb cooler included does make it worthwhile then after that we've already landed an i5 4460 and they're asking 50 i put in an offer of 40 aussie dollars so there is some juicy deals that we've already lined up and we're going to go pick them up very soon but before we do we're going to go check out good old facebook and gametree again to see if this month can just get that much better so strap on in put your used press performance parts hunting capes on and let's get ready to make october 2020 one to remember there was quite a few good deals on facebook here where first of all we messaged someone about a 32 gigabyte kit of g skill memory four thousand megahertz rgb stuff they said they had two kits available i put down an offer initially on both the kits but then they came back to me and said one had already sold and they'll do us the remaining 32 gigabyte kit for 220 aussie dollars i said sure consider that sold i'm there so it looks like we're going to score that as well then we've got the potential deals where we're waiting for the people to get back to us on the first of this being two gtx 970s i put down 200 for both of them so 100 each and then three 1050 ti's all in three different listings where i've put down 100 on each of those so hopefully one of those snags at the very least and then we've got a b450 ryzen 5 3600 x combo where i've put down an offer of 350 aussie dollars then after that we've got hyperx rgb memory i put down 80 on this then after that there was an rx 470 over on good old gametree and we've put down 80 on that so we're going to see while we're driving and picking up these other deals who snags these deals and of course we're going to go see good old les that's the cue right there to get to the tech yes mobile [Music] so we picked up the i5 first off and then we went and picked up the motherboard and i five eight gigabyte ram combo then i had to head all the way to brisbane which is about an hour from where i live due to a tech yes delivery and that was all smooth and then around the corner someone got back to me about a gtx 970 so we've just picked that up now and someone also got back to us about a 1050 ti but they said they're not available till tomorrow so we'll see how that goes but what i'm going to do now is because i'm pretty close to lez's house i'm going to give him a call and we'll go pop in and see what's cracker lacking uh what's cracker like unless good man i'm actually just around the [Music] [Music] corner [Music] and a bit of an update now we've just finished up picking up the i7 3770 and the motherboard which the motherboard does look like it's seen better days so if i can get that motherboard working i'm going to be very surprised but they did throw in a wi-fi card with the deal too so that always helps to sweeten things up and after les's place we had to pick up the cases for in the 100 flip up challenge i mentioned that we picked up uh three cases but the guy ended up saying he had five cases in the end and so we got that for sixty dollars for five old retro cases so i picked up the lot because they're cases from 2005 but they're brand new so i'm gonna be having a lot of fun with these different cases one of them even has the old lcd screens that they used to have like that stuff is a blast to the past but then les les himself he had heaps of stuff this week for us so in total we got eight systems and we also picked up some monitors but then we got monitors without stands unless threw in a couple of stands and then we picked up four power supplies too but we'll show all that when we get back to the studio but anyway what we're going to do now is i'm going to wait for two people to get back to me because they did message me and say that they wanted me to get the deals after work that's the ryzen combo and also the ddr4 memory but they're also like because i went to travel out to get this i7 it's sort of like that way from my home but then these deals are like all that way and so it's going to be a triangle of like massive time wasting unless i can get these two guys to maybe post it to me so i'm just gonna message them see if they're interested in doing a paypal deal posting out these different parts to me and that will just save me a lot of time especially if it's getting dark i don't want to get home at like midnight and also i'm going to be wasting a heap more gas if i do get these other two deals so we're just going to see if they're interested in doing that hopefully they are but then after that there is also the 780 ti they got back to us finally and they're going to meet us on the way home because they're actually on the gold coast where i live so fingers crossed it all goes well but now i'm just going to get a feed but even though i had a feed earlier i got a kfc fill box they're like five dollars aussie which would be like 3.50 us and it's pretty good you get two pieces of chicken and like chips and a bun so always after those deals got to stay hungry for the deals even if you've finished eating [Music] and we've picked up the final deal here which was the four eight gigabyte sticks of memory the person was really nice and they met me halfway between where i was before and here so that's the g skill 4 000 megahertz memory for 220 aussie and they chucked in some extra goodies too so that was amazing and then the guy who was further up north agreed to post the ryzen 5 3600x and the motherboard so everything's going well now but i'm heading home and i message the guy about the 780 ti and he's like well it's too late so we're gonna have to leave that until tomorrow which we will pick that up and uh i think we've hit all the bases so let's get this stuff home and the lights just went out so let's get this stuff home and unpack it man this right here is what it's all about just a a car full of deals baby [Applause] [Music] so last night i got home and i was just exhausted i mean it took me like 40 minutes to unpack all this stuff from the car because we kind of were playing tetris to fit in in total 16 cases and seven monitors and all this other stuff and then get it back to the gold coast where i'm at the tech yes studio so anyway we'll go through the juicy stuff right here where we've got an i7 system from les i got this for 70 aussie with 12 gigabytes of ram now a really good thing about this pc is this delta power supply right here 750 watt and that's a true 750 watt well true 650 on the 12 volt line and these things are very powerful you could power an rtx 3080 i believe off this power supply absolutely fine and then there was also a 120 gigabyte ssd thrown in though i wouldn't power an rtx 3080 off this pc right here it will the cpu will seriously bottleneck it but that was the coolest of the bunch then we had after that a heap of i5 systems and i3 systems as well as one core 2 duo system which les did for pretty cheap because it had a 700 watt power supply in it and also had the wi-fi card at the bottom and some ddr3 memory which is kind of weird on the ddr2 era they did make these boards for the q9550s i believe and stuff like that where they did support ddr3 at the final run and that was probably in preparation for the first gen i series but after that we had the two i3s we got them for fifty dollars each and then the rest of the i5 systems were 90 a pop and so all they're going to do is pop an i5 into the i3 systems and we're good to go then we've got those ssds we've already looked at those then there's this motherboard here with the i7 3770 the motherboard has seen better days like for me to try and get this to work i'm actually going to definitely take all these pins off i'll have to somehow figure out just a way to snip them all and get this off here because they'll probably be shorting together then i can try and bend these pins back on the socket and there might be a chance that this motherboard works and i mean the i7370 they guaranteed me that this does indeed work so that's the main reason i bought it but of course chucking in a wi-fi card i always actually need these and they cost like 15 at least so that's always good that they chuck that in saves me a little bit of money in time then we got the four power supplies right here i was actually really excited about this deal because i always need decent power supplies like ones that are 500 watt plus and their true 500 watt plus so we've got cx750m we've got a thermaltake power supply and fsp power supply and also a hx 650 watt and we got those for a hundred dollars for the four and then we've got this gtx 970 right here which i scooped off of marketplace this was one of the unknown deals we didn't get this guarantee but they messaged us back on the road and that was really good because i do need graphics cards right now and all the other guys all those open offers i had for tvti's and the other 970s they either were firm on their prices wanting too much or they just didn't get back to me so i do have to figure out something else to get gpus pretty quickly um because this is what i i desperately need that especially with all these other pcs that came through but there is something in the works to get some gpus in bulk and that's what i'm looking at right now just some use gpus so we're working out something right now but this is the next deal that we got we actually got this first in the series like when i left i got the i5 actually sorry i didn't mention i got the i5 the 4460 and so we got that for 40 but that was the first deal then we got the second deal these were both local really local to where i am and this has the 45 90 8 gig of ram a zeus motherboard cooler and 120 aussie that's not too bad i'll be able to make something work with that and then this ram right here i'm super excited about this g skill memory the trident z stuff is always some of the best you can get out there it looks really neat plus this is the 4 000 megahertz stuff this does not come cheap and so the fact that i got this for 220 bucks i was really happy about that because i can make this work on a higher end build when i put that together so here's the monitors right here we've got seven in total five of those being 19 inches we got those for 60 for the five and then les did us two of these 22 inches for 25 each with the stands and of course i've got to get the stands on them he threw those stands in so just got to get that crack of lacking then this right here free cooler let's chuck this in too he said do you want a gift and i'm like sure i always love a good gift and this is a dedicated intel xeon cooling solution that hasn't been opened yet so we'll make that work in a build because just stuff like this stuff like this really does excite me because i just haven't used it before and then this stuff right here behind the cooler is even more exciting look at these cases they are brand new and they're from 2005 era and this has got those like tacky leds the all the dragon on the side and stuff like that i don't know about you guys but this is my favorite part of this deal hunting and i actually because i in the whole five years that i've been doing this i haven't come into something quite like this and that is brand new old stock and usually i think if stuff like this does come up for sale it gets snapped up really quickly so we've got some of these old really just really just weird tacky cases one of them even has a front lcd panel on it if you guys remember building pcs back in the day you had these cases with these lcd readouts one of them even has that and a 20 centimeter fan on the on the side of the case so i'm looking forward to doing some builds in these cases right here and considering they're brand new it just makes it that much more exciting to just i don't know is it just me or am i like would you be excited if you had one of these cases come through and it had the tacky leds the lcd screen the 20 centimeter fan on the side or the dragon artwork i mean i don't know it's just something that's really going to make me excited when we put together a build in this thing right here so the fact that we also got these six cases for 50 sorry five cases for 60 dollars even sweetened up the deal more that's 12 aussie dollars a pop which would be less than 10 usd you've even got on this one the ability to put it's got a dedicated section for a zip drive if anyone ever uh remembers those old zip drives they were like they were back in like man when were they like 2 000 error or something like that i even forgot when the zip drives were like in fashion kind of thing and then next up here we've got a p400 which the person who sold me this ddr4 memory right here they just said would you like a case i'm not using it i don't have any need for it would you like this p400 and i'm like i mean for me it's like that's not even a question that's like just chuck that in the car that's going to get used so here's what we've got so far i actually had to write all this stuff down this month because there was just so much like this is a huge month and i've still got to go pick up this right now the 780 ti person's gotten back to us they're keen to go meet us right now and there is also another i5 4460 that has come up and i'm going to go hopefully i can get that too as well and then there's this b450 in the 3600x they're actually still out up in the air like they said they would post it but then they haven't replied for like since yesterday so usually that's not a good sign i mean someone's not keen like they may be just keen for someone to pick it up locally which is completely understandable some people just don't like posting stuff and i get that so that's up in the air still i don't know if i'm going to get that this 16 gigabytes of rgb hyperx memory apparently that's coming through later today as well so what i'm going to do is go pick up two deals now i also have before i started recording this in the morning i checked quickly on facebook and gumtree just for graphics cards and there's like there's really nothing out there i mean without me there is like one deal that i would pick up but it's all the way out in uh like it's like it's almost like an hour drive from me and it's an r7 i think uh 9270x or something like that so it's a decent price like 50 aussie dollars i'll pay that for it but driving there and back and wasting all that time just for one deal is not worth it so this is why i like doing the parts hunt the way i do because i make all the synergy happen and get everything fill up a whole car in one day and we're not um i think we used half a tank of gas yesterday so that was pretty epic [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and coming back from getting those final two deals we got the 780 ti that is in the hand and that came with the 9800 gx which as we said before is really just maybe we can flick it in an office pc or something like that but even then if the power supply supports that gpu then it's probably better off taking that power supply out so those older graphics cards that's the one crux that i have against them is that if you've got that good power supply it's probably worth more than that whole office pc that you would put together using that old gpu though other than that we got an i5 4460 another one and that was 35 and with a cooler so i picked up two of them because i do have a few motherboards with i3s on them and i do need the 4th gen i5s and they do sell as entry-level gaming pcs they still do a fine job especially if you couple them with an rx 470 or an rx 570 or something like that pretty good combo even for gaming at 1080p in 2020 i've done all the math here and we've come out to 2195 aussie dollars which when converted to usd is 1562 us dollars i'll throw the whole tally up here on the screen where we can just see how many deals we got here today this was a mammoth month and it was honestly it started off really good and i i attribute that because i guess i'm used to hunting on the weekends and i started off now on a thursday and i think maybe i'm going to start doing these parts hunts during the week a little bit earlier than the end of the month and the reason we did the parts hunt a little bit earlier this month rather than the end of the month is because i've got rtx 3070 coming up and i've also got the zen 3 stuff i've got to get through all those tests and results so if there's any particular tests you guys want to see run on either those cpus or the gpus then drop that down in the comments section below though do let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite deal of the month even though i didn't include it in the tally those new old cases they were my uh favorite because they're just something i haven't seen here in a long long time and i actually booked them up in that previous 100 flip up challenge and i definitely think i got way more than the price dictated so that was a good deal but in terms of like the actual normal regular flow because that stuff really like never comes up in terms of the raw parts here i'd say the 220 g skill 32 gigabyte kit was the uh best deal in terms of raw price performance parts here because it's 4 000 megahertz memory it's got the bling and we got that free case chucked in with it so i love it when you get those freebies chucked in but they're actually a really good deal and they help sweeten the deal up a lot but do let us know in the comments what was your favorite deal of the month and with that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon but we do have the question of the day here which comes from jp and they ask guys what is your or what are your undervolt oc results of the zotac that would be the trinity please let me know i actually included that in the review i talked about under volting and the 1800 megahertz just a little bit over so it's like eight hundred and eighteen hundred and twelve megahertz at around 800 to 850 millivolt is usually the sweet spot and the zotac fell in that range i think it was like 830 something millivolts where it's sweetened out at so that's your sweet spot range for the rtx 3080s and the 3092 so if you find it somewhere in between that range you are going to be saving a lot of power and really losing hardly any fps at all so definitely recommend it and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
