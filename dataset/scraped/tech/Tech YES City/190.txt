oh the prices of pc parts gonna go up forever are they gonna go up in price they're gonna go up in price Are pc parts and their prices destined to go up much faster than they've ever gone up in the history of tech as we know it and this biggest talking point in relation to this topic at least for me personally has come in the fact of graphics card prices and what we've seen in relation to this market is even worse than that of 2018 and 2017 where we saw the prices of gpus just go through the roof back then we are seeing the exact same thing especially when it comes to an rtx 3000 series card now rtx 3000 series cards are the most desirable two gamers at this point in time at least from all the retailers i'm speaking to all the gamers want to get these cards but also all the cryptocurrency miners want to get their hands on these things too so we can see the correlation there and that is that there's a massive demand for rtx 3000 series cards so my fellow beautiful tech citizens let's go over all the details in today's video where we're going to talk also about macroeconomic policies cajun theory and all this other stuff so what don't look at me like that this is what's been on my mind the last like month if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsors cd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code pftyc you can get yourself a legit single end user windows 10 license today welcome back to tech yes city and we're going to look at straight away the kijian model of economic theory and why a lot of governments actually like this model of theory and basically the whole crux behind cajun theory is that governments will intervene when aggregate demand in society is low so this whole economic theory basically works off the pretense of aggregate demand now in the past i have talked about why i think demand is slightly more important than supply overall they're both very important but in terms of pricing itself demand will always hold the more higher key element in terms of pricing an item than supply will and ultimately we are seeing this exact effect come into play with graphics cards now why is graphics cards going so high when it comes to graphics cards the reason the demand is so high right now is the cryptocurrency and i've talked about this specifically in an rtx 3080 video we did i'll put the link up here where basically a lot of people are just going out and buying these gaming graphics cards whacking them in a computer pressing a play button and then they're starting to make money and so as long as that appeal is there for that to be actually highly profitable then a lot of these gaming graphics cards aren't actually going to go into the hands of gamers so we've got this artificial demand that's come from another segment in the market completely and that's cryptocurrency and it's kind of ruining the pricing structure as we know it and to be quite frank when i see an rtx 3070 here locally selling like actually selling for 1400 and 1500 aussie dollars then you know that something's drastically wrong where these cards were coming in even just a few months ago at 900 aussie dollars however would one call this inflation or would one call this a fad in my opinion i'm going to argue that this is more luxury good with an rtx 3000 series card yes it sucks that a lot of gamers can't get their hands on it but it's actually not a necessity and one thing i was personally worried about actually and in the last month i've been researching this a lot is say for instance the last few years i've actually been saving up a bit of money is that money going to be pretty much worthless or like worth a lot less money in the next year and so i think that's a concern of a lot of people who i guess they work hard they save their money they want to know hey is the government just being reckless with their quantitative easing programs that's where essentially they make money out of thin air and they're pumping it into the economy is that increase in money supply going to hurt our savings and we're seeing this first and foremost with graphics cards and people are worried are these prices going to flow through to a lot of other items out there in society and is everything across the board just going to go up in price drastically quick like we've seen in the case of graphics cards and to answer that question we're going to look within tech first and when i look around what i see truly and i've touched on this in the last few months but you guys did say in the comments that you like the economic videos so we're going to go into what i believe and we're touching on going forward into 2021 is actually going to look like it's a two-speed economy and two-speed inflation where you're going to have inflation of desirable luxury goods going through the roof and we've already seen this with gravis cards we're actually starting to see this at least locally where i am with things like housing prices as well as cars however the most important thing to look at in my opinion and what people are really worried about is hyperinflation and that is essentially when the prices of things go up so quickly that money itself practically becomes worthless then i started to do a heap of research a heap of digging and there was one instance at least in the modern western worlds when we look at the uk we look at the us we look at australia for example from 1966 to 1982 there was a period of higher inflation in fact it wasn't a healthy dose of inflation either in most years it was going into the double digits realm so you'd get 10 inflation in years which is devastating to economies but it's not as devastating as hyperinflation and when i looked closer in those 16 years and what we saw was over 300 increase in wages over those 16 years which pretty much a record for at least the historical documentation of the united states so we had high wage growth the other thing i also tried to look for because i always like in my brain always looking for these trends right you see things breaking out you're like okay that's breaking out elsewhere that's correlating with this and that look don't ask me how my brain works and what i saw with the hyperinflation in germany and also venezuela for example and even touching into the extended periods of in higher inflation in the us for example we did have documented cases and especially a lot of documented cases of shortages in food and electricity so when there's basically a shortage of necessities and that's items that you have to have in order to survive that is when hyperinflation rears its ugly head and in the case of the higher inflation levels seen in the western countries during 1966 to 1982 those would be due to not as severe shortages in necessitative items and so basically what i'm trying to say here is that i don't think we will see hyperinflation where we are unless there's a shortage of things like food and electricity however also what i'm trying to tell myself too is that maybe perhaps i shouldn't just rush out and buy a property or buy an overpriced graphics card however going back to pc parts now we're going to go back to this two-speed theory that i'm thinking is taking place in our modern society right now and that is when we look at say a graphics card it's overpriced and the reason it's overpriced is because there's an artificially high demand but when we look at things like even an xbox series s this is a good gaming console it's going to play games actually quite well and coupled with some of the benefits it offers i think it at least here in australia it's 499 aussie dollars and it's in stock there's no massive shortage of supply and in fact it's going to give someone really good value for money if they're just looking to get into playing games you can also hook up a keyboard and mouse and play fortnite i think this is actually offering better value than a lot of the pcs that i sell and other people sell here locally in the marketplace hey look i'm going to be transparent i've got nothing to hide but then we go back to the pc parts in general and we look at other items for instance recently a corsair 450 watt power supply came up for 49 aussie dollars that's a pretty good buy in australia so i went and bought a heap of them there's also the 10 700 f which i recently saw dropped down in price to 379 dollars for eight cores 16 threads that is really good value there's also in america the ryzen 7 3700x which is still coming in at a very solid price so it seems like that a lot of people want say for instance the ryzen 5000 series cpus and the problem with the ryzen 5000 series cpus is that we've said before is that there's actually starting to become evidence of a shortage in seven nanometer and especially the good seven nanometer that's meant to go into those new ryzen 5000 series chips and so with those imbalances in between supply and demand you're going to see higher prices naturally as a consequence but what you have to ask yourself at the end of the day is is that ryzen 5000 series cpu necessary and is it necessary for the price and in my opinion absolutely not and that's because mainly i've got a bias towards getting the most price performance out of a said pc part and we've talked about how to hold out this period of artificially high demand by just playing on say for instance a graphics card with 4 gigabytes of vram or less or even going on aliexpress and buying a cheaper xeon for example there's basically a list of different things that you can do to get really good price performance even right here today you're probably wondering if i hold down on all that stuff and i get the cookie cutter price performance stuff right now is this the more desirable stuff at least more desirable right now is that going to come down in price in the future and in my opinion definitely yes i think what we're seeing right now is an oversupply and this is the thing people think the demand for money is a constant thing it's actually not and a lot of people refer to velocity of money when it's actually there's money itself has a simple supply and demand and in part this next part we're going to talk about has a lot to do with the governments essentially over supplying money in the economy at this very point in time and i do say at this very point in time because traditionally these things don't last forever the government isn't just going to keep the printer rolling and rolling and rolling because they know that it will have disastrous effects on economies if they keep doing this so sooner or later those printers will stop rolling out the money and with that you will see an increase in demand for actual money itself and you're probably sitting back on your chair and you're like whoa what brian is there a demand for money supply and demand of money this is a new concept for me where a lot of people think there's an actual constant supply and demand for money and that's actually i believe that's false in that demand for money itself actually goes up and down depending on not only supply of money but also perceived supply of money now a government debt to actual inflation itself is one thing that doesn't correlate strongly with inflation if we look at say for instance the darling of high government debt and low inflation this would be japan now i lived in japan for nearly nine years and over that whole period of living there i didn't see prices increase for basically anything at all japan was low inflation it was one place in the world where you basically knew that you were getting a meal today for five dollars and that meal in a couple of years time is probably going to be five dollars still though the governments have racked up a massive amount of debt since the year 2000 and as we said before those inflation levels didn't quite agree in the correlation of just making more government money that an economy will pick up inflation because of that and subsequently of course pc parts so okay we've given the example of japan let's go over now to the united states and also the homeland of australia and even the uk and parts of europe and say is the demand for money going to go down or up and i believe once things and once the easy money supply starts drying up that's when your demand for your dollar will start going up as well and once the demand for the dollar goes up then the prices of pc parts should go down now what are people saying okay what what what what why why you're probably sitting there like yo brian can we just get a simple outlook of when you think pc parts will come down in price at least the popular graphics cards and now that again that's an interesting one because the demand for money i do see that going up a bit in the next at least the next year i'd say in the next three months we'll see this increase in supply start to tap her off a bit so maybe three months later you'll start to see pc parts come down in price a bit but in terms of the demand for gpus directly the rtx 3000 series they'll only come down in prices if like i've said before we just pray for a crash in crypto so if we do get a massive crash in crypto currencies then we will see a massive increase in supply of rtx 3000 series graphics cards so at the moment it's just a waiting game between the easy money supply and the price of crypto when the easy money supply dries up then the price of crypto should crash so here's to praying for a crypto cash but also for the governments finally to put a lid on their easy spending though ultimately when it comes down to it i think that this short term wave of increased supply of money means that there's a less of a demand for money where people perceive the value of the dollar to even go down further and so they're going out and going and getting scalped for these ridiculous prices on rtx 3000 series cars they're going out and buying and paying stupid amounts for things like real estate uh cars so i think like this what we're seeing right now could be a short-term lived thing i don't think it's going to span out for 10 years where we're going to see this massive amount of inflation governments definitely want a healthy level of inflation but the most important thing to look at with that is that if a lot of this cheap money supply is going into non-income generating assets in the case of crypto i guess you could call it an income generating asset but when we look at house prices and car prices going through the roof those are personal purchases a lot of the time and so if they're not going into actually making society more productive and truly increasing gdp then the governments will have to rethink their strategies on how to truly get gdp up and running again because in terms of seeing hyperinflation what a lot of people are talking about in regards to hyperinflation i don't think we will see that just based on the fact that even during the worst times of last year the food and water supply at least in australia and electricity supply was actually fine though in different parts of the world you may wish to research this for yourself say for instance if you're in the uk what is your food and electricity supply like and especially in the us and different countries i can't give you that answer based on your country but i know at least where i am personally things are fine in those two regards anyhow guys hope this video has given you some answers it's definitely when i did all this research it's given me some answers and sort of at least i don't have to worry too much about an economy that's going to be ravaged with hyperinflation i think that's not an outcome that's going to happen but i will answer the question of the day before we get on out of here so do let us know your thoughts and opinions in the comments section below and also if you enjoyed these economic sort of rabbit hole videos where we go down that hole and look at all this different information and present you guys with a video that you can sort of take home some answers with the last time i did it you guys absolutely loved it and it's something that's been on my mind honestly for the last month and i've been thinking about a lot but with that aside we've got the question there here which comes from jamie g and they just ask corrosion dot dot question mark and this is talking about when we started washing motherboards here on the channel and once you wash your motherboard especially if it's water from the tap you've then got of course if you just leave that water on there it's going to get corrosion however what we do around tech yes cities we then get the data vac blows a lot of air so we can able to get all that water off the motherboard even if there's minuscule amounts left we then coat it with the multi-purpose spray and that's water dispersant as well and what that does is leave it shiny looking brand new and of course not susceptible to rust so to answer that question directly there won't be any corrosion at least around tech yes city and at least after it's had some tech yes loving even under the tap and i'll catch you guys in the next tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell for us i'll do that again that bell for us and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye you
