[Music] [Music] our rtx 3080 pre-order has finally come through and i'm going to jump in the tech yes mobile and go pick it up tonight because i can't wait any longer and there's some really good news in this episode too and that is we've got all the parts ready not just for the 30 80 build but also for two other builds here where we're pretty much going to use all our budget and then see what we can make happen so let's just see how far we can keep taking this 100 in the 100 flip up challenge if you want to get a windows 10 pro key license for cheap then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as fourteen dollars and fifty cents using the coupon code tyc on checkout you can save yourself eighteen percent and get that key instantly delivered links in description below [Music] and we've just picked up the rtx 3080 we've got this in the hand it is ready to rock and roll i just got to pop into my sister's place and grab a feed because she's just around the corner from here too and now we've got our three builds mapped out and we're going to go through each of them starting with the cheapest one first where we're actually going to utilize this drive that we picked up in a previous episode and it was actually says a one terabyte but it's actually really only a 450 gigabyte hard drive and we've got a 780 ti that we've got for 100 aussie and then we've got here we got this off les for 70. now this has got a really big power supply in it which will be perfect with a 780 ti it's also got 12 gigabytes of ram and the ssd so that's going to really be like a good value pc because we're putting this one together for literally 170 aussie dollars so that's some incredible price performance right there and i mean with our leftover budget we might think of adding in a monitor keyboard and mouse just to spice things up since the case um it's not the best we'll also be giving that a bit of take sloven too then we've got the next build here you may notice in the previous episode i bought this and tech dapper case for 78 aussie dollars and i decided against using it in the higher end build and the reason being is because i think with a higher end build you kind of want to go and just spend a little bit more to get the build right and we will move on on to that in a second but we've got a 650 watt power supply here we got this for 25 aussie we got this for 10 we actually got two of these for 20. we're using one in this build one in the build over there and then we've got 128 gigabyte ssd that we got for 20 and then this combo here is going to be the main core of this build i5 45 90 rgb cooler motherboard now i did get this in a parts hunt but i got it with a different cooler and i was in a clutch for another flip so i used the bigger cooler which cools better on a different build with the i7 overclocked and stuff like that and then i've just replaced it with this cheaper one here but still got the rgb bling and stuff like that then we've got a gtx 970 we got this for 100 aussie dollars and so this build in total is coming in at 353 this one right here now we're going to move over to the build the one that we started the series and intended to start building and this is the rtx 3080 pc right here i7 10700 f these are going on sale in australia for a really good price i mean for zen 3 around the corner i would ideally hopefully i can get this thing flipped before zen 3 releases that would be ideal we've got the z490m 4 decent motherboard especially coupled with an i7 you're going to have no problems there we're then able to overclock the memory which we've got 32 gigabytes of and we've got four sticks so four by eight then we've got the hard drive two terabyte uh hard drive backup drive one terabyte m.2 nvme drive a 650 watt power supply which is going to be absolutely fine with the i7 and the 3080. this build in total should be maybe using around 450 watts which this power supply is more than equipped to handle and then i was talking about instead of using the stock cooler i wanted to get a water cooler and so we found this with no fans it's an older corsair watercolor i think it's a h115 and it's a 280 mil cooler we got this for 30 aussie dollars but it came with no fans they told me they assured me it worked so hopefully it works fine and there's no like really rattly or pump bad pump noises and stuff like that but then we're going to use the uh three mil four uh corsair fans that we picked up and we pulled out of that previous build with the hub and the controller so that's gonna add rgb to the front of the case and then we can put the spare fan in the top of the case right here at the top so that's going to utilize all that rgb we're going to have water cooling it's going to look hopefully beautiful and that leads us to this last part right here this case we picked this up for 100 aussie dollars actually someone in the discord found it and said uh this is local to you brian it's 140 offer him 100 and i did just that i was like yeah cool 100 is really good aussie dollars for a pretty much brand new he only opened it and put it back in the box it was brand new and offered him 100 aussie dollars for it he accepted and we went and picked it up so that leaves the total now with our budget we came into this episode with 3 316 aussie dollars we're coming out with 350 dollars left over i'll put the tally of all these three builds up here on the screen for you guys but we're gonna we're starting to get dark now so we're gonna build this thing into the night and come up with three pcs and then talk about how much we intend to flip them for and that's going to then span over into the next episode so let's get it on [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so there is some really good news and that is all three of these pcs are finished they're all working fine and they actually all sound relatively quiet we'll get onto the main pc soon but we did come into some trouble in paradise here with this build on the table it had an i5 45 90 and the motherboard and the ram and the problem was that i was getting no signal initially and i was like okay what's going on keyboard wasn't lighting up but the hard drive sounded like it was initializing and yes your hard drive will make a noise even if a motherboard's dead but this sounded like it was actually communicating to the starter chip on board so i was like okay the motherboard should be okay since it was also giving out a dram led light warning here so anyway i was like okay let's just try the cpu i mean i did try different ram sticks straight away tried a different gpu and checked that gpu individually and then i quickly went onto the cpu and pulled it out and i knew straight away what was wrong and it was just like it was caked and i mean caked in thermal paste so those those stories you hear about people just you know using way too much thermal paste that kind of went on here with this cpu so this was where it's a good time to use brake cleaner and i don't use brake cleaner as much as i used to in the past but this is where it's perfect for these situations where there's just so much thermal paste and crap all scattered throughout a small area and it's going to take you a long time to clean that out with other methods so i just pretty much blasted this thing down with brake cleaner dried it off with the data vac and put it back in and everything's working now so i guess uh whether the person's intention was like whether they sold it in the condition that wasn't booting and whether they intended to host someone i will never know that but again it's i i'm glad like i'm glad it's like people like me buy this stuff and we're able to bring it back to life rather than someone who's say for instance trying to build their first used pc and they buy something like that and they think they get hosed and so it's not a good experience if you're that person just trying out the used market for the first time but that's kind of like that's the anyway that's the problems that can occur in the used market we got through this one a-okay and this case actually ended up turning out to be a little bit better than i thought i mean all these builds came together ascetically except the real budget banger over there but let's move on now to our main piece of the prize the rtx 3080 build and here it is right here the grand finale we've finished it off and it is looking mint it's sounding really whisper quiet it's running through those benchmarks absolutely fine and the gpu here this if you guys are interested in this colorful eye game i think it's the entry level model it weighs in at 1.45 kilo and the temperatures are around 75 degrees at 66 i think percent fan speeds and that's in an ambient of 26 degrees so it is pretty quiet it does the job it's similar to the zotac trinity that i reviewed where it's just a decent entry level model of course if you undervolt these cards then you will bring those temps and subsequently the noise down which i do recommend now the other parts of this build is we've got the motherboard that's absolutely fine the temperatures aren't getting hot on that either i mean it's only an i7 10 700 f even in like the heaven benchmark this cpu only uses a 25 watt or something like that it was really low the silicon power memory that looks okay i guess the more rgb you've got in this thing the more it's going to bling out and then the nzxt case which i think this is perfect for a build like this where we had the three 140mm fans and we had this spare fan slot up here where this rear fan slot actually doesn't fit a 140mm fan so it kind of worked out perfectly in this space here and the build came together really tidy and clean now one thing about these nzxt h510 cases is especially this white version here i found that every time i've sold a build in one of these cases it sells really quickly so that's a testament to i guess the clean aesthetic that they've got going on with their cases but you guys are probably wondering what am i going to be trying to sell these three pcs for let's sit down move over to conclusion and discuss and here we have it with three pcs all finito dandido okay let's just get on with the video 170 for the first pc that's the banger with the gtx 780 ti it's got the ssd and the hard drive in there we reused that hard drive from a previous episode we're going to try and go for around i'm hoping for 420 and then someone offers me 20 under we're hoping to clear 400 for that build and that's again that's a good when you look at in percentage terms that's a great profit there so we're hoping for around 230 bucks profit the good thing about that pc is it also came with windows 10 pre-activated uh the next pc we've got was the one that we had a little bit of trouble with it still looked amazing though in the end it came out pretty good and that one costs uh just over and it's 353 aussies so we're hoping to get in return for that one about 550 so hopefully make 200 bucks if we can um and that's because the nzxt case came up as well so initially i could have found a cheaper case perhaps and microed a bit more and still get that 550 because people don't care a whole lot about aesthetics still at that price level but they it started it's when it starts to matter a bit anyway hopefully we'll still clear a decent cut on that pc then of course the last one you guys are wondering what about the rtx 3080 pc we got this we built this for 2 4 13 aussie plus i did have to activate windows 10. so i used an scd keys win 10 activation pro key which was 20 aussie dollars and that essentially brought the cost up to two four three three aussie dollars so in total we have from my estimations we should have around 330 dollars left in the kitty but as we've seen here we haven't really run into any problems so we've got no problems left these three pcs are working absolutely fine and we've still got a little bit left which we're going to bring into the next episode after we sell these three pcs so depending on how much i flipped them for which with the rtx 3080 i'm honestly going to go a little bit big on this one i'm going to try somewhere over three and a half thousand so hopefully in one flip we can cut over 1100 aussie dollars and that's going to be a big one so if we can pull that off that's just going to catapult us into an era of where i can then in the next episode perhaps build up an rtx 3080 pc give that away as i originally promised and then keep going with this series because i'm going to be honest with you guys when i started this series it's it's one of the most passionate things that i've been over the years one thing that's been consistent even outside of youtube before i even started youtube one thing that was consistent with me is i loved buying and selling and tweaking things cleaning things up and that happened not just with pcs pcs was just like an avenue that you guys started to really enjoy on youtube and then that became sort of like its own thing but in terms of me i'm just so passionate about buying and selling stuff and trading i love it it's one of those things across a few different things that i'll do and so this just this series that i'm doing now it's it's what i want to do like it's really what i want to do i don't care if it's an rtx 3080 and even if it's an upcoming 6800xt i just don't care what parts they are i just want to see what the market's charging for this stuff especially these computer shops in australia they're all charging like over four thousand dollars for an rtx 3080 pc so if they're charging that i can come under make my cut and still do well so it's one thing that i've always loved doing analyzing the market seeing where the the gaps are and all the openings are and then sort of weaseling my way through and i said it a few months ago you've got a wheeze and squeeze baby and that's what we're doing at tech yeah city especially in this series man i'm going hard and i just absolutely love it so if you guys are enjoying this one be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what'd you do with things differently or what would you do differently or do you love what i'm doing in building our way up from that hundred aussie dollars and going ham and then still going forward we've got those three cases that we booked up from the last episode the old retro cases that are in new condition we've also got an intel stock fan the newer one the all black version we've also still got a cooler master rgb controller and i think a single fan so we've still got a few little pieces left that we can use in the next uh bit but in terms of microwaving all the stuff we had on hand we definitely got a lot of usage out of that other stuff that we had so we're good to go we're in a really good spot going forward i'm more confident than ever that we're just there's no risk of going backwards basically that's how i see it here and with all that aside i hope you guys enjoyed this one if you did be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below as always and we got the question of the day here which comes from daniel and they ask i'm planning to put together my i5 9600k with a 2060 a normal 2060. would it work with a 550 watt power supply i'll not be overclocking and you put there the small w if it's got the small w on it be very weary it's going to have the big w after the wattage that means that it's true wattage to that spec i've actually got a video coming out very soon where i've booked up a power supply and i'm going to be comparing it against another power supply because it's still in 2020 there's still like these things that go on in the tech scene and these stigmas that exist and people basically get con so if you've got a crap 550 watt power supply that build won't hold up the rtx 2060 will shut off the power supply could potentially go and the way to tell this is to basically look at that 12 a rating if that's like under 20a on a 500 watt power supply then it's not a true 500 watt power supply but say for instance even if we take a look at a good 450 watt power supply like the 50 aussie dollar mwe 450 which i checked out and i rocked them quite a bit they're really good power supply they've got over 400 watts available on that 12 volt line so that's one thing you've always got to be careful about when you're buying power supplies anyway hope that advice helps basically check that 12 volt line make sure it's good to go in terms of its ampage and hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon stay tuned for the next episode too because once we flip these pcs we'll come back and we'll have our budget and then we'll go into the next episode with a whole new outlook and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye
