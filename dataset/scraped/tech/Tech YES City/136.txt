it is finally that time of the month where we're 
going to go jump in the car go find some deals   on used tech products and of course since it is 
such a weird market all the deals that we're used   to getting is going to be a completely different 
game now where in the last month i've definitely   noticed a trend for me personally it's dropped 
off a cliff and that is oem pcs that i've been   selling even at a budget level pretty much no one 
is interested in them even if they offer better   value than builds with rgb bling so i'm now forced 
to find oems that i can at least convert into an   rgb case even if i have to mark them up an extra 
50 bucks because that is what the market is solely   demanding so in terms of me buying oem pcs i'm 
going to have to be a little bit more selective   this month but of course the graphics cards i am 
on the lookout for anything and everything and as   long as the price is right then i'm going to try 
and get those gpus but i have noticed slowly but   surely gpu prices are starting to creep down on 
the new end i'm watching two gpus in particular   that is the 6700 xt and the rtx 3060 because 
they're the cheapest newer cards out at the moment   and i've noticed the rtx 3060 at least locally 
here has gone down roughly 50 aussie dollars   still above its release price but it's still lower 
than what it was a month ago and it's in stock   the 6700 xt is a pretty similar story but in terms 
of what deals we're gonna go look for we've got a   lot to pull up here so let's get on with it right 
after this sponsor spot do you feel like this   when you see this well if so you can get rid of 
that windows activation message with today's video   sponsor scd keys for as little as 12 usd after you 
use that coupon bftyc you can get activated today   links in description below so pulling up a heap of 
different listings here from the two places that i   look at locally and that is good old gamtree and 
facebook marketplace we have a heap of different   deals mainly gpus but the first deal we put 
an offer on here is a ryzen 5 2600 and an x370   motherboard they're asking 200 i dropped down 170. 
these are aussie dollars as well so i will put the   usd conversions up on the screen for you and of 
course if we get this first deal for that price   then we'll be laughing next up here is a gtx 
1070 they're asking 450 i put in an offer of 390   and waiting for them to get back to us but 
gpus have dropped down a little bit in price as   we're seeing with the rtx 30 60 in the intro and 
coming in they're asking a thousand dollars i put   an offer of 850 based on that 950 new price but 
then we've got an rx 470 here they're asking 200   for the 4 gigabyte version i put an offer of 150 
and then a gtx 970 3.5 gigabytes here going for   200 i offered again just like the rx 470 150 
then next up we've got a potato style gpu   r7 240 they're asking way too much for this at 
60 but i offered 20 and they've been sitting   on it for a long time so if someone's sitting on 
something for a long time i will offer them what   i feel is a fair price even if they're asking way 
too much but next up here we've got a ryzen 5 3600   and a b450 motherboard they're asking 300 i came 
in at 240. they've actually already came back   instantly at 260 and i just said to him look let's 
meet in the middle 250 and i'll come pick it up   this afternoon and they agreed so we're gonna go 
pick up that combo and of course it always helps   to get a ryzen motherboard in the mix because 
they usually go for 80 or 90 especially b450 so   i feel like we're getting the motherboard thrown 
in for free at fair market value for the ryzen   5 3600. then next up we've got 1080 ti's and 
yes that was plural or should i say 1080 ties   and there's two of them here one's going for 770. 
i put in an offer of 650 then the next one they're   asking 800 i again put in an offer of 650. then 
we've got a gtx 660 they're asking 50 i put an   offer of 35. they got back to me said it's pending 
pickup but if it falls through they'll give it to   me for 35. and then we've got a 980 ti here it's 
going for a hundred dollars but it is faulty   but the card looks like it's in decent condition 
and it does have that dvi port at the back   so i offered him 20 bucks just as a gamble so 
hopefully we'll be able to get that and see if   we can get it working there it is with the first 
round of deals done and dusted we're going to wait   for the people to get back to us and of course 
we're going to go hit the road now go see les and   go pick up that rising combo and hopefully while 
we're doing all that some of these people will get   back to us and we might find some more deals on 
the road that pop up because i'm always looking   for this i'm always hungry for them deals so let's 
go jump in that yes mobile and see what unfolds so we are now on the road and we just hit 
up les and he hooked us up five pcs and   four monitors and a heap of hard drives but we'll 
talk about that deal when we get home because this   was so exciting thanks nate so much so my friend 
nate he hooked us up with the lead for a gtx   980 so we got that in the packaging 
and we got that he was asking 250   i just put in an offer of 200 especially 
since it's the founders edition card just take it out of the wrapping so you can see 
it and i can see straight away this guy had taken   good care of this card like it's in good nick then 
i asked him like you know always asking you got   anything else you got anything else for sale then 
he had a gtx 760 and he just wanted to get rid of   it he didn't care at all and i just said 20 bucks 
and he said yep just get rid of it and then he had   this here and i'm not used to titans so i'm not 
used to titans at all i don't know the market for   titans so what i saw here was um i didn't know if 
it was a titan first gen or second gen so they're   both 12 gigabytes of ram it could have been 
a kepler never really focused on the titans   and so what i said to him was i was like look 
uh it could be either or and if it's a titan   kepler then it's going to be like worth like 200 
bucks i just said to him look i'll take the gamble   and we'll split the difference so he just said yep 
and so because he wanted 500 for it and i was like   okay let's do it and i got it for 350 so that's 
the that right there i think it might actually   be the titan x though so looking at that now 
because i i remember the original titan was silver   so i'm i just that's why i took the gamble so i'm 
like it could be the x that one right there and   if it is then it's the much better variant of the 
titan cards but from here on in we have to now go   on the road and we're going to go hit up that 
ryzen 5 uh 3600 and b450 for 250. so we've got   some really good deals right now and i just love 
this lead right here because that's three gpus   and we also got a 750 ti of less as well but let's 
hit the road we'll get back to the tech yes studio   and see what's unraveling but it's funny because 
a lot of those other messages that start of the   past hunt that i messaged about they just didn't 
get back to me and it's just been an absolute   bust on that end but hey man you just this 
is like this is how it is doesn't matter   what market it is doesn't matter how you 
roll you just keep rolling with the punches and now we are back at the tech yes studio and 
this is pretty intense the deals that we've   picked up here was uh three different groups 
of people so we started off with lesson i said   at the start of the episode i wasn't going to buy 
oems but les talked me into buying these five oems   plus a heap of different hard drives and i got 
in total four two terabytes and i got i think   five five hundred gigabytes and three one 
terabytes i got those for a really good price   it was around two hundred dollars and then he did 
all these for around 500 plus he wanted me to buy   if i bought the hard drive because i wanted the 
hard drives and then i wanted this here gtx 70 ti   so if i got that he said that okay i'll do you 
all this stuff if you buy all this other stuff   so i ended up getting for a thousand dollars 
four monitors five pcs a heap of different hard   drives a gtx 70 ti and also two i7 2600s so pretty 
much pro rider in these prices what we bargained   i'll show up on the screen what we got everything 
four but that was the first deal and then   while i was on the road as i said in the car a 
friend messaged me and said look check out this ad   for a gtx 980. and i was like okay it's original 
founders i'll just send them a message and offer   them 200 even because that's what i'm prepared to 
pay and then upon rocking up i ended up scoring   the gtx 760 which is ironic because the gtx 760 
i got that for 20 bucks over the 70th which is   50 bucks but hey the 750ti technically might be 
better because nvidia's recently announced that   they're canceling support for the 760 but not the 
750 ti and then we've also got underneath that at   the bottom of the stack we've got that titan x and 
i didn't know in the car i know some people are   going to correct me and i'm going to put a message 
over that but the titan xp is the pascal one sorry   what i was thinking of is i just didn't want the 
kepler titan that thing is like a toaster oven   so i was making sure i didn't get the kepler one 
and i was happy with the maxwell one for 350 bucks   so i still think that's a pretty solid buy and 
that's what i thought it was so i was hoping it   was that and not the original silver one which was 
yeah a toaster oven so i kind of made a few little   typos voice typos as we were getting back to the 
studio and we're on the road and then we got that   last deal which was the ryzen 5 3600 and the b450 
motherboard and it also came with the box coolant   we got that for 250 so i'll put up a tally on the 
screen of what we've got so far but i'm pretty   excited already because getting graphics cards is 
still pretty hard to do at decent prices and the   fact that we've got four of them on the desk here 
does make me happy and we're now at the next day   and unfortunately the deals have not been bestowed 
upon us where we've put in a few different offers   on some stuff especially gpus we'll go through 
those deals right now we've got a gtx 1050 ti 4   gigabyte now they're asking 180 for this i 
put an offer of 150 they came back at 160.   i came back again and said 150 is my max 
and this is the thing about deals hunting   if you guys have watched over the previous 
episodes you'll know that i always stick to   strict budgets especially if that item isn't 
collectible or if it's not unique in this case   this 1050 ti msi4 gig is not unique in any way 
shape or form and you do sometimes make those   exceptions say for instance if i saw a mars 580 
for sale i'd be like okay this is extremely rare   maybe i can push up the budget on what i think 
it's worth versus what i can get it for but in   this case 150 is the max i'll go because making a 
flip in a gaming pc means that any offer over that   i'm just eating into my own profit and then we go 
over to the gtx 760 and they're asking 75 bucks i   put an offer of 50 they came back and they just 
said no it's not available so i like that i mean   honestly i like it when you just people just 
say look nope reject you straight away rather   than leave you hanging because pretty much all the 
deals i put in offers on yesterday either i mean   most actually half the people got back to me and 
just said no it's too low or i'm not interested or   they came back and put in a response where it was 
like maybe a hundred dollars in the case of the   rtx 3060 they came back and said they wanted 950 
and i'm like well why would i buy use for 950   when i can go and buy new for 950 and get you know 
receipt warranty i know the the products brand new   in the box etc so but the people who didn't get 
back to me they're just not interested in that   offer at all and they're waiting for someone to 
come very close or of course at the asking price   of that offer then we've got the gtx 660 they're 
saying today only i put in an offer yesterday   and i just said look did you take 40 bucks they're 
actually like a five minute drive from me and   then they came back and they said no it's not 
available so they obviously want 60 bucks but   yesterday it was 60 today only 60 dollars what 
what's this i mean the today only marketing and   it's just got no meaning whatsoever for this ad 
so we've now waited for three and a half hours   i've been checking out the marketplace for 
more deals and i guess this is just a monday   now so i've exhausted all my options here over the 
weekend and there is that classical song that says   and it says it for a reason because 
there's no deals on a monday   anyhow guys in terms of the deals on i think 
yesterday we absolutely nailed it i'll put the   total tally up again because we're pretty much 
running off yesterday's tally 1820 aussie dollars   and that would calculate to around 1370 usd i 
think off the top of my head in us dollars so   it's a pretty good part time consider we've got 
five pcs we've got four gpus and we've also got   a heap of hard drives two i7s and also four 
monitors and a ryzen 5 3600 and a motherboard   and that came with a cooler as well so do 
let us know in the comment section below   what you guys think was the best deal of the 
parts hunt this month for june 2021 and also   on that note too i'll tell you one thing 
i am noticing but we will do a live stream   very soon here on the channel talking about the 
metas and the trends with pricing and pc parts   but what i was noticing this month so far is that 
we've got more supply coming in we just got all   the people who are wanting to sell the stuff want 
those high prices so the mentality of the market   has to adjust now and so what you're going 
to see going forward in the next month   i feel is more supply coming in but then people 
aren't prepared to budge just yet and then what   happens is people start needing money they want to 
get rid of stuff so then you start seeing people   undercut each other where the supply starts to 
build up and that of course means lower prices   but of course in terms of new gpus we've still got 
to wait for that profitability drop on ethereum   that's the big one i'm watching that every 
day and if we see a massive crash in that   then that's going to spell a lot cheaper gpus for 
everyone so that's what we're waiting for hope   you guys enjoyed this month's part-time as well 
i'm going to keep on going and sifting through   and always sniffing out finding that bargain and 
of course in the process providing a little bit   of entertainment hope you guys enjoy this one 
be sure to hit that like button mates and if   you have stayed this far and are enjoying the 
tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub   button and ring the bell to get the vids as soon 
as they drop peace out from there now bye world
