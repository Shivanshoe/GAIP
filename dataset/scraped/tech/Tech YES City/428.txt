sometimes when you get an old server motherboard in and it's got support for 2 X 56 77 Zeon's there's a setting in the BIOS called Numa and I've heard from people in the past that having this setting enabled can increase your FPS in games and then on the other hand I've also heard people say having this setting disabled can increase your FPS and today we're going to be putting this to the test where we're gonna be testing out both enabled and disabled to see if it really does make a difference having this thing on or off but before we get into it what exactly is Numa well it stands for non-uniform memory access in that if you've got this setting enabled it will allow a CPU in a dual CPU configuration for example to access the memory that it's tied into locally faster than it would access the memory tied in locally to the other CPU and so if you disable this for example then the memory will be accessed at the same speed from both CPUs regardless of where it is so technically if an application has been programmed well then it should be able to benefit from having this setting enabled though with the case with programs and even games we know that a lot of these games out there aren't programmed well if you're a PC gamer and you've been gaming for a while you'll definitely be able to attest to this especially when it comes to console ports though since we just came off the back of putting this system together where if you haven't seen that video I'll put the link up here we did run a number of different tests both at 1080p and 1440p as well as some streaming benchmarks though now we're finally going to disable this setting and compare it with the setting enabled to see how much of a difference there is in FPS there before we do a quick message from today's video sponsor if you're trying to play games with your friends and they can't see you over all the white noise on your mic or you've just got terrible onboard audio then creatives g3 is the solution for you a USB portable DAC and solution with a good and solid mic input as well as having enough power to push through that base properly on your headphones and the ability to plug up to a console and give you better audio this is the solution you've been looking for links in description below to find out more so running through the specs of this system it's an old super micro motherboard with support for 2 X 5500 Zeon's or X 5600 Zeon's the X 5600 series is the better pic being on 32 nanometer and supporting up to 6 cores and twelve threats though the CPUs we've used here today are the X 5677 s therefore cause eight threads each and they have a base clock of 3.4 6 gigahertz so combining them now gives us eight cores and sixteen threats we've also got sixteen gigabytes of ECC registered memory which is another benefit since that memory can be had for very cheap so if you're able to pick up one of these motherboards you can get a lot of price performance for your dollar and the gravity scale we're going with is the 5500 XT though the first title we're pulling up here is csgo where max FPS is desirable from not only pros but pretty much anyone who wants to be competitive in this game and what we saw here with numeron abled was that both 1080p and 1440p we were getting way better FPS than having neumann disabled it was to the tune of roughly 25 percent at both resolutions not to mention the point one percent lows fed a lot better as opposed to having Numa disabled so when it comes to this title in particular you will definitely want to have numeron abled on an old CPU like this moving out of Warhammer Kaos Bane we had here at 1080p and 1440p pretty much the exact same results on both sides of the fence with numeron abled and Numa disabled it was one of the first titles I've seen where I've got exact identical FPS at these resolutions so in other words even a 1080p this game is CPU bound but what we saw in the differences between Numa on versus off was that there was a significant boost in FPS to the tune of roughly 33 percent going from 66 and 65 to 86 and actually is funny because the first time I've done benchmarking where I've seen the 1440p numbers beat the 1080p numbers even though it was just by one FPS it was funny to see this with the Numa disabled setting next up is shadow of the trim ray at 1080p we got a victory with numeron abled scoring roughly about ten percent more performance at 1080p though moving over to 1440p saw us get pretty much identical average FPS and the minimum was only one lowest range Brigade followed in a similar trend to that of shadow of the Tomb Raider scoring identical FPS both at 1080p and 1440p though I do know with my testing in the past that this is an extremely well optimised title even to the point where if you've got a low clocked memory like 21 33 megahertz memory in a single stick you're not going to be getting much of a difference having even thirty six hundred megahertz memory even with a higher-end graphics card and for the last title we've got none other than fortnight and we've got here on low settings with the distance set to epic this is apparently what the pros like to use and we saw here at 1080p we did get a significant boost in fps going from 162 to 194 though at 1440p we then went from 159 to 166 so 1440p seemed to even out the odds but of course at this resolution that GPU is starting to get more stressed than the CPU is hence why the 1440p numbers showed a drop on both sides but it was more significant on the numeron abled side since that was getting more FPS at 1080p to begin with so basically out of those five titles i've tested i got enough information here to say simply leave numr on if you're gaming on older Zeon's like this on a dual socket motherboard this setting in particular the numerable Eve it's had some good progression in the last few years especially thanks to AMD's collaboration with Microsoft in respects to their thread Ripper CPUs which do utilize this setting and since they are high-end desktop consumer parts they are in ways designed for Windows 10 users and we know for a fact just like those 11 herbs and secret spices that the kernel is super important when it comes to an OS it's basically the core of an OS and so AMD of collab created with Microsoft especially with their rise and thread Ripper chips and since these were made for high-end desktop users which a lot of those users use Windows 10 this has received really good updates over the last few years and those updates have been able to span over now to these Jules Eon setups and make them much more viable in Windows 10 environment not just for games but other productivity applications too so in a nutshell if you're building a dual socket system then definitely leave this setting on and set and forget and another thing I did do on this system which I do on a lot of older Zeon's and I 720 604 example is I disabled the spectrum meltdown updates since I'm an individual user I don't have any virtual machines or no one else's on my network they can steal my daughter I don't believe in leaving this setting on though the performance differences between disabling this and enabling this are quite significant too if you want to check out more info on that I'll put the link to that video up here though do let us know in the comments section below what you think about this Numa setting have you tried enabling disabling in the past have you got any anomalies that differ from today's results love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and we've got the question of the day here which comes from hit chim goo cheetah and they asked should I flash the RX 480 to rx 580 and this is coming off the back of our previous video that we did where we were flashing a rx 5700 into a 5700 XT and basically I found in the past with flashing our X 480 s to 5 80s it can sometimes work sometimes it'll work and it just won't work properly in that once you load up your games you may get some flickering and in other words the either the GPU core or the memory on that Arc's 480 just aren't up to the task of running at those rx 580 speeds so with that one it is a gamble I don't know if you should try it or not it's up to you if you're pretty well-versed in custom flashing GPUs and you know how to flash your way back if something happens then you can definitely try it but if you don't really know what you're doing or it's the first time flashing I would advise against anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that
