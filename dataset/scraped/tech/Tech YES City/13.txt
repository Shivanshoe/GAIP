have you ever thought i want a gravis card and it's 12 years old but it only costs 15 well if that's you then the gtx 580 may be just the card however you may be wondering what games can it play in 2022 to the point where maybe you just want to play some games at 1080p low settings or if it can't even play games at 1080p can this gtx 580 play games at 720p well in today's video we are going to test this against the top five steam games to see if it's the graphics card for you or of course if you want to spend a little bit more and get something else are you tired of seeing this annoying

description below welcome back to tech yes city and here we have a graphics card that i picked up on a used parts hunt this was labeled as essentially junk even though they gave a seven day guarantee and upon getting at home i did my usual antics of pulling the card apart cleaning it up applying some more thermal paste and then it was ready to go where the temperatures were actually pretty decent considering this card only has a single blower fan and it is quite power hungry they're getting straight into these games the first game that we tested here was cs go and here's where we played at 1080p on the lowest settings and this was tested with an i7 4770k and 16 gigabytes of ddr3 and here's where the game played absolutely fine getting over 180 average fps the 1 lows were also very good however the 0.1 percent lows did dip quite low and then moving over to dota 2 this is where again at 1080p low settings at 100 screen resolution we're getting over 100 average fps with a 1 low of 38 and a 0.1 percent low of 27 and what these numbers mean is that if the 1 lows are over 30 for example you should be getting a decent experience however the 0.1 percent lows being as low as they are in both dota 2 and cs go does mean that you will get the occasional micro stutter that may be noticeable even on a 60 hertz monitor however moving to the next game here arc survival this game is quite gpu intensive however this game does have the option to lower the settings and at 1080p low settings here we were getting actually over 60 average fps on the gtx 580 so not a bad feat considering that this game is quite demanding even in 2022 though moving on to the next title here was apex legends and this just simply would not play properly at 1080p low setting it was very choppy this car just simply did not have enough vram to run at this resolution so we dropped it down to 720p on the lowest settings and here's where we surprisingly got over 40 average fps coming in at 48 and then on the one percent low is 31 and then the 0.1 percent lows were 25 so it actually played quite smoothly even though the fps numbers weren't that high though for me personally i just could not play this game competitively at this resolution on a 1080p monitor at the very least where in the distance i really couldn't make out where the enemies were so it made it very hard when it came to having long distance skirmishes with the enemies though besides that you can still pick up some frags though the gtx 580 may leave you wanting a little bit more if apex legends is your game of choice and if that is the case maybe we should check out a graphics card like the gtx 970 then moving on to the next title here we had fortnight and here's where we tested at 1080p low settings we didn't even go into performance mode because the gtx 580 could actually handle this game 1080p low settings getting an average of 95 fps and then one percent lows of 68 however the 0.1 percent lows just like most the other titles here were very low but i do believe this has to do in this case with fortnite itself the engine being that it just stutters on pretty much everything even on the latest and greatest hardware though for the last title on steam there is a game called lost ark and i just simply couldn't get this game to install it seems like there's something to do with like a geo blocking that's happening with me here in japan so it didn't even let me install the game so instead of testing with that game we actually decided to test with fortnite so there it is with the gtx 580 a card that's essentially been forgotten by a lot of enthusiasts myself included mainly because of its high power draw but also because of the fact that it doesn't have a hd encoder built on so you can't use things like shadow play and also with its 1.5 gigabytes of vram it does leave it very limited in terms of what games it can play not only 1080p but even at 720p meaning that it does leave a lot more to be desired but that said if you want to build a gaming pc and you're on an extreme budget say for instance you're building something for your kids and they're like i just want to play cs go and you're thinking to yourself well if you just want to play cs go i can save some money and i can go with a budget card like this then it's going to be a pretty good option however if you want to play a game like apex legends or say there's a very popular battle royale that comes out in the future then i believe this card is just not going to do it for you and you may wish to spend a little bit more money and get something like we said before a gtx 970 which when we tested that in a recent video it performed really good i was actually very impressed with what the 9 series cards can do even in 2022. and so there it is with the gtx 580 and in fact when it comes to gtx 500 series cards the maximum i'm prepared to pay is around 25 considering i would put them in a budget gaming pc sell the pc to someone who wants to play cs go dota 2 or maybe another title like roblox or fortnite but in that realm it is limited to pretty much those easy to play free-to-play multiplayer games and that's where the card does fit in perfectly but the age of the card does give concern to how much life it will have left especially if that gtx 580 has been used quite heavily given its high power draw it probably doesn't have a whole lot of life left in it anyhow guys i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comment section below how much would you be prepared to pay for a gtx 500 series card or if you would just avoid it completely love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from daniel carey and they ask is your car gas or electric if it's gas you must be taking a decent hit and so my car in australia actually sold that recently because i feel like demand for especially used cars for example will be on the way down so i wise will sell my car before things get worse and my kind of thinking is well if i could sell for a high price now i can probably buy it for a lower price later and i'm gonna stick to that belief but when it comes to japan here i actually am driving a what's known as a k car at the moment they're 660 cc engines they're very efficient on gas even in japan here the prices of gasoline is actually very fair considering especially what it is in australia at the moment where i'm originally from where it's going up to around 2.20 a liter here it's around a dollar sixty a liter and that said it is a hundred octane here so the gasoline is kind of like what 98 octane would be in australia but it's even better so really not too concerned about gas prices in japan considering my car is very efficient on gas here and the prices aren't as bad as they are in australia hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to subscribe and hit that bell and i'll see you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
