we humans need to stick together yes me lord more lumber is required
righto you require my assistance job so today we're going to be building
something i haven't done before personally and that is an
open frame gaming pc and this frame here can be
had off aliexpress and it doesn't come that cheap
and when i got it i was kind of like well that's actually a pretty small box
and it's not a whole lot of case you wouldn't think okay
that is a pc case but apparently it is and we're going to build it
with the instruction manuals that do not come in english
so just two little pieces of paper and i have to figure out the rest
but that aside we have a build here that's got a bit of a mix of components
some that i've pulled out of a trade-in pc others that i have been someone
donated this thinking it was faulty in terms of a surge protection on but it
was actually their motherboard when i spoke to them about it and then
we've got here a 120 gigabyte ssd and an i7 870 with a
motherboard that was in a dumpster pull out that i
got in a heap of cases with just rubbish
some of these motherboards had heap of bent pins this one had a few
bent pins but I bent them back and then we've got eight gigabytes of
ddr3 memory now this build is going to be
for a special game that i hold to my heart and that is warcraft 3
and they've remastered this game and i've seen the reviews online people are
saying it's terrible but i really need to get back into this game
i used to love playing it and looking at the specs they're saying
that this thing really doesn't need a whole lot at all
you could run this thing on like a rotten potato that's
how easy it is to run apparently but of course since i want the
highest fps possible in this old school game and i'm hoping the graphics are
remastered a bit i'm thinking this build should be
perfect for the job but there's only one way to find out
and that is to put it together and see if there's any problems
and if there isn't any problems then we'll start installing warcraft 3. but
before that we'll quickly put the build tally up here for you guys
and then we'll get to buildings [Music] now one thing about graphics cards like
these this is a gtx 780 and if you can find someone that's
upgrading their pc a lot of the times you can get a free
part off them especially if they think it is
faulty and in the case of this gtx 780 someone sent it in
thinking it was indeed faulty when it was actually their motherboard
that was faulty and not the graphics cards so if your friends are upgrading
their pcs and they've got parts that they just don't need anymore and they're
going to give them away then definitely take advantage of that
depending on where you live in the world [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music]
and here it is here actually after a few hours of completing this build
we finally got it finished and we've got to power it up now
see if everything's smooth but one thing about this case is it's so tedious
because you've got to get all the little spaces right
between the motherboard spacing and the manual is
i like i don't even know why they included the manual because
there's parts in here that aren't there and then there's parts missing and
even the sheets just like got these six steps that just
say nothing in between so what i had to do was go look at the original picture
online and then just reverse engineer it and
then put it together that way and so we've now got the build it's all
complete and i gotta say it is pretty firm it's all in together but we
still got our i o shield here hey i'm an io shield i'm still attached
not for long [Music] [Music]
what is it now [Music] brilliant what is it now
yes my friend you require my assistance our horses are under attack well well require my assistance our hero give me something to do what is it now wait till you see me in
action brilliant well
we're gone with it give me something to do
throw them away throw them away not enough um um um and so we're just about to start testing
out war zone here we can see right up in that top corner we're getting like 30
fps this is so desirable for your frame rates i mean the human eye can't see
more than 5 fps anyway so this is just totally perfect for our gaming
experience let's give this a shot anyway and see
how it performs in warzone i mean it's gone up to 60 already so that's a good
sign hopefully if we can get 60 fps out of this thing
and it doesn't start it too much then it should be okay
storm earth and fire heed my car [Music] and now we've just finished testing up
this pc with warcraft 3 reforged and also
decided to test call of duty warzone mainly because that's the when
you go to flip the pc people just want to know how it performs
in warzone can it run warzone so first of all
yes it can run warzone around 60 fps at 100 screen resolution 1080p low
settings which was quite surprising it did quite well and it was very smooth
in order to do that of course you could drop the render resolution
play with a little bit higher fps but for what it's worth 60fps a smooth 60fps
is always a good thing and this pc did provide that
even without the ability to overclock the memory or the cpu
but then we move on to warcraft 3 reforge and i was actually surprised
here because i thought this thing would be able to do like 240 fps
but it didn't it only went up to around 112 average i think after i did a
massive benchmark on it and even then the 0.1 lows
were like really low but i noticed that only happening when
there was major event changes in the game so say for instance
you go from your normal gold mining to your low up keep and that is when you
build enough units your population goes over 50 you then drop down to mining
seven gold and when that happened i noticed the 0.1
lows dipped a little bit but in battles it was very smooth the
graphics seemed to be a lot better than the og version
but that being said i mean i can see where the negative reviews are coming
from they're charging like 45 aussie dollars
just for pretty much the same game that i paid for all those years ago
uh just with a re uh slapped on texture pack and higher
resolutions that's kind of what it feels like but
i still really enjoyed this game and one thing that comes out of warcraft 3
reforged is is that this is how like really good rts
games were designed and i really miss it i absolutely love this game
i love the original brood war and just playing it again
brings back the feels so despite the blizz attacks on this game all these
years later it did play quite nicely so maybe a lot
of those negative reviews were when the game was first released
and it was quite buggy and it was crashing because i didn't really
experience any problems while i was playing this
game except the 0.1 percent lows but again
this hardware isn't the best to begin with but i was pretty surprised that the
game was cpu demanding at least in terms of
single thread performance so if you want to get the
atmos best fps out of warcraft 3 your gpu you will need a decent gpu if you
want to up the graphics but you're definitely going to need a
high single thread performance to get the most out of that
so this game i came in like thrown a few jabs thinking this system was going to
own it but then warcraft 3 re-forged had that
reforged hammer and did a counter attack and i was just uh taken away by
i didn't even know i just quickly got stunned mid video
though with all that out of the way do let us know
in the comments section below are you digging this
open air build that we did here with this budget aliexpress case
i mean the end product is pretty cool i'm personally liking it
definitely don't buy something like this if you've got animals or anything that
runs around freely and it's prone to i guess dropping
something or spilling some liquids on it but other
than that if you've got a quiet area where you are
this thing comes in a really cheap price point i think it was like 35
usd when i got it i had to pay 10 gst australian tax and of course
converting usd into aussie dollars does raise the price a bit
but for what it's worth it ends up working out if you're on a budget and
you just want a cheap case to get you by then this thing
does everything you can pick it up all at one time and it holds together
the one thing to keep in mind with this thing it will take you a while to get
your head around okay how do i actually build this thing
because the included instruction manual when i saw that and i started trying to
work out what it was trying to say i just threw it in the bin i looked at
the final product of the case itself on aliexpress and
then i realized okay let's just build it this way
and it ended up working out for me despite parts actually missing from the
instruction manual and how to properly complete it now with
all that out of the way we've got a gaming pc here that's ready to rock and
roller and if you guys enjoyed today's warcraft 3 reforged
gaming pc then be sure to hit that like button for
us also let us know in the comments section below do you play rts
if so what is your favorite rts game for me it's definitely a toss-up between
brood war and warcraft 3. i love the both of them
because there's that dynamic in those games where if you make one
little mistake the game's not over i feel like in starcraft 2 you make one
mistake the game is finished and that's sort of
like that's why i didn't really get into starcraft 2 that much because
focuses a lot more on the micro as opposed to warcraft 3 and especially
brood war the micro and the macro balance each
other out same with age of empires as well i'm really looking forward to age
of empires four where you need that mix of micro and
macro and you need to get it on point so bring me back to those glory days of
rts just like this question of the day here with another terrible segue for you
guys and this comes from herbeus here and they ask
is this comparison correctly done out of a case
wouldn't it be accurate to test inside one i don't have
an idea i'm just wondering and they're referring to our video where we tested
out the wraith prism i'll put the link up here and actually i really like this
question i picked it out for one reason and that is depending on who you
go to you're going to get a different opinion
because accurate would be at least 100 accuracy would be testing every single
different scenario out there which no reviewer has time for we can't
test out every single case with that particular cooler
because we just wouldn't have a life or we wouldn't even have a video because it
would just never get made but when it comes to an open air test
system i actually personally feel like it's a great middle ground
where it's going to give you better temperatures generally than a really bad
stuffy case with no airflow but at the same time it's not going to
give you as good a result as a case with really good airflow
in a push-pull configuration and so that's why i test on open-air test
systems because i've always got a correct apples to apples comparison
and i can actually relate that to previous data that i've tested in the
past and another thing is too if something's bad on an open air test
system it's generally going to be bad in general so
that's the most important thing at least when we're testing tech is getting to
the recommendation and making sure you guys are getting a good deal or
getting at least a premium product if it's an overpriced
product for what you're paying for and you're not getting hosed
anyway hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon if you stayed this far and you want to
keep seeing that content around tech yeah city the good old
tech yes bangers here then be sure to hit that sub button
ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye [Music]
yes
