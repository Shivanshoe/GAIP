so here i am doing my thing building up a little 
budget banger and all of a sudden i get a message   about someone wanting to trade an xbox series s 
for a gaming pc and at the moment i am out of gpus   that would be around that price point and 
a pc to trade for a series s but i do have   my little potato so i said look this is all 
i can do at the moment and they messaged me   back and they said sure i want this thing i 
want a pc asap i got the series s for trade   and they said look let's do this trade so we're 
just going to quickly check out what this pc is   and then we'll put it in the car and we'll go do 
the trade and we'll talk about the pc market in   general as well especially for you guys who are 
trying to sell pcs right now you want to know   what the update is on the current pc market i can 
help give you some answers so let's get into it   do you feel like this when you see this well if 
so you can get rid of that windows activation   message with today's video sponsor scd keys for as 
little as 12 usd after you use that coupon bftyc   you can get activated today links in description 
below so here's the pc right here it's a gtx   460. i know before you laugh i did tell the 
person who wanted to trade it i said look guys   i don't have any gpus like that around xbox series 
s performance at the moment i've sold out of them   and i said this is all i can do right 
now and they said look i just need a pc   to do some gaming at the moment doesn't matter if 
it's a potato so they wanted to really be on pc   maybe perhaps they wanted to play some dota 2 
or something and look i sometimes i don't ask i   just tell people look this is what i've got and 
this is all i can do for you and they accept it   so what we're going to do is we're going to drop 
this in the car right now go pick up this series s and we just got back now with the xbox series 
s and we managed to and we're gonna stop   at that word manage and we're gonna put a word 
before it and that is micro and so that's gonna   be micro manage and basically in 2016 2017 if 
you guys were following a lot of the used builds   i was micromanaging hard and basically we're 
returning to that level again where i'm going   to be personally that's what i'm going to be 
doing i'm going to be micromanaging much more   as opposed to last year where i was doing a 
lot of macro and that i was just getting builds   giving them a quick cleanups going through 
things a lot faster than i otherwise would   because the real demand was there and so it was 
more of a macro based market last year where   there was a lot more money flying around so if 
you're one of those people who like to build pcs   especially if you're like me and you like to 
resell them or if you're in the market to even   buy a pc then you may be wondering why if you're 
a buyer prices for pcs are still considerably high   but if you're a seller you can't really move 
your pc you notice sales are slowing down what   i'm talking about in today's video is mainly 
going to be what i'm seeing here locally in   australia especially to my experiences in buying 
and selling pcs but it may be different where you   are in the world some people in different parts 
of the world may have a little bit of a boom going   on at the moment especially if the government has 
different kinds of stimulus measures going through   different kinds of uh cycles going through your 
economy and that you're emerging from lockdown   economic activities picking up but those points 
aside we'll get back to the real demand because   that's the most important thing when it comes 
to buying and selling anything really in this   world it's not so much the supply it's so much the 
demand you can have a product that doesn't exist   and have no demand for it and the price is going 
to be zero but if you've got a product that's in   supply and the demand is higher for it then it 
will have a higher price now you're probably   like brian slow down for a second what what is 
this demand versus real demand well when it comes   to pcs i would call this a weird sort of this 
is one thing i'm going to be coining it myself   because it's how i like to see things 
and that is the amount of pcs for sale   versus the amount of buyers wanting to buy 
those pcs and so right now what we can see   is there's a lot of pcs for sale if i go to my 
local marketplace it's easy to go get a gaming   pc there's quite a few of them available but 
overall there are less gaming pcs on the market   than there once was and more importantly it's 
getting harder for sellers to source parts at   what the market wants to pay for a particular 
gaming pc with a particular set of specs   and hence this is where our problem starts to come 
in for the seller but if we look at the amount of   buyers in the market right now i'd say it's a lot 
less than it was this time last year so our real   demand is low but that's pretty much coming from 
the balance of last year where the real demand was   ridiculously high and remember when people 
tell you that there's a balance to all things   they're not joking because there literally is 
a balance to all things and if you're trying   to sell a gaming pc right now it's just a simple 
procedure of you're simply going to have to become   more competitive to get a sale as opposed to last 
year where it was much easier to sell your pc now   what if you are a buyer well here's where things 
get a lot more interesting in my opinion because   this could go two different ways now one of these 
scenarios could mean that we get very cheap prices   and you're able to build a gaming pc for very 
cheap for a certain amount of time the other   scenario would mean that we have ups and downs in 
prices but it's really a slow market and it's much   like if you're trying to sell the pc you're trying 
to buy the pc the market is just going to suck   so we'll get on to the sucky scenario first so now 
i am wondering brian prices are still pretty high   i can't pick up a gaming pc for anywhere near 
the prices that i could get in say 2018 or 2019   what's going on and now this in my opinion has to 
do with a completely different thing in the market   known as what i've been talking about on the 
channel recently known as stagflation and that's   basically inflation crossed over with low economic 
activity in other words real demand is going down   yet the real supply of products is also going 
down and so that means higher prices still wins   out in the end and so that is a stagflationary 
environment in a nutshell for you guys and so   when we look at gaming pcs the amount of people 
selling graphics cards for instance there's   nowhere near the amount of people selling these 
things as there was before the pandemic started   but if we contrast that to the other parts like 
ssds and ddr4 memory in cases the manufacturers   like azus and msi they're resorting to bundling 
their gravis cards in with a lot of these products   because the supply is actually much higher than 
the demand and they don't want to lower the prices   because they have what is known as a price 
floor where if the prices go under that level   it's no longer profitable for them to make that 
product so they therefore have to stop production   and so if we look at this vicious cycle 
of inflation that could in the future   mean higher priced ssds higher priced everything 
if the supply is cut because it's more expensive   to manufacture those parts in the first place 
but as it stands for now prices of these things   are still pretty good which is why i do suggest if 
you can build a pc minus the graphics card or even   just go with a cheap rx 470 or something like 
that even though you're going to be overpaying for   it in the current market then you can wait it 
out until graphics cards do get cheaper which   don't worry they will because stagflation and 
inflation will hit the prices of cryptocurrencies   where no one will have any money to buy 
them because they're a non-essential item   and as opposed to essential items that's what 
people will need and so they'll have to pay the   higher prices for those leaving them less money 
to pay for non-essential items and that means the   prices of those things will come down versus the 
prices of essential items which will go up and so   going forward there's going to be massive pressure 
and this is what i said in the past there's going   to be massive amounts of pressure on nvidia and 
amd to do something to deter crypto miners from   buying these graphics cards and getting them into 
the hands of gamers because that means that all   the other products that they sell for gaming pcs 
can then start being sold now the second scenario   related to that time frame really gets me excited 
because what we're seeing here with gravis cards   nvidia and amd and even intel coming into 
the market these guys want to keep pumping   out these graphics cards as fast as they can 
as many as possible because the profit is just   insanely high right now however if we hit this 
mark in the market where crypto profitability   just goes plummets which i think ethereum 
have talked about from august they're going   to be dropping the mining profitability a 
lot and also the move later on after that   which will mean that mining for ethereum will be 
irrelevant altogether and then of course all those   crypto miners will go to other cryptocurrencies 
and then that will just tank the profitability and   so we'll see a massive sell-off of graphics cards 
which will take everyone by surprise and with all   the other parts being cheap at the time you'll 
see this great period of where you can build a pc   for relatively cheap though that won't last 
forever of course because the cure for low prices   is low prices just like the cure for high prices 
is high prices but this is where we start to see   the idea behind especially what nvidia is doing 
and that is putting in those hash rate limiters   because they want to only get the cards out 
to gamers now because they want to keep the   market more in balance believe it or not because 
when that other scenario happens it's really bad   not just for their stock prices but also for 
their sales and that the gamers are then buying   the used graphics cards rather than going to the 
stores and buying a new graphics card which nvidia   makes profit on one but doesn't make any profit 
on the other but what about crypto and gpu prices   here's where the next video that i'm going to make 
i'm going to be talking about this directly and   although we have seen gpu prices drop and we have 
seen supply come back into stock it's a little   bit different to what anyone really envisioned 
i would i was hoping by now we would have seen   that rug already get pulled out from underneath 
crypto's feet and we would have seen much cheaper   gpu prices that golden period for pc gamers i hope 
that would have come about already but it seems to   be like we're halfway there and all's we need is 
that big catalyst but nvidia and the forces to be   will be stopping that as much as possible 
because they don't want that scenario to happen   and so they're trying to ease into those lower 
prices but the good thing is is if you've been   holding off from buying an overpriced graphics 
card you'll notice that the prices are coming down   and they will keep coming down because again 
the raw demand from gamers just isn't there this   year versus what it was last year so tldr if you 
are a seller in the market right now then you're   going to have to really be a lot more competitive 
than you once were for me i'm going to be micro   managing a lot more and for me personally i really 
enjoy the micro side of life just as much as i   enjoy the macro so you're probably like well brian 
shouldn't you be down about this and it's like no   because this is what i do and so i'm just riding 
the wave it's like if you go to the beach you just   wait for that good wave to come along and then you 
ride it and then the next one comes along and it   might not be as good so you can't predict how big 
the waves are going to be on any given day but one   thing for sure is if you're out there riding long 
enough then you may catch a good wave but it might   also get eaten by a shark so the news for sellers 
isn't really that good but if you're a buyer   then your patience has already paid off a little 
bit especially when we compare it to may prices   and it's definitely going to get even better do 
not worry about that anyhow guys that's it for   me today if you have any questions or comments or 
experiences of your own be sure to share them in   the comments section below and also be sure to 
hit that like button for us and i was gonna ask   for a sub ring the bell if you stayed this far 
and you're enjoying the content but i think the   best way to do it is i got told from someone just 
to uh go check out my youtube channel youtube.com   techyaccity and then just bookmark the page 
because youtube's notifications a lot of people   are telling me they just get unsubbed they don't 
see the content in their feeds so at least if you   just check on the content every couple of days 
you'll be able to get it as soon as it drops that   way and with that aside we do have the question 
of the day which comes from mr daxter crane   and they ask okay brian who gave you the ketamine 
he's too jovial in this video and uh lately i've   been um on higher spirits because i picked up 
and this is a little thing i picked up a gym   for 250 bucks aussie and this thing goes for about 
700 brand new but the best thing about it was   was that there i got this really good discount 
and the guy even built it up for me so   he barely used it i think he said he'd 
use it twice or something over six months   but it was just such a nice gesture so he bought 
it for seven hundred dollars built it up for   me even tested it out and then just gave me a 
massive discount and this was such a nice guy   but on a serious note that's the power of the 
used market if you look at supply and demand   and study it closely then you can always pick up a 
deal never forget that and so when we look at the   home gym at least where i am locally things are 
opening back up again gyms are opening up and so   people are going back to the gym and then people 
who bought these products thinking that they would   need them no longer need them or they got tired 
of them very quickly and so you can get a bargain   if you're in the right place at the right time 
and that's always going to change in relation to   what market is popping and booming at the time 
i'm sure if this was six or seven months ago   i wouldn't be able to find a home gym like 
this for anywhere near the money i'd have   to go buy it brand new and the prices of the 
brand new gyms would have been a lot more so   patience is a critical factor never get caught 
up in the hype because you'll probably end up   in the long run missing out anyhow guys i'll 
catch you on the next one peace out for now bye you
