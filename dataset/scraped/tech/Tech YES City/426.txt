it's time to start 2020 properly and that means used price-performance and picking up them deals though coming into the new decade there were some trends that were a little bit worrisome one of those being gravis cards there was simply overpriced at least last month when I went to check out gtx 1060 s ten fifties ten seventies even everyone wanted way too much at least compared to the new graphics cards but that's not a problem because this month I've already circumvented that problem because generally trends don't change very quickly and so what I've done is I went on eBay and I said this in a few videos during this month and I went got some 1660 supers and also some RT X 2060s so we've already done a preemptive strike on the used price performance scene this month I don't know if you guys remember Final Fantasy seven and you came into a battle and you had that pre-emptive strike and you're like yeah that's right I'm a boss anyway with that aside I am very hungry for some motherboards i7s things like that the core bare-bones components as I've got some cases I've got GPUs and power supplies are generally not a problem because places like you Mart and msy stock them for pretty decent prices so let's get on good old gam tree and Facebook marketplace and see what we can find and we'll also call Liz as well as a newcomer into the game they called me they've wanted to see what deals they can offload to me so this will be a very interesting month [Music] so the first deal I managed to find and put an offer on was an online 290 they wanted 110 Ozzy so I put an offer of 90 Ozzy they said one of the display ports of the back doesn't work but that's not a problem if you've got all the other displays working and as long as it works fine so that would be a pretty good deal at that price the next deal that we found was 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory they wanted ADIZ dollars are put down an offer 60 Aussie dollars waiting for them to get back to me great for like a budget build especially coming into something like an i-5 6600 or something like that and you want to offer 16 gigabytes of RAM that definitely constitutes good value to the next one up here is looking like it's a really dirty PC of course this is my specialty I can apply some check yes loving and it's got a nice aged 55 azuz motherboard in it and what looks like a pretty solid power supply and a one terabyte hard drive the RAM and CPU are of low value but hopefully they take my offer and we can make something out of this build and then next up we've got 1050 Ti they want 150 I'm putting in an offer of 110 ozzie and then another 1050 Ti as well same price point 150 we put it another offer of 110 for that and then there was a GTX 1060 for 160 I've dropped down an offer of a hundred and 25 and then interestingly enough a risin 939 hundred X they said they've upgraded to a 39 50 X similarly for 680 but if I can drop in an offer and get it for 600 Aussie that'll be a pretty good pick up considering these things go for over 800 ozzie new here in australia so yeah if we get it at 75 percent of the price it goes for new then that's definitely a bargain though moving on with some failed offers I guess there was a I 7 6700 they wanted 200 I put down an offer of 130 they came back and said it just sold and then those are gtx 950 where they want an 80 i put down an offer for a 60 they said someone offers them 70 i'm not gonna bother with it and then there's a gtx 750 which i put down an offer 40 ozzie dollars and they're like can you come pick it up tonight so it looks like we've got one definite deal here and some potentials out in the air so we'll have to wait and see if those people come back to us on all the other potentials but it looks like we've got two GTX 750 so far they're going through Facebook Marketplace I found a lot of double listings that were on gumtree and I've already put offers on them and you don't usually double offer as it does give off a sense of desperation so what we found here was a z97 motherboard as well as an i7 4790 s so they wanted 200 ozzie I've put in an offer of 150 Aussie and maybe a little bit high but the motherboard is a good motherboard it's a solid board that will look good in a build and that should hopefully help sell the build better than it otherwise would otherwise with the mediocre motherboard the max out offers like 120 so that motherboard is pretty solid though moving on to the next potential deal is a 49 30 K they want 80 Ozzie dollars I put an offer a 60 Ozzie if we can pick this up that'll actually be a really nice CPU for the money though with those offers out of the way the market is definitely still a vulture pit I can tell by what's up the sale where I've got to go high and low to try and find some unique deals anyway it's time to call les and see what he's got yeah good night how's things yeah it's been a it's been a while eh nah mate just been I came into New Year's came in a New Year's just with the cloud in my head eh and then I now if things are ramping up again so yeah and so is the used parts mates what have you potentially got for us [Music] do you use any second-gen when I was yeah I can use a few year so I've only got a couple don't come with regards to the the power set up with their call this 500 Lenovo is 500 what Jen are they close Jen okay and I'll take a look at them yeah okay coming I'll just come and check it out okay cool mate all right I'll see you then catch ya okay that's it [Music] so now we've got a quick update and I actually didn't go to leathers place just yet because I called someone who a few months ago dropped off a neck 79 Borden er processor and then I gave him a call before and they said that they had a heap of stuff that they had saved up it's all untested and that do me some really good deals on this stuff so we're starting here with this this was an X 58 board with no RAM and a power supply and like some really crappy graphics card and stuff they did this for 50 ozzie dollars and I said sure I'll take the gamble on that then we're moving over here to a 1650 I believe Xeon system and everything here I got this for a hundred Aussie dollars I said yeah I'll definitely take that and then below that was a laptop with an i7 4600 you or something like that they said it works they've tested it but it has no charger or battery so they did that for $70 yeah I'll take that too and then over here is a PC that's definitely seen better days and this one's a z87 motherboard I don't know what CPU it's got in it but it's got looks like 16 gigabytes of RAM GTX 780 and an RM 850 eye power supply now they said there was no signal so it could be the motherboard that's gone on this because I know these g43 they did have a tough time back in the day and so I was guessing that was the problem and so they did this for $100 dollars and I said yes sure I'll take that as well and then we had this one here the last of the bunch which was a real lucky dip this one didn't turn on at all so I'm guessing the power supply blew out but it's a z77 I was 16 you have to ram massive d14 cooler so I'm guessing there's possibly a 3770k under the hood and this one was again a hundred of those I've taken a few Gamble's here but I'm figuring like gamble plus gamble plus gamble Plus gamble will equal success because I've usually had a lot of success in the past and to be honest the guys sold me pots in the past and they've all worked fine so I was like yes definitely and so ID to it and got all these parts but what we're gonna do now is go ahead up to lasers because there's still some parts that I've got on the road I managed to score they're sixteen gigabytes of ddr4 for $60 we need to pick up that as well and see what the tech yes situation is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now we just got back from this roller coaster of deals and I ended up picking up five twenty four inch monitors from LEDs for about fifty ozzie dollars a pop he did have some 22s but I decided the 24s are the cream of the crop so I went with them and then we've got our two Lenovo's these are 2nd gens and he did them with RAM CPU cooler 4 7 th of pop and it's nearly enough he had a keyboard and this was a g7 10 plus and I was like how much do you want for this thing and he just said 20 bucks and I mean it's a little bit dirty but I'm gonna give us some tech guests loving and that's essentially a pretty expensive keyboard if I remember correctly because it's got like mechanical switches in it possibly Omron's old Browns or something like that and then we got this GPU here and I actually messaged someone a while ago about a GTX 960 and they had a lot 480 Aussie dollars and Alfred I'm 60 and I said that would take it I said well I wasn't coming up for Brisbane for a few days and they said look your feedbacks pretty high he looked like a decent dude I'll hold it for you and I was like sure thing and I realized it was actually the limited-edition one so looks pretty cool and at 60 Aussie dollars for a 960 that's a pretty good pickup and then we also picked up that RAM the to 8 gigabytes sticks of ddr4 memory we ended up getting that for $60 so 16 gigabytes so it's a pretty good pickup and then also it lasers I ended up getting 6 2 terabyte hard drives for 200 Aussie dollars and something that I desperately need 2 terabyte hard drives and since it like 70 bucks at the stores I'm getting under half price so that's always a good deal in my eyes especially since they're actually higher-end models then there's entry-level models so I believe there was like a few Western Digital Purple's in there too so like these ones as well Western Digital Purple's so they're actually really high-quality and then underneath that is two pcs we also picked up at lenses he said look do you have any use for these he was asking a hundred initially for me I just had looks since I'm getting a lot of stuff what would you want so one was a elite elite desk HP so these are pretty good they usually work with newer graphics cards too and it's got an i5 2400 you want $100 dollars I said look wouldn't take 80 he said yes so I can slaughter graphics card in that make it like a budget for tonight gaming PC that's a pretty easy pickup and then beside that was an i7 870 rig and a gig ram so I saw that I was like cool okay how is blind all that jazz he won $100 dollars I dropped in 80 and he accepted that too and then this big one right beside it is actually a different story altogether I helped someone out setting up their new rise in PC and helping them through all the steps and stuff like that and they just said look would you like my old PC and I said sure thing man so I don't even know what's inside this and I'm actually really tired so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna unearth this PC as well as test out those pcs that we got that were untested before and see what the problems are with those pcs tomorrow and we'll also talk about some of the offers where people came back I got rejected but some of the other stuff that got sold as well and possibly even have a look for some more stuff like graphics cards but man graphics cards this month and even last month even it's looking really grim so far in terms of getting a decent deal on used GPUs but also in terms of laser stuff he also quality checks all his stuff before he sells it so I've never had one problem with the stuff that he said works and it does work gar mister plankin it is now the next morning here the tech s studio and we've opened up this case right here the mystery box I was hoping to fly this thing up there was like no Palace play and so we kind of fire it up but we do have inside FX I think would be an eight-core under that water cooler and 32 gigabytes of RAM so that was the biggest win of this free PC here 32 gigabytes so really happy about that it looks like we've got a graphics card included but this case as well after I give it some tech yes loving this will come up really nice I think I've done a build in one of these before actually a really cool case I like it and will probably just leave the components in there and clean them all up but maybe just put like 8 gigabytes of RAM in and a budget power supply and just sort of like flip it as a budget for tonight gaming PC so that one's got some potential I just I don't think I'll be checking it today judo having no power supply get in there my 2 gigabyte friends get in there so hard to do gram with one hand while you're holding the camera with the elbow oh did it GT 640 Wow life can be cruel sometimes [Music] and here's our Logitech G 710 and after five minutes of some tech yes loving it's now feeling like a brand new keyboard so now going through the list of offers I put in yesterday and what happened with that the 3900 X guy just never got back to me same with the a nine to ninety so they mustn't check Gumtree a whole lot the gtx 1060 person did get back to me but they wanted to actually upgrade their GPU and they were like look I'll be on the Gold Coast on the 4th of February or something so that one's a little bit like I don't know what's going on with that one the 6700 guy sold his 6700 for a hundred and fifty Aussie sounds like fair value 1050 is those two of them and they both sold them for 130 each so that must have been someone looking for GPUs in Mass and then just going offering the same money on all these GPUs then go I'm picking him all up at the same time so we missed out on those and then the hundred and fifty dollar PC that was just like ready for the tip I offered 50 bucks on it I usually never do that but like honestly this thing is from what I see is probably worth about $50 max and so they came back at a hundred and I just said like look I'm taking a gamble at $50 as well because I don't know if it works and if the motherboard all the power supply works then I'll be breaking even so there was that and I'm waiting for them to get back to me but I mean I'm guessing someone will come in now and offer 60 but hey that's all good go get it and then there's the gtx 950 we offered 60 but they came back and said they've got another offer of 70 i said just go with that now they've come back to me today and said i know i'm happy to go with 60 and it's like well for me it's like i was already up in brisbane yesterday so that ship sailed like I've already been up in Brisbane done the parts on with all the tour and gone through and saw less so we missed out on that one what we're going to miss out on it because I'm not driving to Brisbane that's like an hour away just for a gtx 950 and what's next is a 750 so the 750 guy he said he'd take the offer but for $40 for the 750 but then he I messaged him yesterday on the way I was like y'all addressing time and they just never got back to us so that was unfortunate too so we ended up picking up that 960 fortunately but looks like with GPUs this month as I came into this parts hunt I thought it would be like last month where it's looking really grim especially to get a good deal on a used GPU and that's exactly the case and I've actually looked this morning on Facebook marketplace again woke up double-checked Gumtree as well and there's just no deals like there's people asking over $200 for a 970 and I mean even 1066 gigabytes 225 or some of that I mean these cards like just way overpriced especially when you can get new 1660 supers and 1650 supers and stuff like that on eBay sales would brand-new for around similar value like huh anyway I don't understand that use GPU market right now so that's why we're kind of like circumventing it on our tour for flipping but with that flipping aside let's get back to these used rigs on the desk the first ones that we got that were on tested and start testing them and see what comes out of that and here's the first PC here that we're testing through this bunch that we got unconfirmed and as soon as we hit the power supply on I want you guys to listen to this so that is definitely not a good sound considering the fan is not even spinning so it's something else inside its power supply that is really wrong so what we're gonna do is we're to pull the components out inside and then we're gonna see if the motherboard works that was some memory in it and the CPU since that is the most since that's the best prize of this whole PC I mean this case here we could use it for an office PC later but not a big deal anyway all right that is a x58 board that is working absolutely fine probably have to change the CMOS battery because it worked after I took that out and it's got a nice 7920 in it but I'm pretty sure this board can accept a Xeon after a BIOS update so that is one victory already and next up on the Shelf is this Xeon system that we picked up and the news is really good that his power supplies working everything's working noise isn't too loud and we got a 1650 Xeon so 6 cores 12 threads and we've got 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory inside even though it's registered for $100 dollars for this whole setup that is a steal oh and another thing too with Dells you got to look out if they've got the locked BIOS this one doesn't have a locked BIOS so that's great news sometimes if you get a Dell and they go to a lock box it's pretty hard to get around you've just got to hope and pray that your graphics card will work if you're using it for a gaming PC but if it basically in the in the boot order sometimes to get around that is you'll have to install Windows on another system and then use that disk and transport it over to your xeon system with the dell lock boss but this one doesn't have a lock boss it's fine so this is the next PC and this one's the one with no signal it is indeed giving out no signal so what we're gonna do is when take all the pots out for starters since this case is like there's no way I'm gonna be reusing this case it's just too far gone missing panels and stuff but I do want to figure out what parts are faulty within this system I'm actually looking at a closer does look like it could be the GPU since that is some really bad rust on this thing so regardless though for a hundred Ozzy there's got to definitely be some goodness in here considering that power supply line definitely works so let's see what's faulty so we're now onto the motherboard and there some good news and that is the motherboard and the CPU both work fine I did have to reseat the CPU however but I guess there's some bad news it's an i-5 4570 it's like it's hoping for a 4770k or something but there is some really good news after that though and that is this memory I pulled out is twenty four hundred megahertz CL ten and so like man I can hear the Zeon's in here the quad channels eons just screaming from across the studio like please Brian pick me pick me so they're thirsty as for this memory here so that's really good I can probably use that in an upcoming comparison because some of the fastest ddr3 memory I've had come through here with those X and peas alright it's finally time now to test that gtx 780 over there and see if that works as well so this gtx 780 looks like it is not working it's giving out no signal we've tried the DisplayPort as well and we've given it a little bit of tech s lovin just to phase one but that means that maybe this graphics card will be making surprise appearances in a Ken yes fix it episode in the future so it's not done just quite yet so here's the finale right here and this one indeed does have a busted down power supply we can kind of see with that light on the mother but it's not even lighting up usually that'll light up as soon as you turn the power on so we have to pull this whole thing apart and then see what we can salvage so perhaps the palace plays and gone after all because we put the next pals play on and there's absolutely no light at all so even like a board after this even if you clean it down a lot there's just no power to it at all it means usually means something's just absolutely gone because that light to come on is like in a low-power state so favor it's not coming on at all is pretty worrisome but hopefully we can pull out some good stuff like that cooler if I can clean all that up properly that's a really good pickup and then the RAM it looks like we've got four or four gigabyte sticks so hopefully there's an i7 in there and we'll retest that power supply and see if that works [Music] so I'll be damned the power supply still works and we can see here it's reading out all the voltage lines absolutely fine I've turned it on and off quite a few times so the only real thing to do is put it to the test in a in like a build or something like that and see if it passes but of course I'll be giving some proper tech yes loving before that pretty given just a quick wipe down and man some of the dirt that came off this stuff is unbelievable maybe it wasn't water damage maybe it was like a real intense like heavy smoker that's like looking like it was the other scenario so I've cleaned up these knock xual fans there okay and we can see this is like the amount of dirt that came off all this stuff it's really filthy but this cooler right here is definitely going to need a bath I've tried cleaning it down it's just stuck on so it's gonna need a hot bath to loosen it all up now I can give it a proper clean after that so that's like a hot bath Paul but the good news is is I did pull out a 3770k and that's looking pretty fresh so it doesn't look like it's damaged at all and we've also got the 16 gigabytes of RAM so this one I'd say overall was a pretty good victory and we are now at the finish line completing this month spot hunt and I mean this has just been a journey this month where we've picked up different pcs different places and honestly pulling those last few pieces apart I think overall I did win out in terms of value it was a little bit disheartening I wanted that z77 motherboard to work in the end and I would like to have had an i7 in that rig before it but the Xeon rigged that checked out perfectly that was a gamble where everything works so that was really good and we got some really good power supplies and other stuff out of those other rigs especially some of that ram but besides that we had that $50 system with the x58 in it and the board ended up working the 920 we can replace that with a really cheap Xeon as you guys know with x58 the hardest thing is always getting the motherboards and they're usually expensive so the fact that we got that for like a little over 30 USD that's a really good deal in itself so going through the whole tally here I'll put up a list on the screen for you guys where it tallied around about thirteen hundred and ten Aussie dollars I believe it's about eight hundred and eighty USD and we got like five twenty four inch monitors even a laptop thrown in there gtx 960 and I'm just blown away by how much stuff we got here this month I've honestly gotta start slowing down I took a look here in the studio I'm like damn Brian you got some sort of addiction that needs to be curbed and even just getting my hands dirty today with some of this stuff and cleaning it up I am pretty excited to start seeing what we can make out of some of these rigs here though it still leaves a little bit to be desired in terms of some of those deals on gumtree and Facebook the place is becoming worse and worse like the more I try and get deals on it the more of a cesspool it's becoming with overpriced stuff especially on the GPU side of things I did get a reply on the I think it was a 49 30 K where I put in a $60 e offer and they got back to me but they said they're only available today and so I went up to Brisbane yesterday and they since are up in Brisbane like an arrow way again kind of driving up there and wasting all that gas just for one particular part just really doesn't make it worth it not just in time but also money spent on gas and there is a rx 480 and I did find an rs-485 put it off for other things on Facebook monthly sorry and put in an offer of $80 and they accepted that so I'm gonna go pick that up tomorrow morning that we've worked out the whole deal they're actually just down the road too so it's really convenient for me and that's another graphics card that I've got so in total this month was an absolute success though I'm looking back and I am a little bit tired and exhausted because I went pretty hard but I know that's the way you guys want to see it happen around techy a city go hard or go home and that's exactly what we've done here this month though with that aside I do want to know what a favorite pickup of the month you guys thought that we'd got here and also if you've got some other ideas or other things you want me to look for then definitely drop a comment in the comment section below but I think I'm checking everything for what it's worth and I am getting really good deals month after month it's just the GPU situation is just it keeps creeping up on me and it keeps worrying me because it's getting worse and worse and I guess that's just the balance where people the only way I could probably speculate on it is that people are buying new parts perhaps and their friends already have 10 70s and stuff and they're like look go get a 1070 instead of a 1660 super or something like that and you've got 8 gigabytes of vram and that's kinda like the only spec they're looking at on the graphics card so they think they get actually getting a really good deal when we look at the performance and the efficiency and the new features on the super and brand-new IDE I think anyone who's sort of looking at it objectively would go that route so I think that's sort of happening in the GPU route and then you've got the other factor in and that's there's still those flood of 4th gen office pcs coming in and you need those use graphics cards or new graphics cards to match them out to make a gaming PC so that's what I think's happening if you guys think you know what's happening then let us know in the comments - love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of those thoughts and opinions we have the question of the day which comes from Wayne and they asked us so what's the advantage of this low-power eye 9 versus the standard eye 7 and they talk about the 9900 t engineering sample that we featured in the previous video I'll put the link up here well we just had this insanely crazy spec sheet for a PC that came under a thousand bucks and the 99 hundred t actually surprised me it was really good panel consumption like 50 watts on load versus 170 watts for a 9900 K for example at 5 gigahertz you are getting two thirds of the speed but you're getting under one third of the power consumption so that's the big benefit verse even an i7 8700 K or 9700 K is that you've got power consumption and you so you can couple with a cheap motherboard and get away with a cheap cooler and in turn even save more money on things like a power supply so that's the benefit that brings of course the disadvantage is that it's lower clock speeds so games that are really single threaded heavy you could see a loss of up to like 33 percent in FPS if you are CPU bound and a single thread heavy or even if it's multi-core heavy and you're juicing eight cores evening threads so games like that are really rare I think shadow the Tomb Raider at 1080p for example may be a good example of that but remains to be seen we will be doing the comparison I just need some time here to get up to speed with everything and without a side I hope you guys enjoyed January starting off the decade for 2020 this parts on I guess that's the reason it probably went so hard because it's the start of a new decade and if you enjoyed this one be sure to hit that like button and I'll
