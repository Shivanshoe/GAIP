over a week ago there was a big discussion i had 
on twitter about sea sonic power cables and i   got asked if the advice given in the c sonic 
manual was good advice which details that if   your graphics card has a total tdp rating of 
over 225 watts then seasonic advises that you   should not use what is known as a piggy backed 
connection from piggy tail cables and instead   use two separate 8-pin pcie cables so why 
would they recommend this is it sound advice   and why do they even include them well i'll 
tell you right after this sponsor spot axe labs   today's video sponsor are running this giveaway 
to promote their new game vale vr on steam links   are in the description below though what is vail 
it's a competitive 5v5 multiplayer vr shooter   the game is currently in testing and the players 
can request access on steam vail is completely   equity crowdfunded so it is built on community go 
and check out their discord using the link below   the aim is to work with teammates strategizing 
ways to make your way through the map to take   over the point or eliminate everyone on the enemy 
team to win it definitely reminds me of cs go   but much better being in vr maps have multiple 
objective points so strategizing with teammates   is a must and don't forget to keep an eye out 
around the corners it'd be awesome to play some   games with our viewers so go ahead join the epic 
giveaway request access to the game which listed   on steam and we'll see you all over the community 
discord links will be in the description below   first of all what is a piggy tail cable exactly 
well a piggy tail cable is a single cable   from your power supply that essentially splits 
into two eight or six plus two pin pcie connectors   which connect to your graphics card these are very 
common especially on more budget orientated power   supplies that are not modular though why are they 
included on nearly every power supply of sea sonic   is starting to recommend against them we'll meet 
exhibit a this is a power supply i picked up off   a miner over a month ago and while one of the 
connectors was fused at the modular connection   point going from the cable to the power supply and 
this was as you guessed it on a piggy tail cable   the power drawer simply became too much for the 
three pins that put out the positive 12 volt power   to the graphics card they in turn heated too much 
to a point where the insulation around it melted   and therefore expose the wiring to oxygen in turn 
oxidizing the wire and this process compounds in   itself because as the wire loses conductivity 
it has to pull through higher resistance in turn   producing more heat and the process literally gets 
to a breaking point where your power supply then   just turns off if it has safety precautions if not 
then i would suggest having a fire extinguisher   handy this is because the gravis card 
can no longer pull the power it needs   through the wire so in order to avoid this sea 
sonic recommends using a single cable for a single   pci 8 pin connector over and this is important 
this next bit for tdp graphics card power draw   of over 225 watt now relating this back to the 
original question in the intro that we asked   why include these power supplies the piggy tails 
with power supplies in the first place well over   the years and especially with most recent rtx 
3000 series launch and amd's rx 6000 series launch   average gdp tdp power requirements have risen 
significantly compared to previous generations   for example take a gtx 1080 it has a power draw 
requirement of 180 watts so piggy tail cable that   splits one connector into two eight pins would be 
fine however if now we compare that to an rtx 3080   it has a tdp recommendation of 320 watts so 
according to c sonic's own recommendation we   should not be using a piggy towel cable for the 
rtx 3080 on both the eight pin connectors and   instead use two separate cables even if one of 
those eight pins comes from one of the portions   of the piggy tail cable also we can take amd's 
rx 6800 xt it has a power draw requirement of 300   watts so just like the rtx 3080 recommendation 
two separate 8-pin power connectors coming from   the power supply directly to the gravis cards 
would be advised the most important thing we   can see here with the gtx 1080 versus the rtx 
3080 is that over the years the power drawer of   these cards are going up and up in general and 
you may be asking why is this especially since   the efficiency of the cards that is the fps per 
watt has improved well as amd and nvidia compete   for the top spot for graphics performance they do 
so at the cost of adding more stream processors   on their cards so even though the cards become 
more efficient they add more power draw in total   because overall the stream processes that 
they have added has produced more power   draw than efficiency itself derived from the 
architecture and node shrink gains can take away   leaving us the consumer with more overall power 
draw so a lot of manufacturers of power supplies   in the past would have not envisioned this when 
producing 650 750 and 850 watt power supplies   for example since they thought that perhaps gpu 
tdp power requirements would have not ballooned   especially as fast as they have to the levels 
that we're seeing with new graphics cards though   what you see going forward is unlike this piggy 
tail cable right here in my hand is you'll see   more singular 8-pin power cables on mid-range 
and higher-end power supplies to account for   this though for now the simple recommendation 
that c sonic has given out i would simply follow   it is sound advice from one of if not the most 
reputable power supply companies in the business   and for them to make such recommendations would 
simply be backed by experience knowledge though   to simplify the recommendation going forward on 
rtx 3060 3060 ti and 3070 piggy tail connections   should be fine to use since they all have a power 
requirement of under 225 watt though the 3070 ti   3080 and 3090 all come over this so i'd follow 
the recommendation from seasonic and use separate   eight pin cables for these pci power connectors 
on these cards mentioned over to amd's camp the   rx 6700 xt 6800 6800 xt and 6900 xt all come over 
that 225 watt power recommendation so for all the   rx 6000 series cards currently available i would 
use separate cables though in the case of the 6700   xt you should be fine with a piggy tail cable 
lastly it is simply a matter of heat the weakest   point being the modular connection from the power 
supply to the piggy tower cable if we look at this   hx 1200 watt power supply that i bought here 
clearly the miner that i bought it off did not   follow this advice though it's good to see that 
the power supply still works absolutely fine   and the safety features corsair have implemented 
on this power supply work fine too though in   the example of this miner and the power supply 
cable used it may be a little bit different of a   situation as before because they may have used two 
rx 570s for example on one piggy tail cable where   these cards have a tdp rating of 150 watt each 
therefore becoming 300 watts together going well   over that 225 watt recommendation and hence if 
these two cards were used for mining for example   it could have melted the cables fast and 
caused the oxidization that we're seeing   right on this cable that i'm holding anyway guys 
hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then   be sure to hit that like button and let us know 
in the comment section below have you had any   experiences like a burnt out cable here or have 
you had perhaps a different experience where the   cable gauge isn't thick enough and the whole 
system perhaps shuts down while you are gaming   this is another reason in favor of sea sonic's 
recommendation though i've never had this happen   on a sea sonic power supply since the gauge of 
the wiring they use is very generous anyway if   you stayed this far and you're enjoying that 
tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub   button and ring that bell and i'll catch you on 
the next tech video very soon again don't forget   to check out axe labs and their vr shooter 
in the description below peace out for now bye you
