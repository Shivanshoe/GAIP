everywhere you look right now rtx 3080s
are sold out but i'm told they are coming into stock very soon and
if one of these does land either for a pre-order or it's
in stock at your local retailer is it going to be worth considering that
is zotac's rtx 3080 trinity gaming edition
card with three 90 mil cooling fans and with the cooler
individually weighing 900 grams is this going to be enough
to keep the rtx 3080 under control well let's roll those benchmarks
straight up getting into the 1080p numbers
and out of the box this card does perform pretty similar to that of the
founders and also compared to that of the tough
gaming which we recently had through here at tech yes city
but one thing that i will mention about 1080p gaming with an rtx 3080 card
is that you might want to seriously reconsider
buying one of these cards if you're going to go with 1080p gaming
as we see in some of the titles we are starting to get hit
with a cpu bottleneck and this was tested on a 10 900k
which pretty much the best you can get for gaming right now
but if we move over to 1440p this is where the differences do start to expand
from the 2080 ti to the 3080 and the good news is here is if you
are an ultra wide gamer or a super ultra wide 1440p gamer then you can
definitely benefit even more so than the regular 16x9 1440p
numbers that you're seeing here now in terms of the zotac versus the other two
cards at 1440p very similar story there's not a whole
lot of difference to be gained out of going over one card
over the other that you see here in the graphs
though stepping things up to 4k it was pretty much the same story
as 1440p except minus pretty much all the cpu bottlenecks
that may occur at 1440p and so this is where this card really does shine in
terms of the 3080 standpoint itself and that is 4k gaming and and also
quickly throw up some rtx benchmarks for you
and quickly show the encoder versus the previous two generations
where i feel like the encoder this time around hasn't been improved
a whole lot over the second series rtx 2000 series cards
but that was a pretty big improvement over the 10 series card so if you want
to use the nvidia encoder it's definitely going to do a good job
and you've also got av01 decoding now built on to the 3082
speaking of the differences between this and the founders and the azus tough
this is going to be one of the most important questions
probably on your mind if you're looking at this model in particular
versus say the other models out there now the tough gaming that came through
and that blew me away i'm not going to sit here in the review
of the zotac card and say that the tough gaming wasn't
impressive that is the most impressive card
i have seen come through here and especially hitting at msrp
and being a cheaper entry-level card in terms of pricing
but then providing the performance that did as well as the noise and the
overclocking that thing was really good extremely
hard to beat now this car doesn't unfortunately beat
the tough gaming in terms of noise as well as cooling but
one thing that it does do is does offer a bit of a smaller
footprint if you're trying to fit it into a different
build which i will put the measurements up on the screen here
for this gpu in particular another thing about the zotac gaming card is
out of the box the fan profiles are pretty much perfect you don't want to
use a different fan profile if you're gaming
because it's going to either create more noise
or the temperatures will run a bit hotter i found this magical level of 69
degrees at 69 fan speeds was doing an excellent
job of not only keeping the noise at a sweet
spot for this particular model card but also keeping the temperatures
just under that magical level of 70 degrees
and even in one of the benchmarks i did when i was playing around with
under-volting we even got 69 fps so what about the overclocks and for me
personally more importantly the under vaulting i'm going to say this
card under vaults well i think any 30 series card is going
to undervolt quite well and for me personally i've
been using these cards and i do prefer under vaulting them because it's going
to save you a bit more power on your power consumption
in which in turn should save you money on your power bill but
it's also going to keep the card cooler and it's going to run
quieter which is an important thing and you're not going to lose much
fps at all this car did lose a couple of fps
in horizon zero dawn when i tested the under vaulting and then on the flip side
when i went on to overclocking it was limited to around a
megahertz core clock but the memory did go quite high
to around 500 megahertz so over 10 gigahertz
on that display which does look pretty impressive when you're playing your
games but when you do overclock it the power
consumption does start to run out of control and you're only really
gaining a few extra fps i think for these cards the 1800
megahertz under volt is not just a sweet spot in
terms of the efficiency curve for the gpu itself
but it's also a great thing for someone who's going with a high-end power supply
with low ripple suppression so you've got to remember when they designed these
cards out of the box they designed them to
work on pretty much any power supply with the rating that
they're recommending so they can say a bronze rated
750 watt power supply is going to do the job even if it's got
a lot higher ripple than say a corsair rmi
850 which will have a lot better ripple suppression than a lot of power supplies
out there so when you're using a power supply like
that you can then in turn give this card a nice good undervolt
with clean stable power and it should respond pretty well and so
that's why i recommend under volting especially if you're going to get a car
like this and especially if you've got a good
power supply anyway moving through the card itself you've got two
eight pin connectors so you don't need the nvidia 12 pin
to two eight pin splitter or of course if your power supply has got that
direct 12 pin connector then you're going to need
2 8 pins so that's located roughly to just off center of the card
in the pcb itself which when we've taken the cooler off
we can see that this is using a very similar design
to the pcb of the founders card now another thing is too at the back of the
card for those who want to know about the capacitors
it does have six of the larger capacitors so there has been
a lot of drama surrounding the caps used and the
overclocks and the stability and when i was doing all the benchmarks as well as
playing a bit of modern warfare which is a pretty strenuous game i do
like to play that on all the cards for quite a while this did not crash
once so whatever zotac is doing here they're
doing a good job at least the sample i've got here is pretty stable
that being said however if you do have a problem zotac say that they do provide
an extended four-year warranty at least for
people in australia so it's always good to have four years
on an investment like this which is pretty much what it
is at this stage if you're getting into high-end gaming and you want to drop
this kind of money on this card you definitely would want a pretty
decent warranty so it's good to see that they are backing
the product with a solid warranty the final thing to go over
with this card right here is i was going to say the rgb of course we've got to go
over the rgb we've got zotac gaming rgb on the side
and on the rear which you can control with their included
software they call this firestorm and you install the app and then you can
change it and even sync it with other rgb software if you want to
and the good thing is with the software you can do more than just tune the rgb
you can tune the card itself and another good thing is after you're
done setting up your rgb whether you want to turn it off
completely or not you can then close down and uninstall the software
and your settings will be saved into the graphics card itself which is a good
thing and going through the rear output of
this card you've got one hdmi 2.1 which is essential for your lg oled
120 hertz 4k gaming experience if you want to go that route
which i do use personally and it's really good
then you've got three display port outs too however the
this is the standard design and the for instance the board partners can
implement more ports where we did see with the tough gaming
for example two hdmi 2.1 outs so this is exactly like the standard founders
output design if you want to get more display outs
then you might want to go with a different card and with all that out of
the way it's finally time to give you guys the raw conclusion on
the zotac trinity and what do i think of it should
this be the card that you consider getting if you're
after a 30 series card now i've compared this to two other cards
here so far i've also got one more in the pipeline
and the tough gaming is still coming out on top
for the 3080 series i'm not going gonna sit here
and if you just come out of the bush i'm not gonna beat you up and put you back
in the bush that's not me not gonna beat you around the bush
basically the zotac trinity however what it does do
good is out of the box it does work the noise and the
temperature levels were mediocre i would like to see them
come down but if this is a card that's coming in at msrp and especially
in australia if you can get this for one of the cheapest sort of entry
level rtx 3080 cards versus the others out there then it will
do the job and i think that's what you've come here to know
about the zotac trinity is it a card worth buying
and honestly if this was the only rtx 3080 card i could get
then i'd be happy with it it does a decent job but does have its limitations
where it doesn't overclock that well and also compared to the founders it's
coming in with lower temperature levels but does make a little bit more noise
and for me personally when i'm looking for gpus
i'm usually looking for one that brings in really good value so
wherever you live around the world if this is in stock say for instance for
some other gpus that aren't in stock and they may have a huge back order
on them this one comes up you want to know is it good
yeah it's pretty solid it'll do the job and
if it's in stock and it's the right price then i would definitely go for it
if you've also got any questions or comments about this rtx 3080 or anything
in general then be sure to drop a question down below or just a comment
down below too i love it when you guys comment love
reading those thoughts and opinions as always
and speaking of thoughts and pieces we've got the question of the day here
which comes from rooks and they ask a 650 watt power
supply for a 30 80 question mark i thought it needs
at least 750 what and the power supply thing is i think
nvidia did the 750 watt because they know
how many mediocre 650 watts there are out there
there's i've seen 650 watts that are really probably only a true
550 or 500 watt and that's even from decent brands
so i think they give the 750 watt just to make sure that hey
you're not going to have problems with a cpu and a gpu that aren't overclocked
out of the box but the 650 watt power supply that i
ordered in the other video that's going to be absolutely fine for a
3080 and also a uh the cpu the 10 700 f that i ordered
as well i mean from the top of my head this
whole system will probably juice around 420 to 430 watts
while we're gaming so 650 watt power supply should be absolutely fine
and the one we ordered is decent i have tried it before in a video up here the
450 watt with a 2080 ti and a 3950x and that passed with flying
colors and with all that out of the way i'll
catch you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye [Music]
