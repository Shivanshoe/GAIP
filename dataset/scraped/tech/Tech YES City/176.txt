we should be live we should be live and on one hand we've got oh wait is it the offhand we've got intel intel on the offhand with their business wait isn't it on hand so until on one hand they've got a i5 on the off hand they've got the i9 welcome back to the stream everybody and uh hopefully we've got some people joining in on chat to just let me know that i'm not alone here in this whole i did hit live so i've just got to make sure it's all working and um once uh once chat grows up a little bit we'll um oh we got someone in here cool we got a hot stream today so make sure you tune in and let us know what you think first of all about this whole 11th gen launch because what i've been seeing here is uh the 11600k and we finished cutting the video we're going to launch that pretty soon but i just thought it was like you got the opposite from intel with this launch you've got on one hand you've got the i9 which is just terrible value and the biggest thing that annoyed me about intel was just like with the i9 was that it's really close to an i7 there's i'll take my glasses off too sorry i didn't realize the glare glare's actually looking pretty bad there the biggest thing with the i9 was that they just essentially got the same core count as an i7 so like what message are they sending to enthusiasts with the i9 it's like hey guys what do you want to rip you off because you can lock in the one-to-one gear ratio on the 10-700k and you can even lock it in on the 11 600k so that advantage of having that gear ratio on the 11 900k sort of mitigated by just buying a decent motherboard which you're going to want to go buy a decent motherboard if you've got um one of these overclockable processes so we're gonna be comparing it and everyone's joining in chat what's up guys we're tech yeah city live good good to see marco in the chat he's he's been like yo uh youtube doesn't let me know about the notifications and apparently like youtube notification system is broken like they're telling they're saying i saw on twitter someone's like oh they're gonna experiment taking away the dislike button i'm thinking to myself what like they need to experiment just getting your videos out to people who actually hit the sub button that would work but but let's uh let's look at this first of all because one thing i'm seeing with the 11900k is this is the worst thing about it right i was looking at the pricing in australia 10 900k right 700 bucks 10 calls 20 threads okay that was already kind of overpriced because you're getting paying for that k but it's not too bad in the grand scheme of things it's not too bad like if you bought a 10 900k i'd just be like yeah sure okay you bought your 10 900k good stuff um you could have got a few other options that would be better value but you didn't make a a bad choice but if you bought the 11900k at 889 aussie like you you made a bad choice you just thrown money down the drain and this is the thing right i looked at just before we started this live stream i'm looking at the 11900 and it's virtually the same thing for 180 less and that's like for usd that's like 140 usd or something that's just for nothing like you're just getting a k license and a cpu that's going to boost to 5.2 gigahertz single core and i'm guessing it's going to go to four point um i think the the eleven nine hundred k goes to around from our test went to around four point eight all core this one should go to around four point seven or core so you're just paying money for like that's the the value proposition of this 1100k is too much so do let us know what you guys think about this in chat uh because i'm sort of like looking at it and um uh we got we got some questions too like i'll make sure that we while we go through the through with this live stream i'll make sure we just uh answer some pressing questions if you guys have them so uh we gotta hear dragonmas he's like when are you coming to india for the parts hunt dude i can't even get to japan so i don't even know how when i'm getting like i'd love to go to india it's actually one of the places i really want to go same with hong kong uh they're two places and sweden as well for some reason they're like three places i just really want to go to um and i guess because i haven't been to either three of those countries but what i'm looking at here is that yeah the reality is i can't even like where i'm at at the moment we've actually gone back into lockdown so i can't even leave like my house really that's how bad it is so i have no idea brother when i when i'm heading over to india but make no mistake i do want to head over to india um you know like just uh i i heard like i can get is it true in india like some people like ride down the highway standing on a bike a bike a motorbike and they're doing like these cool tricks because that'd be pretty cool to see real time i mean dangerous really dangerous wouldn't recommend it but hey be cool to see if you're a tourist like hey here's a dude driving by on a motorcycle standing up so that'd be awesome but we got why do we need such expensive cpus um that's a good question i mean like we don't need them i don't think we need them i think the companies need them to to take your money and that's what i was saying like when we look at the 1100 600k in that video we're going to be talking about 2021 it's going to be the year and trust me i say this it's going to be the year of the rip off that's what 2021 is going to be so if you want to get ripped off 2021 is going to be that year where a lot of companies are going to try to take you to town brothers so just like this 11 900k up here that's what's happening you're going to get taken to town to town skis they're going to say how you doing so that's that one so what do you guys what do you think about the 11th gen so far because i'm just thinking well the 11 600k looks okay that's like a decent cpu and now i'm looking forward to the f cpus as well i want to see what they bring to the table but perhaps the 11700f and the 11400f will be the ones to go for as well as the 11 100 f if they bring that out and those three cpus will be their shining stars i think as long as they hit the same price point for instance like in tomorrow's video we're going to be taking a look at the 10700 f and comparing that to the 10 uh to the 11 600k that's my main street pricing i like that so yeah anyway yeah the game is next thing waste of sand that's what he said with the 11700k so it's pretty much like i just don't know how like people are saying the latency was the reason they couldn't get these chips up with the gaming performance if we relate to the uh productivity numbers they were looking pretty good like the cinebench score on the 11900k was really good but that didn't translate into gaming fps gains unlike ryzen which they got the gains on not just the cinebench scores and the productivity numbers they got the scores in the games and that was a combination of ipc increase but also reducing the latency which ryzen have they've done a great job with their fifth five thousand series a fifth gen but yeah that's uh that's that one done and dusted right we got that out of the way eleven six hundred k seems to be okay i've done the testing i gotta get the video out but that's pretty much the only one if you're in australia it's 419 aussie it's not looking too bad but we got some next stop we've got some news here gigabytes submit plans so video cards they're pretty good with their rumors i always like whenever i'm looking for gpu rumors i'll usually go to video cards uh they seem to be pretty accurate with their stuff and i mean the 20 gigabyte 3080 ti that was submitted in late december so it could be a thing that these guys like gigabyte they're just pulling fakes here having a bit of a laugh submitting plans just to get the internet talking about their cards because you look here like this is just a complete advertisement for all these cards right here gigabyte auris extreme gigabyte gaming oc gigabyte vision so you're looking at you're like okay what's the vision what am i looking at here so you're pulling up the list and you're looking through all the models and that's just amazing like this for them to submit does anyone know the cost of how much it costs to submit some of these plans to the eec because if it costs only a couple hundred bucks gigabyte's getting like very cheap advertising out of this news article and that's how i'm kind of looking at it you know call me a little bit of a like seeing the different angle here but like the look the 3080 ti 20 gigabyte that rumor was just complete uh fluff and i mean if we were to make a 3080 ti i did say though if they were going to make a 3080 ti it was going to have 12 gigabytes of vram that makes more sense because it wouldn't take away from the um it wouldn't therefore it wouldn't take away from the attention on the 30 90 so that's what that is so anyway we got here those models that's the 380 ti what do you guys think do you think the 3080 ti is coming or what i honestly think it's going to be one of those things that i don't know here's jar jar and jar jar says hello to you guys while wrong live so 2090 ti confirmed with the chat it might be that might be what's going on the way we're going with this gpu supply shortage we might see we might see that um [Music] the way we're going we might actually see some of these cards come back in stock the old models like uh nvidia's 16 nanometer we might see that come back in stock we might see a new model on top of that a 2090 ti so yeah the gpu situation look i think if we just don't really talk about the shortage at the moment we can then pretend we're living a better life and we're happier because right now whenever i look at gpu prices yeah i want to sink my head into the sand so perhaps this is my retort to gamers nexus perhaps the 11700k isn't a waste of sand if you've got one on hand you can sink your head into it when you look at gpu prices just a thought right so it's not a waste at all guys that's just the thought just food for thought there so just raising that raise that openly to gamers nexus anyway the next article big off the press so i mean rising like this is actually segues in segway's in segways in perfectly with the last topic here this is the tsmc's reportedly raising consumer electronics wafer prices by 25 so notice the consumer electronics is like hey they might not raise the other ones that they've got long-standing contracts with and long-term relationships with just the ones that you know you and i tech enthusiasts just the ones we're buying 25 yeah just jack them up show them gamers how much we appreciate them so if this comes into effect you might see say for instance it takes 150 dollars to make a cpu like we're talking a high core count like whatever 32 calls or whatever it takes them 150 bucks to the silicon is worth that that's going to cost now 180 so the prices at the end of the pipeline will go up for the lower end more significantly than they'll go up for the higher end so perhaps the prices have already gone up on the silicon too we just don't really know about it because what we're seeing with these gpus we're not seeing any mid-range or low-end gpus being launched a lot of people a lot of their for instance nvidia amd a lot of these guys are just launching this high-end stuff and it comes as i mean this isn't like this is a little bit of a rumor mill but it does look like that's what's happening prices of silicon is going up so if you guys basically if you're looking to buy tech 2021 you're gonna be getting ripped off so should we make perhaps if we're going to make some merch we'll just make the rip off shirt like hey i just got ripped off because if you're like if this is the thing like this is what i don't like people like oh should we we shouldn't regulate gpu prices and this is big discussion right shouldn't regulate gpu prices but the whole economy is regulated right now let's be honest the whole economy just regulated so why not just regulate gpu prices at least we'll get some cheaper gpus because this is the problem right now the whole economy is regulated so where do you go from there like you got to start at the core right if you want to go to the gym you can't just work out the biceps you got to start working out the arms first get get the strength built up so anyway that's what i think about regular prices prices are going up everywhere but we got to stay at home and keep watching the prices go up it's like hey guys way to go just watching them you know if you ever have you ever uh i don't know if you guys have ever owned a stock before and if you've watched it just go down go down in price you're sitting there hitting refresh on the screen you're like ah man i bought some amd shares at 80 dollars a share now they're down to 70 and you just keep refreshing oh and you're watching things go down it's like that same effect but you're watching the prices go up like you're like oh i want to want to get an rtx 3070 you refresh the browser it's now another 50 bucks refresh it the next day another 50 bucks before you know it a thousand dollar card that's aussie it's now 1500 bucks so yeah let's let's just keep hiking prices there's a good solution to everything but yeah that's uh that's what's going on a little bit of a mid-livestream rant but um we gotta hear from the potassium man he asks what's the best budget ryzen cpu right now see this is this is the thing you guys what's what is there a reason why it just has to be the best ryzen cpu do you need to go out to your friends and say hey dude i got a ryzen cpu like i got a riser mate mate listen here i got an amd ryzen in my computer because it's not like what i'm seeing with the prizes it doesn't you shouldn't care what brand it is because the um at the moment in australia the the fcpus on 10th gen they're so cheap they're ridiculously cheap to the point where you'll be getting better value so that would be my if you're looking for the best value go with the 10th gen f chip if you're looking for getting on ryzen though to answer that question directly you want to get the 1600 af if it's 85 bucks if you refresh that browser 85 usd great value um 3100 has gone up in price so if you can find one of them they're not bad but um when uh we got some more questions we'll move on we'll segue into the next topic but i love chatting with you guys i love chatting with you guys i've uh marco's got a xeon cpu in my computer mate that's it i've got i've got a z on my hey listen here listen here fell i got a zeon um when's mining gonna stop being profitable uh when cryptocurrency crashes so actually we can answer that question live for you guys so basically if we pull up a graph here of ethereum right so this is when mining prices uh crash so look at that wow ethereum's just it crashes when this line here this goes all the way back down to like here but also on top of that we've got a thing called difficulty so when this crashes ethereum difficulty let's take a look here okay so this is the higher this goes the less profitable mining is oh wait we should try and like push that over yeah it's not going to work on anyway you're just going to have to deal with it being behind a chat a text text box so we've got this here this price the difficulty this line here when this goes down it you can mine easier that means you can get more ethereum for the same amount of hardware when it goes up however say for instance here when this line goes up that means it's more difficult to mine in other words the profitability goes down so if this line's going up and then the price of ethereum starts going down that's when you'll see profitability really take a hit and that's when you'll see graphics cards start to be sold to the market in mass so i've been praying for this for a couple of months uh hopefully we can get a crash soon on crypto here's for praying for a crash because uh yeah we can all get some um then things will get exciting again because that's all people think yeah we won't go on that we won't go down that rabbit hole in live stream but yeah we've got speaking of gpus we're going to have some good news here nvidia's resizable bar they've got a firmware update tool that you can download and it will let you know if your gpu can be it's for 3000 series graphs cards if you can update your 3000 series card which you probably don't have a crypto miner probably has your 3 000 series card uh we got a donation too sorry i'll quickly really check that out thanks for the two bucks brother uh what do you think about jinx your boards yeah they're so the jinx your bother boards uh they're the alex they're mainly you buying them off aliexpress they're they're good value like i've had a couple of jinxes around here they're not bad i like the one and z's though if i was building a xeon rig and i had to buy a new one off aliexpress i'd be going with the one and z boards from my tests they were actually very solid on some of the extra you know augmented like the extras that you get like the onboard audio wasn't half bad i think the x99 one and z has the optical out which i really like because i use external z 5500 for example and if you're using that then you've got now a better sound as opposed to having to get a separate solution with optical out so i don't think that i don't know if the jinxer has that as well if this has those extra features i'd be going for the jinxa board too i'd be considering but last time i checked the jinxes are really coming in at that budget price point and they're hitting that mark there but from what i've tested they're good if you don't want to overclock you just want to chuck a cpu in there and game they're going to do a job plus they've got a good support for ecc memory too so we got here from ec says hey brian i think i have a budget ryzen 3100 you think uh pairing it with a 1080 is okay yeah definitely 1080 is fine with the 3100 you're gonna get some good fps solid cpu uh nothing to worry about there i've actually i think i paired one with a 1080 recently on the channel i did a build in the 100 flip up challenge so they great combination so um does above 4g decoding help with gaming yeah so we're going to i'll test this in video resize bar i'll do some tests on ryzen for you guys as well as intel z590 we'll see if it actually makes a difference or if it's one of those things where it might make a difference at 1080p low settings but my feeling is if we go to 4k it's probably not going to make too much of a difference because 4k is where you really want the the difference to be had right you got this rtx 3070 or 3080 you want some more fps but the problem is at 4k it's not really cpu bound so it's like yeah probably you won't see much result but that was kind of like one thing that is we'll go over the big screen quickly so one thing that's been annoying me a little bit is that we're seeing all these benchmarks come out and this was pointed at intel when i saw before the benchmarks were released intel was touting that they had the new gaming cpu king now i just picked five games out of random like that's how it when i benchmarked benchmark usually five sometimes more games but the results were unanimous right intel's 11th gen wasn't that great for gaming i was like i was shocked i was like this thing isn't doing well and you want it to do well in the competitive multiplayer titles if anything which we tested three of those in the five games and so when they're advertising their benchmarks they've got all these games that no one plays so it's like you got to start pulling back here and saying okay can we actually test some games that people are playing so i was kind of i was annoyed to see that i was really annoyed with intel this time around because if you've got a 10th gen cpu i think you're in a much better position going into this 11th gen launch than you've ever been so there's that that putting that out there so the 10th gen was actually not too bad especially if you well especially in today's prices but anyway uh what ram were you using in the benchmark so 3600 we use 3600 corsair dominator uh four eight gigabyte sticks so that's it tends to be for me that tends to be a balance between a good fps and what people can realistically put in a computer and just boot it up lock in xmps and they're good to go i think like sometimes i'll see like sometimes as well i've tested in the past with 4 400 megahertz and it's just unrealistic because on some of the cpus that just flat out won't work if the imc is not that great um you've also got the memory itself that 400 megahertz memory costs a lot of money so we usually use around 3 600 megahertz around here because it's just a balance between okay this is the ram you kind of want to go for if you're an enthusiast uh 3200 megahertz is nice too caught a live stream click nice uh just a sec i'll put my phone on d and d shouldn't say okay let's get that on there do not disturb live streaming baby get that call it's like yo check yes i need a gaming pc actually actually we've got a two dollar donation they will data set it's jeremy again my man jeremy you're generous here will data centers start using epc over xeons now uh epic you talking about epic depends man uh the last time look i'm gonna be honest with you guys last time i was out like this was yeah this is before you know 2019 got some coin there you sold a gaming pc before brothers you know i'm talking about um last time i was out we had uh i had a discussion with some of the guys from the data center right and the biggest thing on the data center was uh a lot of the guys used intel back in 2019 and they didn't really intend on changing to amd because of the stability they wanted to let amd prove themselves so i think if amd gets a couple of years track record as being reliable in the data center and then word starts to spread then they'll start seeing mass adoption but until then you know stability in the server industry is like one of the biggest things and i will admit uh intel do have that they do have a good track record of stability so whether or not i'd have to speak again i'd have to go to events and talk to a lot of the guys who aren't in the enthusiast tech scene that are in the data center scene so what's the word there i don't know so i can't give you an answer just yet but back in 2019 i know a lot of people weren't adopting to amd just yet they were waiting to see the results so i think look i think amd is definitely going to come in from here on in and i think if intel keeps performing this bad like if we look at the 11 900k they know they've got to step it up but we'll actually talk about intel soon with what they've got coming in the pipeline but i think people will start adopting to amd i think that's going to happen i just think they've it just depends so we've got to wait and see anyway we got the next one here so the resizable bar if you've got the gpu that can support it nvidia is your guy just go to your website gigabyte oh man give gigabyte gets some really good advertising out of this live stream aren't they they're on it they've got the v bios update ready to go they've got the plans submitted for a hundred bucks for some free advertising here man gigabyte you guys are on your game with this turn like what do they call this subliminal marketing subliminal level marketing under the radar subliminal level so i got to start doing this for tech yes city oh wow guys check yes city made a fiddy let's spread it around man but it's not actually fitty it's a fitty coated in gold how'd he do it [Music] ah i'll tell you how he did it he kept looking at the ddr5 articles so here's the next article we got then we'll join over to chat actually we'll see what's cracking in chat quickly how you guys doing out there in chat you having a good time 100105f video there is a wait is there a 1001 is this guy trolling me live there's a i'm gonna check this out a 100105f he's not wait what he's not trolling dude where did this guy come i love this guy this guy come from the 105 f that's why i love live streaming you guys just pointed out what is this cpu four calls eight whoa okay i'm checking this out 129 aussie four cause eight threads where did this come from the tenno i310105f look at that code name that's what i'm talking about fellas thanks for the suggestion we'll be booking one of these up after the live stream and running a video on it so here we go here five dollars from black gamma excited for the used market in two to five years time that was created by the gpu covered boom yeah i mean that's yeah i'm excited i just at the moment man it's like one of those feelings you just got this uneasy feeling in your gut who knows what's gonna go on in the future that's at the moment the future is all out of the air i've got that i've got that little i don't know i got that little tingles whenever i think about the future at the moment so just try not to think about the future so but i mean i'm excited if crypto crashes and if we get a heap of gpus back on the market i'm hoping it'll be from like halfway on woods from this year i'm hoping things will just get back to normal and we'll prevent i will pretend covert never existed that's what i'm so that's two things i've got one hand praying for the crypto crash the other hand praying for things to get back to normal pre-covered conditions where you could go on a plane and you could go down to japan jump in a i was going to say an s box jump in an s box car hit the rev on that three cylinder go flying around town trying to look for deals that was that's one of the funnest things i've been just really wanting to do that lately um is the rtx 2070 super still a decent gpu yeah 2070 super solid i mean depends on what your definition of uh decent is but that's yeah really good [Music] micro center 10 700 f for 200 bucks might be a better deal yeah at 10 700 f is the cpu to go for it's easily one of the best value cpus you can get right now top is the top cpu you even get a cool you even get a cooler included so that's where the values at that's where the values are for sure but this one thanks for the suggestion right here the 100105f we'll definitely see if we can get a video cracking on that pretty soon but uh anyway ddr5 kickstart and us we know that ddr5 memory is comments this is tweak down they've got an article here we know it's coming that's right we know ddr5 is coming i know ddr6 is coming too one day we know we know guys we know and we know that there's going to be a big jump inside the service so this article here is talking about china's mass manufacturing ddr5 and it's under the guise of micron so micron have their two off spins uh zhuang hey and asgard ram and their own that's so they're owned by micron and they got their first uh ddr4 ddr5 sorry 4 800 megahertz and 128 gigabyte capacities so apparently next gen intel 12th gen is going to support uh ddr5 so again in the z5 90 asrock motherboard review what's the point of bias flashback you're not going to need it anymore because they got biased flashback on the z590 motherboards what are you going to flashback to there's going to be no 12 900k on your z590 motherboard i mean sure if something breaks itself then isn't the blast flashback useless anyway because the bias is bricked uh anyway oh wait no that's what flashback does okay sorry if you've bricked you okay bias flashback is good in that regard so yeah if it's a lightning storm and your bias breaks itself during the lightning storm bias flashback is going to be useful i apologize my bad i mean forget the fact that you got dual bars too forget that samsung though 512 gigabyte capacities ddr5 modules they're going to outdo micron and the uh the manufacturing process there they're going to go like look we've got we got 7200 megahertz 10 donation too thank you so much there is a shift to amd and data centers cloud providers are allowed to specify which architecture uh virtual machines will be deployed on unless one needs avx five twelve everyone chooses amd it's just cheaper okay whereabouts are you based is that in over in the u.s that's some good news there you go people are starting to shift amd data centers that's answering your question directly we've got uh tech therapy here's how you doing ron it's ron been a long time man yeah detect therapy guys i did the parts hunt with austria back in that was back when things were normal that was right before actually come to think of it that was a few months before covert um and then yeah that went down and now i'm austria's really cool i really liked parts hunting in austria it was really cool the food in austria is awesome too a few bucks for the zeon fund i hope we can finally meet up someday again after covert isn't a thing anymore that's exactly right greets from austria run i hope we can brother i hope we can we got designs by ifa my man designs by ifa and the chat is what's going on mate how's it going i'll give you i'll give you one of them all right we'll put the put the glasses on back with the glare how's it going mate what's going on dory yes yeah man yeah you joining live creamy did somebody say menu log get delivery like a jeep well put on the big screen hole get delivering like a g see there we go you gotta get that menu log bro go cop it go cop that menu log you know apparently according to some people apparently apparently this is all going to be worthless like this is all worthless right it's just paper now that's apparently that's what i'm hearing yeah jerome powell over in the u.s jerome powell's got the printer going and it's all going to be useless that's what it means so i'm not flexing brother it's just that was just a flip i did right before the live stream and someone's like man i need a gaming pc i'm like brother i'm your guy i'm your guy come and get it come and get it you know what what is a man got to do to make 100 bucks that's what he's got to do he's got to put some leds in a pc go get the good deals go put the pc together go guarantee it so i'm not really flexing man i'm not really flexing it's not a flex just like hey i actually sold a pc it's more of a joyous moment because the market where i'm at now is actually pretty slow moving pretty slow true story you can ask anyone in anyone in the gig right now is the gtx 1650 a good gpu traditionally this is from og gamergirl oh that the text looks really weird when i do that hold on oh gee was it oh gee wait where'd the question go what was it was it og gamer got is a 1650 a good gpu originally no it wasn't 1650 wasn't a good gpu now it is if you can get one for the right price it's a good gpu everybody wants it everybody wants it now because it's a gpu is it a good one traditionally before the pricing was all messed up you want to get a 1650 super because there was a massive performance difference between the two significant actually should i say significant and um so it wasn't that good in terms of price performance it wasn't that good but once you get a 1650 right what you can do because you're going to save a little bit of money versus a 1650 super what you can do once you get the 1650 super is you can go contact designs by far and say look i got a little bit of spare money here do you want to get some menu log and he's going to tell you yeah dude you mate i want to get some menu log right now but make sure you hit that sub button hit the like button and subscribe wait that was a bad corey voice i can't do it corey i can't do your voice dude [Music] let's get back to some topics here just let's get back to some topics so ddr5 samsung's bringing out 512 gigabyte sticks single stick 512 gigabytes now let's forget about the cost right because they're not even going to mention the cost because this thing is going to send you broke this this like this cash that i flashed here before that is going to be nothing that's not even going to be able to buy you one of these sticks you're going to need uh probably bars of gold or even bitcoin to buy some 512 gigabyte sticks off samsung that's probably what's going to happen these things are going to be so expensive but at the same time it's cool to see they're going to have speeds up to 7 200 megabits per second wow we're not even giving us megahertz anymore we just moved straight to megabits per second mbps and they're going for the big stuff 512 gigabytes so this is promising because uh the good thing about this news article right the biggest thing i'm going to point out about this news article before we move on to the next piece of news is that when you get the highest speed stuff so when samsung's doing the whole okay we're gonna release 7 200 megahertz 512 gigabyte sticks that's great like most consumers aren't going to care but it's good in the sense that if they've got all that high-end stuff then all the mid-range and low-end stuff is going to be very fast too because that's where it all comes from the higher-end stuff and so what we're going to see is we're going to see some cheap ddr5 memory hopefully and it's going to be fast and it's going to be good and then we're going to get gains i mean i'm wondering here's the question i'm going to raise with you guys and i'm going to check back on these comments section i'm going to check back on these comments section do you think you'll be able to game a ddr5 do you think you'll be at a game on single channel do you think that'll be better hey guys i got one stick of memory in my pc and i'm gaming like a boss do you think that's going to happen let us know in chat let us know right now do you think you're going to be a boss on one stick of ddr5 or do you think it's just not going to be viable do you think you have to get that dual channel hey man i need my dual channel hey bro does that thing have dual channel hey listen here brother if you don't have two sticks of memory in that thing it's not going to run games it's not even going to boot up that's what oh how you guys doing anyway it's been a while like i'm live streams here at tech yes city they just they're all over the place they're all over the place they come and go they come and go but we um so yeah okay people in the chat of sans duel they reckon they're gonna need two sticks of memory you're gonna have to go with two you have to go with two sticks one stick ddr5 for crazy micro motherboards yeah what happened to quad channel ah quad channel's like one of those things was like yeah guys it's too expensive to make these quad channel chips now we're just gonna go with dual channel permanently so we can make some more money that's what's telling you guys 2021 the year of the rip-off the year of the rip-off but speaking of something that possibly won't be a rip-off intel has heard you guys they've heard everyone they're like look pat gelsinger he went up on stage and said intel is back i'll be back we'll do a yeah we'll do it like a 2021 arnold schwarzenegger i'll be back meteor lake intel's first seven nanometer cpu to tape in before july this year and release in 2023 so there here he is here i gotta say he looks like a genuine look at this this is intel you couldn't have picked a better ceo look how genuine look how genuine pat looks pat hit me with it pat hit me with it do another two dollar donation from jeremy i game on one eight gigabyte ddr4 memory uh rx58 dude why are you donating your money to me if you don't dude jeremy don't donate me money if you're gaming on one eight gigabyte stick here brother i feel bad now i feel bad i feel bad man don't donate money if you don't donate money if you need it okay don't don't do that okay oh man anyway pat come on man pat pat gel singer what are we doing right here so gel singer claims right he's saying look intel is going to be on top now once they get seven nanometer out and they're spending a lot of money like i heard they were spending 20 billion on making these new faps where they're going to be making them in the us as well so hopefully that'll bring some jobs to the us but the biggest thing about this is is that it's going to be an all seven nanometer platform but another thing is too if we look here if we look stare closely at the seven nanometer here we'll actually zoom in let's see if we can get pat's face right up on screen let's see if we get a pixelated pat there he is come on pat now that's that's as far as i can zoom in guys that's not happening if we look at here seven nanometer computer tile tape in quarter two 20 21 so they're going with a computer tile architecture in other words instead of right you know when you've got ryzen right you got ryzen and it's i've got a quick question to two dolls thanks chris upgrade now or wait for older lake brian don't upgrade to 11th gen so yeah wait for older lake i'd say even wait for meteor lake that would be my suggestion wait for meteor lake because this is looking like it's going to hit hard and i'm going to say why amd hit new strides when they developed verizon and the reason ryzen is so good is because of the way they've done the infinity fabric they're connecting these dies together and the yields are phenomenal they're maximizing the cores the threads and they're scaling very well now intel is going to be doing the same thing they've looked at what ryzen's doing they're like okay this is very successful so instead of stacking them side by side and vertically and horizontally they're just going to be stacking them on top of each other so kind of like our stack if we were to look at how the um the hbm memory works similar in that regard but not simple and it's completely different but it's similar that you're stacking so intel is going to be stacking cpus on top of each other and then connecting them and apparently it's going to make it excellent to the point where they could even stack they could even use this technology in gpus stack ai portions on the cpus um and so that's pretty like promising right yeah look at that i got an ad but look at this i got one up on you i muted the tab see that's what i mean i'm i'm thinking when i live stream now i'm one step ahead of this totally rated episode for cars bandicoots cars bandicoots okay isn't it crash bandicoot that's the only thing i remember with bandicoot so meteor lake is coming in expecting it but before that we've got older lake so older lake is going to be a mix between 10 and a minute and seven nanometers so you will see uh perhaps seven nanometer yields uh and what they can do wants older lake hits so i'm looking forward to older lake but i'm looking forward to meteor lake a lot more because if they can do all that right with the tiling and they get that massive ipc increase then we'll see something special out of intel hopefully now apparently with their gpus as well they're going to be making that on tsmc so intel could be could be a savior i'm not ruling them out just yet because of one i'm going to admit terrible launch with the 11900k like it doesn't get much worse than that like let's be honest intel really like dropped one on the market there like hey guys if you got a 10 900k you're going backwards so that's um i think that's what they were scared of when they uh try to like release 10 nanometers and that's why 10am of it took so long because they didn't want to release something that was just so far much like so far backwards from what they already had it would have been so negatively received especially on the enthusiast desktop line but uh yeah sure enough 11900 came 11900 k cometh and goeth very quickest uh but jeremy with the five buck dono i'm good bro uh made about 10k uh in 2020 building gaming pcs inspiredjou i have six more sticks in my closet just don't need more than eight gigabytes okay so you've been okay so you're a low-key baller you don't even game on pc you don't even game on pc you're just like look man he's making that he's flipping he's just like this is the only thing i'm interested in i'm only just making a gaming pc to flip i like that attitude jeremy you're one cool dude jar jar salutes you and then you've even dropped another two bucks in here i do need a better keyboard notice all the typos okay well yeah grab yourself a better keyboard instead of donating to me that's one thing i'd suggest and i wonder if any uh 10 900 but thanks for the donations i wonder if any 10 900k uh users so we're going to move over chat pretty soon we're going to move over chat because we've finished up all the topics here we've also got some quick sponsor plugs here if you guys want to budget scd keys cheap key make sure you get this right here i'll put the link in the description below use the coupon code bftyc to grab yourself one of these keys for only 12 bucks bingo and then the microphone we're using right here elgato this is it right here i can't even talk behind it elgato the elgato 140 bucks and you got yourself something you just plug in and it just works you can even yell into the thing and it's not going to clip it's got a pop filter built in so you don't even need to get all this they advertise some of the extra stuff here but you don't really need any of this extra stuff you just need the base unit here and you're good to go you're a streamer now okay let's move over now to chat finish off this stream we're talking to you guys in the chat let's go ask me them questions let's do this what do we got here if you've got a pressing question as well hit me i'm uh so we've got mr monkey me i'm running the corsair vengeance rgb so we're gonna pull you over here i am running the uh corsair vengeance well anyway where did the question go rgb do you think that i should double so he's got 32 gigabytes four by eight kid at 3600 megahertz do you think i should double that for better fortnite gaming no mr monkey mate 32 gigabytes uh four by eight kid is like 3600 is one of the best uh solutions you can get you don't need to do anything that's really good uh the sil jb anyone have something similar to nvidia freestyle amd one has like three display settings yeah so nvidia freestyle is really good if you want to get freestyle and use all that features with the filters that's been out for years by the way then you might want to get a video card um juan des og gamer how how bad do you need gpu do you guys need gpus that's sad any cheap keyboard recommendations look jeremy thanks for the 2 donation brother if you have if you want a keyboard recommendation just in this chat like after the live stream is finished put the chat in there say brian give me a keyboard recommendation i'll reply with a keyboard recommendation you gotta state your location too but there are i'm gonna say this there are some actually pretty solid keyboards off aliexpress that you can get i've used some in the past and they've been really good i've actually flipped a few aliexpress keyboards with builds and the people have been over the moon i've even asked some of them that have come back to buy pcs a couple of years later like how was that keyboard and like yeah man still going really strong so that's one thing i like like when i sell a lot of stuff like that with pcs you get the feedback you know a couple years later on whether it's mediocre if there's a problem with a certain control key or space bar or something like that but a lot of the aliexpress keyboard key they go hard man because a lot of the keyboard manufacturers will all use the same stuff it all comes from the same factories so it's just the guys on aliexpress are putting it together cheaper so anyway we got here take your city should i buy a okay well lots of questions what's the best sites i can buy a pre-build on depends where you're at brother depends where you're at so you gotta yeah if you guys are asking questions like that's where should i buy this you gonna stay like where are you coming from are you in europe are you in the us if you're in the us you might want to look around on marketplaces and stuff you can get some really good pre-builts on there um in terms of uh in australia i know like tech fast they're bringing some hard value like to the point where i ask other retailers how they're doing their prices and they got no idea i don't even know how tech fast do pc so cheap in australia sometimes i mean i do say sometimes because they do it on the sales uh but we got bob here should i buy a 10 900k for the next four years i already have a 3090 yeah i mean the 10900k if you pick one up cheap enough go find one on the used market let's have a look right now for you guys actually we'll uh skip over right now quickly have a look what's on the used market in terms of ebay like are people selling any like this is the good thing when something launches you can go and buy something for cheap this is a little trick used here we go we've got five of them in the us there's an es a 10 900 k 400 bucks that's like actually i don't know if that's good or not like i'd have to check more about the es but if it works exactly like it does on the original it's probably if that's international that um 10 900k 285 bucks there you go try and bid on that five days time try and get it for 350. but yeah it's definitely going to last you a few more years like easy four more years uh you got the 10850k as well not a bad cpu in its own right so yeah there's some good deals you can get out there at the moment you just got to take a look around for it brother that's all you got to do just take a look around and get them deals but yeah 10900k is going to go great with a 3090 so is the 5800x 3900x 5900x all that stuff um yeah so we're here next up we've got here take a city what's the best sites i can buy pre-built on already answered that uh take you see new sleeper build new sleeper build where uh if you guys want to see a sleeper build i can do one i do have some uh ideas in mind with a sleeper build but even if i did want it's going to be price performance i'm going to be trying to find deals for that sleeper build i'm not just going to go build a sleeper build where it's like okay guys we put all the most expensive stuff in here that you can't afford i'm going to try and find some deals and make it a journey if you guys want to see the journey sleeper build let us know let us know voice it uh should i buy a 10 100k uh sorry i'm going over the same questions here um julian graco hi brian i bought seven sorry that's ty the creator i bought seven hp z400 been upgrading them to x 56 75 and rx 570 yeah cool that's awesome and then julian greco asks uh 10105f along with the other i3 10th gen refresh chips were announced along with the high-end 11th gen it's just a refresh as a temp replacement for the 11th gen i3 okay hey i mean if it's coming at a cheap enough price let's let's take a look at this thing and have a crack at it so that's what i like about it if it's cheap enough we're gonna go there uh will you review the 11400f yes i do have plans to take a look at the uh four core six core and eight core f chips if they if they're available to me and how much they're available for because actually i'll check that right now right that's one thing i'll check they told me i was told like i was like look you're gonna be able to get f chips on launch and i'm like can i get them for review instead of the k chips but um okay add other stores you can get at 11900f i don't see a where's my eleven seven hundred f come on there's eleven four hundred f okay that's one i'll definitely so we've got some cool chips we're gonna check out here eleven four hundred f peak in my interest at 249 bucks that looks like it could be a low-key winner right there but the 11700f is nowhere to be found right now i'm guessing because there's going to be a lot of eyes on it they're trying to sell this thing right here this is the same thing it's like yeah we intel the game's over with the 11900 series it's an 8 core 16 thread it's basically an i7 stop trying to buck off the 900 the i9 as a as an i7 and charge more money for it i mean look at the price differential there it's almost three-fold the price for two more cores like you've got to be an idiot to want to buy that and that's what i mean they're hoping idiots will come along and get ripped off so 2021 man 2021 the year of the rip-off let's get back to that chat let's get back to them juicy chats you guys have been spamming man i can't even distinguish we've got designs by ifi he's answering your questions in chat guys by the way uh we got king kosher hey uh big fan of the channel i found an i5 9400f with a 1066 gigabyte with 32 gigabytes of ram that's ddr4 that's a score for only 500 bucks okay 500 bucks now you're putting a twist on there if that's us i mean it's not bad like gpu prices in the us are bad so i just put in like even try and get people to shave off a 50 right most people shave off a 50. so nice people most people just shave off 50. so there you go so just say 450 and you get yourself a pretty good deal um take your city do you reckon do you rock a laptop for work productivity no i i'm not a laptop guy i tried look the story behind laptops was in computex i think it was 2018 i used the laptop and my videos had like red lines going through them and i was like man i'm never editing on a laptop again so then i made mini itx desktop pcs and i just wanted to travel if i'm traveling i'm bringing a mini itx rig i'm not using laptops anymore just look i'm not a laptop guy if you want to go get laptop reviews and all that stuff there's jared's tech he's the uh he's a fellow aussie does some good stuff he loves it like he loves his laptops man i even heard a rumor that you know he told his girl to get out of bed one night and he's going to put some laptops in there with you know so the missile was like really so that's it's a rumor i've heard though i can't corral you know don't know if anyone's going to corroborate that one for me but um we got here uh can you still overclock with the b clock with the 6700k that was awesome can you still overclock with the b clock ah they've taken like okay so with the z 590 they've taken out like there is a b clock multiplier there but it's still the same thing like it they i couldn't find the straps in the bios like a lot of the older options that you used to have been taken out and in fact it seems like even on the z590 boards sometimes the b clock will magically appear there but i feel like it's more of a shadow system that and that's when when people are like oh the intel system's performing a little bit better in this benchmark versus this guy's benchmark i think that's because there's like some shadow b clock going on where they're upping it three percent as opposed yeah so usually you got a base clock of 100 megahertz on your motherboard they'll up it to 103 and then that particular set of benchmarks with that cpu is now running at three percent faster because they've also been sent to cherry pick cpu that'll go three percent harder anyway guaranteed so there's a bit of trickery with the reviews and the launches and stuff like that but you got to be careful of it um me i just like to the easiest way to tell is to lock in your xmp profiles and see if the memory speeds are bang on that speed if they're a little bit different then you know some they've sort of tinkered the b clock there so we've got fact here do you think the rx 6700 is going to have six or 12 gigabytes uh the x oh the non xt do you think it's going to be worse or better than the rtx 3060 uh it should be better like i think the rx 6700 would be better i think it'll have 12 gigabytes too i hope it does because yeah you don't like six gigabytes will be maybe for their budget line that's what i think things are going so six gigabytes will be for your rx 6600 or 6500 i think the 6700 should be 12 gigabytes so that should be hopefully that answers that question take care city what world do we live in when sli and xfire works uh we'd live in a world where your time traveling back to 2012. that was when that was kind of like the last good generation with where everyone was going hard with their sli and crossfire oh man i got two 7970s in crossfire what about uh getting a hd7870 it has dx12 and vulcan yeah 7870 is still a good card like believe it or not so uh do you think do you think i answered that question i think am i saying questions twice or is it is it just me am i seeing questions pop up twice or is it just all in my head 25 on smartphone uh smartphone chips no yeah i mean a lot of smartphone manufacturers use tsmc so you will see a price hike on um on the smartphones as well all this is gonna when you gotta when you got a price hike on the actual source of the whole pc tech itself everything's gonna go up in price so that's why the tsmc 25 price hike is bad news doesn't matter which way you spin it you're gonna have one of these one of these right here you need 25 percent more of that it's a big it's huge man like and this is the thing when they calculate inflation this is like this is inflation right things that you're buying are going up in price so like i've been kind of watching like inflation's the biggest scariest thing at the moment i think if you guys have been uh working hard and you want to buy stuff inflation should be the biggest thing you're scared about right now when will the chip shortage end when they start when they start just letting people get back to normal life that's when it should end um right now we can't do much right you know it was funny because you kind of like if you want to even even in australia where i'm at right even in australia if you want to travel in australia you've now got this thing in the back of your mind it's like oh is there going to be like is there going to be some random outbreak and are we going to get locked down again so it kind of makes it hard to travel even if you're in australia right and the thing about australia now is like the government's like well go travel we'll give you a hundred dollars to go travel and it's like well what's the point if i'm i'm going to leave on a plane and then the area i'm going to is under lockdown it's not really reassuring so at the moment like the whole this all ties in with the prices of everything so it's one of those things where i'm kind of just like yeah we've got to get on to some happy news is uh so we got uh juwan he's asking hey brian is uh that is the suez i can't pronounce this is swizz canal a bottleneck for gpus it'll be a little bit of a bottleneck i'm glad they got that thing out after a week if that was any longer that would have actually caused some real bad damage one week's like okay you'll be able to sort of like a traffic bank up things will get back to normal again um yeah so that shouldn't be too much of a problem but if you guys don't know what he's talking about there was this big port that got blocked with a boat that went sideways and they had to get it unstuck so they unstuck the boat and then all the shipping containers could go through again anyway do you think we will see the chinese giants like huawei xiaomi starting to produce microchips in the future huawei definitely i think huawei will start doing it soon actually i honestly think they'd start doing it sooner than later huawei's really big and the point with huawei is is that like honestly i'm low-key like i've heard all these bad things about huawei but low-key i love huawei phones they've never let me down and they talk about spying on huawei phones it's like well they're spying on everything now i'm pretty sure even this microphone might have a chip built into it that monitors my voice so like everything's got spying except our windows iso brothers we'll put the link in that you get that cuts out all the crap that's the tech yes city windows 10 iso image we got anton anton here he's from russia with love brother from mother russia with love hello from russia and he's got a hundred rubble on the table i've got a pretty old 7900x we'll upgrading to a 10900k 11900k give me significant boost in 3d rendering blender and gaming 7900x he's saying the x that's the x99 chip isn't it let me just check that one that's like the not so good chip off the top of my head like is it 10 okay you got cause 10 actually no not really man you're not gonna get too much hey if you like if you've got your 11 900 x just uh thanks for the donation too brother um if you've got the 11900x let's check this out more it's already got 10 calls 20 threads and if you can overclock this thing to like four point i'd say like you should be able to overclock this 4.6 that's my like realistically you should be able to get this thing to 4.6 you're going to basically have this a similar thing to a 10 900k so there's actually no point i'd keep your money i'd save your money it's definitely not the 11900k you're losing two course four threads and this thing was released in 2007 wait it was released in 2017 four years later intel releases something with two less cores it's not cool i have the wave three but how do i make it sound so clear oh raise redemptions two dollar donation thanks brother uh you've got the wave three how do you make it sound so much better um that's weird i've got mine on just so when it comes to you got your knob there you press the little knob so this one here you press i'm gonna press because i'm live press the little knob and then you turn it down and see that's three lights so the microphone setting make sure that's just under four and then talk into the microphone as close as you can so condenser microphones you want to make sure you're in close proximity otherwise if you like look i'll do it live hey guys like you see how it sounds it just sounds crap now because it's all echo echo is going to be going into your microphone and it's going to not work so good so you kind of got to talk closer to the mic and let the mic do its job so definitely um it's like i mean yeah i mean if the microphone was this big then yeah you could talk pretty close to it so anyhow guys let's continue on with the questions so we got here a squadron vitaly he's asking tell your city uh what to buy at 11 600 k or 10 700 kf which better same price in my country oh i'd go with the 10 700 kf my man why and you're probably like why because you get the kf and you can overclock the kf2 and you got eight core 16 threads but even though it's not going to make a difference i think overall your 10 700 kf will give you more uh for you if you're using it eight core 16 threads it's going to give you more bang for your buck i just think with the 11 600k it's it's nice you get the ipc improvements but people are telling me the lo the latency's uh worse on the 11600k and for me i'm a big latency buff so as soon as i hear about a latency drop um no sorry latency increase i'm like yeah that makes sense that's why it's losing out in some of the games so that's um for me i'd stick with 10th gen that's another thing why i'm saying i'd kind of stick with 10th gen not just because the plus you've got z490 boards are going to be cheaper but if you really need the um pcie 4.0 then you might want to think about going with 11g low budget memes how's the lockdown going mate it's not cool man it's not cool so we're under lockdown now because just this random breakout happened in our area so i'm trying to deal with it everyone's dealing with it but you know it's just i guess it's good being a youtuber now because hey your work from home so that's it take your city is that iso as sketchy as people on reddit are saying which iso what uh which is so sketchy like i'm telling you our iso is not sketchy at all we did not do anything oh man okay if i'm not even gonna say anything i don't even need to like your boy yes man has been here covering your backs for years i mean look on youtube it's okay but if these guys on reddit man i just got to say something to them you guys need to you guys need to just get a bit of tech yes loving they need a bit of techies love and that's all they need where's the love brothers where's the love no love over it reddit no love at all oh no yeah anyway anyway anyway i'm actually kind of sad i've that's it then marco says the iso is techies live we're talking about the windows 10 iso here by the way that we made this is the one that we did we cut out all the crap we like tested this for days to make sure it was the one that you guys wanted that's what we did uh where can i buy pc parts pcs from in the gold coast oh we've got a fellow guy smelly toenail 69 love the name by the way man i wonder why you're smelly why your toenails smelly um let's uh let's see where can i buy pc parts from in the gold coast anywhere dude gumtree and facebook are a great starting point uh obviously you've got to be quick on there now because a lot of people anything that's really good that comes up on a deal usually gets snapped up really quick now one thing with gumtree and facebook marketplace is the deals aren't so good because the gpus are terrible right now the gpu market on the coast is terrible so if you're looking for gpus you're gonna have to be really on point really quick but hopefully that answers that question we got here from d phillips five dollar donation thanks brother the next time you fill up with the tech yes citimobile to get some next time you fill up the texas city middle to get some sweet deals stick some v power in it keep up the awesome content stay safe you want some higher octane fuel in that bad boy sure thing the five dollars will help cover that extra octane thank you so much and we'll put some we'll put some 98 in there and we'll go for a spin a bit more octane actually i wanted to tune the stinger a little bit more so i could um just really floor it you know the thing already just the thing already wheel spins off the get-go man it's a quick car so this thing is a beautiful car you guys have to at least go for a test drive in one because just experience the stinger you breathe the stinger in you test at least things haven't gone up in price right can we all give kiara a shout out here on they have the stingers have gone up in price i mean like the msrp not the deal that i got it on no i'm pretty sure they have for the new model okay so the sting has gone up and priced too okay times have changed fellas times it's sad day for us all sad day for us all fellas when the prices of kia cars go up you know something's going on something's wrong okay so christopher asked do you have a doc included with the iso of what's removed and what is included uh we we will like all upgrade we did do a dock but it's really basic it's on the google drive um we've got to go through and and read like state it line by line on everything we've done because we have been so busy like we had to make that windows 10 video on the back of testing out 6 700 xt graphics cards new cpus checking doing the regular content as well because i know you guys love the used content and yes it's it's been super busy this last half the month like it's been ridiculous how busy it's been it's like things automatically pick up in march and then some this like march is just like okay we're gonna start releasing everything again you guys hopefully you had a good couple of months break but um yeah the tech yes read it as a ghost town oh all right well we'll update the tech yes reddit we'll make sure the ghost town's got at least one member in there okay do you still disable spectre and meltdown for new intels um i think is it meltdowns automatically disabled spectra one of them is automatically disabled now by default and yes i disabled the other one for intel not for amd make sure you don't touch that program if you're on amd because it actually you'll lose fps um so yeah we got elias van thor he donates 2 euro thanks brother what do you think x99 tf and 2620v3 and i love the vids thanks man uh what do i think yeah x99 that's the tf that's the one and z great board i love the 12 core person the 6 core is a great stepping stone especially for the money that's one of the best value cpus you can get period don't let the haters tell you otherwise uh but then that's a six core 12 thread z on 4th gen it's got the new avx-2 it's fine it's contemporary even though it's six years old seven years old it's still contemporary and you've got the 12 core option to upgrade to to move into it so i mean let's check the prices of xeon actually speaking of inflation we'll quickly check the prices of xeons if they start going up in price then we're all doomed so i just need a fallback here let's have a look 2620v3 they have gone up oh my god okay go up in price these were i swear these were under 20 bucks when i oh no what about the 26 okay 2678 v3 give me some good news give me some good news yes okay inflation isn't happening guys it's all in my head this is the 12 core is 90 i think that was around 100 that was around 90 okay about a year ago so the prices aren't going up too high so at least you can all but look let's be honest inflation's real it's huge it's actually becoming a problem it's a two-speed inflation two-speed inflation things aren't inflating things are inflating but the governments are like well there's no inflation because of things we're measuring um aren't inflating and it's like well can you measure like a lot more stuff and give us the deets give us spill the beans kill spill the beans fellas can you spill the beans that's what next time i go to vote i'm gonna ask at the polls i'm gonna say where's the option to spill the beans because i want to i want someone to spill the means for me uh christophe coonan 10 donation thanks brother here's two fins on me for the sad face you made when i mentioned redditers you have my sincerest apologies i can't wait to try that out so thanks man just let me try it try it dude and then just thank me later you'll love it you'll love it yeah we've only had positive feedback in the discord and on the comment sections i mean i haven't checked the reddit so i can't tell you like i usually read it look reddit hates tech yes city that's all i'm going to say except uh i think there's one like i think maybe the monitor forum the like yeah the place that talks about lg tvs i think they like tech yes i like the lg reddit thorums okay amd reddit forums okay maybe because i said the 5800x isn't too bad everyone was hating on the 5800x and i'm thinking to myself most people just go out and buy a cpu and put it in the board lock in xmp profiles and call it a day and if you do that the 5800x are pretty good cpu sure you're paying a little bit more but you're getting a bit more too so there's the 6800xt content 6800xt content okay okay oh yeah okay well amd subreddit okay i like you guys you guys are cool too uh take a city 15 aud on on aliexpress okay what's this for the i5 7c don't get an i5 760. get a get a 4.8 thread if you go on first gen there's two four cause four threads on first gen is really pushing it man you're gonna be struggling like even on some of the latest games to play competitive uh multiplayer so let's continue through some pressing questions guys but then after that i gotta go feed myself after that i gotta go get fed otherwise i'll get skinnier than i was before so that's my goal my goal is to do a bit of method acting here at tech yes city if you guys want to see some method acting in the intros that's going to happen and i've got a i've got a in the in the patreon vlog today we're going to make that i'm going to i gotta divulge the mojo formula as well people like dude how you been getting the mojo like they're doing the eye thing they're like have you been getting your mojo back how's it been happening yeah like they're doing the eyebrow hey you getting that back dude going to divulge all in the patron vlog guys all is going to be divulged it's pretty it's pretty weird stuff so if you're into vitamins and all that stuff and a bit of vitamin d especially vitamin d it's you know you go out in the sun get your vitamin d all that stuff i'm going to be explaining a bit of it things that i correlate correlation goes in one in wait goes on the on hand and then to the offhand i5 i9 buy a jeep trackhawk uh jeep uh don't jeebs break down a lot okay okay yeah the ones in eyes apparently break down a lot that's jeep so yeah you know and they're not cheap either jeep not cheap i found a gtx 1080 ti for 380 us on offer up that's not bad hey like apparently like in the u.s cards are going up more than odds so if you find a 1080i and it works that's not a bad deal you can get through gaming get through this gaming uh under underdog road with a 1080i absolutely fine sameel joy take your city if i would if intel were to put more cash that's this stuff right here oh man this cash is coming so handy in this stream a if i was to put more cash in rkl i7s and i9s would it increase the performance no not on the i7 and 99s because they're already putting a generous amount on there i believe that's actually why these chips are running hotter as well with 11th gen it has a lot more to do with the caching structure of the rocket lake cpu so i say if they put more of it on there i don't think it would increase performance you got to remember too the cash on a memory on a cpu is the most expensive part of the cpu it's really ridiculously expensive how memory uh how expensive that memory is that goes on that cpu so they do have to sort of price in especially in the i9 right if we're looking at the i9 they have to price in okay where's the max performance versus how much this is going to cost to implement now on the i9 they want to put a bit more on that because they're going to sell that so the fact that the i7 the i9 were the same in that regard means that something cash isn't going to give you more performance that's just my experience with that just by looking at it from a from a logical standpoint i could be wrong but that's just my guess and i'm guessing you ask the question because you want me to give you a guess so there's my guess is the i9 9900k still a good chip and worth upgrading 2021 it's still a good chip don't upgrade it man you're just wasting money especially if you're gaming um that's a good sign if reddit hates you what's this what what's what's going on what oh someone's theorized why reddit hates me i'd love yeah if you guys have some theories as to why reddit hates me i'd love to know that the tech yes man hates americans no i don't i wouldn't i did not say i hate him come on guys i don't hate america where did this come from i do the american accent hey hang on a minute hey filet o java hang on a minute dude you slow down there my friend slow down my friend we're gonna have a jolly good old chat just slow down okay and lucho mangeno he asked any good motherboard for my i7 479k it's from an optiplex 9020 by the way great channel all the way from el salvador uh any good motherboard okay any good for a non ki7 just you can even go with the b85 dude there's no real need to get an overclock motherboard even then i think some of the b85s overclock that chip as well so yeah there's that get a honda civic no uh what's one of
