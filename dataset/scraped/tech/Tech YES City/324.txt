on this desk we've got an amd system
and an intel system and if you're playing games
there may be this question that pops through your head well
it probably doesn't pop through your head but for some odd reason
this question has been circulating through my head to the likes where
today we're going to get an rtx 2080 ti we're going to get a camera that shoots
at 1000 fps on a 240 hertz monitor and then we're going
to compare intel versus amd for input lag
and see if one has an advantage over the other and we're also going to throw in a
twist and that is we're going to include a
1680v2 xeon which is a seven year old cpu and this
cpu performed phenomenally well when i tested it against the 10900k
and also the 3950x though those introductory details out of the way
let's quickly take a look at what these test system configs have in them
and then roll those numbers for you guys today's video is sponsored by
dashlane dashlane is a password manager that is quick to download and powerful
in its abilities so i like to browse local forums trial
new video services like apple tv and i don't want to give out my most
important tier 1 passwords especially if i'm disconnecting from
this service later and this is where i let dashlane simply do its thing
with dashlane it can autofill and remember these passwords
for these websites that you don't visit often shipping details and also
other boring details can be auto filled too
on top of all that it can auto generate complicated passwords and store them too
so if you have become accustomed to using one word dictionary entered base
passwords and you might want to stop doing that
then all you have to do is download dashlane
login and remember the one master password you set for your dashlane
account and the rest is history now if you use

below easy let's get back to the video so here's
the first system here zed or a z490 depending on how you're
looking at it and it's got the 10 900k 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 dominator memory with 3600 megahertz
cl 16. now moving over to this system here
we've got the same h115i rgb platinum cooler
cooling the cpu but this time around we're using an x570
phantom gaming x motherboard and a 3950x it's going to be using the same memory
that we're testing in this system we're just going to hop that memory across
and then the last system right here we've got the x79
with the 1680 v2 xeon with ddr3 cl9 2133 megahertz memory
then lastly we've got the aorus kd25f 240hz monitor
this thing has extremely low input lag which i've tested before
and it's also got very good response times in that they're very fast
when you smash the overdrive to the maximum setting [Music]
so we just finished up testing and i've decided to go in and throw in a heap
more tests within this video and that is first of
all we'll do hyper threading versus no hyper threading
and then second of all we're going to do an amd graphics card versus an nvidia
graphics card and within that we're going to test
because we're testing two different games
we're going to test freesync versus g-sync so i've shot all the results
i'm going to go edit them out but essentially i've found with
fortnite is that if we play on a local server
we don't get any ping so we've eliminated the ping
variants that could make the results just silly
and so we're eliminating as many factors as possible to give you guys
an apples to apples comparison using the same ram using the same motherboard
manufacturer using the same monitor and for this contraption right here
which is on an amd box this is a mouse a logitech g3 that's
been hacked up with an actuation point so as soon as
the left mouse click is actuated there's a light that comes on and in
conjunction with a high refresh rate monitor
as well as recording 1000 fps we can see and eliminate as much variance as
possible to give you guys accurate numbers now
another thing as well within fortnite since it does run
better on i found on g-sync even on a freesync monitor in dx12
i've decided to now test that on the freesync variant
so we will get an idea of if g-single freesync run better
in terms of input latency but another thing as well we're throwing in csgo
just to test the amd versus the nvidia graphs card with absolutely
no sync on at all anyhow i'm now going to spend a few hours
analyzing all these results for you guys and we'll come back
and see what the verdict is [Music]
babylon [Music] and now here we are at the conclusion
with a hot cup of tea and here we are finally now with the
results that you may or may not have been
waiting for because going through the numbers here they were
pretty uneventful that's what i'm going to say there
wasn't any major differences that were worth writing home about
basically if you had an older xeon or you had a new 10 900k or a 3950x and you
were gaming with a 2080ti or a 5700 xt
you've got real no differences there that are going to determine how well you
can play a game and believe me i'm a big advocate on input lag and also playing
competitively but when we're seeing differences of
only a couple of milliseconds at best on average then it's nothing to
worry about and we'll get onto these numbers anyway and then we'll talk about
things that you should be worrying about if you're a pc gamer and the first
things here uh fortnite was the game that i guess had the biggest
difference if we were to call it that between
the xeon the 3950x and the 10900k where it scored on
average 15.5 milliseconds on the 10900k going over the 3950x that came second
place 18.3 and then moving over to the xeon that
scored 19.8 and as we said before with uh fortnite
we did put it in dx12 we did put the monitor to g-sync enabled and on
the case of the amd freesync enabled and we
did cap the fps at 240 fps in-game not only to give us a different
look compared to cs go but because this game i found in the
past in general runs and gives out the best input lag
with these settings enabled and onto cs go showed us a similar trend
to fortnite in some ways and the first thing was
we got 12.2 milliseconds average on highest threading no hyper threading it
was virtually the same on the 10 900k so
it's really not going to make a difference for your games as we did a
recent video on this as well and it really
wasn't worth turning off unless one particular game you could
gain some fps move over to the xeon that's called 14.6
milliseconds average and then on to the ryzen 3950x that
scored 16.3 milliseconds though i will quickly point out the best
frame we scored in this game it was seven milliseconds on both the xeon and
the intel eight milliseconds on the 3950x so
really the best case scenario that you're going to get out of your hardware
isn't a whole lot if we're looking at averages it might be a few milliseconds
if we're looking at the best frame that we scored in cs go it's one millisecond
and so it's really not going to make a difference between
determining whether you're going to be good
or bad at a game but what about graphics cards we've got here the 2080 ti
and also the 5700 xt now i decided to rerun the test on the
3950x because that's got pcie 4.0 i didn't want any complaints arising
from the fact that hey you should have tested on the amd system so
we saw here when we look at fortnite we re-ran these tests
and we got an average time of 18.3 versus 18.2 so
there was virtually no difference between these two gpus
in terms of input latency and this was uh turning on freesync
versus g-sync though the best frame was uh two milliseconds lower at 14 versus
16 so the nvidia did score out the lowest frame in fortnite on the
3950x versus the 5700 xt though moving over to
cs go this is where we saw an average of 16.3
milliseconds versus 16.5 and again we had that best frame of 10
milliseconds versus 8 and we had the worst frame so
it did throw out the averages if we're looking at the averages in cs go it was
thrown out by this one anomaly frame that went up to 29 milliseconds but
again i'm not going to throw that out because
that's part of testing you've got to average
all the results whether they're good or whether they're bad and so coming out of
these results at least looking at it from a pure
input latency perspective there was no real difference in input lag between an
amd gpu and a nvidia gpu both with freesync technology and g-sync
technology turned on versus off in the case of cs go they're
looking past the graphics cards and looking at the cpu the memory the
motherboard the power supply the ssd and potentially a hard drive
this stuff here the biggest thing and the biggest takeout for me
personally was you want to make sure that you're not getting any stuttering
in your games out of this hardware so if your frame rates are very smooth your
one percent point one percent lows are pretty high
in that game that means you're going to be playing well in clutch situations
if you're one percent one percent lows are dropping that's where you're getting
massive stuttering and that's happening during clutch
playing that's going to cost you games so make sure that your hardware isn't
stuttering i think that's the biggest thing to take out of the hardware itself
though if we look at it from a pure number perspective the 10900k did come
out a little bit ahead of these other two cpus both the xeon and the 3950x
and of course that thing's clocked at 5.2 gigahertz it is
an expensive cpu and it's pretty much the best you can get for gaming
so when it scores a couple of milliseconds better
i guess you would expect it to do so but another thing on top of that is
a couple of milliseconds this is where we're going to go into the next point of
the video which is way more important for me personally and
that is a couple of milliseconds really just pales in comparison to a
monitor with good input lag i've seen some monitors
carry upwards of 50 milliseconds input lag so if you're playing with that
you're automatically at a massive disadvantage versus a xeon versus a
10900k versus a 3950x another thing too is the mouse if you're
using a bad mouse with input lag i've seen mice with like
10 20 milliseconds input lag if you've got a crap mouse that's going
to be adding input lag to the chain so if you've got a bad monitor bad mouse
you could be adding anywhere upwards of 70 milliseconds
just on these two devices alone then of course the last factor
we've got your internet connection so if you're playing games online and you've
got a poor internet connection or you live very far from the servers
you're gonna be adding another 50 100 even 200 milliseconds
to your total system delay and so that will cost you games
so when it comes down to a hardware perspective yes there are some very
minimal advantages to be gained but i would make sure that everything
else in your pipeline is working to the best of its abilities
going into this i was hoping for a bigger discrepancy that would have made
it more exciting but sometimes the news just isn't that
exciting though one thing that we can look at
finally is if you're using your computer for competitive gaming one
thing that i've always done in the past and one thing i do recommend going
forward is always use the usb ports at the top
of your motherboard and the reason you should be using these usb ports
is that they're generally connected directly to the cpu
giving you technically the best input latency but with all that out of the way
if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to
give us a like also let us know in the comment section
below what you think of input latency and how do you get the best
results yourself is there some tips and tricks
that you've noticed with particular games or with particular hardware that
has netted you some better results love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always but going forward from here i will say
when it comes to testing cpu and memory and some of these
individual components i'm probably gonna stop it at this video
because two to four milliseconds really isn't a whole lot
and it's nothing as we said before compared to your monitor and mouse
another thing is too is that the games i'm more focused on them i've found some
games can carry a pretty big input delay
themselves for instance i've tested ashes of the
singularity in the past and that's had some pretty bad input
delay as opposed to cs go and fortnite they've got
really low input delay meaning that the engines that they've designed for these
games have been very well designed for pc to
the point where you have very little input delay
and that's what you want ultimately for competitive play and now we've got the
question of the day which comes from unfortunate sun and they ask where can i
buy used parts that are not broken and basically i've talked about used
parts for years here on the channel quick and easy answer is buy local make
sure it works before you buy it that's the best thing you can do if you're
buying online buy off a reputable seller someone that
has really good feedback so if you're going online and you're buying off
someone that says this thing works so well but i tested it
one year ago and they got zero feedback there's a
pretty good chance that that part might be broken so with that in mind
local check out the parts make sure and verify they're working
online reputable seller you're good to go you shouldn't be getting hosed
well you should rarely be getting hosed if you do those two things hope that
answers that question and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now and if you stay this far
ring the ring the sub and the bell bye [Music]
