the gtx 970 was released nearly eight years ago quite a long time since a graphics card has been released and it's still relevant and you probably clicked on this video to see how this gpu performs in 2022 and you've come to the right place we'll pull up some of these newer titles that i've got on the xbox game pass here the first being anvil which is a really good looking game even though it's only a preview this game uh was really enjoyable actually for a game that i just kicked off and started playing and this is kind of like an arcade top-down style game we're out of the box with the gtx 970 where we tested this on an i7 3770 it recommended maximum settings out of the box and i noticed it was stuttering a little bit so i always like to turn the games down to high settings even if my hardware can handle the very high or maximum ultra settings because i just find it makes for a smoother experience and also if the fps exceeds my monitor's refresh rate i can also consider undervolting the gpu where in this game we were getting 81 average fps with a one percent low of 48 and a point one percent low of 25 so absolutely smooth experience on this 970. the next game we pulled up is panzer corpse 2 which kind of like a turn-based history game but i will admit one thing this game was a little bit buggy where i just tried changing the settings in general uh from the maximum which it recommended out of the box with the 970 tried changing down to high medium low it just did nothing to the fbs it was just staying around 30 fps and the one percent point was set lows were horrible but even on maximum settings we got an average of 34 fps so this game it does need a i guess a bit of patching but it will run absolutely fine with the gtx 970 but if you want higher fps unfortunately it just looks like this game just needs an update to unlock that fps because it's just running pretty bad at a point in time but it is a turn based game so i guess the focus isn't really on high fps with turn-based games it's kind of like a game that needs to be appreciated and played like chess with low fps of course what about some other titles fortnite 2022 update the apex legends the recent update with the new hero they call him newcastle and then we've got dungeons 3 another late title we'll throw these benchmarks up for you guys right after this sponsor spot from today's video sponsor never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again with today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated for as little as 15 dollars using that coupon bftyc links in description below welcome back to tech yes city and straight back to the gtx 970 this graphics card you can have it on the used market for a hundred usd or roughly around that area if it's a good model it might go for a little bit more especially if the person has taken really good care of it they've even changed the thermal paste for you but in the case of the one that i have here today it is the jet stream gtx 970 from pallet i don't know if i pronounced that right it might be palais i remember people telling me the exact name for it was derived in a different language but i just love to call it palette but this graphics card right here set me back a little under 100 us dollars but i did have to change the thermal paste on it and that can be a little bit of a tedious task for some people some people don't like to touch hardware at all they're like oh my god i'm going to break something but if you take your time and you watch tech yeah city where we've constantly changing gpu thermal paste you won't have to worry about a whole lot and in fact the gpu will run a lot better after you do this but moving through the next title we've got here apex legends and this is where i put in a blend of low and high settings and we're getting over 100 average fps the game looks gorgeous at 1080p i was playing this on a 165 hertz ips monitor some of you guys have requested i do a review on this i would need to get some of my gear sent over from australia in order to review this monitor properly because uh yeah i want to give you guys input lag response times and stuff like that but on this monitor the 27 inch it looked absolutely phenomenal i could seriously i don't need a new rtx 3080 or anything like that to enjoy this game the gtx 970 do a perfectly fine job of that and the one point one cent lows are also very smooth as well give you a really good experience and this is with the latest update with that new hero newcastle it's actually a bit of fun to play it's actually bringing in a new dynamic to the game which i do enjoy even though i was playing octane because everyone was picking newcastle while i was benchmarking but the next game we got up here is fortnite 2022 update and i managed to get the stonks guy and i managed to win a battle royale so maybe the japanese servers are favoring your boy tech yeah city where we're getting here an average fps of 125 and then a one percent low of 52 fortnight uh for the life of me this game always manages to has a 0.1 percent lows they dip quite low but thankfully they don't happen in clutch plays i i find the 0.1 lows in this game usually dip when you're in a new area and the map's updating and you'll actually see the text come on the screen and it correlates heavily with this 0.1 low drop in other words whenever you see like updates from the game coming on your screen in the form of text that's when you're prone to getting some stuttering even if your system is running completely smooth though let's pull up the last title here and we've got dungeons three i remember i used to play a game way back in the day i don't know if any of you guys remember as it was like dungeon lords or something and this game just felt like it continues on maybe that series it was actually a bit of fun to play even though i completely forgot the game mechanics you just build up you're a dungeon you mine gold you build farms you build creatures and this was getting over 100 fps 116 average fps is what we clocked in one percent lows were absolutely fine the 0.1 percent lows did dip though i would say would be similar to fortnite a similar story where i only noticed dips when there was uh the game was updating and you'd see text come on the screen but regardless when it came to battles completely smooth experience definitely loving what i'm seeing out of the gtx 970 but with that aside let's sum things up here with some synthetics for you guys if you want to compare your graphics card and obviously get an idea for value if the gtx 970 is something that you want to get then you can sort of take home these uh synthetic scores and just match them against newer cards other used cards on the market and here's where we got a physics score of 9721 that was with the i7 3770 though for the gpu we get the fire strike extreme not to be confused with the other two there's actually multiple fire strike benchmarks we got here 5 317 and then a combined score of 2269. so definitely a solid showing from the gtx 970 we didn't overclock anything in today's video and in fact we even tried under vaulting because you guys love it when i include some under vaulted benchmarks and here is where we went from 168 watts in unity in heaven and ultra settings down to watts and the only way i could really get some under volting out of this card and lower power consumption was to drop the power limit and the megahertz at the same time keep in mind this is on maxwell we don't have an msi afterburner the frequency response curve which is actually from the 10 series and upwards and this gives you actually a lot of headroom to really undervolt the card in a more specific manner we just don't have that with the 900 series if you guys know a better way of undervolting this card especially keeping the performance close to the stock values but really dropping down the power consumption i am all ears do let us know in the comment section below but we did get a little drop i wouldn't say it's really that worth it since the performance drop was roughly to the tune of 10 percent and the power consumption really if you were to add that in the total system power consumption that would probably be around 10 percent as well so you're not really gaining a whole lot from undervaulting with this gtx 970 at least with the method that i'm doing here in the video for you guys but to wrap things up with the gtx 970 it is an absolutely phenomenal card it is after this video it has become my favorite card of all time and i know this is going to sort of shock a few people but it's just been so relevant for so many years it still has the ongoing driver support from nvidia which i'm actually kind of surprised i i don't want to jinx it i'm not going to say anything more because i don't want the driver's support to end but it has had a really long life it is still a relevant card in 2022. if you are buying this off the used market i would caution looking at the condition of the card if it looks like it's totally trashed i would avoid it if it looks like it's been taken care of and the owner does look like they're giving you some transparency and saying hey look we haven't mined any cryptocurrency on this thing and we've taken care of its whole life then that's definitely the card to go for as opposed to i've definitely come into my fair share of used cards that were absolutely horrible to deal with and i can tell you from a standpoint just looking at the overall condition of the card it's always the best way to go with also if you're very cautious and you 100 is all you have on you and you can't afford to lose it i would go through a site that has some sort of protection and recourse or if you're buying it off someone local just say hey if this doesn't work properly can i return it in a few days usually most people are very comfortable with that or they'll show it to you working on the spot so hopefully this video has served you well if you're thinking about buying one of these cards then i can definitely give it the go ahead i think it's phenomenal value even in today's market where we've got inflation raising the cost of all these new gravis cards it's getting out of control i feel like if we didn't have any of this inflation in the last two years that we've seen the gravis card prices of the gtx 970 for example would be around maybe 60 us dollars or something like that and it would be even a much better of a buy than it is at a hundred us dollars i think at 100 us dollars the only reason and the price is this high is just because of just simply inflation that's that's really the only way to describe it and i'm sort of surprised that the tech companies even though amd and nvidia and stuff like that their stock prices are tanking they're not talking about inflation they're just like it's a big elephant in the room that these guys just want to ignore but don't worry if you have come to tech yet city we are going to talk to you guys about all this stuff from all angles so if you want to see that juicy detail as soon as it gets dropped then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and also if you want to become a behind the scenes member and get some access to some vlogs stuff like that for as little as a dollar a month you can hit that join button and with that aside we do have the question of the day here which comes from to a new earth and they ask i'm getting a used one still under warranty just wanted to know if these cards run hot and they're talking about the rx 6600 and these cards they do not run hot at all at least from the testing i did on the rx 6600 it is amd's probably their best card in the rx 6000 range at least in terms of value it's also one of the best cards if not the best from a memory in terms of efficiency if you undervaulted so definitely a very good pickup if you've got the card and it's come from a miner however i would test out the temperatures if they are running too hot then definitely have to pull that thing apart change the thermal paste and it should be running a lot better anyhow hope that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
