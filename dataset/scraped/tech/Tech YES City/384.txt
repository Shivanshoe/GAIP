with new situations there brings new opportunities and lately I've been delving into the potato side of life and to be honest I've been loving it there's that saying is hear it on a lot of these rap tracks where people are like looks so much better from the top it's like nah man around tech ES City things are looking so much better from the bottom so join me tech yes citizens on a journey where we take a look at all the stuff that nobody else wants and see what magic we can make happen [Music] so going through Gumtree we've got a few different desktop machines here that I've found and it looks like no one's really put down any serious offers on them because it just says there's no offers been offered yet so we've got a i 5 desktop that we're dropping down 80 Aussie dollars on and the Aussie dollar of course you guys should know already it's a lot weaker than an American dollar but I will put up the US pricing for y'all out there over in the land of the u.s. of the a but we've got another deal up here that I put some money down on why actually didn't put money down on them because at their current market price that's really going to be tough for me to make any money on them but I said look if I come and pick up all these three computers what's the best you could do for us so hopefully they get back to us on that then there was another guy who had a few different systems available and I asked him look if I come and pick up a heap of systems off you can you do a say a 20% discount and he said he was ok with that and he asked me what machines I was keen on so I gave him a list of 5 machines I was keen on but still waiting for him to get back to me - but then there was another listing here - which was a VIPRE desktop now this case is definitely gonna have potato in it like worse than potatoes gonna be rotten potato but I like the case and I really like doing videos with these really sort of different parts that used to be cool back in the day and they're not made anymore because production costs first who would want to buy them really isn't there nowadays so I put down $30 they said 40 and I said man look at the condition of this thing I'm only really after the case and possibly the power supply so they said sure come pick it up so we've got that in the kitty we're gonna go pick that up soon and then we've got a I 5 desktop which I messaged them about they said has already been sold and then there was a guy up in Sunshine Coast who I put down an offer for all these PC parts and he said he would take it but I asked him maybe if he can come down a little bit closer to Brisbane then I wouldn't have to drive over to ours because that's where these parts are located so what I'm gonna do from now is go quickly see as well the old favorite here on the channel Liz who I just gave him a call before and seen if he's got any better because he sold us a Verret on in the parts hunt and the Verret on actually just gives out this weird beep code as soon as it starts up and I've tried a different CPU in it so basically the motherboard is gone I think tried different Ram too so I'm gonna go return that to less and say look this wasn't tested properly and then I'm gonna see what else les has got on hand too and on the way we also found some bargains on Facebook marketplace where there was a GTX 650 and a message the guys got back to a said short thing come pick it up there's also an HD 7770 so this is right in my league offered 30 Ozzie dollars for this so that's 50 Ozzie dollars for two potato level graphics cards little still I believe will still play fortnight absolutely fine so those who have gotten back to us we're good to go and there's also as well at GTX 750 which someone came to me about and they said would you be interested in this I'm like sure I message them but they haven't gotten back to us and last of all there's a gtx 1070 for 300 ozzie dollars in this current climate I'm just gonna go pick it up and pay that price because I bought this hard drives off this guy before so I know his legit so with that aside there's only one thing left to do and that's getting the yes 'mobile and see what unfolds yeah potatoes like just you know real low end sort of PC real real my uncle junior yeah yeah Oh [Music] and we just finished up now at lasers place quickly because he closes at 5:30 so I had to make it there before then and he also threw in a heap of filthy Mouse's and keyboards also some 19 inch monitors so we got a pretty good score at least in these current times from good old lez but what we got from now is a GTX 650 that's come through that's pretty close by I'm gonna go pick that up and then we got the guy with the 78-74 50 Aussie dollars and we're gonna go pick that up right now - because that's close to the GTX 650 and then there's the 77 70 which ironically is right around these other two gravis cars I'm just waiting for the guy to get back to me on that so hopefully about time I picked up these two GPUs the third potato GPU will be ready to go okay so there's no like you know yeah there's no potatoes through your [ __ ] the other day well I did I did buy the potato what is he gonna power spoiling it [Music] it goes so we just picked up two GPUs GTX 650 and also a 78 70 and this is the thing they were like two minutes from each other you could walk from getting one deal to the other but now I'm also in this area where I've got to get the seventy seven seventy but there's also someone who messaged me on gumtree about a GTX 970 awhile ago and then I remembered while I was picking up these deals so I sent them a quick message they got back to me and now I'm gonna go pick up that 970 because it's just around the area so this is what it's all about and that is Shambala laying and getting them used deals and he goes to jail and he goes hey you been anyway good I'll scrape the bottom of the barrel right now just see what's going on come on be gone off - Brizzy a bit late off the next couple hours so it came for me to pop around or walk around all right so we're now back at the studio and it's getting a little bit late so we're gonna come back to this in the moanin and then we gotta see what we got on the desk here but I will say one thing look at this white DVD tray on the black mesh I mean that just screams potato already and then we've got here a box of keyboards and mice that are all dirty - 19 inch monitors and five gravis cards this is what it's all about and here it is with our GPUs in ranking order we have from rank of potatoes out of five from bottom to top we've got here first of all a GTX 650 which gets four out of five potatoes because mainly in 2020 it's got one gigabyte of VRAM it's really only a basic 720p card that can't get a whole lot of FPS above that is three and a half potatoes out of five with this 7770 basically the same thing is the 650 but I believe this will be quite a bit faster and then above that we've got the 7870 which gets only two potatoes out of five because it's not really that bad it's still a decent card double the vram with the 77070 with two gigabytes and still able to play games at 1080p and it's actually a really underrated card I like where this thing is out in 2020 then above that we got the GTX 970 score in one potato out of five with of course that for you out of VRAM I've done a video on this one of my favorite cards in 2020 on the used market really good performance still out of this thing of course it being a little bit older still man to squeeze a potato out there then above that we've got zero out of five potatoes gtx 1070 of course being expensive but you're gonna notice the potato ranking lines up with pretty much the price so of course this being the cheapest card this being the second cheapest all the way up to the end so what we got here is the first of five pcs so we've got them all lined up I'm checking out the specs down here at the moment and this one here's got eight gigabytes of RAM if I'm going to give a hard drive of course all the jazz included souls I have to do is really replace the graphics card now it is lockdown prices so I'm used to getting these off layers for around 80 maybe but this one here was a hundred of pop and then three others were a hundred of pop too so we'll go through each of these which were a hundred a pop and then one of them was fifty ozzie which was the AMD there's an AMD rig there and yeah that one's like a little bit old I think it's ddr3 though so we should still be in luck anyway this one here we're going to clean this up and make it a fortnight gaming PC combo right now well I should know [Applause] [Music] and here we are on to the next part of this deal this was the bonus so basically if I buy a lot of stuff off less I always ask him look can you chuck in some extras for us I always love a bit extra and he's like well I asked him do you have 19 inch monitors because generally people sell me these for literally like 10 Aussie dollars a pop they don't want them and I take them so he was like look I can throw in two 19 inch Dell monitors I was like wow over-the-moon estatic and then what even made the deal even better was these filthy Lenovo potato keyboards and these old Microsoft white mice this was like the best potato throw-ins you can get with a deal because you know what's gonna happen to these keyboards that's right tech yes loving let's give you guys a little bit of a taste right now to see how dirty this thing looks right now let's grab that one let's grab this one and let's see the before and the after [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and now we got a setup done here you'll notice the PC changed over because that PC right there does not support a GTX 650 even or an HD 7770 so we're out of luck and I gotta then figure out what card will actually work with this old Pavillion over here because I forgot that HP's second gen you've always gonna be so careful with second and third gen hu dip yeah that's the only way to describe a bad lucky dip with potato upgrade path and I got a little bit carried away with the fortnight setups there so we ended up cleaning them all up setting them all up and photo in them you got a love fortnight well I mean some people don't love it but fortnight er self has done so much for the potato community out there and it's just gonna keep doing wonders I guess there's no foreseeable stoppage of fortnight gaming pieces that are required by people coming into the PC gaming world though that aside we did have the first PC we started off with that being this HP Pavilion I could not get a graphics card to work on this thing I even tried my legacy 56 70 with no PCIe power requirement that thing didn't even work on this pavilion so I'm guessing they made this motherboard with literally one graphics card supported to this motherboard so basically with some of these older motherboards especially HP 2nd and 3rd gen what they do is they actually pre-approve in the BIOS the certain graphics cards and then they speak with the motherboard and then they're able to turn on and so if that graphics card is not on there then the PC just simply won't give out a signal via the video card on the PCIe slot so that PC pavilion thing from HP I'm gonna basically have to turn that into an office PC but with that aside the rest of the setups here are already there all good to go I did have a few spare like 19 and 20 inch monitors left over and of course we've got a heap of those lenovo keyboards and mice combos or even managed to get an old-school microsoft intellimouse which I'm actually gonna use a little bit and try out because I haven't used one of those for a while this is the og one with the ps2 support so that was really cool that that thing came through here and some of this older text playing around with some of this older stuff even though it's like old and potato level can be a lot of fun you can probably see this is the reason during this lockdown that this whole season is starting up new episode because before I before the lockdown came into place I started up a series of trading up the gaming PC but that's gonna be postponed because the main reason for that is once I start moving in to the higher end of stuff the prices are all over the place things are out of control supply stopped especially on new parts and so that's gonna make things a lot different to what I'm usually used to so me sort of branching away from that for now and going down potato alley just seems like the right thing to do where I will give you guys an update though on episode 1 we did manage to sell all the stuff even for a little bit more than what I initially wanted so we've got five hundred and twenty odd Z dollars out of that $100 so episode two is got the green light it's all good to go but we're gonna have to wait until who knows how long until that next episodes coming out but in the meantime we've got the potato hunter here ready to go and I don't know what ever better way we could have it because this is just I don't know it's making a whole new thing out of nothing and I'm really getting my hands dirty like quite literally cleaning this stuff up and to be honest I haven't had this much fun in the wall especially on the channel here hope you guys have been enjoying this content and in terms of the deals here today my favorite deal I don't know I gotta say the seven seven seventy or the seventy eight seventy those two cards are really underrated we've got them for a pretty cheap price and they're going to play games at either 720p for The Sims f70 all the 7870 the two gigabyte that's gonna play games really well at 1080p even in 2020 we're talking games like fortnight especially and then maybe Call of Duty warzone I think these two graphics cards will barely be able to do it at those resolutions I actually still got to test that out that's one thing I want to test out so that I can get an understanding of that but in terms of the GTX 650 that's still good to go for 720p for tonight and then we've also got the 970 in the 1070 there which we'll put into some other builds so demand is there at the moment and I'm just trying to go any way possible to get the PCs so stay tuned for episode 2 which should be coming up very soon dear sub boxes and let us know in the conversation below what was your favorite deal of today's potato hunter season we came up with a lot of goodies and with all that out of the way we've got the question of the day from Tala Jim and they ask what's the meaning of letsa yes our fixer that's a slang for we're gonna fix this up and give it some tech yes loving in the process and then it's gonna work absolutely fine and then it's gonna look branding you after that and without aside guys I'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're lovin this potato content hitting your sub boxes and you know
