what is cracka lackin' used pc parts enthusiasts it is the month of april and it's approaching the end and that can only mean one thing and that is a used pc part-time where this month i have a goal to get the cheapest individual parts in that i'm going to be micromanaging more this month looking for those little things that are coming at a good price and that i don't think a whole lot of people are chasing and what i mean by this is i'm going to be chasing sort of older gravis cards two gigabytes of vram you'll still be able to put together a really good price performance pc if this is sort of your target especially in these times and then we've got ddr3 memory we're going to be chasing some of that as well because i do from last month's part hunt still have a few oem systems stocked up here and i'll put the link to last month's part on right up here but with that aside let's get into the deals and then see what is papa lopping so pulling up good old gametree the first deal that we're getting into here is some believe it or not ddr3 memory an 8 gigabyte kit here for 25 aussie dollars now you're probably thinking that's okay but believe it or not ddr3 memory at least sourcing it new has actually gone up in price over the last year i'd say actually if i look at last year's quotes and this year's quotes from brand new suppliers it's actually gone up around 50 then moving on to the next deal that they've come back and said okay this is an hd 7770 now it's not a great card but it will still play games like valerian like league of legends and so you can couple that with a budget pc and that'll really make some magic for a low end build which believe it or not low end builds are actually in quite a bit of demand still especially if people can't get all the latest and greatest where i personally feel like the higher end stuff now carries a more exponential premium over what it once did even a year ago so that's where i think the value lies and that is in the lower end so we're going to keep pursuing that based on these prices at least that we're pulling up right now the four more deals that we are waiting on answers back from is a 7870 we're offered 65 for this and then a gt 1030 where i offered 75 and then also a 16 gigabyte kit of ddr3 memory for dollars and then lastly there was actually an eight gigabyte ddr4 ram stick going for 25 going for 30 i just put in an offer of 25 so hopefully all these people get back to us and accept these offers so we can start getting some more parts so it's quickly used flash i've got to hit the tech yes mobile sooner than i expected there's a gtx 1070 that i've got i put in an offer of 350. they said yes we're going to pick that up right now there's also an apu a 2200g which they wanted 100 for i put in an offer of 80s so we're quickly gonna go grab those two now because the person has to go to work so of course i don't want to miss out on that but as we're hitting the road i'll put some of these deals up that i put officers down and we're waiting for the people to get back on you still you [Music] [Music] so just finished up picking up two deals in rapid succession and this was the gtx 1070 scored that 350 in the bag then we've got right here a 2200 g which i've actually been thinking about doing a video on this because if you guys are in a price performance struggle then this little apu could indeed be your savior but from here on in we've got to give lez a call and wait for some of the messages to get back to us with some of these deals hopefully we can pick up a little bit more fingers crossed [Music] [Music] just in the yes mobile just finished up at lez's place it's getting a bit dark i had to do a few things in brisbane before i went to see les and also had to take back a few faulty parts so believe it or not parts do get faulty but les is really good in that regard because he will give me uh just straight up credit on the stuff that is faulty if i get it from him and it hasn't been on it's been untested but he's just like look just test this if it doesn't work bring it back so he's always good in that regard but we did get some pretty good deals this time around i got a heap of monitors i also got a gt 730 which i got for 15 and i mean i know people will laugh at a gt 730 but hey 15 and it will play some games i know that for a fact gt730 will do a lot better than a gt710 for example it's like in a different league if we're looking at micro plays but then we also had a personal favorite a xeon pc this was loaded with a one terabyte hard drive 12 gig of ram and i got that for 90 dollars and the only reason i paid a little bit more for that was because of the 12 gigabytes of ram and because of that one terabyte hard drive and so the z400 series desktops too they're built so well i mean these things are built like a brick [ __ ] house though some other cool goodies i got from les was a set of logitech speakers for 20 bucks he wanted 20 bucks and i'm thinking to myself hey logitech speakers with a sub 20 bucks sounds like a deal to me and then we also picked up a video camera which he gifted us this old analog with a tape deck in it and i was like okay i'll take that because i'm kind of believe it or not i do like some of the old vintage stuff and especially when it comes to film analog film can give you like a really cool different experience so maybe if you guys want to see a video around uh say an analog video editing setup then maybe i can try and make something happen in that regard i just had this crazy idea that came to my mind so all this gear from les we ended up picking it up for 420 that was after we got some credit so you might see some other pcs in there but he did exchange two pcs for all the faulty stuff that i brought back so that was a different sort of separate thing altogether though in terms of other people getting back to us with deals we actually uh someone got back to us about the gt 1030 but then they didn't message me so i'm like here's my number just message me directly and then they said i'll take the offer but they haven't gotten back to us and we're up here in brisbane and we've got to get back soon i can't really wait around that much longer otherwise i'll be here all night and then there was another deal that the ram that was up here and they haven't gone back to us yet either though there is one potential deal on the gold coast for cl 16 32 gigabytes of g-skill memory 3600. this stuff is of course the cream of the crop when it comes to ddr4 memory in my opinion and especially at 240 bucks it's a decent price considering you're getting it at like cl 16 3200 so those two sets of memory they're in a different league cl 16 3600 is much better stuff anyhow let's go hit the road and go pick up that ram and hopefully some people get back to us in the meantime with some responses [Applause] so here's a little added bonus of your gaming pc you can use all these fancy lights to light yourself up and then you can do a talking head portion while you're recording a used parts on now we've found four gpus potentials and honestly i'm going to focus so if people don't get back to me about memory sticks and other stuff i'm not too devastated it's the gpus right now that i'm super focused on without the gpus there is no price performance without the price performance there is no tech yes city as we know it but what we found here was a little bit of a mixed bag where i saw an rtx 2060 super for 500 and i'll think to myself well 500 is pretty fair so i just said look i'll come and pick this thing up 2060 super 500 aussie cash let's do this and i'm waiting for them to get back to me there's also a gtx 650 where they just wanted 15 bucks for it so i was like okay that asking price is very fair so i'm talking to him now providing it works i'll go pick that up and then the next two graphics cards were new so we got an rtx 3060 where they want 880 i just said look we'll come in at 800. let's just call it a day that's pretty much what they're going for brand new in australia it's just they're all sold out and then um that was after the whole accidental uh driver slippage from nvidia there but then we had the 6700 xt someone had a brand new one of those and they want about nine i'm sorry a thousand dollars but you can get the i think you get the red devil for a thousand news so i was like look come in at 900 and we'll call it a night so it's pretty late now guys i'm going to go to bed with some rgb i'm actually not going to go to bed with the rgb but we're going to turn off the rgb then go to bed and then see what happens in the morning and still look for some graphics cards in the morning as well you beauty so no joke i was just about to get to sleep guy got back to us 6700 xt he accepted the offer so we'll go get that tomorrow and then the g skill ram so even though the guy we missed him on the way home because he didn't respond we um we can get that tomorrow as well so there will be more deals on the table tomorrow that will be the reality more deals equals more entertainment [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so now on the next day and i had to pick these up right here and the people finally got back to me in the afternoon but this is the most interesting deal right here gtx 650 has 15 bucks and they also had a 27 inch dell monitor and they wanted 15 for it so i got these two here for 30 bucks so i think that was a nice pickup and then this right here on the way home i ended up finally a guy got back to me and he gave it to us for 230 dollars because he was a little bit late to reply so i got a 10 discount on that and then lastly we got the 6700 xt and they got back to us and they said they'll come and drop it off here later tonight so before i do hand over the money i'm definitely going to be checking to make sure the card works because if someone's dropping something off to you always make sure that part works before they take off because then you've got no idea where they live or anything like that there's no recourse for getting a refund if the product's faulty but that's about it i have exhausted pretty much all my options here for all these deals this month over the last two days and we've had a pretty good success rate i've picked up some low end stuff and i think we're going to talk about the high-end stuff because you may be thinking well the 900 offer on a 6700 xt is pretty high but when you look at it that's kind of the going rate i've been speaking to people across the scene and some people are paying like over a thousand dollars for instance for 30 60s and people are paying um more than you're used to paying for these new gpus and i guess that's just the way the market's going for instance you're like well brian you never pay you've never paid 350 bucks for a used 1070 before in recent times or at least in the last few years and the answer that is yes but times are changing now and we've talked about this in the last especially the last few videos and it's kind of like these last few videos they kind of had a they weren't that you know they weren't the most positive videos that i've produced but i've had to educate myself on all everything recently and retrain my brain a little bit with certain things so we are going to see traditionally what would be some really good deals here on the table but then we're going to see things that probably don't look like a good deal at first but when i've got demand for people messaging me and saying hey i need a pc for price x and this is what they roughly want in the specs i can get one of these cards for instance for 350 and i can still make a decent profit off the final flip then i'm going to definitely get into that especially when i'm picking up things like i5 10 600 for 150 bucks and then picking up some cheap ddr4 memory i'm able to make it all happen still because the other parts are still pretty well priced and i guess people know that since the gpus are more expensive they have to pay more for the final pc so i'm just really the intermediary and that's how you should think of yourself if you're doing pc flipping you should always think of yourself as just the intermediary in the middle and i guess i am taking a little bit of a gamble in this high market but as i've always said high turnover so we're paying 350 for this thing but we're going to be flipping it as soon as we can that way if and if crypto does crash for example and the prices of gpus just start plummeting we're not going to be left with too much stock on hand and then we can react to the market quickly and then see how it changes anyways with all that aside we're going to put the use parts hunt tally here for april 2021 up on the screen do let us know what you think was your favorite deal of the month i have put an asterix against that 6700 xt as of course nothing's ever ever guaranteed until the money's changed hands and the products in your hand so that one's still out and about but in terms of all the deals this month do let us know what you guys and what your favorite was i mean personally for me i was going to say the vintage camera but actually this gtx 650 i mean for 15 bucks i'm gonna see what it can do i think it can play free-to-play games quite well at least maybe even at like 1080p low settings but i mean the price performance 15 bucks it's there and now we are here at the finish line for april 2021's used pc part time of the month and looking forward we can see some trends going on here and that is some of the parts i mean the graphics cards that's just staying expensive and sort of you're going into a new market and i haven't seen this kind of market before but i know one thing and that's going forward you just got to roll with the punches and that's always been my channel motto here at tech yes city whatever the market is have that high turnover just be ready to adapt and that's what we're doing right now you may see things a little bit different this month and that's me adapting so if you guys have any questions or comments then be sure to drop a comment below i'll get back to you as soon as i can but in terms of going forward i'm just going to stay focused stay positive hope you guys have been enjoying that content but do drop a question in the comment section below because we've got the question of the day here from mike and they ask just a question it's at the end of the comment uh just a question brian the 10 30 with the gddr5 structure are they a better buy or an acceptable card for a low end gaming computer in say an i5 4470 or should i spend the extra for a 1654 gigabyte so it's interesting to ask this question because in this part time we're actually looking for 1032 gigabytes so don't overlook a 1030 especially if you just want to use it for something where just your own gaming pc you're building something for a friend that just wants to play like cs go or some basic 1080p low settings fortnite 1030 uh make sure it's the gdr5 version that'll do that if it's a ddr4 version just avoid that thing it's a rip off i think it performs like half as good as the gdr5 version so that one is literal garbage but the gtr5 version that's pretty good go for it if you can get at the right price though in terms of the 1650 at the moment those things are expensive they can go north of three hundred dollars where i am so 75 bucks versus 300 i can get four 10 32 gigabytes or one 1650 and i mean for me personally since i'm flipping a bit i would go with the 4 10 30s i'd be able to do so much more with that than i would the 1650. anyway hope that answers that question if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] [Music] you
