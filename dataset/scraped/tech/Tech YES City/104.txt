[Music] [Music] today we're going to be doing something a little bit different to a normal pc build and the focus here is on low power consumption and how we're going to be doing this is we are going to be picking pc parts that have the lowest power consumption out of the box and then once we get those pc parts we're then going to take it a step further and tune them to get even more power consumption and the end result is going to be hopefully a pc that ends up using even less power than that of a laptop but also gets more fps and also since it's tech yes city we are going to be using some used parts in today's build also but before we do this build i need to go to the computer store and get some budget components one of those being a gold rated power supply which will be one of the most important parts for today's build but we'll explain that a little bit later are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2. links in description below [Music] and now we just got back from the computer store and we have here the star of the show which in this case will be believe it or not the power supply because we want to get an 80 plus either gold rated or platinum rated power supply and the reason for that is when it takes energy from the wall and then converts it for power for your pc to use there's actually a bit of energy that's wasted in that conversion process and so basically an 80 plus gold will do a better job than an 80 plus silver and that would do a better job than 80 plus bronze and that would do better job than any plus and then that would do better than an unrated power supply however there is a step above 80 plus gold and that's 80 plus platinum and i think there is also titanium as well but as you get to those grades of power supplies the costs go up exponentially so this one with the 80 plus gold i thought this was some of the best value where i got this locally for 79 australian dollars which in u.s dollar terms would be a little under 60 usd now when i checked out the graphs that silverstone supplied on this et 550 they said that it reaches its peak efficiency at 90 percent so that is the first part to consider with a power supply the second part is also the fact that some of these ratings can actually be believe it or not faked by companies now in case of silverstone they're a pretty reputable brand so i doubt that they are faking this rating however i will actually be putting that to the test later and there's a very easy way you can put this to the test if you have a spare power supply on hand as well as a water meter which the water meter is important in this case because later on we are going to be seeing how much power this whole build uses however one thing to consider with a power supply the last point that i'm going to make is you may be thinking well brad you should have bought a 650 watt power supply or a 750 watt power supply because you could only pay another 10 dollars and get a lot more headroom on your power supply however in this case i was thinking the 550 watt would be perfect due to what's known as an efficiency peak so even though this 80 plus gold rating means that it's going to be running at over 80 i think it's about 86 efficiency at all times meaning there's only at max one point in time fourteen percent of energy wasted in that conversion from the wall to uh providing power deal and pc parts however there's actually in the middle of this efficiency curve a ninety percent rating at least silverstone is saying that's what the rating is on their website meaning that if our whole build so that's the motherboard the cpu the graphics card the ram and the ssd for instance is only using say 275 watts then this will actually do the best job possible in wasting the least amount of energy because that is where the efficiency curve peaks out on however the next low powered component we are putting in this build is the one terabyte m.2 this is a western digital blue i picked this up at the local hardware store for a pretty good price and the good thing is here we don't need any extra power cables it'll run off the motherboard power and western digital states that on average it uses most of times under one watt then next up we've got the ddr4 memory this is some corsair vengeance lpx i got this used and the good thing here is it has no rgb leds so we're not going to be using any power lighting up leds next up we've got the 6600 xt this is amd's latest graphics card release and from my test so far it is looking like it is the most power efficient graphics card when you especially when you undervolt it so we're going to be doing that a little bit later but let's get on to the last important piece of the puzzle and this is the motherboard and cpu we're using a b360m so micro atx motherboard with i guess the least amount of components on it as possible so there's no rgb lighting on this it's also got less components than a full-size atx motherboard typically would have and we don't have wi-fi on board either and then we've got in the cpu socket an 8400 t now the t acronym from intel is actually designed to be a low power consuming part from the get go meaning versus a standard i5 8400 it'll have lower clock speeds but also use lower power consumption when both in full operation and even things like idle and normal operation the last added benefit of this motherboard and cpu combo was that i picked this cpu up for a really good price and the motherboard believe it or not i got given to me because someone traded in this motherboard for buying another pc and they said this motherboard didn't work but then a few days later i actually uh tried bending some pins back those micro bends on the pins and then the board got working again then now it's time to build this pc and we're going to be using the matrix 30 which again has no leds and only one exhaust fan since this pc should hopefully not be dumping that much power at all but another benefit of this whole pc is it's going to be very quick to build since we are using minimal components [Music] so we're now on the bios and what we're doing here is we are doing something known as under vaulting and if you can look at this dynamic v core we're going to take 200 millivolts off the cpu cores voltage so bring that down to 1 volt we may even be able to do it lower but once i do some tests after dropping it this much i'll then proceed to drop it say for instance another 50 millivolt and then we will see just slowly testing for stability on the cpu to get it as low as possible with the best possible performance and so what that's going to do is drop the power consumption down now this bios is a little bit limited but it's still enough to get a pretty good result and one thing i like about this method is intel and even amd to some extent but it's more intel loves to charge you for an overclocking license for instance on their k cpus and they love to charge you for an overclocking license on their motherboards with their z motherboards and this essentially this method where you get a non-overclockable motherboard and a non-overclockable cpu just basically gives much better value in that you're saying okay intel you're setting the limits for these components and then i'm going to then basically tune the gear myself to get the most efficiency out of those limits so if you want to think of this in a different light you can think of what we're doing here is maybe the value choice for overclockers in 2021 and what we've got here now is we've also locked in our extreme memory profiles so because this motherboard maxes out at 26 66 megahertz that's not a problem because we're then going to go into our advanced voltages and go down to the dram and drop that down to 1.2 volt but we may be even maybe even able to get away with 1.15 volt or even 1.1 volt but we will check that out later because hopefully our power supply has not just a good power rating with the 80 plus gold but hopefully it also has a low ripple which is important for getting the lowest voltages which in turn will help with power efficiency but once we're done with that we can then save the profile and we can call it undervolting and we can just really just give this a boot this up and see how it goes [Music] [Music] 32.11 that is how much efficiency we have gained after we've done this tuning and you probably see by the smile on my face that i am actually blown away by this figure because i didn't come into this expecting that much of a gain now what we got here was actually 40.35 percent less power consumption this was during the fire strike extreme test and then we lost about eight point two six percent performance so when we factor those two in together that's where we get our thirty two point one one percent gain now if we look at the scores here the most power consumption you are going to save is when you're tuning the graphics card that's what i found with the 6600 xt we were able to drop the graphics score from 13117 down to 12071 but on that note when we're looking at that same test with the water meter we went from 208 watts down to 128 and then for the cpu side of things we ended up dropping the power consumption down from 69 watts down to 60 so we ended up actually saving 9 watts there and then the combined score we went from 233 watts down to 139 watts so nearly 100 watts in total system power drill on this fire strike extreme combined score when we did all the tuning now we ended up tuning the cpu down 0.1 volt or 100 millivolts and the ram ended up finishing up with minus 0.05 volts or 50 millivolts so the way i quickly found out how to get stable voltages on not just the cpu and the dram but also the gpu is to find something that's barely stable in other words the software starts crashing or in this case the cpu on the dram that was crashing as we booted things up and then we then locked in a bit higher voltage and so that's how we found those stable voltages pretty quickly but in terms of the graphics card and tuning that we ended up with a 1085 millivolts at 2098 megahertz and so this left us with a very efficient profile but on top of that i also decided when i was doing these tests to turn off the leds on the video card itself and also the motherboard and then we also disabled completely disabled things like the parallel port the serial port and the hard drive control on the motherboard now in total i believe these accounted for a very slight decrease in power consumption and although it didn't make much of a difference where our idle wattage on the desktop went from 34 watts down to 32 watts after doing these different changes it's still a difference nonetheless though the downside is you will lose that fancy rgb bling on the gpu and that little orange led on the side that's really the only aesthetics you're going to be missing out on but it's still all these little things come together to help drop the power consumption down in the end then moving on to the gaming numbers this is the most important part here we're going to start off with apex legends because this is where we saw the biggest drop and again this would have been out of the three games we tested the most power intensive because it was using that gpu and maximizing it at even 1080p and so here we went from 240 watts down to 142 watts so nearly 100 watt difference and our fps only dropped slightly from 177 average to 165 average and in fact we got a slightly better 0.1 percent low and i believe it's due to two factors and that's our cbu was tuned a little bit better but also our gpu wasn't running as hard now apex legends i think that does like to have eight threads or more so six core six threads you may have to tune some settings to get smooth fps in this game but moving over to cs go we had here 118 watts versus a drop down to 94 watts so we did see a difference while we're playing cs go getting that magical under 100 watt figure while we're gaming is certainly something to smile about and here we actually got an fps increase of 229 from 215 average fps so that was impressive to see that increase and again i believe that just like the physics score and the fire strike benchmark when we did this tune we actually ended up getting not only lower cpu power consumption numbers but better performance out of the cpu as a result and then the final game was dota 2 where we went from 110 watts down to 105 watts but again we did get an increase in fps going from 146 to 151 so dota 2 and cs go didn't make that much of a difference in terms of power consumption but apex legends made a huge difference the numbers aside let's talk about this being pretty much for me something that i'm gonna definitely be going down and exploring a lot more here at tech yes city because what we got here today let's get back to that number 32.11 this is what old school overclockers back i'm talking like x 58 days or pre x 58 these kinds of numbers were the numbers that you were getting when it came to overclocking and intel didn't charge you to overclock you got that performance thrown in for free so these kinds of numbers that we're seeing here today reminds me of that error where you didn't pay for more you just spent your time and tuned for more in this case it's actually going to be in favor of the environment too because we're using less power that means less wastage so going forward into the future i think this is going to be a huge new meta and i'll be giving you guys lots more reports on cpu comparisons gpu comparisons and just telling you the best power consumption routes to go down if you want to get into gaming now the last question that may be on your mind is what about laptops aren't they more efficient than pcs and here's where i'm actually going to get this pc and compare it with a laptop that gets similar fps especially in apex legends to find out where this pc sits in terms of power efficiency versus the fps because i think the fps that we're getting here at apex legends at 1080p max settings for 142 watts is very impressive to the point where i think a lot of laptops would have a very hard time beating this thing out but ultimately when it comes down to it what you're getting here is something that's not going to cost you any extra money it's going to be extremely quiet the temperatures are going to be very good in this case we're getting a lot of times under 50 degrees which means that your parts in the end are going to last a lot longer than they otherwise would and especially if you want to resell them in a few years time they're going to have great longevity still left in them and not only that we've got a cost-effective solution in that we're using a b360 and that we're not paying intel for their overclocking licenses on both their motherboards and cpus and then after that there is the final benefit which i think is probably the most important because you are actually helping the environment by doing this and you're not just on twitter virtue signaling though before we get on out of here there is one more test that i am going to do and that is i'm just going to get a ordinary 80 plus power supply a budget 450 watt corsair power supply and then i'm going to put it to the test against this silverstone power supply to see if the silverstone power supply really is an 80 plus gold now i won't know exactly if it's an 80 plus gold but i'll get a general indication of if it is more efficient than a standard 80 plus power supply and by how much so running the final test where we check this power supply here which is 450 watts it's a budget choice it should be less efficient showed that it was less efficient with 209 watts on the gold rated power supply versus 217 on the corsair cv 450 though i would possibly like to see a little bit better efficiency from the gold rated power supply perhaps it's more a silver rated power supply even though the power supplies are different ratings we've got a 450 watt versus a 550 watts so technically they will have different efficiency curves in favor of the cv 450 but this power supply right here is only an 80 plus and there's a big gap between 80 plus and gold rated anyhow guys with that aside i will catch you in another tech video very soon if you've enjoyed this one and you want to see more of these types of videos make sure you hit that like button do let us know in the comments section below what do you think about this whole build here today and also you may have some questions as well like why didn't you use an 11400 f or a ryzen cpu and we will get onto those and believe it or not this i5 8400t that we used in today's video it's actually one of the most power efficient cpus you can get for gaming on the market and even compared to a 10th gen or an 11th gen where i found in the past that the 10th gen 10 400 f that was more power efficient for gaming than the 11400 f and also the ryzen 5 3600 however we will revisit these things in the future so stay tuned and i'll catch you in another technique soon peace [Music] [Music] world [Music]
