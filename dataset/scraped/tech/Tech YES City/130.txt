welcome back to the second episode of pc 
ultra clean where in the first episode   we took a pc that was just so filthy and 
of course in the process we fixed it up   and made it work like it was brand new as well but 
right here on the desk we've got the next specimen   that has come through and this is where the 
person that brought it in they just said look   brian this pc it has some issues where it boots it 
won't boot up properly and i just want to get rid   of it i want some cash so i ended up trading 300 
aussie dollars for this pc it features a gtx 970   an i7 on an x79 motherboard as well as 16 
gigabytes of ram and a 750 watt power supply   as well as an ssd and hard drive though let's dig 
right into it see what the problem is first and   then we'll get on to the massive clean you feel 
like this when you see this well if so you can   get rid of that windows activation message with 
today's video sponsor scd keys for as little as   12 usd after you use that coupon bftyc you can 
get activated today so after trying to boot it up   a couple of times we got as far as a preparing 
automatic repair screen in windows and then it   just froze completely and now we're trying to 
boot it up again and it just doesn't boot at   all but regardless we are now going to take 
it all apart and just give it a nice clean   now for this cleaning process we are going 
to be using an ultrasonic cleaner with you   guessed it tap water and detergent however the 
catches here is that we have to get the water   off the parts as soon as we are done cleaning it 
because we don't want to add to any of the already   oxidization that is going on with the gravis 
card and the cpu cooler and we want to avoid that   because we don't want any more metal filings 
dropping on the gravis card from the cpu cooler so here's all the parts now they're all laid out 
on the table ready for our cleaning session now   one of the criticisms i got especially in 
the last video is that i make this stuff   look so easy and so this part here like 
chucking the stuff in the ultra cleaner that is   super easy that's the straightforward process 
are we actually going to detail the hardest   part and that's after we end up cleaning all 
the stuff and that's getting all the water   out of every little component here as well as um 
i guess just the whole final process of getting   all these parts to work perfectly because i i 
know you've heard i know it's counter-intuitive   when you hear you know don't put your pc parts 
near water especially just water out of the tap   and uh yeah i like to do things differently i just 
like when i when i trial and error things things   that work and save me time especially money then 
that is going to be the method that i'm going to   use going forward so yes there are some risks 
especially if you want to like do things like   leave batteries in your motherboard but since 
we're taking that battery out and we're just   going to be putting this thing in the ultrasonic 
cleaner that's going to be doing all the work   cleaning all this stuff up to brand new but 
another thing is too is that the hardest part   of the last video that we did i would easily 
would have said would have been this right   here the power supply now we we put this in the 
ultrasonic cleaner and it took me a long time   to get the water out of this because i had to make 
sure you know especially with the power supply you   want to make sure there's not one drop of water 
in there so i dumped the whole thing in there and   the cables were in there as well and that was the 
hardest part so this time around i'm only going to   dunk the top head unit into the ultrasonic cleaner 
and then let it do the cleaning because yeah it's   just something you probably want to be careful 
of because you just don't want any water at all   in the power supply once you're going to turn 
it on now of course you want to discharge the   unit as well before it goes into the ultrasonic 
cleaner so what we're going to do right now is   hook it up to a power supply meter test it out 
make sure it's okay before we even put it in there   and then we're also going to use that 
power supply tester to drain the power supply this is is is   oh is easy oh hmm so this is not the end it's just is wow thank you i love you and now after hours of cleaning and then 
drying out the water and then spraying on some   multi-purpose spray we are now at that phase where 
we're ready to build this pc but you may have   noticed in some of the previous shots there we did 
do the spray painting on the nocua cooler and fan   as well as a little bit on the side of the gpu 
cooler and then on the cables that are going to   be visible because i want to go for that stealth 
look and i want to do it as much as possible   with what we've got now we've only spent so 
far about five dollars on a can of spray paint   but we have spent up until this point quite a few 
hours just cleaning when it came to drying out   all the water i spent over a good 20 minutes 
just making sure there wasn't a single drop   of water paying particular attention to the 
motherboard and the power supply which has   a lot of very small and confined areas which are 
very tough to get to so you do want to make sure   that you're going thoroughly over these parts 
because as i stressed before in the previous   episode you do not want a single drop of water 
still left on the build when you go to turn it   on so anyway with that aside let's get this thing 
put together and then check out if it finally does   boot up but i'm pretty confident it will boot 
up because we don't have any more metal shavings   and a lot of dirt and even some rust was coming 
off some of these parts so i'm pretty confident   that that was the problem it was just erratic 
behavior and that can be caused by of course   things like metal shavings and just 
a bit of rust so let's check it out so   two foreign so after spending a heap of time building it up 
and getting those shots of the bill completed   and what it should have been it's some real 
unfortunate news and that is the motherboard just   isn't working it didn't get past that bios screen 
and then upon pulling it out and just really   checking over it thoroughly i i just i've tried 
everything on this board it just won't work and   unfortunately it's just really bad news because 
this is one of the most expensive components   on this build the x79 motherboard so you know the 
i7 3820 that's relatively cheap compared to what   it's going to cost to source an x79 motherboard 
especially a rampage gene but i mean what do   i think happened with this board well there is 
signs of rust especially in some of these screws   right here so perhaps some critical component 
on the motherboard has just suffered a bit too   much rust and we've got it now a faulty board 
that just really doesn't work properly and it   was a bit odd as well when the build first 
came in that the ram was in the c1 and d1   slots they should have been an a1 and b1 so that's 
sort of an indicator that there was problems   with the motherboard before it even came in but 
what we're going to do now unfortunately is we're   going to change it over just for something budget 
because i do flip these pcs and if if i'm putting   in two expensive components especially with the 
gtx 970 then i'm not gonna be making any money at   all in fact this sort of has aid into the profit 
margins big time on this pc to the point where   i just think it's gonna be hard getting our 
money back but let's see what we can whip up anyhow   so and now we have finally finished this pc after 
such a lot of hassle and messing around and   if you guys are into used pcs and you're 
building them yourself and especially if   you're going to flip them from time to time you 
are going to come into problems sooner or later   and if you're not coming into problems then you're 
probably one of the luckiest people in the world   but in this episode right here i just wanted 
to take you guys through one of those scenarios   that kind of turns out to be one of the worst case 
scenarios in that the motherboard's faulty because   if a motherboard's faulty you just have to replace 
it there's no getting around that i mean usually   you have to replace other things too but replacing 
a cpu and a memory stick and things like that   that's actually a lot easier than taking out the 
whole motherboard and especially when you get a   signal out of the motherboard both before and 
after you wash it and i i think it's this time   around i i should have thoroughly checked the 
build when it came in uh when the person came in   to trade it in i just saw it booted up and i was 
like yeah this should be okay i'll be able to fix   it but it ended up being one of those really rare 
problems where the motherboard's faulty something   on the motherboard's faulty but it just it this 
is what happens and so i've got to take that hit   because when i give the person the said 300 aussie 
dollars for the build i do so on the pretense that   they're never going to hear from me again and i 
got to deal with that problem but at least we got   around that by using a z170 this was a gigabyte 
board i picked this ball because it was relatively   cheap i got this on a really good deal with an 
i5 6500 and we used one of these uh latest i5   black stealth coolers that they include in the 
newer cpus where i put a water cooler on that   on another build and then taken that intel cooler 
off that building it's worked perfectly in this   build to keep that stealth look up now i did want 
to use these two black sticks of memory with no   rgb but they didn't work they weren't compatible 
with this motherboard so there was another problem   that came up in between now and finishing off 
this pc so we put in two rgb sticks of memory   and they were compatible with the board and 
everything works fine and keep in mind this was   one of those first generation ddr4 motherboards 
so some of these boards do have compatibility   issues with certain types of memory but all that 
aside we have a build that is working it's quiet   it runs fire strike perfectly fine the 
temperatures are really good as well   i'll put the score up on the screen for you guys 
but it's funny that we've got a 6 gen i5 we've   got 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory 3200 megahertz of 
memory uh xmp profiles tuned in and we've got a   gtx 970 but the rx 570 build with the first gen i7 
the previous episode where we fixed up that whole   pc that ended up scoring a very similar if not i 
think it scored a higher score in fire strike than   this build did so you don't have to get the nvidia 
card and the latest and greatest cpu to still get   really good price performance out of your rig and 
in terms of this one here though uh moving this   on and trying to sell it trying to flip it i am 
going to unfortunately because i had to put the   motherboard and change the ram and put a different 
cpu in and stuff like that i am not going to make   anywhere near a healthy profit margin on this 
one as opposed to the previous build i actually   sold that one today made a nice healthy profit on 
that one and they were really happy with that pc   anyhow that's about it from me it's late at night 
i'm gonna get on out of here do let us know though   in the comment section below what you think of 
this stealth build right here is there something   you would do different and also do let us know 
what you think of this pc compared to the one   we did in the previous episode do you like the 
stealth look more or do you like the leds more   or do you want to see something more over the top 
if we get another pc in and do the next episode   and i'll be looking for something maybe a little 
bit different maybe i'll look for a budget case   and we'll change the case over with this series 
going forward i actually don't want to change too   much with the pc i want to really just restore it 
instead of changing parts around and adding extra   onto the budget unfortunately in both episodes i 
kind of had to add extra on to the budget in order   to flip them and make them contemporary gaming 
pcs especially with this one with faulty parts but   that's just how it is sometimes i'll always show 
you guys the fails just as i'll show you all the   victories and i'm not afraid to do that because 
that's what life's all about you have your ups and   your downs and even though this one ended up being 
a bit of a downer i'm completely used to it by now   you guys know the drill [ __ ] happens and with 
that aside if you enjoyed this one be sure to   hit that like button and i look forward to seeing
