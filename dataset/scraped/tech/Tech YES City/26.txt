[Music] me [Music] everywhere you look nowadays you see a 1 000. you might be thinking i don't have a thousand dollars to spend on a gaming pc well then you see a under 400 gaming pc and the thing completely sucks and it can't even play games well if you're on a budget and you have 300 i'm gonna show you how you can build some of the best used price performance in today's build so let's look at the parts on the table here and then give this thing a little bit of cleaning and touch it all up and then put it together and see how it can perform at 1080p never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again with today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated for as little as 15 using that coupon bftyc links in description below [Music] [Music] is [Music] don't wait too [Music] is [Music] i need to buy nice [Music] me [Music] so we've now just finished cleaning these pc parts and you're probably thinking damn they're looking like they're brand new and that is the process of cleaning up used pc parts and what we've done here is we've changed also the thermal paste on the graphics card which is actually pretty important because the older the graphics card is in the case of a gtx 970 is actually quite a few years old and so the thermal paste over time dries up and changing it here today will just make it so that it performs pretty much like brand new you probably like brian use some fancy stuff here to clean down these pc parts and what i've got here is the main three components you actually don't need the big air blower and the brake cleaner that we used they're just like extra little things i like to do this 556 right here this is basically like wd-40 multi-purpose spray it's non-conductive non-capacitive and it'll clean down pretty much everything 99 of what you're seeing here in today's video so you don't need all that extra gear to get a really good finish then we've got some thermal paste gt900 massive tube of this stuff is only five dollars always recommend this to my folks at tech yes city then we just got a screwdriver and with that said it's finally now time to put this pc together and see what it comes out like i feel out of place the roads aren't the same like they were when you were the one driving my car [Music] and it's taken me back [Music] but you'll always [Music] everything but you'll always stay close to my home oh [Music] spin me around [Music] and there we have it with the under 300 gaming pc and the fps was extremely smooth but you may have noticed during the benchmarks we had a weird display resolution put up there for testing and that's 1024p and that's because the monitor that we used it on is a 19 inch dell with vga in only and so this graphics card actually has a weird configuration where it's got a dvi port and then mini display ports and a mini hdmi and so we didn't have the direct cable to go to our 1080p monitor so we had to from the junk store again by a mini adapter which changed the mini displayport to vga then that worked on this budget dell monitor however that aside this gaming experience was so smooth at this resolution where we're getting over a hundred fps in two of the titles and that was in apex legends and also borderlands the pre-sequel and we also decided to fire up metro exodus at ultra settings and we're still getting over 80 average fps now the beauty about this pc was that we're getting the 1 and 0.1 percent lows they were very smooth as well meaning you're going to get actually a very good experience even with this configuration at 1080p on medium high or even ultra settings depending on the game and the best thing was the graphics card temperatures were really good the cpu temperatures were fine and everything was whisper quiet in this pc now luckily we had a blue led ring fans on this build and our cpu cooler that we got from the junk store that was also had a blue led then the motherboard had a blue pcb so everything kind of worked out okay in the end and that was kind of one of the gambles you take with used price performance sometimes you don't know what you're going to get but also if you saw in a previous video where we did a parts hunt to collect these parts in japan i had a different motherboard but unfortunately that motherboard had two of the memory slots that didn't work and so we would have only got eight gigabytes of ram in single channel if we decided to use that motherboard and not get a motherboard that actually worked properly and also on top of that the average fps would have been bad as well but speaking of performance the i7 3770 and the gtx 970 even in 2022 if you want to play games especially some of those very popular free-to-play games or even cheaper titles that you can pick up like borderlands pre-sequel i actually think i got this for free anyway on epic games as free giveaways that they have on their game sometimes you can get very good performance for very little money however closing out today's video we are left with a machine that ultimately is very quiet looks pretty good performs really well and also has a 500 gigabyte ssd so it's going to be very contemporary and you've got 16 gigabytes of ram to be able to play games smoothly and even talk to people in the background with applications like discord and even have a few tabs of google chrome open in the background i probably don't recommend having too many tabs of google chrome open in the background otherwise your pc may start slowing down but when it comes down to it used price performance is always the way to go to get the best price performance however in today's video we did take a gamble with some of those parts especially some of the parts that we bought from the junk store where they don't guarantee anything and when you buy it you can't return it so if you were to build a used pc like this one today i'd recommend going with a platform where you can get some kind of recourse if something doesn't work properly and you can get your money back say within seven days or if you can test the parts out and confirm that they're working before you buy them as opposed to me with going to the junk stores i am taking a gamble but i am reading what they say on the labels even though it's in japanese i get a good idea but unfortunately with that motherboard like we spoke about before i actually got a little bit hosed in the sense that they said that it was one of the graphics ports that didn't work properly when it was actually two of the memory slots that didn't work properly at all and the problem was when i saw it in the display case they had two of the memory sticks in dual channel which that configuration they were showing in the case wasn't working at all so it was actually kind of disappointing to see that a japanese even a junk store would kind of do this to a consumer someone buying their product so that was a bit of a mishap that came out of the video but all in all when you're dealing with used parts sometimes you can come into these mishaps they can be very annoying but that's not a problem you keep going through and in the end you're gonna get very good price performance but with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed the return to japan and the first used price performance pc coming out of this country from tech yeah city if you did be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comment section below what do you think of this pc what do you think of the specs and the price that we put it together for love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and with that aside we do have the question of the day here which is actually not the question of the day but it's throwing a bit of shade at the tech yes shades that we picked up in a recent deals hunt where i got some new sunglasses and i got them for five dollars they're actually under five dollars when you convert the japanese yen to usd and mitch yk says tech yes city big smiley face tech no shades sad face laughing out loud and actually a few people said they don't like the sunnies here at tech yeah city the new shades that we got but that aside if someone doesn't like something that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad anyhow guys i'll catch you in the next tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you want to see that content as soon as it drops be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and also if you want some behind the scenes access where we talk a little bit more about what's going on behind the scenes here then you can hit that join button for as little as a dollar a month get some of those juicy vids behind the scenes too and with that aside i'll catch you soon peace out for now from japan bye [Music]
