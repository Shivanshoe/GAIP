the 6800 xt from AMD is finally here at 650 featuring 16GB of vram is it going to dethrone the rtx 3080 which was nvidia's $699 4k gaming champion well there's only one way to find out let's roll those benchmarks for you guys where we've got 1080p 1440p and 4k numbers on a distant planet somewhere in the cosmos we exist in cyberspace [Music] we've been transported to the future we're dealing with forces beyond our control [Music] you will be terminated [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] on a distant planet somewhere in the cosmos we exist in cyberspace we've been transported to the future we're dealing with forces beyond our control [Music] we exist in cyberspace we've been transported to the future we're dealing with forces beyond our control [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so the numbers are all out and what we saw there was just an absolute show of performance amd with their 6800 xt they've really evolved and that's the best word to say from coming from me because i've just seen them over the years they've struggled to compete with the video especially on the high end i mean the last real card that i was enthusiastic from amd was the rx 400 and 500 series but with the high-end side of things they didn't really throw nvidia a high-end flaming fist of fury and sort of like their high-end say for instance vega and then radeon 7 they were met with a bit of i guess power consumption and then they had water coolers and there was a few things that stopped them from really just competing on the high end over the years but this right here the 6800 xt marks a new level of price performance but also a new level of top performance where depending on the title 1080p a lot of the times they're going to be cpu bound and in today's testing i did use a 5800 x i did overclock that and also use that with 32 gigabytes of cl18 3800 megahertz memory so we got the best performance numbers out of both the nvidia card and the amd card over pcie gen 4. now in terms of the 1440p numbers here's where i'm going to be making a solid recommendation for the 6800 xt it's pulling ahead of the 3080 comfortably on average at this resolution now if you're a high refresh rate 1440p gamer or you're an ultra wide gamer this card is going to offer you really good value for money in the high end segment and we'll talk about value for money on the lower end segment later on but when it came to the 4k numbers this is where they started to even out a bit and it did start to favor the 3080 because of the gddr6x and although it's only got 10 gigabytes of 6x this stuff is faster than the gddr6 that they're putting on the rx 6800xt even though you get 16 gigabytes and more vram you do get faster vram on the 3080 hence why the 1440p numbers will favor the 6800 xt versus the 4k numbers which will generally favor the 3080. though as for the power consumption here's where these two cards are going head to head yet again the 6800 xt being on seven nanometer and then the 3080 being on eight nanometer i was expecting the power consumption to be i guess in the same ballpark but they're pretty much identical when i was testing dirt for 4k where the difference was only a couple of watts and then when i started to undervolt the 6800 xt it started to perform very similar as an undervaulted 3080 and this was really surprising because you will definitely want to undervolt the 6800xt in my opinion because we then got around 90 watts less power consumption from the wall where the 3080 got similar results when i was under vaulting that and you're only losing a couple of fps at best so if you want to save power and also the benefit to that too is better longevity on your gpu as well as running a lower noise and a cooler temp on your card then under vaulting is definitely going to be something you want to check out now with that said i will be making an under vaulting tutorial for both these cards coming out very soon so do stay tuned for that that was for the build quality and the cooler on the 6800 xt we did do a dedicated unboxing video where i did talk about how i was very impressed with the build quality of the 6800 xt and amd's reference design this time around now pulling up the numbers here shows that the auto fan speeds out of the box are the quietest uh out of the four configurations that i test here but then i also test manual sixty percent eighty percent and a hundred percent fan speeds and the temperatures i found were actually best at 60 manual fan speeds and now the ambient temperatures where i am are pretty hot at the moment we are starting to go towards summer whereas the rest of the world is going into winter but i feel like that's a good thing because it's kind of giving out a worst case scenario on how this cooler will perform in a lot of situations so the cooler did hold up it was starting to get a little bit on the hot end of things but again if you undervolt you will get lower temperatures and better noise but what about the ray tracing performance now this is something that amd were touting that they've got directx ray tracing support with rd and a2 the consoles are going to get that as well they use rdna2 as well and here's where i saw that the ray tracing performance was behind that of the 3080. i did think that it did look a bit better on the 30 80 and i have seen other comparisons where the 3080 ray tracing performance is looking a bit better as well as performing a bit better than the rdna 2 solution though we definitely know that nvidia have been working on ray tracing for a couple of years now so it's no surprise to see that they are ahead in that segment for now at the very least and i did test out the ray tracing performance in numbers in terms of world of warcraft where they amd said look take a look at the ray tracing shadows though i didn't notice a whole lot of difference in visual fidelity and i'll pull up a side by side for you guys but i did notice a massive performance drop at 4k where i did max out the settings here all the way to the max 10 slider and the good news is that pretty much all the cards in the graph here will give you a 4k 120 hertz experience which if you want to couple it with an oled at 4k this card as well as the nvidia cards will do a great job on world of warcraft with the new expansion coming out i'm sure there's going to be some people out there that want to get an oled and just really enjoy the game especially at a smooth frame rate though on that note of oled we'll quickly interlude here what about the oled support in terms of the 4k 120 hertz here is where i noticed that we were getting 120 hertz unlocked though i did have some problems with the variable refresh rate it wasn't working quite properly just yet when i tested out two different games dota 2 and also cs go it was not really adhering to the syncing and it was just going pretty much unlimited fps so they do have to implement a driver update and maybe lg will have to implement a firmware update to get the 120 hertz working properly whereas the 3080 has had a few months and that is working perfectly at the moment and it's not just the frame rate and the g-sync and the freesync it's also the hdr 10-bit support it isn't uh working 100 on the 6800 xt just yet though i'm sure amd will get on that with the drivers though speaking of the drivers this is where we'll segue into that because the drivers aren't perfect on day one and i'm going to give amd just like i gave nvidia the benefit of the doubt i'm going to give amd the benefit of doubt here and just say look the drivers will get better but i did notice some things that i would like to see amd improve on that note we're at this point in time they pretty much give you the radeon software and then it's got all these options that it's feature packed but the problem is every time i load it up to do one specific thing i don't want to go through a menu with all these fancy transitions all these fancy graphs and text i just want to say for instance lock in an under vault profile and i want to do that quickly and easily which is what msi afterburner do so i'd like to see amd offer a minimalist install on their radeon driver package and allow full unlock control to programs like afterburner where when i was trying to undervolt and overclock as well i was just met with a fan profile that took 10 minutes to ramp up to those fan speeds so if i locked in manual 80 i'd just afk my computer and then wait until it finally slowly ramped up to that and that also happened in the radeon software itself so on that note the driver experience was solid from day one but the user experience could definitely be improved on with certain things like that now what about the encoder thanks brian from the past and i actually did uh more analysis after the recordings from the three gpus and you guys even asked you guys on twitter and what you said that was unanimous that the center image looked the worst and that was actually the 6800 xt's encoder with dirt 5 and this was all 4k ultra the 5700 xt you guys said it was actually looking the best majority of the times and then some people said the left hand side which was the nvidia 3080 looked the best sometimes so it was a majority on the 5700 xt however in this game and this was done through streamlabs high quality mp4 so that is an efficient i guess way of recording videos as opposed to using the in-house geforce experience versus even amd's reliv too so it's a practical solution and out of the practicality way of doing things the 6800 xt's encoder looks like it was the worst something to take note on back to you past brian though finally with all that aside if you're watching up until this point and you haven't pre-ordered one of these 6800 xt's yet then i feel like they're going to be sold out and i feel like it's going to follow the same problem the 3080 did especially the 3080 where this card was my favorite pick out of the 3000 series coming in and coming out it was even then more so my favorite pick because i thought it was the most relevant card on the high end coming out of it i haven't tested the 6900 xt or the 6800 for coming into the looking at the results and the specs that amd were providing i liked the 6800 xt and amd said which card you want to check out and i requested the 6800 xt and i am not disappointed one bit i am just they really blew my expectations away 110 with this card now if you're into ray tracing and you want to get things like dlss with ray tracing on nvidia do have that side of things polished the rtx studio driver set i have found and i did edit some videos on the 6800 xt and i found that this was working better with cuda support in adobe premiere pro with the rtx studio driver so if that's anything to go by one i feel is more suited up towards raw value price performance gaming as it stands because i mean we can come back and look at this in a couple months time once amd's perfected their driver but as it stands if i was into raw value for money gaming getting the best price performance possible without turning on ray tracing and extra fluff then this is going to work really well though if i was more focused on the other things that i spoke about the studio driver set and also getting a better user experience i would go for the 3080. though i will say this before we transform and roll out of here and that is if you're going for either one of these cards a 6800 xt or a 3080 you are not going to be disappointed they're both really good cards and i think that the 6800 xt is definitely gonna have stock issues just like the 3080 and the 3080 still has stock issues months on it's like at least from the retailers i'm speaking to locally here this is the most in demand card versus the 3070 versus the 3090. so i'm guessing the 6800 xt is going to be very quickly sold out and it's going to be back ordered as well now some other last minute things as well two little last minute things crypto mining benchmarks terrible on this card at least from what i tested here 60 mega hashes per second the 5700 xt and i think the radeon 7 beats it out too so whatever amd's done here and i did speak to them i was like guys is the cryptocurrency performance meant to be this bad and they said this time around they wanted the gamers to get the cards so maybe that means that they've done something with the drivers or they've done something on the hardware level but they have nerfed the crypto performance relative to the game performance on the 6800 xt also the rage mode i did turn that on and i thought that it was just giving a little bit extra but the power consumption went up so i just decided to test with out of the box settings the rage mode didn't do anything for me personally where i was impressed with more so the power consumption and the noise with the out of the box and of course the overclocking the under vaulting manually did much better then there's the final thing the smart access memory they uh amd said look take a look at the smart access memory for us and i just said guys it's really beta at this stage because they wanted me just like the review initially of the zen 3 they wanted me to test on a very specific bios on a very specific motherboard so i'm going to let that mature and then i'll take a look at smart access memory in the future because i just don't want to be a beta tester at this point in time let's get on now to the question of the day but do let us know in the comment section below which one of these would you be picking would you be picking 6800 xt or the 3080 love reading your thoughts and opinions though i did say earlier in the video i was going to talk about the lower end and i'm hoping that both nvidia and amd do bring out something to address say the 200 price point where we're getting at least in relation to what these provide that price performance where i feel like 1080p gamers especially on a budget could really benefit from this new tech so please nvidia please amd get us something on this lower end side of things because there's nothing really in sight for the immediate future the question of the day soda maniac sodomaniac they ask where did the comments you were answering go question mark and this is on a video that we did like my first video on a razor a business ages ago and i think back in that time there was no reply feature it just tagged the user so when you're seeing all these comments on an old video in a row it's just how the old youtube system worked as opposed to i think a few years ago maybe i i don't know when they exactly implemented it then they implemented a direct reply feature so that comments were more structured so hopefully that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
