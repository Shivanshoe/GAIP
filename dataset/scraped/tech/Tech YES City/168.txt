testing one two should be live see if people are watching watching watching watching come join us tech your we're gonna be watching the pc parts and the places we just gotta let's uh let's see if anyone's in chat anyone out there come join us and we'll chat all things pc parts prices you guys after the yesterday's parts hunt okay we're good we're good to go i think we're good to go let's uh let's see what we got here welcome back guys to the tech ass city live stream and i thought we would do something a little bit different where people like people ask me they're like dude this gtx 1070 it was a really good deal and i'm thinking to myself it's it's okay wasn't the best deal uh but then i'm checking the prices of gpus in america and i'm seeing these gpu prices are not just bad they're horrifically bad to the point where i'll give you guys some recommendations live we can hang out we can chat and uh rael says hey brian just got a stinger you must be loving it dude i you know i picked up the deal one of the deals last night and the guy was just like interrogating me about the stinger and i was like dude you just it's gonna be the best car you've ever driven like i mean not not like i'm biased or anything because i have one but the sting is amazing um you know the sad thing is you probably see the prices of those things go up in a few months as well but let's do our best to help you guys out with some pc parts and what to get at the moment like i just searched the market i do a scan and this is kind of a little it's it's a pretty much worldwide friendly it's going to be a worldwide friendly session here so after we're done with the prices we'll just uh hang out and chat and you guys can uh hit me up with some questions and then we'll go from there but let's go let's get on so the price is like if we look at a 1660 super 860 dollars 700 800 it's it's ridiculous like you'll get that is just a plane like that's a rip-off that's a you do not want to pay that right now so we just we'll just close that one off and then we got even like things like rtx 2060s these were you know 350 bucks when they came out now they're going for 950 dollars that's a three-fold pricing increase to get yourself a rtx 2060. now it's mean to super you get the eight gigabytes of vram for an extra 50 but again an absolute rip-off so what i'm looking at here believe it or not this is the one that i'm gonna be recommending for you guys in the us it's a little bit of an old card but i mean look for the money you can get it for a decent price so there's one up here r9 280 a three gigabyte this is this guy's selling this i don't think it's been sold yet 145 bucks i just pulled this one up like if i was in the u.s and i really needed a graphics card i'd be i mean the shipping is international so i'm guessing it's a lot cheaper in the usa to get this thing shipped to you so probably about 150 now i know it's expensive right but when i'm looking at a 1660 super for 800 and i'm comparing it to the price performance of this at 145 i'd much rather go with the r9 280 at 145 bucks and i'm sure people will be like okay brian that's got three gigabytes of vram and it's like well i mean do you want to go out and pay five-fold for the extra three gigabytes of vram and a bit more performance i wouldn't so this card right here it's in that perfect scenario of crypto miners aren't targeting it and it's just doing really well in terms of its like for this current climate so the gpus is the toughest thing still and it's going to be the toughest thing until the price of crypto completely bottoms out and uh who knows when that will uh who knows when that will be but then we got the r9 380x as well 380. so these are my two picks like these are my two favorite picks just by scanning the us market looking at all the gpus the calculator inside the tech yes brain and seeing that we can get a good a decent deal still on an r9 380 and an r9 280. so that would be my recommendation for you guys i mean look at like there's a gtx 1070 that's 400 us though that's i mean that's expensive by again i wouldn't i wouldn't be paying 400 that's like 500 aussie dollars for a gtx 1070. so i picked up one for about 350 aussie which is about 280 us i think so that's not too bad i mean yeah but that the gpu sucked but let's get on to some better news because you guys out there you're looking for a ryzen 5 uh 3600 believe it or not the people on aliexpress these things are going for 162 bucks so that's ship worldwide and that's um that's pretty good price if you want to get on the ryzen 6 core 12 thread one of the most i'd say one of the best selling cpus of all time would be the ryzen 5 3600 this thing is offering tremendously good value for money at its current price point so i'm definitely digging this one of course if you want to get this cpu you can couple it with the infamous snowman this thing hasn't gone up too much in price i think i was getting him for like 16 uh 17 but now they've gone up to 20 bucks so not too bad and in absolute terms it's not too bad at all then you get a one dollar discount as well there you go makes it 19 now if you need a motherboard for that 3600 we've got the a320s not bad like if you just want to play games right if we if we're in this environment of you're doing it tough the stag flash and error i think we're going into the stagflation era here but if we're going into this stagflation era you can still find some good deals so a320 for 67 bucks shipped that's a pretty good deal too if you're in the if in the us i think you can get like a b450 still for 79 bucks not too bad considering i did read a report on tom's hardware about believe it or not the real tech audio so there was the the real tech audio or something like that they were saying um the real tech audio chips apparently are going to be in shortage and this could cause a motherboard shortage so i was reading that after i did the video on the 11400f someone messaged me they're like brian you're talking about shortages and now apparently real tech might have a shortage on their hands for hd audio controllers so if that happens i don't know then what's after that what's next right so it's uh that's what i've been saying it's kind of kind of better for you guys to grab your tech parts sooner than later because we're seeing a trend here that's for sure shortages price increases you don't to fall victim to that here we go right here quickly we'll quickly segue as well quickly segue to the sponsor we got elgato wave three elgato corsair the sponsor of the channel they got the 120 bucks on the wave three this is the mic i'm using on the live stream for you guys and people say oh what's this mic what's this mic this is it right here it's just the wave 3 and there's no extra i mean corsair sent us over the pop filter and stuff this thing doesn't need a pop filter you can yell into it it's completely noob friendly in terms of getting a mic that just works and it works really well so highly recommend this thing and we've also got scd keys channel sponsor here get yourself a windows 10 pro key for as little as 14 bucks using that coupon bftyc and i'll put all the links for all this stuff in the description below for you guys but let's move on to some other deals still 11 400 f still a great price i think these things are they've i mean wasn't it like in stock until the 26th or 27th of april now it's been moved back to the april the 30th so this cpu right here if you're in the u.s it's still a good deal this is one of the best deals on the cpus that you're going to get in the us and you get that with the h510 at least on amazon the h510 boards have gone up in price i don't know what the deal is with that but those are these things so i guess it's a board so this thing is actually tremendously good value at 175 bucks that kind of pay an extra 20 bucks then you should on the motherboard it's not too bad uh speaking of ddr4 memory 79 this was like a 32 16 gigabyte kit and i found this for 3200 megahertz so put this in happy days i think you can even get the uh the gray kit and save yourself a little bit of money but this is a 2666 so if you're going with a 10 400 f save yourself eight bucks not bad then for a case i don't know i got to ask you guys has any of you guys used the montec x1 cases because if i don't know if you guys have used this case but if you've used the uh montag cases they've got four fans four rgb fans mesh front 57 bucks i don't know what you guys think of this thing but if it's not too bad then it's not too bad right so i mean i'd be giving this thing a hit if i was in the usa so looks like a pretty good case for the money if anyone's tried this case do let us know and chat what you guys think of this thing uh because it looks like a decent deal at least when i compare it to all the stuff out there at the moment and uh what's going on in the case market so four fans tempered glass no frills and we move over the last deal this is the last one i'm gonna pull up for you guys on pc parts price watcher we got here the 35 500 watt 80 plus certified for 35 bucks so this thing is a bargain power supply wise you want to get this thing uh now sooner than later before that sells out because 35 bucks is a deal for a 500 watt power supply and then that's about it so that was the deals that i could quickly find if i was searching the market in the us and i was looking to buy some pc parts that's what i'll be going for of course i would be looking uh locally say for instance if i was local here i'd be doing a search like for instance in australia we've got gumtree i'd be going over to gumtree and i'd be looking just scanning the market seeing what's available going through all these one-time deals i'm saying here okay this isn't bad this one here but that's a bit of a far 160 kilometer drive is very far but gtx 964 gigabyte 80 aussie dollars at 60 usd i'd be trying to pick something like this up maybe it might even be a fake but you just got to be careful of that one make sure you check it out before you pick it up but uh just scan the market go through the gtx 970 go through gtx 1070 take a look at what's around um that's not bad at all and we've got two dollar donation here thanks shampoo time just high and good night oh god i'll be up 4am man that's early so shampoo time is a member guys and he uh saves lives ambo thanks for your hard work brother and thanks for the donation too we got gtx 970. that's pretty good deal too so looking through these deals 90 bucks i'd pick that up i'd put in an offer for that assuming it works assuming it works so you can find some good deals you're always going to find better deals locally than you will um on ebay or amazon and uh so i think in the us you guys have got craigslist and offer up and stuff like that um and that's where you'd get the better deals but of course do make sure you don't get host i'm speaking perhaps that people are asking about the 6700 um xt deal that i i was pulling up in the deals hunt yesterday a guy never got back to me and apparently someone like so we got a little bit of a network going on where i am locally and so apparently it might be a scam that's what i'm being told because one of my friends messaged the guy and then he was saying oh come pick it up in the afternoon and the guy was telling me oh i can only let you pick it up at night time so when you've got these conflicting reports on a deal just be weary it might be a scam in this case i'm just staying away from that 6700 xt down because things don't add up and when things don't add up then that's not a good sign so just be careful with that don't get scammed there's so many scams out there and i only think it's going to get worse as we go in and as the days go by i only think it's going to be worth the scamming so we got the last piece of news before we move over to chat before we move over to chat guys oh we got designs by our fire and chat what's going on man what's going on we're going to be doing a live stream with designs by ifr and also a pro rainbow six siege player called rain so that'll be cool to sort of talk with a uh upcomer in the scene a pro player and see what the goal is with pro gaming because you guys don't know i'm i'm uh i'm washed up when it comes to pro gaming but of course i like to look at all the tech and get the young guys coming through all the best stuff in all the best settings and gear so they can be pro and they can play at their best and hopefully win some bucks in tournament but we got here the 3080 ti this is rumored to be coming out in may it does carry a bit of weight this time around like i'm saying this is if there's a rumor that's carrying weight like we heard the 30 80 20 gigabyte rumors i think that was just marketing uh gimmicks this time around i'm saying the ti this looks a lot more credible because of the 12 gigabytes of vram that makes sense for nvidia to do that instead of 24 gigabytes now in terms of the performance it's right up there with the 3090 but of course because it's got less vram it's not going to be as desirable still so it's in terms of its uh product segment and where it's at it looks a lot more of a smarter move where people are paying the premium to get two more gigabytes of vram and get more performance but the 3080 is still going to be a lot better value for money at 700 versus a thousand so i mean this is msrp of course like crypto is just distorting everything right now but i'm also being told that this could also have a proper implementation now don't now this is a rumor nvidia might finally be doing a proper implementation of the crypto mining nerf on the 3080 ti this is just a rumor as well it might even be across all the new cards that are being made as well so that's a rumor out there at the moment whether this comes into effect i hope it does so gamers can actually get the cards considering it's global pandemic people do want to play some games because they can't go outside a whole lot it would be nice if people had the you know the luxury of playing games instead of people just sticking um cards in a motherboard and then clicking mine [Music] but hey you know i've got my i've had my thoughts on crypto mining in the past i've had my thoughts on crypto mining um i don't think the miners are actually the problem i've said this in the past i think it's all the uh stimulus money going out there that's the real reason why the crypto miners exist in the first place but let's move over to chat now do let us know what you think of the 3080ti rumors do let us know if you've got any deals or any matters of your own to share with people who are looking to get some cheap deals and looking to get things out there at the moment and let's uh let's go let's go to some chat right here i got so i've got the the stream decks all working now so we've got the fancy transitions and everything going so we got uh where's the rtx 3050 only four gigabytes so it won't be attractive to miners and yeah that would be good if nvidia do an rtx 3050 i would love that i think it would be a card that would come in at a lower price point uh hopefully crypto miners wouldn't snap it up as much i mean crypto mine is just snapping up everything as long as mining is profitable crypto miners are going to be there especially if cards are msrp the problem you've got on top of the crypto miners now too is because the graphics cards are being bought out by the crypto miners you've then got the intermediaries and that's the scalpers so they know graphics cards are in demand as soon as they see a graphics card at a good price they're going to snap that up and then resell it so you've got so many more dynamics in the market not just the crypto miners there's so much more going on where as soon as someone sees a decent price on a graphics card they're just going to snap that up before someone else does because they know it's a good price they know they can make money on it so that's what the market's doing right now it's uh correcting itself into an all-time high uh pricing level but hopefully the rtx 3050 comes out i mean hopefully just graphics cards come out hopefully they just flood the market with gpus that would be great so but if true what uh so designs corey ask a question if true what market price do you see this card being at obviously between the 38 and 39 but what's your price rough price guesstimate i mean in the u.s it would come in like it's going to come in a little bit over a thousand dollars if the retailers like newegg for instance are doing their shuffle program in australia if we're talking aussie prices i would guess the the retailers are gonna obviously the distributors are gonna be having a field day they're gonna be loving it oh wow more graphics cards from nvidia a new graphics card from nvidia that's on the high end i reckon you'll see the 3080ti in australia for around two and a half thousand aussie dollars i mean that's the ironic thing was that's where the 3090 roughly was when that was first released in australia it was at two and a half thousand so you probably see the 3080 ti there at the same price so it's like wow i waited all this time to get 12 gigabytes less vram and less performance fantastic um i mean hey so i reckon i'm guessing 2.5 k like realistically when you go to the retailer and see the prices so that's uh that's what i think with the 380 ti yeah and i think it's i think it's coming i do think this one's coming i think the rumors are pretty solid at this stage they're too heavy to ignore um so we got uh and we got a five dollar donation from big dude 101. oh yeah that's five bucks thanks for the donation brother as for negotiation haggling making offers do you get better uh better results making an offer online or haggling face to face uh this is a so this is the thing for me man i mean i don't know about you guys but you you don't it depends on what you're haggling for like if you agree on a price before you meet up you don't haggle then that's like a big no at least deal hunting where i'm from if you agree on a price and then you go to someone and then try to haggle them down further it's a big no like i'll just if someone does that to me i just say mate just jump in your car and on your way i i hate it and i don't do it either that being said if they've got extra parts so say for instance you've negotiated a gtx 1070 like this one for 350 and then i go pick it up and he's got something else on the spot that i didn't know about and uh then we can negotiate on the spot and face to face but i do find in if you're going to look at negotiating on the spot versus online negotiating on the spot is much better i find people are more willing to strike a deal or want to strike a deal on the spot than rather online so i've had a lot more success in terms of getting bargains on the spot but i think that's because you're picking up the part already and they've just got stuff that they want to get rid of and they're like pretty much name your price and i'm like all right i'll give you this for it so but yeah in terms of pre-negotiating a deal and then rocking up and trying to negotiate it down further i mean i don't know about like i don't know how you guys do it in different cultures and different countries but yeah i don't do that where i'm at like right here so i mean if you if you say for instance if you go to a market though if you go to a used uh pc part shop and they've got a price there then you can say okay would you take 20 bucks less or something that's fine but yeah don't uh don't try not to try not to negotiate a price and then just rock up i've actually had that happen a few times as well some some guy like came over he's like hey man i'm getting my son a pc i'm like i'm like yeah we talked on the phone i know you're getting your son a pc he's like i'll give you a 350. i'm like yeah it's cool then he rocks up it's like oh man i give you 3 30. i'm like what like i just said jump back in your car and he's like oh no no no i'll take it i'm like okay so but yeah so that's a good question i like that one i got a gtx 750 ti for 55 usd was it a good deal in this car like i'm gonna say in this current climate yeah like that's what i'm hearing like it's a decent deal like it's not a great deal it's not like nothing to get crazy about but it's a decent deal from the prices i'm seeing on even r9 380s and 280s right so if we go back to this 380 um i would i'd say you got a pretty good deal like it means let's just check the prices on ebay for gtx 750s or ti's yeah you got the ti version there and um i mean yes that's 67 bucks and that's getting shipped from sri lanka so yeah 55 bucks you got a good deal uh nothing to complain about there considering what's going on in the u.s it is he's really selling wow 200 is someone really paying 200 bucks for a 750 ti wow okay yeah you got you got an extremely good deal there my man people people are paying 195 bucks for a 750 ti damn i didn't i mean i didn't realize it was that bad in america like that just shows how bad things are right now so but anyway let's cheer up let's cheer up a bit because hey we got i'm showing i'm helping you guys out showing you guys the ways of uh what i'd be picking up personally would i be picking up a 750 ti for 195 bucks no way but i'd be picking it up let's see when they went cheaper so you see the price progression here i wouldn't even be picking up a 750 ti for 138 dollars so that's insane so i got a gtx 1650 for 230 and it's so sad that it actually was a good deal yeah it's true yeah uh hey brian how's it going good i'm going pretty good taking care of my health that's the most important thing always take care of your health sleep well if you've got the good diet got the good sleep got the good energy that's the most important thing um in terms of the deals hunts i enjoyed the used stuff a lot now i'm actually you know people it's funny people in the comments on the other parts hunt yesterday they're like oh you know like we go from 3080s to gtx 650s and gt 730s and i'm excited about it and it's like yeah i mean i'm excited about just getting deals and putting uh pcs together that's how i started out tech yes city like really when we look at the roots of it i just started out building pcs and then got into the used stuff so the use hustle is the most fun like that's the funnest thing on the channel and it's it's one of those things that sort of like the use hustle is always going to be one of those things that you can just go and it's like my little bubble world that i can go back into and forget about all the all the stuff going on in the world i mean until of course the used prices start getting ridiculous but hey a gtx 650 for 15 aussie dollars i'm happy with that i'm actually more than happy because that represents pretty good price performance so we'll continue on let's continue on here we've got some uh we got some juicy ones have you found any good deals on ryzen apus i found a 2200g in yesterday's parts hunt for 80 aussie dollars i thought that was decent all things considered four cores four threads and then you can whack it on a cheap motherboard a320 and you can have a little gaming pc i'm actually going to do a video on that exact ryzen apu i think they're a good option to look at right now especially if you want to build a pc where you've got an upgrade path as well for if things get better i mean by better i mean it's sad because things aren't going to get better the economy is just going to crash and then the prices will get cheaper that's pretty much the only way out for things getting better if people refer to things getting better in the econ in the market so so it's like a catch-22 isn't it so which way do you go uh anyway we got we'll continue on what juicy questions have we got right here man you guys are talking a lot what's uh okay so older lake will be out okay so maybe that you guys are going off in these crazy tangents okay in one of your last videos i spotted three strut braces do you hustle jdm car parts too okay yeah i used to um in in in japan so the reason you'll see some car parts is there is i that's a funny story that one i um oh where do we go with that so that's just funny okay so i used to in japan that's i used to before pc parts i was doing a jdm gear i love jdm cars right i grew up as a teenager 180sx r32 skyline sora liberty b4 fd i owned all sorts of jdm cars absolutely loved them still love them i still love them um and so i went to japan and when i went over japan i'm like doing the math you know what i mean i'm like calculating i'm going to some of these places because uh one of my ex-exes over there she was into the whole car scene well she had friends that went into the car scene and then i sort of got in i was like there's like you know kid at a candy store and um there's a kid at a candy store there in japan for jdm because the cars were so cheap like you could get an fd skyline back in 2007 for around i'd say usd you could get like six thousand dollars i think four and a half thousand if you're on your hustle that's an fd that's a series six um so you're just like wow this was insane the prices of uh used cars over there so i was just yeah i was i was just strapped up going woo here we go let's jump in these cars buckle up and go and go crazy and that's exactly what happened now but when i was over in japan i started seeing the prices of car parts because i had to i had something go wrong on one of my cars there's the fd i had something go wrong and i had to replace the just wait we got a donation to from now 15 bucks thanks brother there's a big one hey brian just fyi there's a facebook marketplace scam ad here that's affecting people here in oz guys selling at 2080 ti for 550 aud and not shipping he's even got a fake new south wales license uh yeah there's okay we'll just quickly interlude uh two two uh two pound donation thanks to hey love your videos keep looking thanks for the donations guys that's awesome i'll do i will quickly interlude with this scam stuff it is actually important i did see something that did alarm me um it is ah damn can i see i don't know if i can show the names of the people on live stream this is the sad thing because on facebook i can point you to i'll just hover over i'll just hover over like what's going on okay i saw a 1080 ti that was too cheap i think it's been taken off there was a 1080 ti that was way too cheap for the money and when i looked at the person's profile they were in like they were over in europe they weren't even over like they weren't even over in the um [Music] they weren't even over in australia but they were trying to rip people off in australia so that was a clear scam so yeah if it's too good to be true basically if it's too good to be true then it pretty much like 99.9 of the time usually is just remember that with scamming so i mean you've always got to like that's why you've always gotta if you're buying over facebook marketplace always and this is my rule of thumb with marketplace and gumtree these are like the local sites yeah they're in harvey bay yeah 340 bucks yeah mr b tree that was the one the 1080ti for 340 bucks was it located in harvey bay yeah that was the one it was in harvey bay so that was the one he's talking about the always pick up the part and confirm that it's working and it's going to get worse i'm telling you guys it's going to get worse the more we go on because you look at this look at values i mean values are going like this too morals and values going down the drain and with that comes more scamming i mean yeah anyway just there we'll we won't even go we won't even go there but thanks for the the 50 filipino pesos donation here we got uh gtx rtx 2060 costs about 630 usd yeah that's expensive in philippines too man like the prices gpus man going crazy why don't we check out that price of ethereum hopefully when that crashes um hopefully that hopefully when that crashes a bit okay it's gone down a bit more hopefully we can just drop down to like you know fifteen hundred or a thousand bucks if this if this sinks down to like here you'll start seeing some graphics cards up for sale again so that's a good thing about that but we'll get back to the story now so sorry we'll get back to the story of the the uh the used car parts and what what was going on there then we'll get back to some more questions we've got some juicy questions coming and rolling in now so the the used parts right i had to replace a a car part on my fd i think it was like some manifold or something like i forgot now which part i had to replace but i was at the mc i had my one of my friends was a mechanic over there and he was full like into drift and everything and he was replacing the part and he said the parts going to cost like was it like a hundred bucks or something and i was like what like 100 like in australia this would cost like 400 bucks at least for the part then you got the labor and so it was like cost me like 150 bucks to replace the whole thing because he was a friend i mean he gave me a cheap price but the actual part price itself was dirt cheap and then i started looking on like the yahoo auctions and all the stuff over in japan and i started seeing like okay we got like this this arbitrage here on ebay where i could buy stuff locally clean it and and then i started to clean it up as well and that was adding extra value so i got all this used junk that would people they'd actually call it junk i'd test it make sure it worked cleaned it all up then i was putting it on ebay and just making making bank and that was when uh that was when before tech yeah city there was i had my youtube channel it was called brian easy i think even to this date you can type in a youtube.com brian easy and i'll my channel will come up and that's where brian easy came from because that was my ebay seller name and i was just uh hustling pc uh sorry car parts and then it wasn't when until i went into the uh the junkyard for my brother actually took me when we went to this um pc parts place and uh sorry it wasn't pc past places like just a there's like one of them used parts in japan if you've ever been to japan they have like all these big places which just all used stuff and it goes super cheap and i saw a pc in there and i was like oh wow this this could be good this could be real good and uh so what i went i went in there i was i opened it up and i was like okay this is a it was a 45 e45 p45 motherboard and then i took the cooler off i saw q9550 i was like wow even if this doesn't work doesn't turn on the parts alone are going to be worth more than 20 bucks so i purchased it for 20 bucks and that was when i put together like a 40 pc vlog and then the channel just blew up from there i was like wow people want to watch this and people were loving it now like dude more used stuff more used stuff and so then i came back to australia and there was this whole like marketing side of things where you've got all the marketing like you know all the companies want to send you all this stuff uh and have you tested all and like because i was testing all the used stuff out they they're like oh can you review the new stuff and i'm like okay cool and then yeah i started getting into the new stuff started reviewing all that and now it's sort of like the channel's a hybrid mix between using new stuff and i will be honest i love doing the youth stuff way more than the new stuff i i just find it more exhilarating more fun i just find it fun to sort of like go out meet people do deals and then build something out of that and then of course flip it the whole process is fun i just don't think like i think building new pcs is just so uh so systematic it's so just normalized in that there's this thing you just go to the shop buy the pc parts there's no it's not the difficulty level's easy right it's like it's like jumping into a game a video game you select that difficulty on easy you know you know what you're in for you know if you're in for an easy cake walk it's going to be easy it's going to be boring so that's why i always turn up the difficulty level to hard or extreme because i know it's going to be fun and that's kind of with the used hustle that's what you're doing you're putting the difficulty level on hard or extreme and you're just having fun so that's it that's why it's like it's like my little world it's like my little retreat so hopefully you guys can go into the use i mean most of you guys most of you guys are on the used scene are in the retreat you understand that retreat and that's the good thing about it so i think i've got to delve more into it too the more we go on actually we've got a very cool video coming up you know uh i was doing input latency testing recently so i've got to do this reflex video with uh corey from designs by ifr but you know i i had the ldap i've got this ldap tool from nvidia and i just had this cool idea that came to my mind i'm like why don't we test out all these cheap monitors the 15 and 10 monitors i'm picking up used and see the input lag on them because i think they're much more of a value for money play if you want to get into pc gaming 60 hertz monitor used one you get it for 10 bucks what about 144 hertz yes like 200 bucks so why don't we just get into the cheap stuff so that was uh that video is coming soon you guys will love that but uh let's get back to questions so how much would you pay for a 30-70 uh at the moment i would pay i mean like i would pay like 800 usd max uh 1100 aussie dollars but then again the market's like well twelve hundred dollars the market's going to thirteen hundred dollars so that that's the that's the crux there so i think the rtx 3070s you kind of got to wait actually someone did message me about a 30-70 and i just it got lost my phone bricked and i had to get another phone so someone messaged me offering me a 30-70 and i didn't get back to them and i feel like an idiot now because they're probably going to do me a decent price and i was like damn i would have liked to have picked up that 30-70 but uh sorry if the guys out there message me again for that 30-70 brother but in terms of what i'd pay yeah no more actually someone said m7 digit he said no one eight hundred dollars and even then that's bad man you guys like have similar thinking to me that's great i love it great minds think alike fellas don't worry great minds think alike so um okay we got hey brian ah you are my mentor thanks i'm your mentor man cool i still i'm still i'm still got a lot of i still got a lot of educating to do in the world like lately i've been educating myself on a lot of different subjects outside of tech and it's fascinating i mean some of it i've sort of tied into the channel you guys have been liking those tangents thanks for watching that but um we got a question here is it so much fun i can make a lot of extra income uh okay so you've been doing you've been doing this for half a year and making extra income i love your channel question what is your favorite cpu new or old uh favorite cpu of all time for me personally is the x5675 i absolutely love it i have the most fun with it i think it's still relevant to this day turn off the spectrum meltdown updates and the 5675 is going to give you a good experience x58 motherboards are still amazing they're still awesome get some good triple channel memory i would like if i was just gaming and i was just playing competitive uh pc games still i'd be on next 56 75 even though some of the games now that you know putting this avx ii instruction sets on and they're sort of forcing you to go get a new cpu x58 is it man that was the og that was the big one that was when intel were on their game and that's when you know before before we got into too much um profit and you know profiteering from the companies that was sort of like the i see x-58 is kind of like the last generation where profits weren't a massive concern as they were on uh subsequent releases so yeah i just i missed x 58 days that was some and they were kind of like the funnest days in the industry as well like i don't know it was still like it was just fun xeon power too yeah x5675 love it so uh favorite cpu thanks for the question uh do you know any other languages i'd speak a little bit of japanese um that's about it in english so we won't speak too much japanese is the 4650g a good deal for 140 bucks actually yeah uh we'll actually move on to that we'll check that one out that's actually pretty good 4670g is the if you guys didn't know it's the six core 12 thread six core 12 threaded uh ryzen apu and it's actually pretty decent like this is okay well it's a good deal if you can get it for the 145 i don't know where you saw it for that at the moment it's it's really expensive on aliexpress and i'm guessing that's because it's got the gpu portion on board so you can kind of ride out the storm with this apu so it's a 6 core 12 thread it's basically a ryzen 5 3600 but with an apu and the apu's not half bad um is the return of marco marco welcome to the chat brother is the return of the japanese channel imminent maybe maybe man i might get back to that i've just honestly man i've been so um i've been so tied up just with a lot of uh there's a lot of like in the last six months a lot of personal stuff's happened too so it's been really tough to sort of just my first priority is just to juggle tech yes city and then do all the other personal stuff in the meantime and um yeah it's been but i would like to get back to it one day especially if i was in japan i'd rather do the japanese channel if i go if i get to get back to japan i mean i'm applying to to get over there i really want to do some used deals hunts in japan again i miss the place i miss my boy i miss everything about japan would love to get over there again another place i really want to go for some reason is india a lot of you guys from india really want us to go over there too in the philippines like i just want to do a whole asia tour like massive asia tour wouldn't that be good hong kong singapore you guys are and a lot of you guys in in the asian district you just like you guys support the channel a lot too so i really love it um and greetings from romania sweet uh what's your japanese account oh tech yesu japan japan uh maybe someone can link it um and we go what happened to greg and your show uh greg greg didn't greg stopped doing live streams so greg just was like dude i'm not doing live streams anymore but um yeah i mean greg i'd like to have some guests back on one of these days and again that's just like you look at the live stream uh schedule right now i'm just uploading whenever like whenever i get a video finished it's like upload let's release it for you guys um in terms of live streams i'm like hey wouldn't it be a cool time to live stream but i'll uh what we'll do with this live stream is we'll sorry we'll get back to the talking head what we'll do with this live stream is uh i i wanted to make this sort of like a monthly thing where we look at the prices and just together we kind of see what the deals are what's going on and i guess if we follow all this kind of stuff we can see the trends that are running through and always look at the trends the trends is always going to tell you uh future trajectory so that's the one always look at the trends the trend is your friend i mean whether and the problem is if the trends against what you like and what you do then that's that's the worst part that's the hardest pill to swallow and that's the sad thing about trends too so if you want to identify the trend and you want to hop on with on board and um it's like a freight train sometimes that's what the trend can be so we'll get back to some questions here rtx 3080 in new zealand at retail is 3 000 new zealand dollars worth it no not at all my man that is a complete rip off that is a complete joke uh 3 000 new zealand i mean look new zealand dollars are pretty close to that of aussie dollars i'm guessing that's what like two thousand seven hundred aussie dollars ah let's take a look for you guys three thousand new zealand dollars that's yeah two thousand seven hundred eighty two dollars that's way too much i mean even the scalpers even the scalpers on gumtree don't even charge you that much for a 3080. i could probably look for an rtx ah yeah all the names and personal stuff damn it i gotta be careful on live streams we'll try maybe facebook this is a problem like i do this stuff and it's like i make sure there's no names coming up otherwise i can get getting done like hey brian what are you doing showing personal names rtx 3080 let's have a look let's have a look so i'll be able to show you this i think i'm able to show this so yeah even this i mean even the scalpers are coming in with someone's got a whole pc i think with a 3080 in it for 3200. so you just buy the pc and take the 3080 out and you'd still be getting a better deal um this guy's got a rog strix he's got a 2 600 so yeah complete rip off complete rip off so there that's uh that's that one complete ripoff yola welcome back to reality um three thousand dollars i mean come on i mean look when i talk about inflation uh inflation's not that bad it's not two hundred percent not in a not in australia or new zealand so okay should i get a gtx 1050 ti i5 7400 pc for 370 bucks you know what yeah like that's not too bad like even in australia that's not bad at all that's a really good deal in the us i would say yeah at these current market rates that's not a bad deal either so um i gotta ask rick spolestra bitcoin has dropped five thousand dollars what do you think is the crash here okay let's look at cryptocurrencies um bitcoin especially i mean okay let's see if the crash is here like um people are worried about a crash okay for starters if you're okay let's get on to bitcoin price i'm just gonna tell you guys straight up okay wow that is tank in a bit okay straight away we're at this point right here right 63 000 for a bitcoin you got to ask yourself if you're holding bitcoin right now this is what you've got to ask yourself okay no one can predict this line this line can go down to here and that would be like thirty thousand thirty five thousand that line could go down that way this line could also go back up this line could go sideways if you had a crystal ball you you wouldn't even be like yeah you would it'd be amazing if you had a crystal ball but no one does so what you've got to ask yourself at this point in time forget about this previous line here right forget about the 72 73 000 it's now at this very point in time at 63 870 if you're holding bitcoin if you are holding a bitcoin right now can you afford to lose if it goes down more so if it goes down to thirty thousand dollars how are you going to feel i do if you've got a bitcoin and you sold this for sixty four thousand australian dollars would you be happy ask yourself to ask yourself these questions if i had a bitcoin i'd sell it straight away that's my personal feeling i was like wow uh you know you got a one cryptocurrency coin for 64 000 and at this point in time i could buy uh over a kilogram of platinum for one bitcoin one kilogram of platinum let's actually while we're on that note of while we're on a note of that i mean no offense to this no offense to this one but you you've gotta at some point in time you have to see when something is a massive bubble and set a tv like this one right here points towards a massive bubble this coin is nine dollars right this is the set of tv token you can see here like it's some it's behind chat sorry but you can see here nine dollar this is a massive bubble ladies and gentlemen this is a huge bubbling crypto and if we look at because you're like well brian it's got future potential if we go to theta tv i'll mute tab which makes it look i mean look at this they've got 627 viewers do you think this whole website do you think this is worth 10 billion or whatever the market cap is pricing do you think this right here is worth 10 billion if you do think this is worth 10 billion dollars that i just think you need to realign what you think value is because in my opinion when i look at this website this right here i see a squarespace like website i don't see much innovation here i don't see something that's offering an advantage over twitch i don't see something that's offering an advantage over any other platform in terms of what it looks like i just see a massive bubble that's what i see a huge bubble this is the biggest indicator of a bubble right here so i mean go do what you want but if you're holding theta tv coins you should be very concerned about this just dropping from out of nowhere and when the floor goes out of all these cryptocurrencies that's when they start dropping because i mean for me that is not a 10 billion dollar website or a currency that's but that's what it's valued at right if you look at the market cap so do be very careful with cryptocurrencies right now that's just my warning i look and this is coming from a guy that that made um that made money off crypto i made what i was comfortable with but i think right now i think crypto's in a huge huge bubble regardless of inflation i just think inflation's got to catch up a big like a lot you've got to have hyperinflation to catch up to some of these values and that's the thing just be careful always ask yourself always ask yourself at this price point if it went down could i afford to lose more money and so that's the question you gotta ask yourself be comfortable so yeah what i think of the bitcoin price um it's actually now what do i think of the bitcoin price going forward this is the test of time right we'll get back to the bitcoin price crypto because this is important this ties in this actually ties in believe it or not with everything we're looking at this right here will tell you uh bitcoin price in ways could be directly i mean i don't know the correlations but i think it's correlated to the supply of money so bitcoin can be correlated to the supply of money in ways when there's too much money out there the price of bitcoin is going to go up when there's too little money out of there the bitcoin the price of bitcoin is going to crash so going forward we're going to see the real answers from this price movement watch this price movement because this will in ways i feel this will dictate how easy money is flowing around so if bitcoin does crash then maybe you'll like you'll definitely see your gpu prices can become cheaper but at the same time you'll it'll see it'll tell you how easy money is and the supply of money so if it goes back up if it goes over a hundred thousand dollars then we're looking at a different scenario altogether so looking at possible big inflation numbers so that's what i mean i'm watching the bitcoin price closely so don't worry about that but we'll get back to uh some other questions here are you against mining uh like look when it comes again it comes in my beliefs i just think i'm not against mining i just think asic miners is better asic solves a whole different problem right asic miners are more efficient they do a better job they don't produce as much waste in terms of electrical waste and they do a much better job so that's um i mean and look at the problems they're causing for the gpu industry right now people gamers can't get any like the whole thing's just a mess so i'm not against mining in the sense that i'm not against asic mining but i'm i'm kind of i'm against gpu mining i think it's i think it doesn't solve anything really but um i mean even the bitcoin founder was against gpu mining believe it or not satoshi nakamoto he was against gpu mining yet people just forget the original anyway it's it's a long story he was kind of for cpu mining which is even more inefficient so so we got a yeah but then yeah we got like a question that got hidden because it's just all swearing but people like oh you know asic mine is um asic miners are all corporations if you think for a second if you think for a second that gpu mining is not corporations as well then where are we going with this because asic mining is just the same as gpu mining corporations are buying up all these cards and using them to mine cryptocurrency doesn't matter if it's an asic miner it doesn't matter if it's a gpu miner when it comes to an asset miner you can get usb sized asset miners that don't cost a whole lot of money if you truly believe in mining cryptocurrencies then you would support asic miners that's just my feeling i don't think like this whole corporation thing what's like corporations have even more of a hold and more of a stronghold in terms of distributor sway than the gamer does so it's even a worser argument to say that gpu like um acid miners are all corporations that's the crap that you're going to read on the news but you got to think of it you've got to look down logical uh top-down approach and say okay who's got the money and when they got the big money they have the big sway and so you're seeing a lot of these gpus aren't even going to retail shelves they're getting bought out from the distributor line before they even reach the retail shelves and that's of course corporate sway so asic miners would solve a lot of those problems um but anyway yeah that's just my thoughts on it anyway so we go rx 480 for 200 euro not a great deal but i guess if you got to do it you got to do it uh the jeep the gpu is related to bitcoin yes it's related to bitcoin because uh they mine um they mine on nice hash and that converts it all to bitcoin so it's almost like this big um it's gonna say big ponzi going on where it converts all the all the alt coins back to bitcoin so all the money flowing around eventually comes back to bitcoin that's why bitcoins the grand daddy especially because of nice hash nice hashes sway over the industry is huge so uh anyway research research i mean that's just all my research too i mean i've got i do get a lot of guys as well the sad thing is lately as well i do get a lot of drive-by critics and these like look drive by crit i don't mind like guys if you're going to critique uh my opinions and my theories that's great i love that but please put in why you think i'm wrong if you think you know brian you're wrong because xyz that's awesome we can have a discussion but you get the drive by critics these guys just come in you're an idiot you're wrong you're just upside down thinking and it's like how does this add to discussion and i've had a few drive by critics lately and they just it's the most annoying thing i don't do drive but i'm not a drive-by critic myself so i don't do it but you know there's there's so many um drive-by critics out there dogecoin thoughts oh man the dogecoin thing i'm not getting into dogecoin we'll get back to we'll get back to the land of tech right now um instead of i mean if we i mean if you guys want if you guys want to talk about cryptocurrencies yeah drive by critics fellas they're everywhere okay these guys um they're not open-minded the drive-by critic is not open-minded they uh they can't think for themselves and this is the problem the biggest thing the biggest thing that we have nowadays is people are being taught what to think rather than how to think so if it's anything if i can help you guys in any way shape or form it is educate yourselves do your own research and trust your gut okay and that's the biggest thing if you can if you can be taught how to think rather than what to think then i think it's going to make for a better uh whole better whole society um but yeah have you heard of chai yeah i've heard of i've heard of dogecoin so basically the dogecoin thing is a um it's a it's a dog coin backed a shibuya that's a japanese breed it's funny because the shiba inu dog itself is a very problematic dog in japan they're known to be very it's funny i mean i wonder if the trading mechanism of dogecoin will check out dogecoin i wonder if this is related to the actual behavior of a shiba inu uh because i mean there's all these cryptic um yeah i mean that that right there is pretty much a shiba unu at least the last month that's exactly what a shibuya is like in their personalities they just can go off in us in a heartbeat and the japanese know that they're a beautiful dog but they're very uh easily agitated with this that's in the in japan so a lot of uh japanese won't want to own the uh shibuna dog for that very reason but um yeah now we've got a whole cryptocurrency coin dedicated towards a dog and i mean it's like i mean how far does the joke run guys i mean hey i own some dogecoin like so you got this whole coin that's dedicated towards being a joke where it's uh it inflates did that just wow did that just crash before our very eye what's going on with this coin okay so price movement right now volatility so in terms of this coin i think this one's related to elon musk elon musk has a lot to do with this um i get you see a lot of his cryptic messages with dogecoin what's his plans with this i don't know maybe someone needs to ask but he did say one thing about dogecoin the irony the currency that was made as a joke might end up being the currency that's being used in terms of that cryptic message itself one would have to ask what's his master plan with this because there are some big and i mean big institutional money going into this or if it's institutional bank money anyway the average retail investor does not have the power to push this thing up the the billions that's being injected into dogecoin the retail investor does not have the power of sway to push that this is some deep pockets going into dogecoin and if anything if you guys um uh chris can uh ten dollars thanks bro send in some tech yes loving from the states awesome man if you guys are you know if you're asking me for an investment right now um i'm buying platinum i'd be buying platinum that's just my research all points towards platinum being a uh absolute amazing buy right now it's the medal of the future uh that's what i'd call platinum um that's my research anyway so that's me i've got my own investment sort of targets going forward in terms of what i believe in but in terms of what you guys believe in do you believe in dogecoin i mean if you do go for it i mean i just i mean the way it's going right look at the trajectory of this thing the way it's going it's it's going to beat uh market cap it could be bitcoin in five years time so if you believe in a in a doge uh dog a dog coin then sure but i mean at some stage when does it become a coin that has real world function and that's the only one i see right now the only one i see right now is uh is ethereum the only one i really see right now that i would and i've used before is ethereum ethereum has and that's why when you when you talk about cryptos you're lumping in so much crap with what and there are some good cryptocurrencies out there but there's the majority of them are crap and the majority of them are just all pump and dump and absolute rip-offs i mean that's my my belief is if i was to invest money into crypto right now and be a theory but even then i think ethereum's in a bit of a bubble uh so i think all i think all of crypto's in a bubble yeah so we just talked about the theta tv and that coin itself was just the market cap versus what you're actually looking at with your own two eyes is unbelievable so anyway let's uh let's uh forget about cryptos now so but yeah i do a bit of research on cryptos but i'm uh me personally i'm a big believer in platinum right now for some reason i just like it i've done all my research on what i do going forward and so have your medium term outlooks if you're investing if you're in investing for a pump and dump you're doing it wrong and i will say this before i we get off the topic of investing and if you're investing for quick short term gains make sure you're very well researched and you've got your all your research all the stars align with your research make sure all the stars align and that's a good gamble because if you're just doing pump and dumps thinking something's going to go up you're only going to be making the broker rich and that's then the broker will just take your money and fees especially with cryptocurrencies because the cryptocurrency fees themselves they're like they're they're lucrative for the broker they're like one percent per trade or something like that if you had one percent per trade fees in fx or stocks or any any massive retail brokerage you wouldn't have anyone trading period so the the brokers if you're looking at short-term trades on pump and dump schemes and stuff in crypto the brokers are getting rich in the long run not you so just be careful with that um yeah so anyhow my research at the moment i've done all research and in terms of a vehicle platinum's the medal of the future that's a little hint i'll give you guys if i mean if you can believe me you cannot believe me but i believe platinum is the medal of the future also people aren't talking about it like they're talking about all these other investment vehicles but when i've done my research i'm like wow platinum looks really good so that's what i'm believing in at the moment anyway um we'll get back to uh we'll get back to just talking tech now so we'll get back to talking deck uh is it better to buy p uh pre-built pcs now actually speaking of that i believe nzxt i saw the other day nzxt raised their pre-built price uh what did they raise it to so they i think i saw a tweet without raising it like it went from seven hundred dollars or something to like twelve hundred dollars and i was like yeah so maybe it might not be a big time so now i think a heap of youtubers did um videos on like get a pre-built and pull the gpu out now that's all flooded so whenever there's a market opportunity you've got to be on it quick and usually by the time you hear it on the news it's too late so again that's that old age old saying buy on the room or sell on the news this one here i mean the prices are starting at a thousand bucks let's just see what you get from a pre-built from nzxt um i'll tell you guys if it's a rip-off or not okay so you get the case that's great where's the specs um oh yeah i mean the c i mean if it had a better cpu oh wait 1200 bucks no way okay 9100 f damn man nzxt's taking you to the bank here yeah okay so yeah i mean i wouldn't build a priest i wouldn't build a pre-built that's all not on this not on this website so a thousand bucks for a 1650 and a a 91 like out of all cpus a 9100f like come on they released the 10 100 f and that had four cores eight threads like at least give me a uh a ten one hundred f for a thousand bucks i mean come on my money's not that useless is it so that's my thought on private i mean if you guys know any good pre-builts um then maybe i'll i'll shout them out on the stream right now but i i was looking at the nzxt pre-built and these kind of they look rough uh right now but mind you um mind you the the rtx 2060 if that's gone for 800 bucks then hey i mean if you're desperate go for it so i mean they're using so if you look at that there's 26 66 speeds they're actually using a h410 motherboard as well so they're only showing you three things here uh show more like yeah h oh well okay wait no b365 motherboard okay so they were using they weren't using the they should be using a z motherboard especially a thousand bucks so yeah this is the worst time to buy a pc in my lifetime i mean yeah yes and no yes or no we looked at early in this stream we looked at um things you can do you still get good deals the gpu is the hardest part right now hands down but there are some still decent deals out there especially if you got a thousand bucks so just be on the sidelines and um of course always look for a good deal locally on the gpus you're going to find a better deal locally than you will on ebay or amazon because you suddenly got basically with the marketplace on ebay is you've got like i think it's like 12 to 13 14 fees the sellers are gonna add that on versus local right so when you've got that extra percentage buffed on there it's much better to get a local deal anyway but you've also got the traffic it's exponential when you're looking at it on an ebay standpoint traffic is so much more you've got like thousands and thousands of views per ad on ebay that's thousands and thousands of more people that are competition so anyway um check this video for a second nzxt said why they have this selection okay uh anyway uh eight dollars donation thanks man tech fast for us gotta use aussie bargain codes though yeah that's true techfast sometimes have some deals uh i have seen them they have had some ripper deals if you're in australia i just don't know the waiting times on those uh on those builds i heard it was sometimes it could be up to like a two months for a build so that's huge but it's worth the wait i mean if you don't want to get ripped off in australia techfast are definitely doing some when they have their sales on aussie bargains they're definitely given some good deals and anyone in the industry knows that so um i got faulty 2060 that was overheating and crashing cleaned it and changed pace this is sad that if you guys have faulty graphics cards people are paying money like people are paying money like my friend he apparently told me that he sold a gtx 1070 a faulty one for like 280 aussie dollars i'm like are you serious like people are paying money for faulty graphics cards and then you just put it up they're faulty and people will buy it still it's like what so they're paying like almost like a 280 for a faulty gtx 1070 versus 350 i much um rather know where my money would be spent and that is on the uh 1070 that works for 70 more so yeah the market has gone a bit crazy um yeah so and then do you think the market's going to get worse now that people are getting their tax returns yeah probably yeah amen never underestimate the power of impulse that's what i'll say uh the power of impulse is a crazy thing uh especially when a tax return comes around in australia it's just like this whole uh season now where you've got these seasons throughout the year where there's tax return there's christmas there's even easter now easter's coming a big thing like easter gaming pc it's like what there's an easter gaming pc like you stay at home just game through easter don't do anything with your family just stay at home and game get this easter pc so that's a that's a new thing coming out now in australia easter gaming pc so any holiday the the retailer is going to use an excuse to hack off a pc and uh make some money so i mean look the bottom line is though consumerism especially in australia uk and australia like us consumerism uh or consuming is at an all-time high so you gotta remember that like we got now we're getting these services in like after pay and there's all these services coming in to promote just debt debt fuel consumption and the problem with the debt fuel consumption is it isn't productive and it's not productive for a country it's like uh it's like someone's got the punch bowl out and they're just you know they're filling up the punch bowl with the extra alcohol but sooner or later someone's going to be like whoa i'm getting a bit dizzy here i go you know i can't keep going but then the punch bowl's full still and you've got the guy who's organized the party he's like yo yo yo the punch bowl it's still full keep drinking so you've got all these people running around now on this debt-fuelled hangover well no no not even hungover they're just debt fueled uh binge and they're just high all the time so that's that's what's going on and there the tax returns is just going to add to that anyway we got a five dollar donation here from black gamma there's like original point of discussion was to ask which gpu to buy in the current market are we any closer to an actual mark answer yeah so i just at the start of the stream brother i uh did point out what i would be looking at if i was in the usa so i've been i did check out the r9 280 so this one here that's what i'd buy like looking if i was online right and even locally i'd be looking for an r9 280 r9 380 uh that's that's how we go looking just off the top of my head judging by the price performance of this it's a decent card make sure it works i mean with ebay you get technically you get a warranty if it doesn't work you can send it back so conditions used and it's working so that's what i'd go for right now anyway we've got skill rebuilds two dollar donation thanks brother a aud seller 1340 megahertz a sapphire nitro 570 gigabyte four okay so you want to sell it i mean you'll get 200 for that thing that's the reality of that easy like i think easy you get 200 for it probably even get 220 for it um people are hungry for gpus man and they'll pay good money for them depends where you live as well uh also look at your locale uh where you're at depends where you live if you live in melbourne for instance i know if you're in melbourne or if you're in sydney prices of gpus seemed a little bit higher than where they were where i'm based so i'm still in a better market i think where i'm at in australia than other and i know i'm in a better market than the us because like i was surprised like i did the parts hunt yesterday and like people were like telling me my gtx 1070 was a really good deal and i'm like man like 350 is mediocre and the guy the guy was sitting on it for a couple of days as well uh there wasn't rtx uh sorry there was a gtx 1070 strix as well for 430 i did offer the guy i think was 350 or 380 however he's like no i want my i want i think he wants 400 bucks so there is still an rog strix for sale locally where i'm at uh 1070 if you if you guys are keen on that but um but yeah yeah that's right james brock's like you are in a better market yeah that's right i'm in a better market i'm going to enjoy it a little bit especially because i love used parts i'm going to be enjoying that enjoying that used market man but uh you know do you know the best market taiwan marco marco's telling me that taiwan is the best market to be in right now worldwide for gpus uh he was shown some videos on his channel where they just got rtx 3080s all on the shelves and the prices aren't too bad so anyway that's taiwan taiwan's the best place to be right now and marco will tell you he'll chip in and say hey guys and i've been actually hooking up maybe i might be able to do a part time with marco an online parts hunt and we take a look at some of the gpu prices in taiwan and you know sooner or later it's like hey just divert the containers to taiwan fill up the containers with gpus and then on they go you know i'd love one thing i'd love to do in australia is i i've got to start talking to gpu manufacturers directly i think youtubers like or i guess you know guys that guys that are in a position where we've built up reputations we would ship out the we would just get the gpus in and ship them out straight away go to the manufacturers direct cut out the middlemen and start giving people gpus at decent prices i would love to make a program like that and i think linus was already doing that to some degree and that's the best way to do it at the moment because you've got the and i know for a fact there's a lot of middlemen at the moment who are just ripping people off and i've spoken to the retailers and they're marking them up just their standard markup rate from if they were an msrp of uh say for instance in australia an msrp of thirteen hundred dollars for a thirty eighty they'd be putting their maybe 150 markup 200 markup at best and they've got to do the warranty the sales after sales support whatnot but then they're telling me like it's the dish trees that are ripping people off all the middlemen are just cleaning up and they're the guys who you know no one can point the finger to them because no one really knows who they are and uh that's the thing they just and then if no people know who they are they then buck they just put the blame on someone else oh yeah it was this one he's overseas he's the distributor for he's jacking the prices up and so it's just it's at the moment in terms of um gpu pricing new gpu pricing it's just a game of past the buck so and you know or you could see it as a game of musical chairs and the consumers just permanently standing up and everyone's sitting down and the music's rolling as well the music's not even stopping or starting it's just continuously rolling and the chairs are all for the distributors and the people making money in the pipeline and the consumers just standing up missing out on all the action with a sad face and they're like hey guys this isn't fun anymore this musical chairs isn't fun and the industries are like it's fun for us we've got a chair we've got good music rolling you consumers can just sit there and miss out on the action so um anyway that's what's going on it's the uh it's the musical chairs that was never meant to be for the consumer but i mean hey maybe guy like i'm gonna actually after this live stream i'm gonna put out some feelers out there and uh see maybe if colorful or something like that um we're interested in doing a shipment to australia and uh start shipping these gpus out directly instead of going through middlemen because yeah the middlemen are just either selling it to corporations uh or they're just yeah up marking them for the poor retailers and so the consumers just missing out big time so even even with some inflation thrown in it's still a rip-off so that's the worst thing about it all so yeah but anyway in terms of um in terms of the gpu i'd be buying right now it's uh this one right here right here the r9 280 three gigabyte that would be me yeah if i was in the usa i'd be looking for something like that something low-key something that not everyone's going for but still will give you a pretty solid gaming experience that would just be my pick so an r9 280 for example as well will give you much better performance than the gtx 750 ti so uh bro why would you want to sell the 30 80 who's selling uh i'm not selling the 30 who's selling a 30 80. i mean my guess is someone would want to sell a 3080 to make money that would be my guess uh how far we got skilled rebuilds how far is brian going to overclock that gt730 i don't know i might stick a fan on it's got a passive cooler i'll stick a fan on it i mean and we'll see how hard it can go um gtx 1080 ti better than the 1050 ti man are you guys starting to troll in chat now apparently like i got a call as well apparently miners are buying up the 1080 ti's apparently they're the cards to buy up now so it doesn't matter which card it is miners want to buy it up so that's the reality of uh the gtx 1080 ti as well so i think any graphics card's pretty good but look for the ones that are under four gigabytes of vram and under that's what you should be looking at right now because generally people are going to get if they if they're miners and they're that experienced and they can work with cars that are four gigabytes and under they're probably not going to anyway it's more worth their time to go for the the higher end stuff anyhow so the four gigabytes in under is definitely your play at the moment to get decent value and i think that's going to be a continuing trend until uh cryptocurrency has the bottom slip out from within so if you know the funny thing is about market caps and all the prices of bitcoin and everything what you see and with a one trillion dollar market cap and all that you shouldn't look at it that way a bitcoin is only worth the bids on that current day at that current point in time and if you added up all the bids on bitcoin that would give you a indication of how much real money is ready to pounce on bitcoin and that's why when you look at the price of cryptocurrencies they're so susceptible to pumping and dumping and that's because believe it or not there's not a whole lot of liquidity even though there is liquidity there's not a whole lot of uh vol um sorry how would you describe it there's not a whole lot of mass liquidity in cryptocurrency and that's why the prices are so volatile so do keep that in mind if we look at say a trading a currency pair like the um japanese yen versus the aussie dollar there would be much more in terms of bids then bitcoin would have on it so you you for instance in in one day of fx trading between the aussie dollar and the uh and the japanese yen you'd have more volume of money being moved than there would be in bitcoin maybe i mean i'd have to do my more research on that but at least when the price movements there'd be a lot more mass liquidity in crit and uh currencies than there would be in crypto currencies so just be careful with that that's the one thing i think a lot of people if they look at the price of a bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency they've got to understand that those things can fall out of nowhere and so that can send the prices of um cryptocurrencies crashing down which then can cause a gpu flooding on the market so people suddenly oh crypto's not profitable anymore and then they just sell their gpus off and they sell it off before the next guy can sell his off so it's a race it's suddenly this race to sell your gpus off and so that's a realistic scenario um we've got some egg yeah why don't you answer your email uh sorry man like my email just gets flooded brother um i've just been like personally this is the best time to get me is actually on these live streams or on twitter um and so the best time to get me is on the live streams or on twitter i've just i'm just like yeah i got a lot going on personally as well so do keep in mind i do have a have to do a lot of stuff on the side um besides the youtube as well so a bit busy especially these next few months they're going to be busy months for me so um once once everything's sort of once everything's back to normal you'll know guys there'll be videos like every one day or two days and like they'll be they'll keep coming out so i promise you that much uh isn't it isn't it good that someone who bought a card for a high price and gets some return with mining um i mean yeah i mean like if you've got a graphic card go do what you want with that thing if you've paid if you've paid a double retail for it double msrp then yeah i mean definitely you might want to recoup some of the cost back by using it to mine i mean do what you want with your i mean i don't is it a good thing i don't know it's subjective so do you know um i want an older r9 series radeon card but all of them seem to only have one display port and aren't 1.2 which would mean they don't support my 280 hertz monitor right yes i believe that's right i think what is it 200 280 hertz monitor is there like is there a 280 hertz monday i didn't even know i think that isn't that the limit isn't it 360 hertz and 280 hertz is the limit or something like that or is that the 280 hertz limit like i've never heard of a 280 hertz monitor i think it's the 280 oh wow what overclock okay i don't even know that ah there is a 280 hertz monitor what okay that's interesting i didn't even know that wow okay there's a 280 hertz monitor there you go um i think there there is like i think it's like if you look at the gtx 9 series i think um [Music] what's the what's the limit on it again there is a refresh limit on i know the 9 series for instance won't power 360 hertz it'll only power to i think like 200 and something so there is a there is a limit and yes i believe the r9 series will do the same unfortunately so in that case that monitor will need a 10 series card a 10 series card will be perfect that will power the 360 hertz or the 280 hertz in this regard um yeah so we'll get back to some questions though man you guys are hungry for the questions let's get let's get into it again round two can you recommend a good 1440p gpu um i mean it depends on your price depends on your budget i mean rtx 3070 is a good 1440p gpu the problem is would i pay the current market rates for them no in terms of a budget card for 1440p i mean depends on how much you want to sacrifice the vram if you can drop the settings and keep it under four gigabytes of vram you can get like a a fury x or something like that try and get a fury and that would actually give you some decent fps at 1440p that'd be my recommendation we're looking for a value play uh do you think uh game devs will start coding according to the bottlenecked ability for gamers to get last gen gpus i mean yeah like game devs are already just cutting it down look at fortnite look at all these games that are popular they don't want to innovate because they're too busy getting the audience bigger and bigger so they can buy skins and buy all these in-store purchases the incentive now for video game developers is not to make your game graphically uh demanding not to make your game graphically challenging the the incentive is to make the game as easy to play as possible so you can and then it's free to play i mean it is free to play if you guys aren't impulsive if you guys aren't impulsive then the game is free to play but if you know they they pray a lot of these game developers see the trends now and that is easy easy money is flowing around so why don't we make a game that people can just jump on and then all their mates are playing and then they want to have the cool skins and we'll make money that way so yeah the the game indus the developer like all right let's just let's just give a quick um shout out here the age of empires four this this this actually puts a smile on my face i saw the uh i saw the game uh gameplay trailer for this and i am i have never been excited for a game in a while than this one like i think the anticipation for me personally with age of empires 4 is huge i've been waiting for a good game to be released and hopefully i mean there'd probably be micro transactions in there somewhere but i'm hoping that it's not i'm hoping they just maybe do it like the old school way just release the game pay some money for the game and then release an expansion back um but yeah like this game right here is sort of giving me some hope in terms of game devs designing for better hardware but also still making it playable to the masses but still having a good game so hopefully this is one of those games that renews my face in pc gaming because at the moment i'm just seeing a lot of free to play games and um and they honestly they just like they're not like they're good and all but there's much more to pc gaming um than there is to uh there's much more to pc gaming than there is to free to play battle royales where you're just going in one little zone and the depth and all the strategies and and all that yeah it does make me a little bit sad because you know like that's the thing in the questions are you excited for diablo to remaster yeah like i'm actually excited for that too because this was when pc gaming was so innovative and all the games like that's why they're remastering diablo 2. you know what that means it means all the new games most the new games coming out now just straight up suck they're boring they're crap and so people would rather play a remastered game over was it two decades when did diablo 2 come out do you have what meant i remember playing diablo 2 release was it two decades now well yeah over two decades ago so people would rather play a game from two decades ago than play games now if that doesn't tell you something about the games that are coming out now and the caliber of games coming out then i don't know what what does what that spells for me remastering diablo 2 means that hey this game had such a good skill set had such a good game play had so much depth was awesome and that we've got to remaster it because all the new games haven't taken up that they just suck and they keep getting worse i mean like no offense the diablo 3 but i didn't really enjoy it anywhere near as much as i enjoyed diablo 2. uh diablo the original that's when you had that tent you had the trend it was going up right you had the trend we'll get we get on the big screen look at the trend uh we had the 1990s games were getting good they were going up up up 2000s early 2000s up to 2010 though just kept getting better and better and um then uh about 2015 hit right and then games just like i think gta 5 was the last game that i really enjoyed like really really enjoyed on pc like i got excited about when i started playing it because it was so well written the story was good uh everything was just good about gta 5. but after that it just like you had all these games coming out and they were just like they'll just crap one after the other crap crap crap hey get excited for this game and you're playing it like the mechanics you know like i don't know about you guys but doesn't the autopilot like some of these games they come out with this autopilot mechanism where you click a button and you're like sitting there for five seconds watching your character do an auto move and it's like where's the skill and excitement in this you guys will just put on netflix and watch a movie like who designs these games so anyway anyway yeah so actually that's funny well 2015 was when the micro transaction took effect yeah that's pretty much when we had the decline in in game develop developments uh pillars of attorney yeah boulder's gate 3 was really good as well i actually bought a gate three still in uh beta alpha actually i got early access and i only played like through the first bit because that's all you're allowed to play through and i was so i was having a really good time sorry i shouldn't say gta 5 was the last game for me boulder's gate 3 was awesome as well so that was really good i was getting into that i did an all-nighter that was the first all-nighter i've done on video games in a long time so there are some good games and i think a lot of there's this whole uh undercard now in pc gaming right you've got mainstream and now you've got as weird because pc gaming was never mainstream this is the funny thing about pc gaming was never mainstream and now you've got pc gaming being so mainstream i think things like diablo 2 remastered and a lot of these good games that come out that stick to that old formula you've even got wow classic they stick to the old formula of mechanics and skill and gameplay they're they're surging in popularity they're capturing the og pc uh gamer as well as the non-mainstream uh pc gamer that is getting into it you know who wants to be a bit uh intellectually challenged uh you know wants to be challenged not instead of not just picking easy and running through a game and getting their dopamine hit so um yeah but that's pc man how do we how do we go off on this tangent live streams guys live streams oh damn have you played factorio really faint fun game no actually i haven't i'll have to check it out if you reckon it's good if you guys you guys the viewers if you reckon something's good i'll check it out because you guys uh we've got we got a like-minded community here it's awesome you know like all the comments that come in and all regardless of my my channel sort of staying underground i love it how you guys are constantly um yeah like we got a community here and it's an awesome one i always love it like i actually haven't had any real negative comments like proper negative comments in a long time so that's been an awesome thing so you guys stay awesome we got a donation from mel 7.99 thanks for that i love the number uh do maternal especially the dlc is pretty intense uh especially on ultra violence or nightmare difficulty yeah doom doom's awesome man um doom on the on the nightmare difficulty is it's really good so there's actually a there's actually an aussie guy called spud hunter who was really good at the game he's really good at doom i was watching him play it um on the max yeah nightmare difficulty and it was just he clocked it and he was really good so it's funny how like some people are like really good at certain games you've got guys out there that are just uh you know super mario speedrunner bandits and like that's the beautiful thing about uh gaming in general you got people who really excel at one genre of gaming so we've got here it's a good deal to buy used graphics cards from aliexpress i'd say it was it was a good deal like when we had rx 570s and 470s for 80 that was a good deal then um we can check that we can check out we go back to the prices of use graphics cards on aliexpress and have a quick check for you guys but i think um okay is it we'll just check if it's a good deal i'll just quickly read through some other comments uh do you play rocket league uh no it's not my it's not my like rocket league wasn't my thing i did play it like when i was having a few beers i think it's one of those games i i think rocket league's one of those games where you get with your mates and you have a few beers it's like that mario game where you've got you've got to find it the ghost or whatever the ghost is there's some games that are fun to have with you like um drive-by critics that's it that's what it is marco you don't want to be a drive-by critic we'll reiterate that in the live stream a few times um plenty of them out there but i know in terms of rocket league it's a fun game when i i find it's like a fun social game it's weird because a lot of people just play it on their computer uh in with their friends like like dedicated i find it's actually one of those games it's fun to play with your mates when you got them there um let's look at uh gtx 9 i like on aliexpress i did like the gtx 9 i did like it see this is a problem i thought this would be the problem 205 dollars for a gtx yeah mario party yeah that's the one i haven't played it for so long i forgot the name of the the mario game uh 205 yeah no way would i be buying a gtx 960 for that price so at the moment aliexpress gravis cards are really intense in terms of their prices i mean i remember gtx 950s they were they were like 70 and that was even considered a little bit expensive you know seven eight months ago so the prices on on aliexpress for gpus right now is kind of a no-go that's personally for me so um that's uh just be careful with that one so yeah but we'll move through a few more questions so are you into cs go skins brian i i like them i just i'm not into the whole community of trading them i know you can make some bank on that hey if you're if you're hustling cs go skins i know one guy locally here sold a pc for some cs go skins because the guy was so desperate for cs go skins i mean sorry the guy was so desperate for a gaming pc that he traded like over traded skins for a the um the pc and so then the guy ended up the other guy ended up flipping the skins and making some bank and they like the thing is if you sit on the skin apparently if you sit on the skins is this right if you sit on the skins at a certain price sooner or later someone might buy it so it's a it's a patience game i think when it comes to it's kind of like the the world of warcraft auction house i used to sit on the world of warcraft auction house with my overpriced uh materials and then sooner or later someone would buy them so that's a that's the problem right now right if you got people selling these g i'm guessing the same effect is going to come into um the same effect will come into [Music] rtx 3080s and stuff there'll be guys who have them and they'll be like oh i'm just going to sit on a stupid ridiculous price and wait until someone's impulsive enough to uh to come and buy it um what is the rarest game you own rarest game like intern actually it's funny because the only box game i own now is boulder's gate 2 shadows of him that's the only box game i own that's that's actually scary because i used to have so many boxed games and i used to love keeping the boxes but for some reason i think i cleaned out ages ago i cleaned out all my box games and um and boulder's gate 2 was the one i was like you know i'm going to keep one of these because i had the map it was the collector's edition i had the map in there let's i'm pretty sure you got a map with it i'm pretty sure like when you bought boulder's gate 2 you got a map with it yeah here we go you used to with a mouse pad and a mouse pad i don't think i got the mouse pad this is in mint condition man i love this this is the rarest game i own and i got the map still so it's got the mouse pad as well that's awesome man i want the mouse pad so um skill rebuilds 10 bucks donation thanks brother i've been here since your bulldozer frame times versus intel video appreciate the meta watch be easy thanks for all the fish thanks man thanks for being staying tuned for so long man that's awesome cheers um that's wicked yeah back back in the day i i think there was this whole thing about it was back in the day it was bulldozer versus uh the four core you had the eight core versus the four core and it was just all this like youtube was a different time back in 2014 it was a different time where you just it was a popularity contest and it should never be that guys when it comes to making choices in terms of um especially if it's costing you money always make a choice based off research and uh getting educated and so yeah i did i did a four core intel i think it was a fourth gen versus the eight core bulldozer and i found that the four core was doing better in fbs and this was at the time it was a big taboo topic but i was glad to do that video uh it was a huge video and i was glad to make that one and and sort of uh put that that argument to rest i think that was back when people were just like yo uh here's the popular guy recommending a cpu i'm just gonna go buy it because this guy's uh popular he's like what a dumb thing to do don't ever do that when it comes to making big money decisions hey you'll find the popular guy won't be there to bail you out when you've lost a heap of money that's the scary thing hey um and um okay so uh bro i need a 30 80 help uh medi reza you're local maddie didn't what did you get off like medi i think you i think he bought a pc office what did what what gpu did you have in that pc what pc did you have what gpu did you have in that pc you had a really good one so thanks for the five bucks brother um that's weird you had a good pc but the 30 80 man that it's look i know it's hard to get a 30 80 man i need mine for testing i need i've got a 3080. and i've got actually i've got 230 i'm not going to lie i've got 238s okay i do i got one in uh synthetic sewer and then i got one for testing so i'm um i'm down if i had extra 30 80s i'd be selling them much better rates than um than the 2 500 bucks you're seeing i'd be selling for much better deal than 2500 that you're seeing locally that's why i'm looking look i'm looking if i can get a hold of gpu vendors and see if we can do some direct deals i would like i'd be happy to do the whole container for free like just to help people out in australia and i think if some like community members could organize that just to help people get some of these good cards it'd be great for the pc gaming community because the end of the day we're all pc gamers we should be looking after each other and that's the biggest thing marco's junior oh wow marco you've got some competition marco's junior's in the in the comments section sup marcos jr are you um is marco you're going to get surpassed by marcos jr one day we got here the uh marcos jr asks when you come to japan again maybe some double hunting brian oh yeah so when i get back to japan i am gonna like it is gonna be a parts hunt mega megathon i don't even know if that's a word it's gonna be a mastodon of parts hunting like i'm just gonna never stop for like a month it'll be a straight month i'm just i'm edging to get out like into a different area and do some part signs man i'm i'm edging to do it so it'll be like a mega parts hunt people are going to think i've gone mad when i get to japan and i start part-timing again i'm trying to do it as soon as i can i'm trying to do it and you know the funny thing is if i went to japan and did it if they had a good internet i'd love to live stream parts hunts for you guys like actually live stream the parts on so you guys can come along have fun that would be wicked um are the prices in japan lower uh they're still affected uh we can check actually that's a good thing we can check for you guys um other parts still lower in japan we'll check live for you guys so basically kikaku is like uh it'd be like i don't know what you guys have in us it'd be like pc part pickers price list that pulls up the best prices of all the different retailers uh this would be their price so what's an rtx 3070 going for in japan uh you can get an rtx 3070 in japan that looks like it's a readily available price that's about 1500 usd um let's have a look that would be i think that's including tax so how's the japanese seen i don't know but i'll just check for you guys so 1577 usd you could get an rtx 3070 in japan for uh let's check out 30 80s um let's see the stock yeah so you okay they're a ripoff in japan that's that's insane so it's two and a half two point three thousand dollars or something for an rtx 3080 in japan uh we can also this site's really good like this site is like in japan they are blessed with kikaku in terms of actually scanning the prices um this is a really good site for scan so the number one selling card in japan right now online is the 6700 xt that is the like at the moment in because this is very instantaneous you gotta remember kikaku.com has the like tomorrow this could change so tomorrow the the gt 1030 yeah boy rocking representing number two a gt-1030 that's for the haters out there saying that the gt 1030 ain't selling japan's showing you that people just want to play league of legends and um they just want to play league of legends and some cs go and they don't want to pay 3 200 for an rtx 3090 keep in mind that is the rog strix 3090 that's number three like that's insane so that must have been like they must have had a mad stock pile of 30 90 strixers come in and suddenly that's moving up the ladder so people like oh my god gotta buy a 30-90 gotta buy a 30-90 um but hey like look i would get a that's a gdr5 version i would get i i would get a gt 1030 if i was in japan right now this is the this is the sad reality of pc gaming hey man what card should i buy right now let me just have a think about it gt 1030 yeah what's the value for money play gt 1030 shocked face that that's what we're going for gt 1030 pc that's that's japan i think that's the card i look 1650 300 300 hey like that's a bit better than the prices i've seen in the us for um 1650s gt 710 i guess office pcs need to still get built that's um but i guess amd's like amd's see they're not being targeted by the miners so much so the retail this is all retail this would all be all retail sales by the way so these are the cards that read like a lot of people just individual uh single consumers are buying so yeah it's good to see like it's good to see that some of the cards aren't too bad but it's still pretty bad the situation is overall pretty bad in japan as well so there's that um so many two dollar donation what's the uh best high-end gpu for content cr creation i can get 1080 ti i'd go for a 1080 ti if you're looking at value for money in terms of the current market a good thing about japan is like you can go to the yahoo um it's actually cool that you guys talk about japan like i really like i miss the place like non weeaboo like i i don't go over there to you know um be a full like i'm not into the whole anime thing like i like anime but i'm not like i'm into like japan diet cool um cool tech love the love the tech hub love the nature love exploring japan and um of course i got my boy there but then you've got of course you've got the other side you know people love it for the the anime and all that and anime is huge now i didn't realize how big anime is but um yeah but you know you guys probably like look watching like is this guy is this guy yeah this guy weeb i gotta gotta like give you guys a preemptive like yeah i'm not a weeaboo don't worry um i remember i saw that you know it was funny um it was funny seeing that frank video ages ago i remember laughing that was one of the funniest videos i miss that comedy man i miss that comedy it's sad that the comedy like that isn't really encouraged nowadays but that was some genuine humor i miss uh filthy frank's yeah he got on to make music now that's it's kind of like i mean i i thought he was a brilliant comedian that's all i thought he was i loved his comedy love his comedy anyway we'll go what are we looking at here um gtx 1080ti let's have a look so medi we'll have a look gtx 1080 ti on market uh this is so yahoo auctions you'll be able to see um hundred dollars so seven hundred dollars buy it now if you were desperate in japan you can buy it now for 700 something dollars that's the buy now price it's on bid uh for x amount of dollars so there's one here for seven hundred dollars so okay it looks like if i was in japan i'd probably go for a 780 a 1080 ti sorry i'd go for a 1080 ti it looks like they've still got that like they're not a rip-off and they'd be great for content creation still a great gaming card you get all the advantages you don't get dlss which sucks i i like dlss i think that's really good but you don't get dlss but you still get the in reflex and the boost and stuff like that so there's that that's 1080 ti that's actually a pretty well priced card like on the used market in japan that would be one of my top picks just by looking at those prices versus the new prices um maybe like maybe see what the goal is with the gtx 960 something like a budget card yeah so that's yes you've already got a hundred and something dollars on bid that's three hours remaining so they got three hours left on the auction i i wouldn't really be going for that too too heavily um but yeah so i guess the 1080i we just stumbled like i honestly think we stumbled onto kind of the best deal straight from the start uh or a 1080. that'd be a great card for for rendering and um oh just you guys asked someone asked about japan uh and the best card to get the best graphics card to get in japan and i like i'm i i kind of i know the japanese market so if you if you guys were like yo brian uh what's spain like what's the go in spain what gpu should i get and i'd be like i got no idea yo brian what about colombia i have no idea um kind of like you know us a little bit i'm a little bit well-versed i've been over to the us i know the whole the scene when i was i was hustling there i've been two times and i've i've been there two times now in terms of uh hustling in the usa so i kind of know it not that well versed in the usa but in terms of japan very well versed and and same with australia so i know this one i can give you guys pointers if you want to know what what japan's doing but yeah 1080 looks like a decent deal like that one's dollars buy it now so that's pretty good i just honest honestly i just buy that like why are these guys going into bidding wars i that card's just gonna sell out like you re look this one this one's already oh wait that's a that's a 1080i but oh wait look at that wow just we're live streaming just like start bidding up the price 10 minutes so this one's actually going we'll just chat with you guys this graphics card here is like going very soon out of uh we'll get to see what the price of this goes for oh this is junk okay i okay so whoever's bidding on this is pretty ballsy um if you've got the junk in the title here that just means like the seller he does not want to know about this card after it after he sends it out you pay him the money you are not getting your money back at all so that's what junk means basically in a nutshell it can work it can't work um okay oh man my kanji is bad what's he saying he'll say you'll tell me the state of it okay so the health of the card he's talking about the health of the card i just need google translate for that now my kanji is so bad now so that's a problem i can speak the japanese but now i haven't read it for ages okay so he's just saying all right dog okay so it's been sleeping yeah it's been sleeping in a warehouse so he's just basically like he's doing the whole like i used it for editing videos and um it's just been out of my computer for a while so just take it as it is and it could be it could be busted um you knowing that excuse seeing that excuse i personally wouldn't be buying it that's just me after seeing the junk in the top like people clearly in japan they label it as junk and they just mean look i mean if you are selling a gtx 1080 why wouldn't you just quickly put it in a pc and just say hey it works here's a picture of it working because you're going to get more money for it naturally right and if you're going like well brian people don't have time to and this is the thing right we're going into the profiling here you guys actually will look at how i hustle too and this is how i can bid and place bids it's basically you've got to get into the mind of the person selling it i'm not saying he's a bad seller i'm just saying why would he be taking going to all this effort to take all these photos of this card all this effort like he's put in and so he's got a bit of time on his hands if it was just one quick photo of the card and just like yo junk uh it did work i'd probably believe i'd be like yeah okay it works it probably works but because he's gone to the lengths of taking all these nice photos writing a big description but not actually putting the card in a computer and testing it that's a little bit of a warning sign that would be a red flag for me so there's that there's a little bit of it like get into the mind flow and connect the dots and then you can hustle good deals and that's probably why i don't get scammed so um that's probably why i don't get scammed but you know this card could work i'm not saying it won't but i just wouldn't bid on it so but we'll check the price we'll see what it's going for so it's going at 285 so someone's taking a gamble at 285 dollars that's what's going on here so basically it's got three minutes to go we'll watch this live let's watch all this together what is the gtx 1080 no return go for 250 dollars i mean hey if you guys could fix up graphics cards that would be definitely i think that'd be one for those guys who take a punt on it but he's i mean he's saying it works saying it works it's two minutes remaining if you're in japan you can get potentially faulty gpu it's a gamble it's one of them lucky dips kinder surprise so but we'll continue on with the question while we watch this auction run down on a live stream how much is that ddr3 ram there uh ddr3 ram in australia is still pretty cheap so i was looking on my parts hunt for i was looking on the parts hunt for eight gigabyte sticks and 16 gigabytes for around 25.5 um 16 gigabytes about 50 aussie dollars so if you're looking at in terms of if you're looking in terms of 50 aud there's about 38 points so 39 bucks 39 bucks for 16 gigabytes that's what i'd be paying right now that's about the market rate for me and that's what i when i need ddr3 now ddr3 is believe it or not ddr3 memory costs about 25 for 8 gigabyte sticks brand new i think so 50 usd for 16 gigabytes so anywhere under that figure is pretty good right especially if you're doing it in pcs so how does the uh how does oh we've got a five dollar donation thanks gilbree builds thanks man uh how to approach fifty dollar faulty winforce three r9 290 uh tech yes love and offer 30 40 less 50 um yeah like i'd offer 30 bucks i mean it's faulty right so may need just take a gamble on it uh you wise will save some dollars in the process if it doesn't work there was one guy that really critiqued me about my oven bake methods and that's a funny thing like he was like oh man you know i buy faulty graphics cards and i hate it when people love them bake it and it's like well that's a subjective way of like saying hey it's in favor of you rather than in favor of the person with the card who's got nothing to lose but i will say one thing nowadays judging by the rates of faulty graphics cards i would say instead of you uh trying to attempt the gpu oven bake method or the heat gun method i would just sell your faulty graphics card now on ebay and just listed as faulty people are buying them up and paying good money for them and put that towards a a graphics card that actually works because yeah like faulty gpu prices are going up so you should seriously consider uh selling your faulty gpus like listing them as faulty like it's just like then you're not you're not misleading anyone or anything like that just yeah don't even bother wasting don't even bother with the last ditched attempt like okay yeah it is it is a lot yeah it's a last-ditch attempt and that's the thing i based that off of the fact that no one was buying faulty graphics cards like if i if i put a faulty graphics card up for sale two years ago no one would buy it it would just sit there on marketplace and no one would buy the other people's faulty gravity cards i think a lot of people would just end up chucking the faulty gpu in the bin and doing doing someone else a favor instead of trying to host someone that's sort of like the culture but now hey if you've got a faulty gpu you can get some money on ebay for that thing actually what we'll do is we'll quickly check um how did that auction go so this one how did this one go is this one done yet ah someone's bit look at that someone's gone nut you're not getting that 1080 for for 260 or so you're getting for 280 now so this is the thing about the japanese auctions too this is why i was telling someone go like there was that other one there for 400 that's guaranteed working go get that before this one gets bitted up and um and then that one gets bought out anyway someone's going to buy that out it's a good price i would buy that out right if i was in japan i'd just go buy the one with the 39 800 or 350 usd for the 1080. i just get buy it up because the current market forget get like why waste your time getting into bidding wars hitting the f5 browser like me on live stream i'm just i'm i'm i'm the guy stepping back watching i'm having fun here but i mean if you're if you're serious about getting this card why do you want to get this card when you can get the one that's just buy it now here it is oh wait he's saying junk as well oh no okay i look like an idiot he's saying junk as well these guys men can they please just put it in the the pc put the card in the pc and show it working okay it's the same scenario okay oops that's another thing do you re do your research before you put the buy it now live stream fail right there live stream fail uh-oh that was my ebay affiliate account doesn't do well it's like hey guys if i'm recommending an ebay link i might as well get affiliate kickback that's the affiliate programs but um let's have i was going to like what i wanted to do is i wanted to pull up completed listings on faulty graphics cards and show you guys so yeah like here we go look at this i wasn't lying i wasn't lying this was a bid war a bid war for a faulty graphics card two hundred and two dollars this is what someone paid in australia for a 1070 ti and it was faulty 202 like that's good money like you know you know after 2018 after the crypto bust you could get 1070 ti's working in really good condition for 200 like that's insane now people are paying it for a faulty one wow man times change so quickly don't they so uh midi how does a 3090 compare to a 2080 uh it's it's a better card like it's really good i think off the top of my head it should be a 90 percent faster i mean it's it's a quick maybe even twice as fast 39 is a beast card man it just costs a lot um for gaming if you're doing if you're doing like because you're content creating the 2080 is a good card for content creation because you've got the rtx studio driver so yeah for content creation you're probably not even going to see a difference but for gaming you'll see a huge difference from a 30 90 to a from a from a 2080 so to a 30 90. so there's that there um okay what could you do with a broken gpu i me i could put the heat gun on it that's about all i could do with the broken graphics card i could just put the heat gun on it and hope and hope that we get a signal out of it um because yeah like i've said in the past i and that's a good thing like when i was doing my um recent video on how i have a go at gpus i'm terrible with the soldering iron but i will like for the purpose of giving it a go i will order a soldering station kit so if you guys have got some recommendations for a good soldering station um i'll get one and i'll try repairing a graphics card like properly and maybe learn the ways because i think in this climate it would be a good skill to actually replace the faulty part on the gpu if it does have a faulty part and then just uh have a crack at it and get it working again so that would be pretty cool but of course you do want the good tools um use the soldering station that luis rossman uses what is what's it called is it called the rosman soldering station uh if someone's got like an aliexpress link or something i'd love just to yeah i'll get one off aliexpress um for a soldering station or something like that so uh what's a good one so yeah half a million subs yeah that'd be cool if we get half a million subs soon it'll be awesome it's like my goal my dream to get to half a million subs because million subs man like million subs you've got to be on that youtube like someone at youtube has to like you they've got to hand pick you and throw you out on the algorithm and that's uh i don't think that that's never going to happen for your boy tech yes unfortunately but hey half a million subs we can we can dream let's get there brothers let's get there punch punch on oh man that's the thing nowadays too we never never a good punch on nowadays either is gtx 962 gigabyte still worth it i saw it for around 80 to 120 bucks yeah i mean like 80 usd i think at this current point in time i would buy it in the us looking at all these other prices right looking at this price this is like i'm saying here in the us right now this is a good deal like believe it or not this is a pretty solid deal so yeah 960 at 80 bucks is a decent deal too i mean like just to get you through and see what unfolds i mean everyone's praying for a crypto cat crash and the good thing about a crypto crash is even if a crypto crashes temporary it's gonna provide some relief to the gamers so that's why i'm praying for even like a big sharp crash that even if it only lasts two months it's going to give people a chance to get a gpu at a decent price so here's to that um anyway that's uh that's a that's on the gpus but in the meantime hold out get something like an r9 280 if you desperately need a game and get a gtx 960 or something like that so crypto is crashing right now yeah that's awesome let's have a party let's let's just retitle this stream crypto crashing party who's in are we all here yeah whoo let's do it let's check the price of crypto hopefully it's crashing right now um yeah let's have a look no that's that hasn't that's stabilized that's stabilized i mean it depends what depends what um depends yeah they're kind of stabilized that's not that's not oh well okay doge is having a a field day here that's the one a lot of people are watching you know it's funny i was like i was on twitter the other day and i saw some um um this this trending dogeday 420 or something and all these guys hundreds of thousands of tweets guys are just going stupid like dogeday 420 like yeah this is gonna take over the world and it actually crashed that's when it crashed on that day like it's gonna like someone like this is where i think someone out there or some group of people with a lot of money are just having like the biggest lols of their life right now with this dogecoin stuff like come on if you are controlling the price of dogecoin you have to be laughing your ass off that all these hundreds of thousands of people are tweeting and you're just crashing the price of doge when they think it's going to go up it's like that'd be the i just i could imagine these guys who control the price of doge just sitting there laughing their asses off going yep let's just sell let's just sell into these guys they think it's gonna go up in price we'll just we'll just leave them holding the bag here's the bag of dogecoins thanks for your money [Laughter] but there's an age-old saying don't worry um never forget it guys that's that is a fool is soon parted with their money so i mean look if you're gonna go into this doge thing i wouldn't go all in okay just be careful on it dogecoin 420 day like i mean look like honestly i just think the joke is going to go longer though i could see like this dogecoin thing will probably go to a dollar like that's honestly um that could be something that happens that's a reality with a bit i just look i don't like the only coin i believe in i've said this the only coin i believe in the crypto space after doing a lot of research is the ethereum that's all i believe in all the others just don't do anything for me they're all just hype and no go as opposed to ethereum which is actually got a whole backbone behind it but it's kind of that's again that's my own research and so that's my own research anyway um yeah i mean bitcoin bitcoins bitcoin i mean bitcoin's the og that's sort of like that's just the poster child for crypto i think there's better like better uses for crypto than just um putting your money in there and speculating because let's be honest the only thing that's bitcoin's been doing the only thing with bitcoin is people have been making money off it and getting rich and buying ferraris in that case you should just have ferrari coin and then just say hey guys come and buy ferrari coin and buy me a ferrari if you're the original guy holding on to the ferrari coins and a hundred other thousand people buy ferrari coin guess what you've got a ferrari now you've materialized something out of nothing that's how you can see it right but if you've got something with intrinsic value and that is what i believe in ethereum has it's a whole network that's powering smart contracts so there's a difference and that's what i mean we can sit here and talk crypto all day uh but the only one i believe in is ethereum that's all that's it like out of thousands and thousands of cryptocurrencies uh and that's the thing i mean i might cop a bit of hate for not believing in bitcoin but that's just my personal beliefs i mean if if you want to go um i mean hey we could get some drive-by critics here welcome to slap the dislike button and then just tell me i'm an idiot and move along that's cool so that's what i think this live this live stream is this live stream we've actually pointed out a fallacy and that is the drive by critic so anyway guys um let's uh we'll close this stream off soon i'm gonna go cook some dinner up uh and it's a friday night so i'm gonna go get myself a beer and relax a little bit but if you guys have any pressing questions before we get on out of here pressing questions then i'll answer them and then we'll close off this live stream for you guys but thanks for tuning in as well it's um it's been awesome and uh yeah every month i want to just look at the market in terms of pc prices uh tonight i'm cooking up veggies chicken kiev and uh some just some chips that's that's for dinner tonight chicken calves i like it man it tastes good and um i want to get back actually what i want to do is get through a lot of all this stuff i've got on the plate and then you guys have been requesting i get back to the gym and start bulking up again so i'll start bulking up again and then we'll go out and we'll just like we'll hustle pc parts with a big chain on and we'll start intimidating people for deals if that's what you want we can do that as well i just got to get the muscle mass for it um but no i mean that was a joke guys that was a joke okay chicken kiev love it baby uh where do i get cheap windows 10 keys oh thanks for the question brother in the description uh that's is that a dying question it says do cpu price watch next yeah we said we did all we did the whole market today i put out some good deals things that i would be uh buying personally uh so watch the first part of the stream and um yeah if you've got those questions uh do you know the aussie youtuber greg's kitchen from the goldie oh no i don't i'll check him out thanks for the recommendation always love it if we've got fellow guys on the gold coast i live on the gold coast in australia you guys could google it and um tell me you you'd like to like the gold coast best weather in the world that's just my opinion a personal bias of course but i love the gold coast uh what do you think an rtx 30 series will devalue to in a crypto crash i think 80 percent of our msrp possibly 70 so say for instance an rtx uh 3070 cost 500 you might see them going for say 430 dollars 420 that's if you have a really big crash in crypto people will be selling them out under msrp of course at that price people who have wanted gpus will just pick them up i'd say and here's the thing the reason why it won't go any lower the reason why it wouldn't go any lower is because there would be so many hungry pc reflippers that would just be buying them up they'd be like yep i'm getting these under msrp the manufacturer has to make a profit and so that's the thing when you look at an msrp it doesn't get much lower than that because that's your flaw if you go lower people are losing money so you've got to look at that price and then people know like re-flippers no okay that's the price floor when it comes in under that i'm going to be picking up more and more and more and more and more on stockpiling because they're not going to get any cheaper and of course people need to buy gaming pcs people are hungry man people are hungry i think they're hungry than ever um anyway uh b and e so hot today is the gold coast the same no gold coast was really good today i don't know why brisbane was so hot that's weird man geez maybe maybe that's why people want to come it's only an hour drive too brisbane shouldn't be hot uh hard drive mining oh man hard disk drive mining that's from cheer isn't it chia and the hard drive mining just like i need a break i look i'm going to go eat some dinner now have that beer okay uh hard drive mining okay that's it man i mean look the good thing about that is at least the good thing there i'm guessing with hard drive mining is people won't be buying 120 gigabyte ssds and look that's all you need used hard drive 120 gigabyte ssd the used market's still going to be fine so i think if there is hard drive mining it's going to affect all like i'd say it would affect the the three or four terabytes and stuff like that so yeah no it's all good yeah well yep i gotta get on out of here guys gotta get on out of here so it's 10 30. no yeah it is wow we've been streaming for two hours that's huge okay guys what a live well two over two hours that's uh that's awesome i guess we go off on tangents hey you guys love it you guys keep asking the questions um hey what happened to pickaxe mining well that's the thing i mean here's the thing right instead of pickaxe mining you just use those graphics okay if you've got graphics cards go mine on them and then go buy precious metals like look at the irony there you can actually mine precious metals with some graphics cards if you look at it that way and you'd be getting an absolute bargain too that's from my research so anyway um platinum baby platinum that's my research so yeah if you guys are asking me sell that sell down your cryptos and buy platinum that'd be a smart move that's just my that's just my uh my recommendation that's my research i could be wrong could always be wrong anyway guys i'll catch you next time love each and every one of you thanks for tuning in and uh yeah it's 10 30 pm dude how are you not tired brother let's answer this brother i'm on that green tea i wake up in the morning see most people wake up they'll drink a coffee they'll go and drink a coffee and they'll be like yeah i've gotta gotta have my coffee bro gotta
