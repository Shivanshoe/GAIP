[Music] here's a fun fact about colorful that i
didn't even know until a couple of days ago and that is
that they are the second biggest gpu manufacturer
in the world behind palit and palit (microsystems) apparently own galax
and also gainwood and they're the number one distributor
even beating out companies like asus and gigabyte when it comes to gpu shipments
and in america evga which i believe they're
number one in the usa but just because they
ship more gpus than asus and other companies does that necessarily
mean they are better well today is a very big
and pleasant surprise for me and i mean big because this cooler weighs in
at over 1450 grams being 148 grams on its own
and then the whole graphics card weighs in at 2.075
kg making it a mammoth pretty much the same size as the
founders rtx 3090 which was pretty much the biggest graphics card
i have seen to date now they've got three 90 mm dual ball bearing fans
and on the middle of the fans they've got the logo that doesn't spin
with the fans themselves so that is a welcome addition not just for aesthetics
but also when i see these logos on these graphics cards when they start spinning
around it can look a little bit annoying so especially on a flagship graphics
card or a flagship model like the igame vulcan here now i am
wearing these white gloves and you're probably thinking why are you wearing
white gloves in a review of a graphics card Bryan that's because
this card comes included with these little gloves right here
and they include a vga support bracket which will fit in a variety of cases
because you can adjust it and then screw it into the back of the
gpu an extra two features on the inside of the card which is going to mount
inside your case is a usb type-c connector which
i'm told you can externally control things like the lcd screen and monitor
things from that port and there's an extra fan port if you are
into ln2 overclocking then the big difference on this card
versus a lot of other cards is this lcd screen right here now i was
actually at first going into this i was like okay
this is going to be some tacky lcd screen that's not going to do much
but after using it i was really pleasantly surprised in that you
can rotate it 90 degrees so if you're mounting it traditionally or if you're
vertically mounting it inside of a case the lcd screen is going to be useful in
that regard and what you can do with this lcd screen
is actually quite impressive you can monitor cpu temps loads as well
as gpu temps and loads fan speeds vram usage and you can split that to two
different screens which is my personal favorite especially
while you're gaming it can tell you if the gpu is being utilized at 100
which is generally what you're going to want with an rtx 3080
and another cool feature in the software itself is that you can rotate that
vertically on the display so if you're building in say a silverstone
ld03 which i have in the past your gpu will kind of be
going in a vertical sense but in a tall sense and so the lcd screen will still
be useful in that regard as well if you're looking
at it from a different way so very nice implementation and it's also
got a 60 fps refresh rate so it looks very smooth and it's also high res so
not tacky whatsoever and if you're in the market for a flagship gpu for
instance you want a strix or something like that
then this is going to give you something that the strix isn't going to give you
and going over the back of the card you've got your hdmi 2.1 out three
display port outs which is standard on the rtx 3080 but
above that you've got an introduction of a button and this
isn't going to launch anything don't worry
it's actually a dual bios switch where if you press it in
it'll turn on oc mode and so here's where we'll get into the 1080p
numbers and the 1440p numbers in the 4k numbers
where we can see that the oc mode here is going to juice a little bit more
power but it's actually going to give you a
little boost on your rtx 3080 which is actually more significant than
other oc models that i've seen come through here
in that also in the future if you're running games
and they potentially crash or whatnot then you can quickly just turn the
computer off take this button off and then you'll be
back to normal mode but for what it's worth i tested out the
oc mode here and it was a hundred percent stable
even doing the rtx benchmarks the ray tracing benchmarks so
i usually have had not much luck when it comes to
overclocking and ray tracing but this card right here handled it
with ease and just continuing through the rest of the benchmarks here
sorry there is a lot to get through because i just like to be
thorough in the tests and know that if i'm recommending this card
to you guys you're getting the full picture like quite literally and that's
what you are getting with the oc mode and turned off it's
going to perform similar to pretty much all the other rtx 3080s
that have come through here so very useful overclocking mode here
but you will be juicing more power when it comes from the wall
now one thing i like to do with rtx 3080s
and i'll probably be saying this in every rtx 3000 review that comes through
here is i like to under vault so under volte
on this thing definitely gets us a better efficiency curve or a much
better efficiency curve overclocking it does start to juice
more power than is desirable both out of the box settings and a custom oc but
here's where i went with a custom oc and i got some big gains and these were
quite impressive to the point where they were beating
that of the tough oc that came through here
ever so slightly and then we went on to the fan noises and temperatures
they were also very impressive so i was surprised to see that colorful
especially with this model right here the vulcan they mean
business and they mean it in a lot of different ways
not only with this massive cooler design but the noise is kept
well under control and out of the box i actually preferred the out of the box
settings with the fan profiles something that a lot of companies i
noticed are definitely paying attention to as the balance between noise and
temps so you will want to leave this just out
of the box even on oc mode it'll give you the best sort of
noise versus temperatures even for longevity purposes
though continuing on you will want to get a power supply with more than a dual
pca output and in this case this will need
three pca eight pins and then in terms of
measurements this is quite a big card i'll put the measurements up on the
screen here for you so if you do want to mount this
here are the dimensions just be careful this thing is not only very heavy
but it's also very big and with all that out of the way
it's conclusion time this is where i'm going to just drop my thoughts on the
table and to be frank with you guys this is
where the gloves coming off i've got to say that i'm very impressed
with what they've done with this card right here
i used to know colorful like even four or five years ago
as being a company that sort of just made these real banger type gpus
but this right here is a strix alternative and in ways i feel like it
could even be better with a very useful implementation of an
lcd screen that is not tacky it just really works
fine now in terms of rgb there is a little
bit of rgb on the cooler and on the back plate if
anything this is going to sound so weird but i wish they kind of put rgb
around the rings of the fans that would have just made this card
absolutely perfect in my opinion i think it would have just been
i would have just been dancing here going yep
that's it they've just done everything so i would like to see a little bit more
rgb i know that sounds a bit weird but i think if you're vertically mounting this
which you will definitely want to with the lcd screen
i think that extra rgb would have completed the card
now in terms of the software great job great implementation of the software it
works tremendously well the lcd screen works really well the
cooling performance the noise the temps the build quality everything's
phenomenal on this card colorful mean business and they really
want to take business away from a zeus gigabyte and
all the other competitors out there and with a model like this this is their
flagship air cooling model i believe they've also got a water cooling model
coming out but if you're interested in paying i believe
it's the extra hundred dollars msrp over 6.99 so 7.99 for this
and in australia i believe it's going to come in roughly maybe 150 aussie dollars
over those 12.99 cards if you're interested in getting something that
is pretty much going to be like a strix but have a little bit more
then this is going to be the card for you i was really impressed another thing
as well when i pulled the cooler off i looked at the vrm solution they're
giving you 23 phases directly to the gpu itself
and then there's another six phases on top so 29 phases in total
on this gpu so they really have gone from the ground up
to make sure that they've got a gpu that works phenomenally well
so very impressive job also i'm going to say from here on in
if you see this thing in my main rig then do not be surprised
it is just that good but something like this really impressive
really good job and if it's in stock and it's the right price
then this card is definitely going to impress and you've got all these cool
little features like gloves and you've got the lcd screen the vga
bracket support system and also got to say from here on in is
that colorful very good job i'm definitely going to be
keeping my eyes out on this company and seeing what they
release in the next few months anyway guys that about does it for
today's review also if you're interested in the capacitors
of at the back of the gpu they're using the four big
two uh little sectors in the middle this is the same as the founders edition
and if you have any questions or comments then be sure to drop
that down below and i'll get back to you as soon as i can
and with that aside i'll catch you in another tech video very soon just after
this question of the day here which comes from the last shippy and
they ask what flavor of tea are you drinking and
so for me personally i like to drink in the morning i've got a
little routine going where i'll drink a earl grey with honey and
cinnamon and then i will drink after that two
cups of green tea so i have three cups of tea in the morning
i mean it might be a bit excessive but i love my tea so it usually
alternates between earl grey in the morning first thing in the morning is
all gray then followed by two green teas then
after lunchtime i don't drink any more green tea because it's got caffeine in
it caffeine keeps me up if i drink it past lunch time so that's
my tea drinking session right there it
alternates between earl grey and green tea
let us know in the description below too what tea are you drinking love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and i'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music]
bye
