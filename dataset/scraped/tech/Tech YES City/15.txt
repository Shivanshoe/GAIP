just recently amd announced the ryzen 7000 series cpus now these are slated to come out later this year in the fall but then the b650 motherboards that they also announced are slated to come out in october now i took a step back after watching this presentation i also listened to a few other people i wanted to hear what their thoughts and opinions were and this sort of announcement in itself even though the product hasn't come out yet it's definitely going to be a direction that enthusiast tech pc gaming is taking that i personally am not passionate about i'm losing interest as i see the trends that are going on within this industry so today's video i'm going to talk about these trends with you guys i'm also going to talk about what has happened in the last month for me personally in japan i've been able to just to take a step back and look at this whole situation through a different style of lens and it's actually refreshing but i can see what's going on with pc gaming the trends that have happened and also that are happening and i want to talk about them and where things need to change because if they don't change then essentially this industry at least from the side of what the hardware people like me and i know a lot of other people out there we're just going to lose interest because we know it's going in the wrong direction anyhow let's roll a sponsor spot for you guys and then we'll talk about this more in depth are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2. link's in description below welcome back to tech ass city and i've realized one thing and that is i have a huge love for price performance it doesn't matter whatever i do i want to get the best value possible even outside of use tech and coming to japan has made me realize that more than ever that my passion lies within price performance and it's actually funny because the japanese have a name for this and they call it costa park and what that means is basically price performance so there's even i guess this love for it in japan but going forward with my channel i really want to focus on giving you guys videos where we're looking at just the best value and maybe it might be outside of tech so i do want to hear your opinions on that and so with ryzen 7000 i'm going to spell it out to you guys how i see it and i don't know if you guys disagree or agree do let us know in the comments because this has really bothered me more than other launches and the reason it bothers me is because i feel like it's more focused on just the elite mob this time around as opposed to caring about the price performance guy or even the guy who wants to get an entry-level pc it feels like the x670 motherboards and they've even got the x670e they're all just targeted towards high end and even with the b650 motherboards they're only going to support ddr5 memory and so if you guys haven't checked the prices of ddr5 it's literally even in japan here over double the price of ddr4 and i think for someone building a new pc or especially for someone who is a gamer they can more than perfectly get huge fps out of ddr4 and in fact i'm still getting really good fps out of ddr3 and so after i saw the ddr5 exclusivity i started digging more into these cpus they're going to be on the new five nanometer process and they're also going to have a new input output die which all the cpus coming out are actually going to be apus and that they're going to have rdna 2 graphics on board every single cpu so what that means is you're going to be paying for that whether you like it or not and i know for a lot of people that buy gaming pcs they're buying the ryzen 5 3600 they're buying a dedicated graphics card or even if we look at the side of intel they've even got the f cpus which don't have that graphics portion on board and you can save your money if you don't want to get that or you don't need it then we look at the gaming benchmark demo and here's where they had the cpu running at 5.5 gigahertz which is a very impressive feat but then they said that they're giving you a 15 performance boost over the previous generation 5950x but then this got me thinking of how much of this performance boost is actually coming from the clock speeds themselves versus an ipc lift now i have heard from the street rumors and i can't say any names actually can't even show any pictures i've heard it's a two percent ipc lift and this is actually coming from the tweaking in the level two cache on the cpu itself and apparently a lot of the raw performance uplift you are seeing is from amd going to the 5 nanometer node and using that with the 7950x and they did show a blender demo where that was beating out the 12 900k by 30 percent in the final render times then the next argument brought up was just amd sandbagging they're going to be delivering much higher performance on ryzen 7000 than what they're showing in the presentation and looking at this from a standpoint of just analyzing everything outside of tech and just looking at the trends of the price versus the products launched recently i'm starting to see that amd kind of doesn't care and i'm talking about this in the sense of what happened with the rx 6500 xt and even though that's the radeon division they're still managed by the same amd umbrella and so what i saw with the 6500 xt was they just launched basically a product that was flawed and same with the rx 6400 they launched these products that were just flawed and they didn't see them to any reviewers and they essentially just wanted to get a product out there to make money so if we look before the gpu launch and we look at the cpu division then we see what happened with ryzen 5000 was a different launch to ryzen 3000 where everything on ryzen 3000 in my opinion was just one of the best cpu launchers in history they had the b450s and they had the x570s they had the options there then they had the cpu line they had the non-x cpus namely the ryzen 5 3600 and they had the 3600 x then when it came to the 5000 series there was no ryzen 5 5600 on launch there was just the 5600 x and so really you're paying hundred dollars more to get a six core 12 thread from amd with the ryzen 5000 series than you were on the ryzen 3000 series and so i feel like analyzing these two trends in itself shows where the company is going with the ryzen 7000 launch and that is higher prices now that they have obtained a lot of market share off intel and this is where people like i've said this in the past i've seen actually quite a few people say this as well they're just no different to intel and nvidia and so i hopefully at this stage people start to see this come through and if you're buying a product in the tech industry just buy it for what it is is it going to give you the best price performance or is it going to do something else that might be outside of price performance and you're really going to get that out of that new cpu so there it is with ryzen 7000 if we look at the ddr5 exclusivity and then look at the ddr5 pricing we can see that we're just losing the newcomers we're going to be losing the people who want to get into pc gaming on a budget we're just like pretty much ignoring that market and with that i'm very passionate about that user base i'm very passionate about that market and it feels like amd is just going to shun them off and definitely nvidia and amd together have done this on the gpu side with the rx 6400 the 6500 xt and even the rtx 3050 these cards there's no cards that are hitting under 200 that are actually good and are worth buying and so we've seen this new market where i'm not even looking at any new budget builds under 500 because they all suck and then if i look at other youtubers no one else is really making build the best new pc and no one's even if they are they're not passionate about it they're like all right guys i'm just building a pc because maybe some company sent me over some parts and i got to use them in a build and if that's the case that's fine but what i'm seeing is just a lack of passion and lack of sort of soul in this industry it's getting sucked out and it's actually making me a little bit down when i look at pc gaming in itself because my favorite years of doing all this was the years when you had the price performance just cracking absolutely banging on the new side and it was just banging on the used side as well together it was just absolutely amazing and i think that's where i was so happy and just loving being in enthusiast gaming pc tech and looking at this i just see the market going in this direction where it's just all expensive products and my guess would be that the actual logistics inside of the businesses make it so that they just want to sell high-end products now because think about it right if you've got a product for eight hundred dollars you only have to ship that once if you've got say four graphics cards at 200 each that's four products that have to get shipped and so i think the inflation has been eating at the lower end products a lot more than it's been eating at the higher end products and so that may be one reason why these companies are doing what they're doing but in the end they're going to be just losing a lot in total because people aren't just going to simply be able to afford these higher priced options that both amd and nvidia and even intel have to offer and what i'm seeing here in japan when i analyzed the markets just on the best-selling stuff before i made this video i can see that the nintendo switch that was selling for about 300 that's the number one seller here and then i also saw surprisingly the xbox series s in japan which xbox really isn't that popular in japan that's crawling up on the charts and coming in the top ten so it goes to show that people don't have this money to go out and spend two thousand dollars on a high-end gaming system and people like me who are passionate about making the best price performance know that if i go out and build a 6800 x 10 and 8 core 16 thread it's just really the you've got a 120 hertz monitor a 144 hertz monitor you're just not going to be getting your value for money in the whole chain of events and so i'm just really like i'm looking at this and i'm like am i the only one that feels this way about pc gaming anyhow guys i thought i'd take a step back and just talk to you guys heart to heart and let you know how i feel about the whole enthusiast tech space at the moment and i just i can't keep going forward making videos about things that i'm not passionate about and i think the whole reason i got into youtube in general was because i was so passionate about whatever it was i was doing and even if we look at this microphone right here like i'm talking into a 50 mic from the junk store and i absolutely love it like i've tuned this thing up i've spent a little bit of time on working this thing and hopefully it's giving out a really good sound but i i really sort of enjoy testing out all the price performance you can get and it feels like that's being sucked out of pc gaming completely at least not with the used sector but even getting a good deal on the used sector isn't as good as it used to be because so many people are going to use because the price of new stuff is just unbearable and so again back to the nintendo switch that's your benchmark and same with the xbox series s that's your benchmark of what a lot of people are prepared to pay in general for a gaming console or a gaming device and so i think pc gaming itself when we look at just a kit of ddr5 memory that's more expensive that can run you up more money than a whole device itself and so you just you look at that and you're like yeah this is this is just getting ridiculous anyway guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what do you think about everything we've discussed love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from john 3 20 and they ask wouldn't an rx 6400 be a better option instead for that price and so they're referring to our 980 ti gaming pc that we did and absolutely not the rx 6400 is just it's a slum of a gpu i mean amd nerfed the gpu within the gpu itself so before you even connect it to a device you've already got a hindered product that is prone to stuttering depending on the game so that's why i personally don't like the rx 6500 xt or the rx 6400 because you can't hook these gravis cards up to a gaming pc and expect it to run completely smooth and that's what i saw with apex legends one of the smoothest games that i had running on pretty much even ddr3 setups you name it whatever it was working fine but then you put the rx 6500 xt in and you put the settings up and it just starts stuttering it's actually a mess of a card and that's why i don't recommend it to people not just that too it doesn't have things like a hd encoder it was a real slap in the face to gamers put it this way i thought that was the rx 6400 i personally am not recommending it just because i feel like if companies start recommending gimped products then you're going to get a gaming experience and yes some dude decided to start up a angle grinder while we're recording this video but hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content be sure to hit that sub button ring the bell on the way out for perhaps some different content on the way anyhow guys peace out for now bye [Music] you
