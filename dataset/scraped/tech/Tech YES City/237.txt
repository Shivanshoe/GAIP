one thing that's probably crossed your mind is... a high-end gaming pc with the latest 6800 XT and rtx 3080 hitting the market they definitely offer a performance boost versus the previous generation cards and of course with the new zen 3 5000 series cpus out that is the Ryzen 9 5950X 16 core one must wonder how much power do you actually need to build this gaming pc well today we're going to help answer that question where deepcool sent us out a heap of their different stuff with their dq 850 watt power supply and they said look we want you to stress the living yes out of this power supply and i said to myself well sure and then they said look we'll sponsor the video too so today's video is sponsored however that being said if i do find some problems with this stuff sponsored video or not i'm still going to report it to you guys during this time but let's pull that proverbial tech genie out of the bottle and start building this high-end gaming rig [Music] and now that we've completed the build one thing we can do is go into the bios and here we're going to get a readout of our voltages which is pretty important if you say for instance a lot of people can just do this and easily check if they're running a very bad power supply if they're running something that's really good or something that's mediocre now these voltages here are very important these three the 12 volt the 5 volt and the 3.3 volt and the closer they are to that spec on the right here i guess the more well the better and more normalized your power supply is going to be so this 12 volt here we want this generally to be within 5 over or under so that would make it 11.4 volt or better or 12.6 volt and under so we can see here it's right on 12 pretty much only like a smidgen over 12. so it's running really well on the 12 volt line the 5 volt is 4.97 so that's coming very close to that spec as well and the 3.3 volt is again coming very close to the 3.3 number so this power supply is already giving out very close to the numbers that we want here now another thing as we can see here is with your cpu v-core voltage this is on ryzen specifically where it is running pretty high out of the box at 1.45 volt and it goes up and we see here 1.47 amd have said this isn't a problem because it's only a worry if your cpu is amping at these voltages in other words if you're at full load and your cpu was then consuming um 1.45 volt then it would be a problem so it's nothing to worry about if you see this according to amd this is nothing to worry about because it's not being amped at this voltage but first a quick little overclock here at 4.6 gigahertz on the 5950x with the memory locked in with 64 gigabytes at 3600 megahertz which this motherboard is actually with this cpu is taking it so that's very good news if especially if you're a video editor and now the second test for checking out this power supply is where we'll get onto the third zoom where we're just going to load it up with a heap of different power consumption but this test right here is just on the gpu because what we're doing with the rtx 3080 is we're checking if the ripple suppression is good or not and what we can do here is load it up with a benchmark called thirmark which is what we've got up on the screen and since the rtx 3080 has the unique ability to monitor input voltage we can then sort of use that as a budget way instead of going out and spending thousands on oscilloscopes we can use this as a budget way to see how much ripple we have on our 12 volt line and from our benchmarking here we can see the highest peak we've got around 11.875 volt and then to our lowest point is around 11.85 and so that's around a 25 millivolt variance which is okay it's actually really good and i have seen around 10 millivolts that's sort of like the best in the industry at the moment though i guess at its price point which is coming in at around 189 aussie dollars in america i think it's around 120 is looking like the ripple's actually pretty solid for the money considering it's also a modular power supply too so these numbers have checked out and also the numbers that we checked in the bios just to check that our rails were running at the right voltage spec we're also checking out two so what we're going to do now however is load up this gpu and cinebench and then put the two together and see how much we can load from the wall to stress test on this power supply to see if it holds up we now have fermark loaded up and our gpu the good news is our gpu is around 100 power consumption here which is what i was hoping for because usually when you load up a cpu heavy benchmark and then a gpu heavy one you don't actually hit a hundred percent perfectly on both but the gpu is hovering near 100 cpu's gone pretty hard as well and we're juicing uh nearly 800 watts from the wall and this is from a single cpu and a single gpu so it's actually quite good that we're doing this on air especially since we're testing out the 850 watt power supply since nvidia does recommend you use a 750 watt but i don't think they'd see someone like me just overclocking the living crap out of their cpu and gpu at the same time to try and max a power supply on two i guess really strenuous benchmarks because fermark is one of the most power hungry benchmarks you can run on a gpu and r23 is the latest cinebench which does use some of the latest instruction sets to really stress test your cpu and see here the cpu is going to around 93 degrees and the gpu is going to max 69 degrees magical number of course with 69. so what we're going to do now however this is with the side panel off so we're going to check if these cl 500 cases from deep cool are any good and what we've got here is three fans on outtake three fans on intake with the 360 mil rad and we're going to see if we put the side panel on are these temperatures going to go up from 69 and 93 respectively any higher or are they going to potentially go down which i have seen in some rare instances with cases with very strong orientations towards high airflow and after running these benchmarks now with the side panel on there's actually some really good news for this case i'll be flabbergasted that is that we went to 90.5 degrees maximum so 1.8 degrees cooler with the side panel on and then for the gpu that remained at 69 degrees so there was no change there so what this means is that this case has the proper channels if the fans are good enough and what we've put in this case though there is credit where credit's due and that is the mf120 gt fans that we've got here so we've got three included with the castle 360 x which is the water cooler we're using and then we've got an additional three pack which we've put two up the top and one at the side here so we have three mf 120s intake three mf 120s outtake and it's holding up well though it is getting a little bit noisy with the side panel on versus off it does drop the decibels about one decibel so it is still pretty noisy but do keep in mind this is running around 800 watts of heat it is quite a lot of power to push through a pc if anything i'd be trying to go the other way and undervolt the rtx 3080 to see if i can sweet spot both these out and have a daily driver that uses a lot less power and with that we'll have not only cool attempts but also have quieter noise though one more test that you guys have requested that i do is world of warcraft shadow lands for some reason people like yo shadow lands let's see what the results are and so we're going to leave the overclocks on the gpu we're going to leave the overclocks on the cpu but we're going to jump into shadow lens and put up real-time monitoring of temperatures of cpu and gpu as well as checking the power consumption from the wall while we're playing this game at 4k resolution scale i don't really see what fps we get but to see how the i guess fermark and cinebench scenario is a bit unrealistic when it comes to real world gaming and there we have it with world of warcraft we set this even though we're playing at 1080p we set it to 4k in terms of the resolution scale whereas at 200 percent max settings at a scale of the slider we pulled that all the way to 10 msaa 2x and we still had near 200 fps this game maxes out at 200 fps we're getting in the new shadow lands update in this main area we were just hovering above like 150 the whole time and when i was testing this for the 6800 xt review i was in another area that actually wasn't shadow lens and that was getting a little bit less fps so it seems like if you guys are into world of warcraft you're going to get the same experience in terms of graphics out of the new expansion as you have out of pretty much every uh world of warcraft that's been released beforehand since frozen throne so that's my opinion there i mean the game's gonna run absolutely fine another thing is too is that you've got a maximum power draw of 515 watts with an overclocked aorus 3080 and an overclocked 5950x while playing this game so the power consumption when you're playing games it goes down a lot compared to that test that we threw at this system beforehand where it's pretty much perfectly maxing the gpu and the cpu in perfect harmony with unrealistic instruction sets that would go together that sort of puts on this real heavy strain but it's good for testing out temperatures max loads and also especially in this case the power supply where the 850 watt dq handled things absolutely fine now in terms of this whole build cost here this one's really expensive it's coming over just over 3000 usd and in terms of the australian cost it's coming in around 4 800 aussie dollars so if you want something that's pretty much going to be the best of the best as it stands for not just gaming but also productivity since we threw in 64 gigabytes of dominated memory i think if you're going to go with a 5950x you're definitely going to go for the 16 core 32 threads and so when you go for that productivity play it's always good to have 64 gigabytes of ram for instance if i only have 32 gigabytes of ram i get all sorts of crashing and errors in premiere pro when i'm editing 4k content 64gb seems to alleviate that so it is definitely something to consider if you're doing this for workstation and sort of gaming secondary then this is definitely going to be something that may be worth your while considering especially if the time is going to save you money in the long run though in terms of the other components especially the ones deepcool sent out because they really wanted me to take a look at it run it through the paces i was actually really impressed with the cl500 and the mf 120 mil fans those mf-120s they could pull and push a lot of air and this case when we put the side panel on with that huge airflow that would actually drop the temperatures of the cpu so that was really impressive to see i was actually expecting it to rise a little bit which i've seen a lot of cases around this price point ever so even though they've got good airflow they do raise the temperatures ever so slightly so really good job in the terms of this design on this case whether the aesthetic is for you or not i think it's a different kind of space age look but i really am digging two things about this case and that is the magnetic sides where they've got a really tough tension as well so they're not going to fall off if you're just casually carrying this case around but if you are transporting it long distances i would take the side panels off first and then just cut the pc around because if the side panel falls off the glass one and that drops then that's going to be a big mess though another thing is too it's got the gpu support bracket which will hold up and stop your gpu from sagging as we saw with this aorus 3080 this thing is huge it's a mammoth tank times like three if you guys ever played the old commanding conkers you got the mammoth tanks this thing is like three of them in your case because you've got three fans and this thing like holds the card up so over time you're not going to get that sag and that undesirable aesthetic and i guess if you're going to go spend this amount of money on a pc it's little things like that that do make a difference so cl500 impressive the mf-120s they're going for a different look but the most important thing is the airflow's really good on those fans and then it came to the 360 ex that cpu cooler is sort of like run-of-the-mill it's doing a pretty good job it can handle the 5950x at 4.6 gigahertz though it didn't do anything to wow me or impress me as opposed to the case and the mf-120s and then of course the dq-850 that's coming in with a really good price performance price tag considering we put it through what we put it through today and it's modular it's got the gold rating for efficiency and another thing they wanted me to mention is that if you're in australia you can get this with a 20 discount at mwave for a two week period i think it makes this power supply around 169 aussie dollars and that's including gst so if you're in australia and you want a really good power supply to power your high-end rtx 30 80 30 90 or 6800 xt or whole build and you want to overclock then this power supply is going to do a really good job of doing that so i'll put some links in the description below for you guys if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button if you've got any questions about things we did in today's video be sure to drop a comment down below too and with that aside we have our question of the day which comes from jeff zest and they ask it's in relation to 4k monitors they ask benq 3270u or this and they're talking about the vue sonic vp 32-inch and i've tested out both of these they're 10-bit panels and i'm guessing jeff knows what he wants when he's asking about these monitors because they're really geared up towards video editing because they're both calibrated out of the factory which means that they've got accurate colors and they're good to go straight for video and photo editing now in terms of either one of these i would just get whichever one's cheapest where you are at locally that's always when i'm when i see products and they're coming so close to one another i usually just recommend grabbing whichever is going to save you the most money because there's not going to you're just going to be thinking about these differences you're going to go go back and forth go back and forth which should i pick which should i get and that time wasted could be time that's spent productive elsewhere to make up the difference anyway so between these two monitors there's not much of a difference at all they're both really good for video editing and photo editing get whichever one's cheapest hope that answers your question if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] oh
