so at least in a few places around the
world it looks like prices of pc parts are returning
back to normal, however you're probably thinking...
NEW ddr4 memory? YES please. New 240 gigabyte ssd? YES please.
new ryzen 5 3600 yes please New 2070 super? YES please,
and a used hard drive? No thank you? Well i'm here to change your mind with a
bit of a different type of build that is we're going to be mixing used and new
parts together so you can get pretty much a brand new
build but you can save around 100 on this
build and still get something with a good
power supply good case and of course a good cpu and gpu
to give you excellent gaming performance but the use components we're using in
today's build we've got here a one terabyte hard drive
now i picked this up for 26 aussie dollars
in a deals hunt and that's coming in under half the price now the good thing
about this hard drive is when i purchased it it had a two year warranty
so i'm really only poised to save money which of course is a good thing and then
this power supply here this came in and i got this on a deal for 20 aussie
dollars and power supplies especially one of this caliber
would easily cost around four times the price here in australia
and when i put it through a power supply tester it checked out absolutely fine
showing some really good signals then the last used component we're using in
today's build is this case right here it's a used
silver stone case with three rgb fans at the front and
it's pretty much in like new condition but
i got it for 70 aussie dollars which is around half the price that it goes for
brand new so those three components combined here
in australia i'm saving around 150 aussie dollars
just like that and with that aside i'll give you guys a quick tally
of today's build we'll quickly put it together start tuning it
and then we'll compare the 2070 super on this pc
versus say something with a z490 and 10 900k
to see how much value you are getting out of the ryzen 5 3600 build
that we're doing here today though of course you guys want to see the finished
product let's get you the finished product
[Music] yeah that's right you tell me in the
comments that their soldering skills haven't improved
since the last time we met [Music] no more pain no more worries
got no more time for loving you [Music] and now we're here with the finished
product the tech yes soldering skills you guys have been uh
critiquing me previously but then skills are getting better and
better by the day i mean if i didn't fall asleep at school
when they had soldering classes i might have not had to learn in my older
days but hey that aside this case right here we
had the problem of the person who sold it to me didn't include
the connector going into the led controller so
yeah that's where the soldering came into place where i had to make my own
wire and then connect it directly from the
power supply but that aside everything now is working
absolutely fine we've got this pc booting up we can change the colors
of the build by just clicking the led button and
besides that i mean the build looks like it's got good airflow it's
a huge case bigger than i expected and all for 70 aussie dollars i think
this thing retailed at 200 aussie dollars so
silverstone where have you been my whole life
well actually since 2016 because that's when this case was released
i don't know if it's for sale anymore but again when you're dealing with used
parts that's one of the beauties of dealing with the used market is you
come into some of these things like this that are really cool and
they're cool because they're not just really
good price performance but they're also just an absolute
looker in terms of putting your build together anyway enough rambling aside
we're gonna finally tune this pc up and then run some games wow oh so we now got the games all set up and
ready to go but just before we get into our games we want to go into
the bios right here and we do that by hitting
delete and f2 when we start up our computer
but when we're in this bus right here we just go down to advanced memory settings
and on different pcs it might be a different menu up the top but
you just search around until you find extreme memory
profile and we just uh click enter on our keyboard
and then we hit enter on our profile right here
and that'll lock in the x and p profiles which is super important
for ryzen cpus to get that extra performance well
it's kind of it's really important nowadays on any cpu
when you're playing games so after that we just go
save and exit setup and we're now good to boot those games up
and start getting some fps [Music] it's a root interruption so we're just finishing up the final
benchmark on this pc right here what i'm doing is i'm testing the gpu
temperatures with the side panel on versus off
that's going to tell us how good the airflow is
on this silverstone second hand case that we picked up right here but
so far the fps is looking incredible i mean this is why we're playing a game
the noise is extremely low and we're getting over 140 fps
it's about 150 in 1080p warzone at high settings we got that
also similar numbers in tom clancy's division
two we're getting 144 fps at high settings and we also got 118
average fps in shadow of the tomb raider high so this thing is geared up towards
high settings high refresh rate gaming and i've actually got to quickly move
now to get in the gas zone so i don't
lose the round because i want to do a full round so i can test the
gpu temperatures and it's like oh hey how you doing there i'm untouchable
but yeah continuing on uh but what we can see here is the
oh that's a rude interruption so what we can see here with this case
is that it's keeping the temperatures on the gpu below 70 degrees which when
the gpu is at 100 under 100 degrees that is really nice so
the case is doing its good job but also the cooler on this rtx
2070 super is also pretty good as well i don't get a chance so what we're seeing here with this case
is that it's keeping the temperatures of the gpu
under 70 degrees which also how you're doing there it's a good thing
so the first round is finished with the tempered glass side panel on it's scored
70 degrees celsius and we're going to take this side panel
off now and basically if the temperatures are lower on the gpu
that means the case could use some improvements but if the temperatures are
a little bit higher or the same it means silverstone have designed an
absolute winner here and i probably got more than i bargained
for at 70 aussie dollars i mean three 140 mil fans at the
front and one 140 mil fan at the back i just wish i knew about
this case sooner this is the first time i've ever seen one
i'm going to be low key with you guys here i kind of want to
sell my main rig and make this my main rig but then
i won't have 64 gigabytes of ram anymore so i won't be able to edit videos
anymore and you just won't see me that'll be the
end of tech yes city as we know it all because of this
silverstone prime mirror case right here i think it's called a
primera you ready let's go
[Music] and after whacking this system on our 10
900k there was some really good news and that
was first off we'll start off with the best news
tom clancy's a division two scored the same average fps at 144.
then we moved over to tomb raider that was getting an extra 15 fps
and then we moved over to warzone and that was scoring an extra
20 or so odd fps and here's the thing the ryzen 5 3600
can be had for under 200 comes with a cooler
and then we use this on a budget entry level b450 motherboard
with some budget 3000 megahertz memory now keep in mind i did use the same
memory on the 10900k and the power consumption was the same
at around 330 watts so what we're ultimately seeing with
this build here today is the power of used and new synergy
and so what i'm predicting and this is probably the start of a trend here at
tech yes city for what i'm going to be doing going
forward that is i'm going to be mixing a lot of
used and new parts together because i feel like the prices of new components
especially cpus for example are coming down to really good price
points and with gpus you may not want to go out and build
something like this where you've got the rtx 3000 series
coming up very soon but that being said if you can pick up a
2070 super 2060 super at a really good price on sale which in
australia these cards are going on sale with ebay is 20 off so
if you can get really good deals on the new stuff don't be afraid to look around
in the used market where there's just going to be awesome
deals to be had because i found recently there's a lot of used pcs
coming up for sale and of course some people just want to
upgrade their cases they want to upgrade to a thousand watt power supply
and you can pick up some really good deals like we did here with this case
now i actually researched this case out and
it appears that it was around 200 aussie dollars and i got it for 70 aussie
dollars and it's pretty much in like new
condition the person took really good care of it all i had to do
was give it a data vac and alcohol wipe it down
and it pretty much looks like brand new again so i'm getting under
half price for a case that has one of the coolest aesthetics
i've seen in a long time and honestly i am surprised that i have not seen this
case earlier because i was blown away by not
just the build quality but also the paint job
that they've done on this they've used some real high quality paint
and it really shows when you're building it and then of course you probably even
see it on the b-roll but then those 140 mil fans they're
super quiet like i'm right next to this case right now and it's on and
it's just whisper quiet and the temperatures are pretty good too we've
got the tempered glass and whatnot but one thing
about this case in particular i think it's called the primera pm01
is it's a massive case like it's bigger than i thought it would be when i first
saw this listing on good old gametree i was like okay this is going to be a
normal standard atx size case and what it's worth it's getting closer
to a full-sized atx tower than a mid tower and mid towers are
pretty much going to be the majority of atx cases
out there so very big case very good build quality
very good performance i'm just surprised i haven't really heard or seen this case
beforehand and of course the saddest thing being this thing is not for sale
on the new market anymore but i'm glad i picked this up because
again like we said in the intro it's just really cool
to buy used parts and get an experience that i never thought was possible in the
realm of pc building the ultimate when it comes down to it if
you're in the market for a new pc don't be afraid to go with some used
components especially if you just quickly check on your local listing
site whether it's gumtree or craigslist or something like that
and you see a bargain pop up especially for something like a case
where you can go out check it out if it looks good then you can purchase it
with a power supply though i will say do be pretty careful
and definitely get proof of say a hard drive as well
get proof of those parts working before you purchase them because
if anything i don't want you guys out there in the audience
to get hosed and i've been hosed in the past before
actually quite a few times and it's one of the worst feelings ever
and the sad thing is even nowadays you can get hosed on new parts
so you've got to be careful with that too so i'll put a link to a video up
here about what to be careful of when buying
using new parts and with that aside i hope you guys
enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us
also if you want some links to some of the stuff we've used in today's video
then i'll put some links in the description below
and with that aside do let us know in the comment section below
what you think of this big silverstone primaria case right here anyway we've
got here the question of the day which comes from phone toys tv
and they asked sir can i install the raised prism
on my ryzen 3200 goc any suggestion and the answer that is certainly yes if
you've got a wraith prism it's an am4 mount
the 3200 g is an am4 socket cpu apu and you can mount that in the
socket and put the am4 cooler on so basically any
cpu or apu that fits am4 you can use an aim for cooler for it so compatibility
is definitely there in terms of overclocking the 3200 g the
wraith prism will do an absolutely fine job it's actually suited
for even the likes of a 3900 x 12 core so getting the most out of
your 3200g on a wraith prism should be no problems hope that answers
that question and if you guys have stayed
this far and you're enjoying that content and you want to see the moment
it drops be sure to hit that sub button ring that
bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye [Music]
