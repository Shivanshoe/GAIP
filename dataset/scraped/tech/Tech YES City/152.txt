as may 2021 approaches the end this 
can only mean one thing and that is   the used pc parts hunt of the month where this 
month it's going to be a focus on just the best   deals period it doesn't matter if it's a graphics 
card it doesn't matter if it's a motherboard   or even a beautiful i3 as long as it's the right 
price i'm going to be putting in an offer so with   that said let's see what we can find on good old 
gamtree and facebook marketplace today's video   is brought to you by the asrock z590 tai chi 
with a dedicated 4 centimeter moss fan for low   temperatures on your vrm coupled with a dedicated 
gpu holder and pcie 4.0 for your m.2 drive   this thing has it all links in description below 
so going through good old gamtree straight up   we've got three potential deals where i'm actually 
waiting for all three of these people to message   us back but first of all is a rtx 2080 ti this is 
the aorus edition and they apparently they've got   a few screws missing on the back but they claim 
it works perfectly and i think maybe they've   tried to change the thermal paste once before 
and they lost the little screws but either way   1000 aussie dollars and i'll put the us pricing 
up here on the screen because if i get a gpu like   this i can couple it with that recent i9 laptop 
cpu and would have a really strong and powerful   high-end gaming pc but then next up we've got 
a 980 ti strix and i've offered them 280 cash   pickup waiting on them to get back to us on that 
one and then next up is an i7 desktop computer   they were asking apparently they've dropped it 
down to 320 from 350 and i just put an offer of   250. you never know so you can get a whole monitor 
keyboard mouse i7 pc 6700 and some ram ssd hard   drive it'd be a nice little combo to then couple 
with saying rx 570 and make a solid gaming pc   then moving over to facebook marketplace we then 
got yet another 2080 ti they're asking 1100 i've   put in an offer of a thousand flat so waiting 
on them to get back to us and then we've got a   ryzen 7 2700x and i put an offer of 200 aussie for 
that then there's also a 32 gigabyte kit of ddr4   corsair memory they're asking 150 i'm just trying 
to shave off a quick tenor then onto a combo with   a z370 tough gaming and an i7 8700 we put an offer 
of 280 on that then there's an a320 motherboard i   know i've already got a couple of these but if i 
can pick this up and i put an offer of 20 bucks   see if they take it hopefully no one else wants it 
an a320 for this price is a bargain in my opinion   and then the last two deals i think you guys 
will definitely like one of these and that is an   fx 6300 16 giga ram cooler master cooler and a 
motherboard and they want 90 but they say it's   completely untested so i'm thinking i'll go with 
a gamble i offer them 50 cash pickup waiting for   them to get back to us on that one then the last 
deal is 16 gigabytes of ddr4 they want 75 i've   come in at 50 bucks though the main thing with 
gravis cards i feel like they're still overpriced   and hopefully that is shadowing all the other 
stuff that people still want to clear out and sell   so there's our initial deal outlay we're also 
going to go catch up with les right now but i've   also got to do something else while i'm up that 
way anyhow so i'm making a bit of synergy work   as always but the main thing is this month i'm 
noticing that a lot of these other parts besides   graphics cards i think people just want to move 
them and since no one's really looking to build   a pc or buy a pc because the graphics cards are 
too expensive that now leaves these other parts   coming in at even better prices than i'm used to 
paying so i'm going to come and swoop that stuff   up especially since i got that large graphics card 
deal recently if you haven't seen that video i'll   put the link up here but let's finally go hit the 
road and see what deals we can get cracker-lacking huh   and we're cutting now straight to the next 
morning and it is well last night was bust   city in that we picked up the deals 
from less so we'll go over what we got   in terms of the stuff so we picked up uh four oem 
systems five monitors and uh two power supplies   and we got that for 525 aussie off les and 
then we picked up over here on a separate deal   we picked up a gtx 760 but we picked this one 
up on the road so i saw this up for 50 bucks   i messaged the guy i said i'll come pick it 
up now and we got that while we're out but   in terms of every deal that i got beforehand every 
deal that i put a message on before we uh left   to get this stuff none of the guys like literally 
no one messaged me back or i think one person   messaged me back and they wanted close to asking 
i think that was on the i7 desktop from gumtree   so it's a i'm going to call this episode this 
month it's going to be a stalemate because there's   a lot of stuff and i'm starting to see this even 
from this morning i've just woken up and i've   checked uh new listings and i've noticed that 
mining profitability is starting to drop a bit   and i'm starting to see a lot more cards come up 
more than usual there's rtx 3060s coming up now   and there's rtx 3070s coming up but this is 
getting to that stage where i think we're at that   level where some people like well i'll sell my 
card now so i can get as much for it but you know   i want to beat that rush because if everyone 
starts selling the cards then the prices will   come down so i think we're at that point right 
now point of inflection this is the point of   inflection and what's going to go on from here i'm 
actually very curious to see but that is not going   to stop us from continuing day two of the deals 
hunt but there's also some other good news so   besides boss city one guy did get back to us about 
the fx 6300 combo and he said he'd take 50 but he   lives on an island and i'm thinking to myself damn 
like i'm not going to catch a ferry across to an   island just to get an untested motherboard cpu ram 
and cooler so he said he'd post it for 15 bucks   and we agreed on that so we ended up picking up i 
guess one deal out of those pre-roll messages but   that can only leave one thing left over and 
that is to get back on gametree and facebook   marketplace and find those deals so starting off 
with good old gametree it was uneventful there   was a 6700 xt for a thousand i offered them 
900 they came back and said they're firm but   then moving over to facebook marketplace i found 
two deals and here's the thing i found two deals   here today and both people have messaged me back 
already accepting my offers so gtx 10 63 gigabyte   180 aussie dollars they wanted initially 200 
and they've accepted that offer then there was   a whole pc up for sale with no gravis card and 
so they want uh initially they looked like they   wanted 850 and they've dropped it down to 675. i 
offered 500 they came back at 600 and i said to   myself well 3700x that's not bad at all it's got 
a water cooler the case has got rgb bling gold   rated power supply b450 motherboard 16 gigabytes 
of ram i said sure let's do this up because all i   have to do then is put in a graphics card and 
pretty much add ssd in a hard drive and i got   myself an easy flip so that's two deals that we're 
gonna go pick up that is good news starting out   the day already but while on the road of course 
we're gonna try and find some more banger deals and here we are now back on day two and uh we 
ended up getting this deal so this was today's   haul and the other gtx 1063 gigabyte i was on the 
road and i'm messaging the guy i'm like yo can i   pick this thing up now man can i pick this thing 
up now just i got ghosted so fast so hopefully you   get back to me post out the gpu and then we'll 
have two post-it deals this month a pc and then   some les pickup specials but this one right here 
this is interesting for one reason because i think   the guy i mean he said something about oh i took 
the gpu out and sold it separately and i'm like   you know when i went in there you had all 
this like crypto stuff set off someone   you didn't sell the gpu server he just took 
the gpu out and started mining crypto and then   wanted to get rid of the pc but either way i 
don't really care because this here for 600 aussie   is really solid i mean where are you going 
to get a 3700 x 8 core 16 threaded ryzen b450   water cooler and it's even got some cool rgb bling 
over there and a 600 watt gold rated power supply   as well as six gigabytes of ram so i thought this 
was a solid deal for the money and all i have to   do is find a appropriate gpu like say for instance 
i pick up if i picked up one of those 2080 ti's   that would have been perfect but if i pick up 
something like that i can then whack that in   and i'll have a very solid uh easy flip on my 
hands in terms of a nice gaming pc i do have to   clean this up a little bit there's not much i 
mean it does look like it's been sitting here   with a little bit of dust they've obvious they've 
even left the peel on there which is awesome when   you're picking up anything means it just hasn't 
really been used so i was pretty happy with that   for 600 aussie but do let us know in the comments 
whether you guys think this is a good deal i mean   when i look for deals i just trust my gut and my 
gut was looking over this i'm like i offered a 500   initially and he went to 600 so he wanted to get 
rid of it he wanted to sell it and i'm thinking   myself 600 it's a solid buy it's not obviously the 
best deal you can get but adding all the parts up   in my head if i was to go out and build something 
like this i'd be paying around 900. off the top   of my head so my gut was like yeah looks like a 
solid deal let's go cop it and he showed me it all   up and running and working so that was a bonus as 
well and telling up this month's deal so far we   got the initial 525 we picked up four pcs five 
monitors two power supplies then we got that   gtx 760 that was fifty dollars and then we have 
today's pickup which was the six hundred dollar   cyber power pc minus the gpu and then there was 
also that sixty five dollars posted fx 63 combo   deal which was still going to wait on if it's good 
i'll let you guys know and you'll probably see it   on a budget build here on the channel but we've 
also got that gtx 1060 i'm not banking on that   so i'm not going to add that in the tally so far 
but i'll put the aussie dollars and also the us   dollar amounts up on the screen here for you guys 
you can check out all the deals do let us know in   the comment section below what was your favorite 
deal of this month and why so i love reading those   thoughts and opinions but let's look at something 
that i've been noticing this month while doing the   parts hunt it's actually two different trends 
noticing the first one is very weird to the   point where i've only seen this once before and 
it didn't last too long and that was when i was   uh deals hunting in 2018 right when crypto was 
going bust there was all the sudden that you could   see the gpu starting to come on the market now 
it's not indicative of that yet because mining's   still profitable but i've noticed in the last few 
days there's these rtx 3060s coming up and there's   a lot more of them coming up and they want around 
that thousand dollar price tag when you could   get these when they initially came out for around 
eight hundred dollars so the fact that they want   two hundred dollars more but then they're cutting 
their price down like fifty dollars or a hundred   dollars means they want to sell them there's 
some sort of desperation there and actually i've   seen other people discounting on just a lot of 
other pc parts as well they're discounting their   ads and this is the most frequent discounting 
rate i've seen on ads when i search for things   that i've ever seen when i've been searching on 
marketplace so what this means is that people   want to sell the stuff but they want more than the 
market is wanting to give them and so we're seeing   that difference now the basically if you were to 
trade some sort of items you would have a bid in   an ask spread so what happens there is that the 
bidders aren't willing to pay the askers price   and so naturally if they want to sell which 
they probably will want to they have to come   down to the bitters price but basically what 
this means in a nutshell is i think prices   will come down not just on graphics cards but on 
other stuff as well we could be seeing a massive   glut in the market in terms of people maybe just 
switching off tech right now they're not really   interested in building a pc because they go to 
check the prices of pc parts and they're like well   damn that's way too high i might just go buy a 
tv or something and uh watch uh movies instead   or watch people streaming so regardless the market 
always has its natural ways of sorting itself out   but the second thing i wanted to talk about now 
which relates back to that first part is that   if prices are coming down you will be able to 
get a really good bargain if the time is right   say for instance i noticed that someone in the 
title they said i need to sell this urgently   well the more time goes on and the more they 
can't sell that because they completely ignored me   at 200 but the more time goes on the more urgent 
they get then the more that price will come down   so basically in this environment if you are quick 
and there are sellers that need to sell something   off quickly then just like always you'll be able 
to get an absolute bargain but i've been noticing   since these people are hungry to sell their stuff 
and the discount rates are more than ever that   means that if you're patient but you're also very 
quick on the pulse you'll be able to land yourself   some really good deals in the next few 
months that's what i feel is coming up   so if you have been patient then i do 
feel that patience may soon be rewarded   as i have been hearing a lot behind the scenes of 
what is going on in the crypto market i know a lot   of guys are actually just completely getting out 
of crypto anyhow guys that's it for this month's   parts hunt of the month it is now may 2021 and 
man time is flying by especially when we got   this question of the day here it comes from ricky 
v and they ask what's next and this is a really   funny question it might surprise you guys with the 
answer and that is i actually don't even know what   the next video i'm making is going to be here on 
the channel i sort of just uh make it as it comes   because i feel like that's the most exciting thing 
i feel like people seem to think that like in this   world chaos is a bad thing but chaos i i think 
it's a beautiful thing in that if you don't know   what's going to happen then in ways it can be kind 
of exciting i mean imagine if your life was just   jotted out on a plan and you knew everything 
that was going to happen tomorrow the day after   the next week the next month and the next 10 years 
in ways i just feel like that whole element would   just bring a sense of just real boredom to your 
life and so i think chaos in one way can be very   exciting that's what i've done my whole life is 
just live day by day and sort of the most i'll   have planned out here on the channel will just 
be in the next week in terms of okay we've got   maybe some products been sent in or something 
or i've got these new these used parts here   that i picked up and i will make content based 
around that that i think people will enjoy so   in terms of what's next though to answer the 
question directly i'm thinking right now it'll   probably be a video on um fixing up some really 
weird problems as i've had a pc that's come back   four times now in the past three months and when 
the pc comes back four times and you've literally   changed the whole system then you know it's not 
anything on your end but something on the user's   end and it's this one this one will be a really 
good video on that i'll be touching on a few basic   problems as well things that can really make you 
pull your hair out but they can be really easy   to fix hope you guys will be looking forward 
to that one and with that aside i'll catch you   in another tech video very soon if you've stayed 
this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content   be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell 
and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye you
