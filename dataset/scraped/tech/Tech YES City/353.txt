this motherboard here is the z4 90 horas Pro ax now I think this is the best z4 90 motherboard coming out of gigabyte norris's whole lineup in the z4 90 stack and I've also tested the Auris master here as well as the gigabyte vision G and this one here the reason why I'm going to be picking it out of the other two motherboards against those is that it's the better value option I feel that it's loaded with features and it does a really good job of overclocking where it's coming in at a price point of 270 US dollars but then also in Australia it's coming in at 477 AUD so if you want I believe what is a top-tier board and handles of 5.2 gigahertz ten 900k overclock with doing so with pretty good efficiency levels then this would be the board to consider and the first reason for this is that they're using a 13 phase that's twelve plus one phase where twelve phases are dedicated towards the CPU and this is direct drive MOSFETs now when we tested out the ten 900k at 5.2 gigahertz this was scoring 264 watts which was actually coming close to that of the Z 494 Lawson 2 which I tested here on the channel as well as the MSI Zi 490 Meg ace and we've got a Z 490 comparison coming up we're going to round up all these boards in a video but these are some pretty good numbers as well as the temperatures themselves where we saw a maximum surface temperature of 85 degrees and then on the vrm readout in the software we saw 85 degrees as well and 63 degrees on the heatsink surface temperatures of course out of the box if you just want to run it at 4.9 gigahertz all cores on 10 cause this will juice it to around 197 watts anything over these levels you do start to lose a lot of efficiency with the ten nine hundred K but this board definitely makes up for a little bit of that using a very quality good vrm solution you've also got tantalum caps on board which is something that I do really like however with the heatsink design it weighs in at roughly 175 grams so it is a little bit lighter than the other solutions and that does leave the temperatures to go a little bit hotter than some of the other boards here but anything in my opinion under 90 degrees 20 4:7 is a good choice and they've done a good job of implementing that we've also got an eight plus four pin connectors up the top here but even for my testing here I'm only using a single 8 pin connector and we don't go anywhere near that because we've got thick gauge wiring on a HX 1,000 watt power supply so for the vrm they've got an excellent implementation here which is slightly more efficient and better than that of the Vision G but they've also included features on the back here like Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 they're moving through the onboard audio here we've got a frequency response curve that's pretty much completely flat - 2.3 decibel drop-off with 10 Hertz and under so again we'll power those mid-range cans absolutely fine with a pretty clear signal and in terms of crosstalk that was - 89 decibels which is excellent and then for noise suppression on the mic they do have this and it's very tricky because this is the first time I've noticed it's a what I would call active noise suppression I actually haven't seen this before this board where it's tricky to actually find out that it's using noise suppression where I only found out by plugging in my old Japanese 1980s vintage mic and you can see once you unplugged it it then had to readjust and in that time it was learning the noise profile and cancelling that out even while you talk the words so it is a better generation and reiteration of noise suppression but that being said it still is noise suppression so it will lower the quality of your voice by a little bit but the benefit of that is your friends you're gaming with online and people you're just talking to online are going to get a very clear voice coming through it's just in the quality of things noise suppression does take a frequency out there that will affect the quality of the voice recordings so the onboard audio checks out absolutely fine now moving through the BIOS this is another thing I like about this board in particular was that it was a good experience I couldn't fault anything from the baseline it's very simple to use overclocking was a breeze and there was no problems like I actually found on the vision G when I was checking out that BIOS so they've implemented a more stable BIOS at this time around with the Auris pro a and also in the bias itself you've got the smartphone utility which can tune each of the total eight PWM fan headers and their speeds now that being said I would like to see RGB control within the bias itself and you've also got a five and twelve volt RGB headers down the bottom and up the top four four in total they're running through the PCIe slots we've got three 16x slots where the top one is actually only the true 16x and then the one below that 8 X and then the one at the bottom four X and then the two in-between One X slots are also there and in terms of m2 connectivity we've got three M 2 X 4 slots though the top one is reserved for PCA for then the bottom two a PCA 3.0 and testing out the speeds and temperatures they were absolutely fine and we saw a maximum temperature of 51 degrees so they're doing a good job on the heatsink implementation there they move through the back of the board here we've got the Wi-Fi 6 connection point with its own included standalone antenna 10 USB ports in total one of those being a USB 3 point to type C and it also got a 2.5 g NIC you've also got a single HDMI 1.4 out and no ps2 port but manual 5.1 surround out and an optical out for your audio and after all that it's time to segue into a conclusion for you guys where this board has it all the vrm solutions really good the feature set Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5 and also the heatsink design is a fin type design so if you want to even go crazy on the overclocks you can put a fan on that and it will respond well the BIOS is also really stable on this particular motherboard and testing out ddr4 40 400 megahertz memory worked absolutely fine as well as the over clocks on the 10 900k working absolutely fine too then we've got the clean black as saying this is another thing that I'm personally digging about this board is that it's just got such a nice look to it and I think it's gonna go well with any type of build that you're doing and of course who can forget about a little bit of RGB which you've got on the left-hand side both the top and bottom so flipping the board around now I really like this one for that premium value if that's kind of going to be a segment I think for me personally that would be a segment because you're getting everything out of this board that you would want on the premium range but you're going away with things like a fancy back plate on the rear of the board and saving costs and so I like the fact they've included tantalum caps the bias responds really well to overclocking you've got really good onboard audio 2.5 g Nick all this other stuff that is feature packed and it doesn't break the bank too much 270 USD that can handle their mainstream flagship CPU overclock to the brink is a really good feat but in terms of its efficiency as well it's also coming close to that of the Z 490 PG velocity' which when I first took a look at that I was really impressed with that - I'll put a link to that review up here but in terms of the Z 490 comparison this one is definitely gonna be near the top of the list I can tell you that now before we even go into that comparison and I do like this board against the vision G and also the Auris master which I've already tested both of those here in the studio so this one is the one to get from gigabyte it's got the hardware it's got the feature set but they've also done a good job this time around with the BIOS and how they've implemented the stability and that's about it for today's review if you guys enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button for us or should I say Oris and also let us know in the comments section below that was a bad joke wasn't it and anyway let us know in the comment section below what you think of the aesthetic what you think of the results for this board and also what you think of a price point in terms of a motherboard what are you looking for if you go with budget or premium love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from raw Denine and they asked 1.5 volt how did it not fry and they referring to the previous vision G review that we did where that was taking the motherboard to really crazy voltages now one thing is well with z4 naiti do not overclock the CPU and leave the voltages on auto in the past I've seen different motherboards handle this all but in general z4 90s are really just going crazy with the auto voltages and so it will take it to crazy levels and basically the reason why it doesn't fry is because I identify straight away whenever you test out any CPU out of the box always get a baseline with the power consumption it's using so the for instance the 10 900k that's using around 190 to 200 watts at 4.9 Giga it's all core so there's your baseline now if you got to 5.2 gigahertz and suddenly like some of these bullets they're drawing 350 watts you know that that's just a stupid amount of extra wattage for really little performance gain so you know straight away okay I've got to chain this down I got to take things down and I got to turn off the stress test straightaway otherwise you could risk frying your CPU and that's how simple it is so basically always get that baseline and then go from there so around 260 watts is where it goes for 5.2 Giga it's all core that's a pretty fair level it's pretty much topping out at that and I won't go any real that much higher especially for 24/7 use and that pretty much does it for today's video if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content and you want to see it the moment it drops then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch it in another tech video very soon peace out for now be [Music]
