graphics card prices are in a bit of a weird 
predicament now where they're not as bad as   they were a few months ago but they still suck 
and in this case if you're in the market to   build a gaming pc or of course if you've got 
a pc that just has a really crappy gravis card   say for instance a gt710 then you may be looking 
also to upgrade to something with a little bit   more power however at the moment in this wild 
market i believe there are some graphics cards   especially if you're just looking the 
game that offer better value for money   than other graphics cards so let's take a 
little look and i'll give you guys some tips   on buying a used gpu and still even though it's 
a pretty bad market for buying grabs cards you'll   still be able to get some good value for money hey 
bro are you tired of seeing this annoying activate   windows message then if so today's video sponsor 
scd keys has you covered for as little as 14   using the coupon code bftyc you can get 
activated today works for windows 11 pro 2   links in description below so over the last couple 
of days i've been analyzing the market because   i have a used parts hunt coming up later 
in the month where i'm mainly looking for   you guessed it use graphics cards so i like to see 
what is going to be the best value for money so if   i put together a gaming pc then someone who buys 
it is going to be happy for the price performance   that they're paying so this leads us to the first 
round of graphics cards that i'm going to be   recommending and that is going to fall into the 
category of essentially what i would call power   inefficient graphics cards for crypto miners 
since the crypto miners are mainly targeting   newer graphics cards that are much more efficient 
than the older gravis cards this leaves the older   graphics cards in a position where pretty much 
the only people buying them are gamers so take for   instance this graphics card in my hand even though 
the heatsink is a little bit bent on the end   i picked this up for an absolute bargain this is 
a gtx 760. now if you look for gtx 7 series cards   i've noticed that gtx 770 and also a gtx 780 and 
a 750 ti there can be some pretty good deals of a   hundred dollars and under for these types of cards 
even just quickly looking through the market on   ebay.com today i found three different listings 
where from the photos the card looked decent and   the description said the graphics cards work and 
of course the price was looking pretty good take   for instance this gtx 750 ti they're asking 70 
for it however as you may or may not know 70   at least two years ago wasn't a great price for 
a gtx 750 ti on the used market it's about 30   over what i was willing to pay back two years 
ago however that being said if you guys have   been following my used parts hunt you'll notice 
that i've been paying around 20 to 30 percent   more than what i usually pay for gravis cards 
and that is essentially what the extra demand   from cryptocurrency miners have placed on the 
graphics card market itself that is an artificial   higher pricing because there's much more demand 
than just from gamers and so at this point you   may be sitting in your chair and you're like well 
brian if crypto currency miners don't really want   the gtx 7 series cards then why are the prices 
still over inflated compared to what they used   to be and there are two reasons one of the reasons 
we're not going to discuss in this video because   i've talked about it quite a lot but another 
reason is because the gamers that otherwise   aren't willing to pay say for instance a 500 price 
tag on an rx 6600 xt which is already inflated   over its 379 dollar msrp price they pretty much 
quit trying to buy those newer cards and then they   look for something cheaper because the people who 
are willing to pay the money at msrp for new cards   are essentially being priced out of those newer 
cards and then they're looking for other options   that exist in the market so our first option that 
i've presented today is gtx 7 series cuts i'll put   all the links in the description below for some 
searches that you guys can do on ebay as well as   local listings however that being said there are 
some drawbacks to each of these series of cards   that i'm going to be recommending here today first 
off with the gtx 7 series is that nvidia is ending   driver support for these graphics cards that means 
if there's a new game that say fortnite 2.0 and   it's everyone's playing it and it doesn't have the 
driver support from nvidia the game may not get   optimal performance and in fact you may get things 
like stuttering or just generally low performance   if a newer game was to be released and you bought 
one of these older graphics cards the second risk   factor with the gtx 7 series of course is its 
age it's quite simply an older card however   in general before we move on and this is going 
to apply to all the used graphs cards that i'm   recommending in today's video is there's two major 
things that i look out for when buying used grass   cards the first is oxidization aka rust if there's 
a heavy amount of oxidization on a gravis card i   usually steer clear of that card especially if the 
seller is asking around market rates for the card   the second thing is i always make sure that the 
graphics card can boot up to windows and install   the drivers for instance there's a listing on 
ebay where the person says that the graphics   card boots to bios however in my experience with 
a card like this even though it can boot to bios   if you install windows and then you install 
the drivers there may be a chance that the   card is actually faulty and after you install 
the drivers you get met with a black screen so   if you're buying any used graphics card i'd first 
of all look at the graphics card itself and that   is is it looking like it's in decent condition 
aka not a whole lot of rust on the thing and   also secondly does it boot to windows and can it 
install the drivers that being said if you do buy   a graphics card off ebay for example you do get 
a very short term and effective warranty policy   where if the card comes in and it doesn't work 
properly at least if they say that it is working   in the description it says it's a working used 
product you can generally get your money back   if you get the product and it doesn't work pretty 
much instantly now let's move on now to the next   round of graphics cards that i'm seeing some very 
good value for money come up at least compared to   the new york prices and that is cards like the 
r9 280. i've seen these cards coming up on ebay   for even under a hundred dollars now these cards 
have a three gigabyte vram buffer that's going   to be absolutely fine for playing a lot of those 
popular multiplayer titles at 1080p for instance   i've been playing a bit of apex legends lately and 
i'm really enjoying it and a card like an r9 280   will do a great job of playing this game and 
giving you a smooth experience at 1080p however   the caveats for the r9 200 series and even cards 
like the r9 380 and 390 the drawback for these is   that just like the gtx 7 series amd has announced 
that they drop support for these cards so if you   do come into a newer released again fortnite 
2.0 style game that is new to the market   then amd won't be releasing support for these 
older graphics cards even though they should   technically work fine it's just they won't be 
getting the performance enhancements that the   newer graphics cards will receive in other words 
if you're playing those newer titles you won't get   as good value for money out of your gravis card as 
buying something that's new that said though the   newer graphics cards aren't really looking like 
they're good value for money right now so even   if you found yourself in that position it would 
probably still equal out in your favor however   just going through some of the listings here on 
ebay again that hundred dollar and under price   point you can definitely pick up some decent price 
cards on the market especially if you're looking   to build a sub three or four hundred dollar 
gaming pc then this is the most critical element   right there and it's available and ready to 
ship the next line of gravis cards i'm going   to draw attention to is something like an rx 470 4 
gigabyte now if you're looking for the 8 gigabyte   cards especially when it comes to an rx 580 or an 
rx470 these miners their cryptocurrency miners are   just going to snap those cards up straight away 
because they're still very profitable for mining   what's known as ethereum and even though there 
are other alt coins out there that are profitable   most cryptocurrency miners that are serious about 
putting a lot of money into cryptocurrency mining   are definitely looking at the ethereum profits 
because that is the main player in town when it   comes to mining and also mining profitability that 
being said though the rx 474 gigabyte and even   if you look for something like an rx 5500 xt 4 
gigabyte these graphics cards at least in the pure   essence from miners they're not as targeted as 
they would be by the people looking for the eight   gigabyte cards so your four gigabytes and under 
gravis cards at least when you're getting into the   newer cards even though these cards are still 
a few years old you can still pick up here or   there if you're quick enough a good deal on some 
of these graphics cards though going back to the   nvidia side of things there are a few more cards 
that i do look for although i'm finding i'm not   having as much success as the older cards at 
least when it comes to value for money though   that being said i'm always on the lookout for a 
gtx 970 or a gtx 980. these cards can still give   out really good performance for the dollar and 
you can pick them up on the used market for what   i consider a pretty decent price for instance in 
australia i can pick up one of these cards locally   from time to time at gtx 970 for 150 even though 
previously i was paying around 120 dollars for one   also looking at the gtx 10 series when it comes to 
that i'm looking heavily at gtx 1050 ti's and gtx   1050s four gigabyte and two gigabyte cards as they 
remain under that four gigabyte buffer but also   their crypto mining performance isn't that great 
which means i can snag them up and put together   gaming pcs for pretty good prices but there's also 
the gtx 1063 gigabyte however i have been finding   that a few people at least cryptocurrency 
miners are targeting believe it or not   the gtx 1063 gigabyte whenever they see these up 
for a decent price they go snag them up and then   start mining what is known as altcoins so quickly 
summing things up as it stands with the market   especially the used gpu market and if you're 
looking to build a gaming pc your best bet right   now at least to get the best price performance or 
the best frame for your dollar is to buy the more   inefficient cards that burn up a bit more power 
and have lower vram sizes mainly four gigabytes   and under as these cards are really not worth it 
for miners where they have to put them on a system   and pay for expensive power supplies and as they 
add up all those costs those older cards that are   more inefficient just don't make any sense to 
them they're the final thing to talk about in   the land of graphics cards and the reason why i 
think a lot of frustration is starting to seep in   at least when it comes to pc gaming that exists 
this time that actually didn't exist in 2017   and 2018 when there was the previous crypto boom 
is that nvidia and amd are simply not releasing   lower budget cards that were represented really 
good price performance and these were the graphics   cards that the majority of gamers were buying if 
we look at the steam surveys the gtx 1060 is still   the most popular dedicated graphics card used by 
gamers and so what this meant was that cards that   came in around 200 and under and they offered 
really good price performance were the cards   that gamers wanted to snap up and put in their 
gaming rigs and unfortunately when we look in 2021   what amd and nvidia are doing they're just simply 
not releasing any successes to the gtx 1060 or the   rx-580 i mean amd did release the rx 5500 xt the 4 
gigabyte and the 8 gigabyte which had msrps of 200   and under but i simply did not see hardly any 
stock of these cards sold in australia i'm not   too sure about europe and also america but the rx 
5500 xt it only offered slightly more performance   than the rx 570 and 580. if we go over to nvidia's 
side of the cam the gtx 1660 super and also the   gtx 1650 super these were cards that were released 
now nearly two years ago and they were offering a   bump up in performance over the 1050 and also the 
1060 respectively however we get to see nvidia at   least put these cards back on the market in bulk 
or release a successor to them and i think that   right there is why not only the higher end market 
for rx 6700 xts and rtx 3070 are experiencing bad   pricing from crypto miners but there's also this 
massive demand from gamers that has always been   there and nvidia and amd are not providing the 
supply on the lower end anyhow guys do let us   know what you think of today's video if you want 
to get some gravis cards at decent prices i'll put   some of my searches in the description below but 
also we do have intel with their arc announcement   if you guys want a dedicated video on that and 
perhaps we can mix the uh ways to get a decent   price on a new graphics card in one video i 
can make that happen for you and as always   love reading your thoughts and opinions just like 
this question of the day here and this comes from   jason frederick and they ask how do the fans 
survive the bath without removing the lube   in the bearings and they're referring to our 
recent episode of pc ultra clean i'll put the   link to that video up here where we give these 
parts a massive clean from start to finish but the   main star of the show is the ultrasonic cleaner 
which i just pretty much dip into hot tap water   with detergent and the ultrasonic cleaner does 
the rest and in the process technically if there's   things like lube in fans they should come out but 
every time i've cleaned fans in this ultrasonic   cleaner the fans have been fine afterwards which 
means to me that the seals are holding up very   well in these fans however in the past i have come 
into noisy fans and it depends on the noise if   it's like a new gravis card and it's got a little 
bit of a noise on it sometimes i'll just put some   multi-purpose spray on there grease it up a little 
bit but if it's a little bit of a heavier knock   on the fan i'll just use some of this degreaser 
and this stuff's a little bit thicker than wd-40   or multi-purpose spray and then that usually the 
noise goes away after that so that's what i do   personally i just haven't come into any knocking 
fans after i've washed them surprisingly actually   now i think about it probably is a little bit 
surprising but i guess it's a testament to all the   fans that have gone through the ultrasonic cleaner 
and that they haven't broken their seals for the   lubrication hope that answers that question and 
with that aside if you guys have stayed this far   and you're enjoying that tech yes content be 
sure to hit that sub button ring that bell   to get the content as soon as it drops here and 
i'll see you next time peace out for now bye you
