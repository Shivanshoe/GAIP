If you have been looking for a gaming pc recently 
you may have noticed that the prices to buy a   gaming pc are just ridiculously high right now, 
especially if you want to build say an rtx 3000 pc   then you may even have to sell a body part in 
order to obtain one of those gaming pcs but don't   worry in today's video we're not going to be doing 
any of that we're going to be building a pc for   under 200. that's not only easy to put together 
but also the parts are readily available on the   used market and even the new market in the case 
of the gt 1030. now this gpu here is not going to   give you ultra gaming performance but what it is 
going to do is still give you a decent experience   at 720p or 1080p and another good thing about this 
card is that cryptocurrency miners are simply not   targeting this graphics card at all because it 
won't make them the profits and it's not worth   the time for them to invest in something like this 
which means that it's relatively well priced for   what it is on the market so let's take a look at 
what other parts we're going to put inside this pc   and then of course we'll quickly put it together 
and see how well it performs hey bro are you tired   of seeing this annoying activate windows message 
then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you   covered for as little as fourteen dollars using 
the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today   works for windows 11 pro 2. links in description 
below so before we get on to building this pc   there's three other components besides the gt 1030 
that we're going to need the first is this right   here and i'd call this the star of the show this 
is a small form factor hp 8300 third generation   system it has an i5 3470 eight gigabytes of ram 
however we got this for 50 and it didn't include   any drives so we will have to add our own drives 
which we're going to be using a 120 gigabyte ssd   you can get these for around 20 even brand new 
if you're looking for one used you may be able to   get it cheaper then we've got a 500 gigabyte hard 
drive i picked this up off the used market for 10   so the price tally that we paid for these parts 
i'll put them up on the screen as well as put some   links in the description below but building this 
thing is really easy so first of all we just take   off this side panel and then we have to install 
the graphics card however you may notice that   out of the box we have a bracket that is longer 
than what will fit in this pc and that's because   it's a small form factor pc so there's actually a 
different bracket that we need to quickly install   on our graphics card now i've got the zeus 
model here for the gt 1030 but if you're   buying these off the used market just make sure 
they include the small form factor bracket or ak   the low profile bracket and so the one 
that we got here from the store we got this   from a local store here for about 90 dollars 
brand new and it did include this bracket from   the get-go we then took the normal bracket 
off and installed the low profile bracket   and then it slotted into the pc absolutely 
fine now it's time to install our drives and   i like to use for this since some of these pcs 
can be a little bit complicated in installing   the drives i personally like to use double 
sided tape it makes the job hassle free   and just very quick and easy to install then after 
applying the double-sided tape on both the ssd   and the hard drive i like to in this particular hp 
case right here i like to put the hard drive where   it originally was and then put it upside down 
actually and then mount it to the metal bracket   with the double-sided tape and then for the ssd 
i actually found just under the power supply   was a nice location and then i've reused 
the solder power and the sata data cable   from the cd-rom drive and we've relocated 
that to the ssd and so we don't have to add   any additional cables or power cables we don't 
even need any thermal paste in case of this   build right here since it is an i5 iv bridge it 
didn't use much power to begin with even back in   the day let's give this thing a quick clean down 
install windows and then see how it performs in me and you games and me was a dream 
at first i got lost in your world   in your universe i never thought i messed up made it worse pushed you away   all that fight and it paid till you left 
one day wish i could take back all those and i things that you miss me too so let's get 
over our issues and go back to me bless you i it know knows you let's go back i can't believe i'm a mess i'm a 
wreck when i see your face and i know that you're   feeling exactly the same but stop pretending we 
should stay apart tried to meet someone new but   they can't compare and i know that i'm feeling a 
bit unfair but you're the only one that's in my heart i know perfect but i think 
it's worth it nobody knows you and there it is with the under 200 pc some 
people may be laughing at something like   this but i was enjoying playing games on this 
thing and the fps was really good at 1080p   dota 2 i had it on medium settings with maximum 
screen res the picture looked pretty good and   the fps was actually really good where i was 
getting near close to a hundred and twenty and   i did benchmark this for the entire game that 
i played on a turbo match five versus five with   one of my favorite heroes sam king and it was 
actually quite an intense game and it ended up   being a victory for your boy but then we move over 
to cs go and this was giving out pretty good fps   again around that 120 range seems to be a sweet 
spot for this gt 1030 at 1080p and the i5 3470   was also delivering and able to match the frames 
with this gpu even on the lower settings so   we had a blend of high and low settings and that 
seemed to max the gpu and cs go then moving over   to fortnite same thing with 1080p but this time 
we chose to play on what's called competitive   settings where they put all the settings to low 
100 screen res but then the epic view distance   and we're getting over 60 fps most the times and 
it was a smooth experience you'd definitely be   able to find out if you've got the skills on 
something even as cheap as this pc right here   and then the final game we tested out was valorant 
i'm finding valorant does give very similar fps to   that of cs go we had this on low settings at 1080p 
and we're getting around 120 fps again but i did   find with valerian it was a bit more of a smoother 
experience in terms of the 1 and 0.1 lows than cs   go was so if you're undecided on which of the two 
games to play then i'd say that valoran is perhaps   even more slightly budget friendly in terms of 
the hardware that you can use to play the game   though with those four games aside we had the 
power consumption another good factor with   this pc where we didn't even break 100 watts we 
were getting from the wall around about 75 watts   while we're playing games so very low on power 
consumption if you need to save money and on your   power bill for instance and this thing's going to 
do a great job of doing that so the budget costs   on the machine itself does match very closely with 
the ongoing costs and i was just overall pretty   impressed with this machine especially since as we 
said in the intro a lot of the other pcs out there   if you want to get the fancy rgb lights and then 
an rtx 3000 series grabs guard you're just going   to be simply paying for it in this current market 
though with all that out of the way i hope you   guys enjoyed today's budget gaming pc that we put 
together here if you did then be sure to hit that   like button also if you have any questions about 
today's build then be sure to drop a question   in the comment section below and i'll get back 
to you as soon as i can just like this question   of the day here which comes from taimur and they 
ask i am wondering what brian does with those hp   elites transplanting into gaming cases so this 
case right here this pc you can transplant them   into a rgb case if you wish to it does require a 
bit of extra work and in some cases it might not   fit in bigger cases so usually for the transplants 
i picked the micro atx cases with the power supply   module or opening area up the top of the case 
and then you can just change all the hardware   put it in a better case even use the same power 
supply because some of the hp systems and also   some of these oem systems they use proprietary 
connectors so if you're going to go out and do   this transplant make sure you do a little bit 
of research before you do that but in case of   what i'm doing with them i'm mainly using these 
ones here for budget gaming pcs and also office   pcs and also the other i7 pcs that i picked up in 
the parts i'm going to put the link up here for   you guys i'm going to be using some of those i7s 
for an rgb transplant into a gaming pc so i do a   lot of different things with the parts that i get 
in here hope that answers that question and if you   guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that 
tech yes content then you know what to do hit that   sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you on 
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
