is the rtx 3060 ti from galax worth it you're probably wondering that especially if you've clicked on this video from search and these cards i find the funny thing about galax is they don't post enough cards to north america where in australia these cards regularly come up in stock and the good thing about this brand is that they're constantly hitting around msrp so in australia the 3060 ti i was told was coming in at 688 aussie dollars i managed to find two of these on a sale for 699 aussie dollars so i managed to snag up these cards and i wanted to test them and see how they compared against the founders edition where straight away the cooling performance of this card is extremely impressive i was actually surprised that this was an msrp car because a lot of the msrp cars that i've tested especially on the 3080 line they've come around with just mediocre temps mediocre noise this thing here was i'll pull up the temperatures straight away was scoring extremely good at 28 degrees c ambient temps now delta adjusting this which i usually test or i like to delta adjust to 23c ambient this was bringing it down to 63 degrees ambient and the noise on top of that was also phenomenally low and so out of the box it went to around 47 percent fan speeds and this was at 34 decibels so setting a custom fan profile and upping the fans higher especially if you want to overclock the card is definitely going to be worth it they're taking the card to 80 and even 100 fan speeds did start to bring the noise up to considerably loud levels so the cooling performance checks out and they've even included rgb which you can control via software on the two 100 mil fans and on the side of the card it's also got a metal back plate and going through the dimensions here i'll pull them up on a screen for you that's if you want to mount this in a mini rtx case it does come in over the two slot region on the depth and the card weighs in a tad under one kilo though how does it compare against the 3060 ti and other graphics cards let's start rolling the benchmarks for you guys it's for you guys for you guys let's start rolling the benchmarks for you guys for you guys guys guys guys guys let's start rolling the benchmarks rolling the benchmarks rolling the benchmark for you guys guys guys [Music] guys guys guys guys i'll even throw in some ray tracing numbers to see that this card is doing okay i mean if you want to play for instance cyberpunk 2077 you can do that with ray tracing turned on i prefer the medium settings 16 anisiotropic filtering and then turning on ray tracing on medium with the reflections i find the shadows isn't really worth it at least in terms of my personal visual though definitely if you want to get something that will give you a really nice experience in cyberpunk 2077 which i've been saying this to everyone that i speak to has got the same opinion the storyline in cyberpunk is extremely good it's one of those games at least since boulder's gate 3 that i jumped into and i'm just really enjoying not just the story but also the game mechanics and all the different choices and customizations you can do with the characters themselves especially when it comes to the perks now of course if you want to undervolt these cards you can do that quite easily but one thing for me personally with the 360 ti it's pretty much the only card coming out on the new series of cards this year that i would overclock on and this model here being particularly impressive with the temperatures and noise i would definitely think about overclocking this thing and then getting close to rtx 3070 like performance however there is some good news related to that and that of course is those temperatures we looked at before but the power consumption is also extremely good on this card that was for outputs we've got one hdmi 2.1 and then three display ports supporting up to 360 hertz at 1080p of course if you want to go with a 4k oled you can get 4k 120 hertz so summing things up with the galax 3060 ti ex this guide here is doing that galax formula which over the last few years i have grown to like quite a bit especially if you're looking for value for money and that is offering a card around msrp but does have the rgb bling it does have the cooling performance it does have the low noise and of course this one here is quite a big model so if you buy this you're definitely going to be happy with your purchase at least down under in australia coming in as one of the cheapest cards on the market now it does require a single eight pin connector and it doesn't utilize that nvidia 12 pin this one right here needing that single eight pin does do a good job and doesn't need any more power requirements because it's a very efficient card out of the box and to top all that off if you buy this card you get a three year warranty at least down under which does make it even better or more appealing option than previously thought so good job from galax this is a solid card bringing in solid price performance if you guys enjoyed today's review then be sure to hit that like button for us if you have any questions or comments be sure to drop that comment down below and i'll be sure to have a gander just like the back of this box which got ganderized while i was opening it and this question of the day which comes from christian lopez and they ask i'm not getting close to your fps on the 3080 i get around 50 fps with the custom settings does the vram matter in this game with ray tracing this is referring to our cyberpunk 2077 video where we took a look at all the different quality settings and i think the 38 is going to be a little bit slower than 30 90. it's not going to be that much if i'm getting 55 fps for example you can expect to get around maybe 50 45 to 50 with a 30 80. this is like the ray tracing turned on and all that at 4k with uh custom settings but the vram the 10 gigabytes of vram won't make a difference versus the 24 in cyberpunk at 4k the reason being is because we did some tests and we found it was only using about seven gigabytes of vram at 4k hopefully that answers that question if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring wait we'll do that again that bell and i'll catch you on another tech video very soon peace out for now bye how does it compare against the 30 60 ti and other graphics cards let's start rolling the benchmarks for you guys you guys for you guys
