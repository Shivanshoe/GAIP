you guys were asking for some more behind the scenes footage and today i'm gonna go fix up a pc apparently might have a broken motherboard sold it a few months ago but we'll go check that out and i've got to go pick up some cases as well some rgb cases because all that stuff i got in the parts on got to start building out some gaming pcs and there's also someone else that wants me to check out their 1080 ti that apparently could be broken as well so it's not always smooth sailing when it comes to selling gaming pcs you gotta go fix up some problems sometimes so let's go see what the road has to show [Music] [Applause] [Music] so that problem ended up being a lot easier than i thought and one way you can tell what the problem is is by looking at the i guess the whole pc plugged up to whatever it's plugged up to so if you're turning on a pc and it's cycling the windows but there's no signal and the mouse and keyboard are lighting up and you know the gpu is good then usually it's another problem outside of the pc and that's what i did initially i turned the power button off and then it takes a few seconds to cycle down which means it went to windows and it was able to shut down fine anyway i took it out i reseated the cpu because i just wanted to make it look like it was a hardware problem and what it actually was was i think just on the back of their monitor they had their xbox plugged up and all they needed to do was hit the input source button and uh and then that changed it over to the display port and i was like okay cool but uh anyway that's not a problem that's one problem down it ended up costing nothing which is the best outcome but from here on in we're gonna go collect those cases but i'm also going to talk to the guy i'm getting the cases from about gpu prices a little bit see what the market's like and see what prices he can do for me as well it's always just one of those curiosity things when you're out on the road [Music] and we have now fast forward a week later during a vlog and i got a haircut things are a bit different i've gotta actually get something ready really soon so this pc right here uh it was the age of empires four pc we did yesterday but they were like look i want a nvidia graphics card and so they ask for options what can you do for me so yeah we've got that one ready to flip very soon so we're going to get about 800 aussie dollars for that and so that's what i mean when i put the prices out on the video because i think people yes they're like i can't get these prices for these parts and a lot of people can't get a lot of these prices especially online because the ease of buying online has become more and more in demand and so that's one thing if you look at the hustle right locally you're going to get better deals even now than you ever did in the past because a lot more people are online looking for stuff so even though you look at the ebay prices you've got to try and get those deals locally because it's going to be so much better it's getting such a big difference to the point where i don't even look on ebay for used parts i used to actually scroll through and look for a lot of motherboards a lot of gpus uh you know cpus as well you could sometimes find some bargains but i pretty much go online now just to buy xeon stuff and some of that sort of other stuff that's not mainstream but in terms of the gpus especially getting local deals is gonna be so much better and uh this pc right here it's a flip it's gonna happen very soon and then we've got right here two builds that i gotta quickly whip up one is gonna be a just h55 gtx 570 pc and this thing believe it or not people some people just want a gaming pc to play uh what is it roblox i think it's roblox and so they don't really care as long as they can get it for a real cheap price so some of this stuff here it's like those off deals that you get thrown in with the bigger deals and then that can help um it just it just helps so that's one thing to never overlook when you're buying bulk if you can get some of this stuff for really cheap which in the case of the gtx 570 it was thrown in with those uh hd 7970s when i did that full when i found that new supplier and so i can now utilize that and it works i've tested it out works absolutely fine this one here is a 7970 i'm going to put together with an i5 7 500 16gb of ddr4 so that'll be a little bit more expensive but they're two builds i've just mapped out i've got to whip them up and uh right behind that is the big boy this thing right here is apparently australian exclusive and got this for 99 aussie dollars so if you guys are looking for an alternative finally to the data vac well this thing is actually not just an alternative it has so much more power than the data vac it's probably almost twice as powerful as the data back it's it's actually pretty crazy so that one i'm just giving it a whirl right now and seeing if if it saves me time and it doesn't damage any parts then i'll keep it around so that's sort of like what i do behind the scenes is i'll trial things out and if they work then i can potentially make a video on this unit right here but one thing i will say about this unit right here is i do have to wear earmuffs when i'm using it it is pretty loud so that's i guess one drawback but it does feel like it's actually better built than the datavac also i was talking about before we switched fast forward a week there was someone i was going to go see about a gtx 1080 ti and then they were busy that night and then sometimes you just like there's a miss and then there's another miss followed by another miss and so i'm gonna finally get around to that and just go visit them today and see what's wrong with their 1080 ti document it for you guys as well because this is just everyday problems that happen and so i like to address that stuff as well so there's also another problem that happened which we'll talk about very soon but let's get one problem done then we'll talk about the next one which has to do with the monitor and so it has to do with warranty too because a lot of people actually ask us about warranty so that's an interesting thing that we can talk about but it's also in the morning and i gotta have a shower but before i have a shower i'm gonna hit a quick tech yes workout wake up sleepy wide awake [Music] so i just finished up at that person's house with the gtx 1080 ti and i kind of went into it when they told me the symptoms starting out i went in kind of having an idea of what it would have been and my guess was right on it was a essentially they got a 1080 ti off marketplace and it's used but then it started crashing in superposition so superposition you can set it to 1080p extreme for example and it puts a very heavy load on the gpu so it was crashing in that benchmark but it wasn't crashing in the unigene heaven benchmark i thought that was interesting because that tells you the graphics card is pretty much teetering on the line of its uh out of the box default speeds not working properly so when i downloaded afterburner i straight away drop the memory speeds down and then i that that fixed it as soon as that happened it fixed the gravis card it was working fine but of course going inwards since you cannot update a nvidia gravis card with a flash you have to pretty much manage those default settings so what you do then is uh you have to install afterburner and have it run as the pc boots up and pretty much for the rest of the life of the card so he decided that he's going to put that 1080p on his main rig and then keep on doing other stuff but i got rewarded for doing that and for helping that person out i ended up getting rewarded with some goodies some used bangers and i got a gtx 960 i got a uh a couple of like i3 4th gen builds with crap in it and then there's also another build in there i think it was like a first or a second gen and then i got some also some old potato graphics card as well so that's what you do man you just help people out and they'll help you out in return so he's very grateful that his uh 700 aussie uh 1080 ti didn't end up being a complete hose job so he's really grateful for that anyhow guys we're gonna get back to the tech yes studio and then build up those pcs so we just got back now and we've finished off two builds we're gonna immediately put one of those up for sale because my kind of rule of thumb is i always like to have a gaming pc up for sale and that way of course you can get interest and keep flipping now warranty is an interesting thing a few people ask me about this in the comments from time to time and i've actually had uh one case as we saw at the start of the video and then yesterday someone uh messaged me about a monitor having a bad spot on it and this is where if you guys are selling pcs especially gaming pcs always if it's a local deal people coming to check it out you show them the gaming pc make sure it's up and running before you sell it but also show them the gaming pc up and running so that if they go do something to that pc then it's kind of on them like in the case of the monitor that was a perfectly working monitor it came out of here with no issues and they must have damaged it on the way back to their house or dropped it or something like that and then one of the patches is blown out on the leds and so when it comes to guaranteeing that i'm just going to be like well that's sort of like out of warranty right natural occurring warranty sort of issues happen when uh say for instance pc doesn't start anymore or something happens and a part goes faulty the most common for me is actually faulty memory followed by a faulty motherboard so that's how it usually goes in that order faulty gpus if that's within warranty then that's a real that one sucks the most because you have to replace the graphics card that can be at this point in time it's really tedious so make sure you if you're doing those gaming pcs make sure the graphics card you're putting in there one way to check as we've talked about in previous videos is you just open up msi after the burner you can quickly check how much headroom that gpu has if it's got a little bit of headroom it's usually fine so if it's got like if you just up the slider 10 megahertz on either core clock or memory for instance and it's like artifacting and stuff like that then uh perhaps that gpu is close to its end anyhow so there's a lot of different things involved but the most important thing you can do is circle back to that making a gaming pc that works and then showing that it works before it leaves and then of course if something does naturally happen one of those faulty occurrences that isn't the person's fault then you just replace that and that's sort of part of doing business but in this case uh the first problem ended up being user error which in that case i'm happy to go help the first time but if they keep sort of making mistakes another very common one is someone will go and pretty much install a heap of crap and make the windows corrupt and then you've got to go and reinstall windows for them so usually i give if it's their fault and it's just a user error i usually fix it up the first time for free but then if they keep doing that stuff then you'll be like well i have to charge you for my time because this isn't my fault it's not the computer's fault it's not the parts fault but then you do come across parts that do become faulty from time to time but usually you run those stress tests before you sell the pc and you check for that and it's actually a very small chance that parts do go faulty and gaming pcs and the funny thing i find about used parts is a lot of the older stuff was made with a lot of good componentry on it so it usually has a very long life installed for a lot of these used parts anyhow guys with that aside hope you enjoyed today's behind the scenes vlog i guess kind of the stuff that no one really talks about in the tech scene but it's kind of stuff that a lot of us do do especially if you are selling gaming pcs and also you guys said in the comments you want to see more of this behind the scenes stuff so definitely happy to deliver content that you guys want to see so with that aside hope you enjoyed this one please hit that like button if you did and also if you stayed this far hit the sub button and ring that bell but we've also got the question of the day here which comes from compact23 and they asked do my eyes deceive me am i saying the best bang for the buck tech yes man finally back in our time of need so that uh yesterday's video with the age of empires for gaming pc that was i looked back at it after i edited the video out i'm like yeah this is really good value for money and then i looked on ebay after i'd uploaded the video at the prices of the 7970s and stuff and that's sort of like when i look at that and i get back and circle back to the local deals it's kind of like the contrast is getting massive so if you are in a good area with pc parts use pc parts scene definitely stay on that and try and get those deals and you can make up good gaming pcs you can service your local market they can save money on their gaming pcs you make a bit of profit in the process everybody's happy when this happens but those ebay prices man they're pretty scary for some of those parts so definitely going to be sticking more local than i ever have and uh hoping that more of those deals come up anyhow guys i'll keep you posted in the meantime i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
