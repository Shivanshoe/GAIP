welcome to the used pc parts hunt of the month i feel like this month i'm going to be heading into the graphics card abyss where graphics card prices are still high but i desperately need some used gpus to put into builds now i pretty much have everything else in the studio here i've got a lot of used hard drives i've got ssds i've got power supplies motherboards cpus coolers and even cases but i don't have many graphics cards i'm actually very desperate for these so welcome back to the november 2021 used pc part time of the month and i've already managed to look for a heap of different graphics card deals and we've already got two confirmed we've got an r9 270 and we're gonna pick that up for 60 aussie dollars and also put up the usd pricing on the screen for you and i've also managed to find an r7 260 and that's for 40 aussie dollars so we've hit two budget gpus i'm also working out a third deal on an r9 290 where they're asking 210 but i put in an offer of 150 so hopefully we get it for 150 it's actually not too bad of a deal but then we've also got rtx 3060s i found a few of those there's one that i put an offer on for 700 aussie so hopefully they get back to us and they accept that then there's also a few other deals on gpus that i will report back on if the people get back to me but in terms of i7s and searching for ryzen and some other stuff seems like it's a little bit dry in that market as well but of course let's go hit the road and go pick up these deals and then as we're picking up the deals i'll keep you guys updated on what other pc parts i can pick up so let's go find those bargains and put on those used price performance capes because things are about to heat up if you've just built a gaming pc and you're getting this annoying windows needs activation message even on windows 11 then today's video sponsor can get rid of that message quick and easily for as little as 12 using the coupon code bftyc you can save 35 in the month of november links in description below [Music] so we just finished up at lez's place and if you guys didn't know les he is a staple here at tech yes city i usually go and see him every month just because he's usually like his place is in the center of close to where all my deals usually are the ones that i've teed up and so i usually go see him first just wait for a few messages to come back in and he ended up actually having three gravis cards and they're all two gig models so i believe we've got a gt 730 a gtx 750 and also a gt 1030. now i know they're not much but they will still be like entry level in the case of the 750 and the 10 30 entry-level gaming pcs and we got that for 80 for the three cards so that's a pretty good deal in itself and actually i was going to now pick up the r9 r93 270 so i'm gonna go pick up that right now but then i was looking at because the r 7 260 that was close to me and i looked i relooked at the ad because i just thought it was a two gigabyte and it ended up being a one gigabyte card so i'm just i just said to the guy sorry i'm just i misread it i'm just not interested um because one gigabyte cards they're just extremely hard to use and all the monitors that i pick up that i usually do in sets and if i'm selling a gaming pc i'll usually do like a combo with a monitor keyboard and a mouse they're all 1080p monitors and a one gigabyte card just is not doing 1080p gaming even in like easy to play games so i'd rather get the two gigabyte cards because at least they'll give someone a decent experience in some of those easy to play games at 1080p so i kind of just pulled a pin on that one i mean what would i then pay for a one gigabyte card well i mean people give them away so like when i'm dumpster diving or if i'm doing bigger deals people usually just give away one gigabyte card so to me they're kind of worthless if i was to pay money for one to be like ten dollars maybe even then so one gigabyte card's just not on the radar but do let us know in the comments what do you guys think about one gigabyte vram video cards do you agree with this or do you have a different opinion let's go get that radeon gpu and then also see who's messaged us back so we just ended up picking up this r9 270 it actually ended up being an x version so they're a little bit faster kind of like the 78 70 was to the 78 50 and we also ended up getting it for 50 dollars too so i had 70 on me and i asked the guy if he had a 10 a change he's like i don't have a tenant change just give us 50 bucks so sometimes that's just how it goes down but we're gonna go now and pick up the next deal but i have had a lot of people get back to me on some of the higher end stuff like the rtx 3060 i put down an offer on an rx 6600 and none of these guys are budging at all and so really puts their used 30 60s close to that of pretty much retail prices so i mean if you're going to pay that kind of money for a gravis guard you might as well get it from a shop with the brand new warranty so yeah kind of like no deals on the higher end stuff but the lower end stuff we're definitely starting to uh get some pretty good deals here [Music] so i've just picked up this i7 4770 an h81m motherboard and a single 8 gigabyte stick of memory for 80 now when i was there as always with all these other deals i always ask if the people always have extra stuff and we came into something they had what they said was a dead motherboard but i had an i7 6700 t in there and i said what would you want for that and they said i'll just make an offer so i offered him fifty dollars so we ended up picking up the i76700t and then all that other stuff for a hundred and thirty dollars now the thing about how i kind of from what i can sort of get from that is that i know that the 4770 and the motherboard and the ram stick worked because he said that the motherboard and the 6700t the motherboard was dead so when you got someone kind of like at least being honest in that sense you kind of like because it's getting a little bit late too you don't have to go through the whole paces of saying all right does all this stuff work can you show me it working but of course i'll find out when i get home if my if my gut instinct's right but anyway we're gonna go quickly now pick up a gt 1030 as well this has come up on marketplace i just put an offer down and they've acceptable they actually came back and but then they accepted and it was actually quite annoying too because there was an r93 290 sorry r9 294 gigabyte now they've accepted my offer in the end but now i've come back to the gold coast it's too far like i was up there way before when i was near lessers and they just kept sort of haggling up and i'm like well that's all i'm prepared to pay like i told them three times in the messages that's all i'm prepared to pay like i offered him 150 aussie dollars for their r9 290 it's a custom edition so it's not too bad but then they came back and they're like 180 and i said 150 is all i can afford for this card and they came back at 170 now like 150 is all i can afford for this card and anyway they messaged me just before they're like 150 yeah let's do it up and i'm like well it's too late now because i'm not driving all that way back up to brisbane just to get this single deal so yeah kind of anyway that's life let's go pick up this next graphics card so the final deal of the night is a gt 1030 this just popped up on marketplace they're actually asking 80 for it i just popped in an offer of 50. they came back at 60 and then i just said look uh 50 is my max for this card so they agreed i just picked it up now and we're gonna head home grab a feed and then also work out if there's any more deals up the sale i actually want to get to bed early tonight because i want to wake up early in the morning and see if i can find some early morning uh saturday specials good morning tech yes citizens it is now the next morning and i've looked over gumtree and facebook and i've found three potential deals well two of them are pc parts two graphics cards gtx 960 for gigabyte and also gtx 670 so i put down 80 aussie dollars and 50 000 respectively hopefully we get lucky with those two and then there was an xbox series x and they want 850 i put down an offer of 800 aussie dollars uh but also i'm just trying to uh i had a series x but i actually long story short i sold it to a friend uh because they wanted to play series x with their son desperately and i'm like okay man have mine for you know what i paid for it and that's exactly so they ended up getting a good deal but i kind of do want my series x back so i'm looking for one and this one's apparently got a cyberpunk controller so yeah hopefully i can get that but that's all that's on the market really i thought it would be a little bit better on the on a saturday morning but apparently it's not but anyway let's go through what we've got so far where we've got five gravis cards which i'm actually gonna go through now and test all these graphics cards out because the prices i paid from them were really good in my opinion though really cheap especially considering the market then we've got an i7 860 i7 6700t 50 aussie big ones and then a 3770s so they were the cpu deals and then we've got this of course here a 47 70 and a 8 gigabyte stick of ram and the motherboard so that was 80. so that was a pretty good combo i mean considering what you can do with that you can make up a budget gaming pc right there the last of the pieces that we got was a power supply 500 watt for ten dollars and then a z220 replacement for ten dollars because i've got a busted power supply in one of these pre-built things that i've got at the studio here [Music] now we just got back after picking up that xbox series x i actually got that a hundred dollars cheaper than i initially put on the other one so someone went and picked up that other xbox series x and it must have just been something about this morning where series x's came up for sale but i can see how quickly people were snatching up the other ones i saw one for uh 700 the guy was firm on the price and look i should have come and get it because i do want to replace the one that i had before but uh the pc parts this month were really different in that we only ended up spending 450 aussie dollars this month on pc parts and i'll put the tally up on the screen here where we've tested out all these graphics cards they all work okay with the exception of the r9 270x where that's currently only working on the vga ports so i got to look into that maybe the display port and stuff like that it's just a little bit dirty needs a real good clean out or of course it could be a semi-hose but uh we got here a hundred i think i spent 170 on i got five graphics cards they're budget graphics cards but still they're pretty good value given this current climate now all in all it was a great little budget play this month on the pc parts and uh do let us know in the comment section below what you guys think of the deals this month which was your favorite of course is there anything you've been picking up lately that you've been getting good deals on sort of like a new meta moving in i feel like some of these higher end cards again i'm just refused to pay the prices that some of these people are asking for some of these higher end graphics cards if the crypto miners want to keep going and buying them up good on them but i feel like their crypto it'll come to an end sooner or later they're non-productive assets so either those crypto assets the um the money just falls apart in that whole asset field or everything around it starts coming crumbling down so that's the funny thing about when all this un uh productive money i guess you could call it productive money is chasing unproductive uh goods and services so i mean in terms of the crypto stuff i've been predicting it'll crash for quite a while now but hey markets as they say the age old saying markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent but the thing in that case is i haven't really been gambling on any of those asset fields so that's sort of like um perhaps that saying might apply to people building gaming pcs where they can't be solvent enough to buy some of these prices on some of this higher end stuff but speaking of higher end stuff i did look at ebay sales in australia and there was a 3080 ti system this is the dell aurora r12 and it was going for i mean with it 3080 ti this system was going for 2 900 aussie dollars so i did get one because i want to do some content on it see if it's easy to upgrade and then after i'm finished fixing it up maybe re-flip it but that's 2000 usd really good price considering the specs and i'd love to check out if the 11400f at 4k is going to isn't like is it going to make a difference if you put 11900k in there because i don't think it will especially at 4k but i noticed gamers nexus did do a video on the aurora r12 with the amd components in it and it was total garbage like they just said it was basically complete garbage besides maybe the power supply so i want to kind of check this thing out if if i can and then maybe just see what you can do to extract value out of it maybe if you have to re-case it which probably impossible being dell in 2021 but there might be things you can do to get this running really well because at the price range i mean i haven't like 20 80 sorry 3080 ti's are basically going for that price so you're getting a whole gaming system for that price which does really make it appealing it's just there was another thing as well is that they said the delivery could take until next year and i'm thinking to myself well that's more along the lines than of a pre-order that's not really like i mean i should have read the fine print on the postage but i never expect something to be in stock and then take over six weeks to deliver so i'm kind of going to ask that dell store and like say look do you guys have this on hand if not if it's just a pre-order i'd rather just cancel and get my money back so that's kind of one thing that was going on there but other than that the parts on this month has been a little bit lean i just got a feeling like i don't know i just got this feeling that things maybe will get cheaper and stuff i don't know it's something in the air so i'm going to trust my gut on this one and just wait out a little bit of course sitting on a bit of a a tech yes cash pile just uh ready to ready to pick up some bargains if they start coming up because yeah who knows who knows anything can happen in these markets anyhow with all that aside if you enjoyed today and yesterday's used pc part time of the month be sure to hit that like button we've also got the question of the day here which comes from gordy clark they ask hey brian just out of curiosity are you still using the ultrasonic cleaner on the parts after you pick them up after the part time so the ultrasonic cleaner i only ever use that on just extremely dirty parts where i feel like either i can't do a quick clean down on them or i feel like they're that dirty to the point where the actual dirt itself will affect the usage so we recently did a um we cleaned off a heap of crap off this motherboard where it ended up working out after the ultrasonic clean but usually the ultrasound is clean it does the whole process does take a little bit of time because you've got to wash the parts leave it in the ultrasonic cleaner let it dry off a bit and then dry it off again spend a bit of time drying it off and then clean it all up perhaps undo certain heat sinks redo things back up change thermal paste and so it does take a kind of a lot of time from start to finish so i usually do it in sort of like a bulk process where i've got all these really dirty parts and then i'll go through them in one time and just do all the process at the same time so in terms of like parts here today that i got in for instance none of those are dirty enough for an ultrasonic clean in my opinion so i'm not gonna waste the time in that regard so hope that answers that question and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell on the way out and i'll see you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
