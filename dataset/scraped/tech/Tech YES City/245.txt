Windows 10 Keys this has been a highly controversial topic for a few years now and one of the channel sponsors that i have here at tech yes city scdkeys, i've been using them personally for years now and the reason being is i actually checked when i first was negotiating a sponsorship with them. I said "look your keys have to be legit if they're not legit i don't want anything to do with you." and so they then sent me over a few keys, but i didn't want to trust that method i went on to a separate account from a new user and then bought some keys and individually tested them and when i ran them two years ago they were actually retail keys - that is single end user licenses the keys that you and I should be using on our pcs especially if we are gamers... and especially in the last few months i've been seeing messages along the lines of "scdkeys are selling volume license keys you shouldn't buy these, they're not meant for the single end user" and these comments they may be right about other sellers of Windows 10 keys but they're actually not right about scdkeys where a volume license key is essentially designed for business to business where they would give out a single license and that business could then use that same license to deploy across all their systems that they were using hence saving them time but also saving them money where they got that volume license key now there are ebay sellers that do sell these licenses and essentially it isn't legal however that's enough talk i'm going to go buy some licenses off ebay and also buy some licenses off scd keys and then use those licenses on the pc behind me where we can check the validity of such licenses to tell you guys what's going on and furthermore i'll even call up microsoft and check with them with today's licenses that we're going to use let's get on with it and get the lowdown for you guys so here's our first little ebay key that we got here we got this for six aussie dollars however the listing has already been removed about 20 minutes after i bought it so that was very quick so i'm guessing ebay is already filtering out these listings and stopping them from being sold on their website though we did get the message through and we did get a key so we're now able to grab this key check it out and see what it says so our first little ebay key right here has netted a result of a windows 10 rtm professional n so it's not even a pro license it's a pro n license which there are some differences here and that is the end takes away some features in windows and i think it requires an actual different install of windows too though the most important thing is after that it says volume mac now mac means multiple activation key so that is not meant for retail channels at all so that's one of the ebay keys what we're going to do now is quickly buy another ebay key and see what results it turns out so the next one now that we've dropped in here is actually i don't even know if this is worse or not but this is a windows 10 rtm education n volume mac license so that's two different ebay sellers two different keys i'm going to say if you want to get a key off ebay do tread lightly and we've just got our first key now purchased off the website scd keys we've got here windows 10 rtm professional retail so this is the retail stuff this is a single end user license however we're not going to stop there i've got a heap of different keys from this website over the years so we're going to go through a whole page of keys and just check the validity of each and every one of them and going through the rest of the keys there is a little bit of a twist here and that is that not all the keys are base windows 10 some of them are actually windows 8.1 and the thing about this is those they're still retail keys and the good thing is here is you can upgrade windows 8.1 windows 8 and windows 7 keys to windows 10 for free and so some of the keys might be different versions but those versions will upgrade and the good thing is is that they are all retail keys so it's finally time to put on that bogan accent give microsoft a call and see if these keys are legit thank you for calling microsoft [Music] thank you for calling microsoft support my name is your first name and last name oh hello my name's bryan hi bryan um bryan how may i help you today uh yeah um i just bought a pc off uh facebook and my mate said i should just check if my uh windows 10 is okay all right so the windows 10 is working on it you're using windows 10 operating system on it yeah it says it's activated but my friend said i got to be careful of what the key is you've got to be careful of what like if you buy like some people buy keys off ebay and they're not real microsoft keys so i just if your windows is already activated you do not need a key anymore okay so that's um okay thanks so my windows says it's activated and with a digital license okay i'll just look into this further allow me a couple of minutes bryan one your last name would be simpson right yeah yeah i've got i've got the key here if you just want to check it uh see that's absolutely fine it should not be required i'll just confirm a couple of things to you and see and make sure that your device is running fine okay and bryan i must tell you that if your system is activated through a digital line license it will remain activated on this computer okay on this pc and you need not worry about that so all the features of windows 10 would be unlocked and you can use your device without any difficulties and access all its features okay yeah thanks mate okay i won't waste any more of your time thanks mate you're most welcome brian and so there it is from microsoft support themselves they basically said if your windows 10 is activated you have nothing to worry about and i was a little bit surprised because i did mention that i look i bought this key off marketplace and it could be a key where my friends have warned me about keys on ebay and that didn't phase uh the customer support team they just said look if windows is activated you are pretty much good to go we're going to continue on now with uh for instance you go to trustpilot this is a big one because some people have linked me to trustpilot where cd keys for example have been getting i'd say their competitors are putting in fake reviews because i've never had a problem and i've got a lot of friends that use scd keys as well we've never had one problem with the service you pretty much log into the website use paper i use paypal to buy the keys and they're instantly delivered you just go to show key and then your keys there and all the keys have worked and here's the best thing about today's video with std keys because i went to them and i said look i'm going to do this video but can you give the viewers a big discount and they said look it's the month of black friday we're going to give a 30 discount for people who use the coupon bftyc and so i when i bought the keys today i use this on a two-for-one combo so they'll sell two retail keys for a little bit cheaper than the price of buying two individually in a pack and this is a great option if you're building more than one pc because we see here with the cost it's a little over 9 usd for a single end windows 10 pro license and they're a retail key so the bottom line with scd keys the channel sponsor here they're absolutely fine i'll put a link in the description below with this month's coupon code even though it's black friday tyc the bftyc i'm calling it the big fat tyc discount for november when you get 30 off and they've also got other products like office 2016 which i've activated one of these to my microsoft account for instance if i change pcs or upgrade my pc i can then just log into that account and i've got office 2016 available there so really handy really good service and i do vouch for my sponsors here at tech yeah city so if you have any more questions or comments about cd keys and windows 10 then be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below but there's also one more thing as well and that is if you get older pcs like in taiwan i remember we went to a scrap yard and we saw windows 7 keys printed on these old computers if you want to get a free key it is possible to reuse older windows 7 keys so there's that option too and so if you see me on parts hunt sometimes i'll pick up old windows 7 keys and when i've then reused that motherboard put it in a different case for example i was then able to upgrade that windows 7 key to windows 10 and i didn't have to pay for a windows 10 license at all so there's that option too anyway guys we got the question of the day here which comes from mr max gas and they ask the lg cx supports variable refresh rate right what about the c9 now both the c9 and the uh cx they're the lg 4k 120 hertz oled tvs they support it both of them because it's baked in i believe to the hdmi 2.1 standard so you shouldn't have a problem it's just then up to the firmware update and also the update of the device you're using whether it be a playstation 5 or an xbox series x or a pc graphics card it's up to that manufacturer to then work with that tv to get that working properly so yes it can work just whether it will work and how much time it takes for that to work is another thing anyway guys hope that answers that question and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] yes
