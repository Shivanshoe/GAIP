yeah I got it on my thumb I'm just trying to I'm just I just keep refreshing killer comes up I go go all right I'm going I'm going I'm doing it then you ready yeah okay we should be live I think it's working now hello everybody out there welcome to the glorious stream text something and I have joined my co-host Greg yeses ah how you doing Greg yes sir sighs all right I really wish people like I think the fun in these streams is watching you setup the stream I do is its own uh I am interesting yep do you know how bad I am at doing this stuff like I said it's OBS kind of screw you though I mean well this is the thing yeah like I've every time I stream now I've got my my outlay it's all set and I'm like cool all's I have to do is open this up and then I open it up this time my webcam disappears and then the other chat disappears everything is just disappeared I'm like what's going on so I guess that's the that's what's going on there so anyway live-streaming noob here but hopefully the audio is good you'll notice that I got a virtuoso headset and my man over the other side of the planet has a virtuoso as well what a coinkidink that is such a I cannot believe that it worked out that way well yeah so here's a true story I told grace and you got to plug the cable in because I don't trust the Wi-Fi yes so we go they gotta be completely transparent to the viewers I said look viewers need the best audio possible so no that's alright that's right they stayed Wireless you can stay whilst it's fine no but you don't want to test it we can try okay yeah yeah so you can see probably a little bit crackle pop on stream right that's what's going on Greg's a little bit crackle pop keep in mind though we are streaming I mean I'm streaming to him I guess you could call it over Skype so there is a sort of because you hit the button no not yet [Music] and he goes then he's going to go to a wired mode yeah and then yeah and then you would notice the crackle pop will be completely gone I guarantee the Bryant yes it's like Brian says this sounds way better which I can't attest to because I haven't actually listened to myself noticing yet chat will chat will decide chat will tell you so guys juicy stream here today we're gonna talk about Zen 3 we're gonna talk about Intel's rocket League we're gonna talk about our TX 3000 series delayed I mean this one's a no-brainer I mean I think everything to delay this year 2020 is just the year that what the sleepy asleeping year like it's just it's yes it's marinating yeah it's just it's a year that's just like gone that's all it is I think we can already see that and it is do you know what else it's the year for I don't know idea budget supreme now I had the supreme their supreme dude like yesterday well I think you go to light is the thing I know it's gonna be there's gonna be a lot of negative stuff going on out there but you just gotta find the the positive stuff you can do in these situations like there's got to be something positive you can do and I figured well I can just like go below that bar that I was usually going and I can try and get stuff out of dumpsters I can try and get these free keyboards and mice and these $10 19-inch monitors and just start making some magic happen and that's a mess so uh that build I did yesterday was so exciting it was so much fun did you are you having inventory problems like with your use oh we can talk about that straight away we know about inventory problems straight away because yes this is huge right it's it's not just the new parts right new sellers are coming in astray is gonna get its gonna hit a lot worse than America to and the reason being is because the US dollar has gotten so much stronger against the Aussie dollar and what this has set up is a situation in Oz where parts are just going to they're gonna get jelly they're already going up in price like I was getting 1650 supers about 220 Aussie say about a month ago whatever now they're like 280 so there's already a price increase of 60 Aussie dollars for 1650 super now that will probably go up more I'm guessing because of what I'm hearing because right now I've got guys who supply me use parts and they're telling me we can't even go get the used parts because everything's shutting down so they're basically being forced to shut down if that's what if that's making any sense so like everything is just all the chains in the line are just getting shut off and so supply is just drying up and then I've got these guys in China who are messaging me saying we got supply we got stock we're ready to go and I'm like yeah what's the best price you can do for 120 gigabyte SSDs ddr3 memory ddr4 memory and they send me the price list and my jaw drop someone wait what so like why is the price has gone up 50% like literally 50% on SSDs Ram and then coupled that with the Aussie dollar tanking you've literally got like an 80% increase in prices from what I was used to getting so you know that our dollar is being devalued heavily as well I mean all the fiscal policy that we've been enacting just that's one of me yeah that's gonna take all year round that's gonna take a few years to flow through but that will through flow yeah I mean it's already I can't say to what extent you're seeing on the used market things being tried up I mean what extent is is that to blame you know can you blame the problem for that or is it just a healthy called terrible fiscal policy hello helicopter drops they're doing him in Australia I think they're doing him worldwide like I read an article about Thailand and the helicopter drop just they're like people like we want our helicopter drop we want a helicopter money where is it and the government's like well we can't give you everybody helicopter money we can give those who really really need it and we're doing I mean we're giving more people like we're giving most I mean I think it's you qualify for a $1,500 so payment if you make under 100 K as a single adult and if you make under 200 K roughly as a you know if you file jointly with your spouse so I mean and these are like just these aren't even gonna be taxed like these are just kind of upfront they're calling up rebates but it's just free money we're handing out I mean this is part of a multi trillion dollar stimulus effective interest our interest rates have dropped to nearly zero and once you go to zero it's irreversible I mean unless you do some really wacko stuff and economics there's really no way to come back from a negative or zero interest rate which is also gonna devalue the dollar what says it might make us a seem more appealing because people are gonna still want to invest in this but at the end of the day you know the cost to borrow money is there's almost no cost effectively according to the Fed now banks are still charging which is uh which is that country which is the country that's got negative interest rates is a Denmark or something many of them do like in Europe in countries have negative interest rates Japan also has negative I did point I did a negative for more yeah I mean it's not far it's not like negative 2 or negative 3 even the European countries aren't that far austero but Japan recently tried what we're almost doing now Japan's the baby boy and it's the Federal Reserve of Japan it was by ETFs they were buying stock like public stock in order to keep their economy afloat and then they also dropped interest rates below zero and they're still not I mean you know the the problems aside health problems aside they're still in a pretty big trough maybe maybe they just need a virtuoso headset to get them through a tough time there's no but I thing with Japan is and they've tried stimulus and all that stuff in the past and albeit all the test is I used to live there they they get the money and they just they save it but I spend it and that's light together government doesn't know what to do over there like it's it's a big problem for them to like when they hand out money so I guess in Australia they're handing out money to they like there's the think it's $750 which is already coming into people's pockets that's why you know you still have a heap of gaming PC's ready I'm not gonna not gonna sit here try and pretend I'm the saint but yeah like when that money comes through I got gaming PCs ready but now I got no gaming PC's ready and yeah I mean people like dude that's the main people are begging me for PCs right now like I'm getting message I'm getting flooded with messages like man you got this PC available on my own damn it's like I you sometimes I like to leave like an add up and just get some feelers you know if I'm making something else in the process and be like hey I've got this coming up and now getting messages I'm like no I don't have any PC coming up like there's just nothing I got like the last one I built yesterday I'm looking at it right now is like the lost so it's scary man keys I don't know I got build an evil gaming PC's anymore so and I've called my supplier up yesterday I'm like dude please give me something yep give me something please he's like I can't like he went and saw someone and they apparently had like 20 pcs and he's like please can I get them please can I get them and the guys like the guys like now we got only to lock down dude you have to wait it's locked down lips so it's it's really bad like at the moment the situation is really bad situations dire in terms of what the governments are doing if you look at governments and what they're doing no one really knows if they're doing the right thing or the wrong thing because we've never been in this situation in modern day era right we've only times have changed so much where we're so reliant on technology and all this stuff and it's such a weird time to be alive that's all I'll say man like it's like my like sometimes you'll see in my video rarely you'll see there's a view right we got a view where I live and out the coast now all the lights are just switched off like all those big hotels and stuff and so like tourism is just slopped to a massive slump and um yeah it's it's just weird like it's just such weird times to be alive man the unemployment rate here is really I mean obviously it's we're expecting it to be temporary and caused by one specific thing but it's way higher than we predicted it would be yeah which is resulting in more people attempting to apply for unemployment benefits which will also have you know that will reap problems for as later on down the line as well just because our we're gonna fund it oh we're just gonna make more money okay well there's more currency devaluation but I there was a book that I read I think I think I read in a book we're back in the old days we know before you had all these computers that were calculating all these ups and downs and basing all these you know stock prices off of balance sheets and and all this and that yeah quarterly revenues and all that stuff they would they would just look outside at the factories and they would see if the factories were pumping out smoke yep and they're pumping out smoke it meant they were in business they had orders coming through they were working they were manufacturing whatever they were doing but when the smokestacks stopped pumping out the smoke that meant there was a problem yeah and you can I mean the equivalent of that today I would guess would be something around like you said but lights being off you know or not being as many cars on the road maybe an industrial highways just totally empty now yeah and that's just an indication that you're not you know you're not manufacturing anymore which is why prices are going up across the board because there are less of those goods in supply now yeah yeah exactly um it's my also just quickly is my chat unavailable like on the live stream I'm just trying to yeah I guys I apologize I don't know what's going on with this chat like I I've tried copy pasting the thing in properties it's just not working so yeah yeah so you've got the you got the pop out here right you can see it on stream otherwise we'll just show it quickly so we got the pop out here there's the live pop out there's the chat and I copy I copy that well you will be able to see it soon and then I've got like there's the thing there I go to properties I'm like hey yeah let's use that and it doesn't work maybe I just like okay nothing and then we try it again that's weird yeah again I'd really die there okay so it it was just a boy again this is the problem I'm facing with live streaming it's just bugging out and now it's working so anyway ah okay sorry guys sorry about that rude interruption because I like to read chat while we while we're going through and yeah the thing is like we could just sit here and pretend like nothing's going on which is so hard for me to protect like how can you pretend like nothing's going on in the world of course we can't talk about the human thing directly because you know our careers are in jeopardy when we do that but we got to talk sure you have to you have to be able to talk about this stuff man you have to be able to talk about it because it's affecting what I'm doing here directly yeah and that I can't get out and get parts anymore I can't a lot of the videos like a lot of the builds you'll see that's me sourcing parts a lot of the not just that right it's a lot of these weird one-time parts I'll get and I'll do videos on that too so like literally half my content is coming to a crocks and so it's it's kind of weird anyway yeah so I'll figure out like we're gonna be going down this tangent now where it's gonna be so retro it's not funny because I do have a stack of retro parts that I haven't dug into yet so be like Pentium 3 or something I think that might become oh yeah get ready guys get ready chat because this is going to get juicy but that being said right we got delays on hard way we're gonna talk about Xen 3 now I pull up a door TVs article here I know some people are the biggest fan of a daughter and they think he's rumors aren't true but I know one thing when it comes to an AMD rumor that guy has some direct links I know because I'm not gonna say too much but there's guys telling me like yeah we told it doored this stuff like three weeks ago at these events you know what I mean and they're like saying yeah we taught a dog TV was so tight-knit with him and here he gets them really he gets access to the leaks as they come I know that for a fact so he's basically saying like CIN 3 is going to they got to change the design a little bit so they're essentially like they're doubling the level three cache but then they're sticking it to one CCX and I think this is going to be a better design well obviously it's going to be better because they're they're computer engineers but they're looking at a 10 to 15 percent bump in IPC which again is incredible they do use the word only so I will critique that it's like nah dude any year-over-year if you can get a 15% IPC bump that is like so good in this current climate of tech right yes they say we've been used to from a blue team oh yeah is that that's what I mean so anything so anything's welcome like I wouldn't say only but in terms of the court count looks like I'm guessing they'll stick with this there's apparently there'll be more cause more threads but I think the markets really had a taste of more cores more threads and it's something that's not really needed like past yeah not past a certain point yeah and that's my main like I say I say 16 cores is pretty much high-end for like me I don't need any more than 16 I got the 18 I don't need any more than that and that's why I've had real no desire to change over the TRX 40 and do all these contour all this content cuz I know it my passions just not there for a man when I started testing it out and benchmarking and doing all the tests then I was like I didn't notice anything as opposed to when I got my hands on the 18 core I was like whew that's a lot better than eight cause for what I do and so you can tell it straight away it so this 16 cause if they can work on the 16 core especially and get the IPC as good as possible just make it this just absolute dominant 16 core then that's where it's gonna be for them I think especially it it does say at the bottom lastly we do have a smalls and four leak mostly just confirmation logical assumption that zone four will feature even more cores so they're obviously still is at least somewhat of a push to have a higher core countship which I wonder I wonder how that will affect like software utilization like as of right now I can think of a handful of things that I do that actually require right that 16 cores 32 threads you know insane workhorse of 3950 eggs yeah but it's like how much more are you willing to go on a consumer platform before you before it's it just looks like flexing like okay you're just walking around with your shirt off because you can not because you actually need to you know like yeah I don't I mean we know it we get it AMD is good at the core count thing like we we've you've already proven that to us no one is disputing that but I would prefer it like you said if they stop emphasizing that and they start emphasizing the IPC bump fifteen percent is a huge bump and if that actually happens I will be genuinely impressed because like you said we're just not accustomed to those kinds of jumps and I never you Oh year-over-year yeah yeah exactly yeah and so I am I would say a conservative estimates gonna be someone around with six to eight percent which would still be great I'd still be perfectly fine with that no complaints on IPC side but the frequency is what we need to focus on now a little more I think because getting to 4.2 4.3 maybe 4.4 yeah I get it it's harder to do with higher core count ships and that's that's part of the problem they keep focusing on the hike or count side of things then you're not gonna get even more performance out of individual threads which is what Intel is doing better and that's the only reason why until it even remotely recommended anymore amongst tech enthusiasts is because they still have that core count or that core frequency advantage you know here it is problem thrown at you okay do you know another thing to is yeah this is a curve ball have you ever thought that maybe the ring boss was just that good to like we're talking latency here because I've heard been reading up a lot about the trading high-frequency traders and stuff they all swear by until they get a ring boss these guys don't use anything else and it's just latency ring bosses King still for latency and do you think intel's even having a hard time out doing their own design that is the thing so like they've they've got it they've got a niche they're still they've got a niche they're still on that latency thing is really bust latency it's gotta be eye last I checked if I ever call correctly 20 30 milliseconds I think compared to I might be totally honest I you know just got a look at the actual cash level one cache level two cache level cache is always gonna be yeah but I mean from core to core or like you know when they all share a common l3 or whatever yeah it's it's like that latency is I want to say on the effective two to three times faster than infinity fabric ladies even with tightly tuned ramp you know something that has insanely low cast late season and really high frequencies yeah and that's part of the prop two is it's dependent on another thing whereas the Intel stuff I mean you could pop 2133 into an Intel platform or 4,000 you know at the end of the day the differences are marginal compared to this you would see on the AMD platform especially the then stuff so yeah I think you're right there definitely oh he's winding up folks that's it I'll just guess I'll just fake and I was faking a couple don't worry I think Intel struggling to do like there they obviously III feel like they see the need to bump core count they have to now then their hands are tied but how do they do that in a ring bus design I mean you could ditch that totally and go to the HTT stuff same thing they do with the 1090 DX scene whatnot but at that point you you do you lose that snappiness some of those programs definitely benefit from that architecture you lose the razor's edge that's what that's what it is you lose the razor's edge and are they like that's I mean they're probably looking back at the architects that designed nalem and and at Sandy Bridge and they're like yo what do you guys do can you redo this stuff like know we we outdid ourselves back then eh guys that's it just check to the x86 done let's just just pack up shop so so that's it's just funny I don't know like and you look at it right you look at it and it is what it is I think they need to it's gonna be a radical do you desire it wasn't IBM developing that graph graphene processor and stuff that's kind of like the future wait surely they have five nanometers and I mean they're always finding ways to get around quantum tunneling right which is the old bit barrier to something tighter than around five nanometer but yeah I expect I mean if you get down to four three you're gonna have to change how you approach the transistor because you you can't get around I mean you can mitigate to an extent but physics will do what it's you know it's it's just laws this what we study in nature it's how we see things happen and there's really no ultimately no way to get around it so basically Xen 3 I'm really looking forward to it I'm thinking again like 8 cores 16 threads is where it's at right now I think if you're like if you've got even if you've got a lot of money and you're gaming or whatever a core 16 threads is perfect for you like I see a lot of guys I want to get the 12 core they want to get 16 core I'm like are you really gonna use that oh but I'm gonna be streaming I'm streaming now my CPU like my CPU doesn't use much pride like I can I'm watching the utilization CPUs 1.6 I can show you guys on stream how much CPU is being used 1.8 percent like where's this whole like can you see that it's 1.8% so like I'm streaming from my GPU that's why you got a stream from your GPU encoder don't be fooled by this streaming crap like everywhere you go get a good SSD make sure you really if you're doing any content creation spend money on a decent SSD I'm not the bangers that I use in my builds not the aliexpress specials use something good like a mlc drive or something that's really good Samsung do a great job on the higher end SSDs they're really good you have throw it I mean yeah I'm ready there we go would you still be ok using the Nvidia encoder the new one or the old one doesn't matter let's assume you're using an RT X 2070 which is a mid to high range car right yeah if you're using that card and you want to stream games and let's say it's witcher 3 i don't know a crysis 3 okay something that's perfectly intensive would you still want to use your Nvidia encoder yeah you ready for it I'm coming by I'm throwing a curveball back at you throw I've drawn a kemple article you know the truth I'm streaming right now on the gtx 1070 yeah yeah I live it up video editing on it so 1070 is such a sweet spot it's a good sweet it's a great card storm and it's great for streaming it's great for video editing I find it's really good there is one problem with the 1070 though from the RT X series that I've noticed and that is if my clips are long enough in Adobe Premiere Pro it'll like it won't desync the audio on the video but when you're reading you know you read the audio line like you'll see all the bumps and stuff and you are that's where that's where I've messed up it desync like that's all over the place so you you don't know where yet like it's just got different lines for your audio then where you're actually speaking it's such a weird ugly I'll have things like a prayer bug yeah it's it's a premiere bug with GTX 1070 because it doesn't happen on our TX card so yeah that's really weird yeah anyway so yeah that's uh that's that going on so we got Zen three let us know in the chat are you oh and apparently it's a new socket the biggest thing - apparently it's gonna be it's gonna ask that that's in force a new socket as well I wonder if it's a totally different socket actually this this is what we're talking about if it's a new socket that kind of like that's like what about this upgrade path that everyone's telling me about you don't have me cuz I'm here doing it I'm doing today I'm doing an a320 in a rise in 536 hundred now people are telling me upgrade paths you can go rising five thousand dude in the pill and if you get a a X 570 you can go rising five thousand in the future sorry kid no they did promise socket support through 2021 I think originally I'm not mistaken and then I think they dropped that down to 2020 maybe I'm wrong but I'm trying to member what we talked about Computex because that was I specifically asked them was socket support and and you know were they gonna actually honor their pledge because that was one of the bargaining chips AMD used was hey if you buy into our platform early you're gonna be good for years you know so why not or as until shafts you every generation with uh oh you need sorry see ninety-seven doesn't work you need z170 okay well Z two seventy that might work with the BIOS update Z 370 not gonna need a new chip see whatever Z 390 now they have another chip said I don't know sorry sir and that's and that's to be frank the socket stayed the same right it was still LGA 1150 actually to change but we've used the a.m. for socket or Oliver Iseman today and it's I I don't I think people who were more budget-conscious are going to care because they weren't in the market for a brand new Zen three chip anyway they're gonna probably look at this as an opportunity to buy cheaper now cheaper is then twos and plus originals n stuff because now that's gonna be you know yeah it's not gonna be pretty factored anymore it's used that's right that's me man so please Andy bring out that new socket yeah I don't want some cheap I want some chips into oh yeah especially around tech yes City man so it's funny hey its I love this stuff man give me that give me that use n stuff finally yeah cuz oh that's a funny thing like people buying my nice because I find Zen's actually starting to do is end to anyway and ends n plus the originals and 1000 series mint oh like no one like not many people want that like let's be honest yeah some places a lot of people bit so hundred so what I'm getting now is a lot of people buy high-end pcs they want they want sendto in there like they want the AMD option and it's great but the thing is a lot of those guys too when they buy this they're like I want an x5 I want the best motherboard bro it's got to have it you know you just don't understand I'm like dude like yeah just as I say don't do you're gonna be spending all that like X hundred dollars on this motherboard that you're probably not even gonna utilize the features on let's be real you save that money I just tell them that I just tell them honestly save that money man and a couple of years time yeah by then it's not yeah you're not even gonna care about that platform you're gonna be you're gonna be on something else yeah totally different right that's gonna be ancient am3+ stuff now right it's it's I I understand why they would want something that's flashier beef you're looking like a motherboard is obviously it's a vital component but like you said it's really just one of those it's like options on a car like at the end of the day the car is gonna freakin run just fine but maybe you want the carbon fiber trim pack maybe you want the Bang & Olufsen sound system you know maybe you want the 20 inch rims like that kind of stuff is optional but at the end of the day it's not gonna affect the way that your CPU runs to the extent that you know it's gonna function properly you might be able to overclock a bit more run faster memory but again those are added on top of the fact that is at least compatible and yeah budget-conscious people should definitely be looking at the b-series stuff which has gotten a lot better since the originals then release the original be 350 board some of those were questionable although at the end of the day they still work but you know be 450 got better who knows where the helpee 550 is but i don't think it's gonna matter now because if we're already talking sen 3 ya probably ain't coming so but that's I mean so like I just told these guys that you before we move on to the I know some of the people in chat like y'all move on to the Nvidia subject love heart okay yeah I put that love heart up there - okay so we're okay so basically with this upgrading stuff look back on trends right there's only three things that I'd be spending my money on personally that is a good power supply if you wanted to last forever a good case and a really good SSD that'd be the three things that you can see via trends they don't improve a whole lot over the years like you don't like you look at the air 540 man that case is still one of the best in my opinion if you bought that back then you made a really good investment you buy some see sonic power supply back in the day Corsair passed by it was really good you buy a really good Mel C SSD you still laughing so yeah those are the three things if you want to spend money on upgrade path just grab them they'll last you for a long time anyway envy to your article let's move over now in video big Envy big Envy we've been waiting for this we've been waiting for invidious 3000 series tech enthusiasts have been waiting for rise of us or not rising yeah rise in three thousand r-tx thirty sixty yeah and Greg's been waiting for artist-- I've never he's been he's been low tell it low key telling me dude I just can't wait to get a proper Nvidia graphics card in my machine I'm such a just wait just wait no but now is gonna have to wait longer this is the problem he's gonna have to wait longer now because of a particular thing going on now I'm pretty upset I'm pretty upset with this because I was really I was looking forward to this a lot like a lot lot because it's I wanted to see some real big gains I want to see in videos architectural gains I want to see him drop a node I wanna see hey no shrink fella I want to see that someone see him drop a node and yeah that's it that's it and I want you know the biggest thing I want to see I wanted to see some like people people desire nor condone it in our industry but I wanted to see Jenson and Lisa sue flexing at each other going out I love I love the crap talk man I absolutely love it like bring it on so I want to see some few more remarks and yeah but we didn't get that so well not yet and now rumours has it I'm getting rumors behind the talk here that it's all delayed until September that's their like their st. August in the title here by its which well Winky Dink that's copy text I'm definitely sorry it's looking like everything's gonna be pushed back until September main reason being is just supply chains and everything right these grapes cards aren't gonna probably be well they're not gonna be able to be shipped properly don't be able to be manufactured properly is all that in there and plus the atmosphere too I mean do you want to release a card or a series of cards at this time I mean it just well you you know manufacturing constraints aside I just don't think that it makes sense for them to wait for a show where they used to announcing things like this because that's when you build the height that's when you have the media let's present and and and super you know just ready to fire hit the enter key in polish that's another thing too is they don't want to release it when everything else like you can't build a use PC you can't build a new PC all these other parts are out there you can't build them so I mean we've got over the performance in the past this is going to be big RTX 3080 r-tx 30 70 r-tx 30 60 I'm looking forward to that a lot and I don't know this is one thing I don't know yet is if the delays are going to mean the 30 60 will come out the same time as the 30 17 30 80 no no way do you think do you think NVIDIA is just gonna go hey love for everybody they're gonna push everything back man they're gonna push it all like it's it would be shocking for them to break tradition and release lower end cards at the same time and the reason why we've talked about this in other streams is the more expensive cards are less attainable and they know they're gonna sell less of them if they release everything at the same time so why not we let some of those guys that are on the fence bite the bullet if they want a new card now and spend a bit more for the for the you know higher end stuff and then by the time the lower end stuff is already leaked out you know people that were potentially buyers of the lower end stuff already bought more expensive cards which I'm assuming they have better margins on that anyway and so that that's how you kind of get people to set higher yeah I think they need to release it early in charge 10 grand if that's the case 30 atti I mean they lower prices after a while you know I mean granted the fab I mean I'm sure the fab process probably becomes more efficient with time that's the case with yields across the board for the most part but they I mean people who want it now will pay a premium for it they know that and the same goes for the higher end card that they may not necessarily need they'll still pay more to get the higher end card because it's the only card you can get and they want to be one of the first to get the new architecture I mean complete logic but most important question I want to know is is do you want more RGB and this is the chat as well do you want less RGB or more RGB on your new RTS cards I want I want the whole side of the card to light up like my and the fans as well if you can get the side and the fans to light up that is great because I don't I don't care any of that I want to be able to change the logo color Jesus I'm sick of the same Yan green crap okay that only works in a neon green black themed build truth I want to be able to change it apparently there's functionality baked in for RGB so I heard I heard it's set to green for so obviously it's a invidious color but why not let us yeah yeah break tradition a bit and come on in video come on in video we all want this we will want proper RGB I want it to sink up to Corsair IQ so I can have my graphics card go whoosh through that would make the cards like AI b cards are already more appealing in their own rights right especially when they're priced competitively but one of the things stopping me from from I like the new founders cards they run quiet for the most part they might be questionably built but the build quality title itself is good they look freaking good there's no sag the way they build these cards there's no sag anymore like there were in the old ones I don't have many complaints at all apart from the fact that you know there's cosmetic stuff maybe overclocking to an extent but let me change the day caller yeah exactly yes I remember when the when the card first came out you remember like this is like people trying to make fun of it like it looks like a toaster I'm like yeah it looks like a really good toaster I think things good so I mean I love to look at the founders cause they did a good job on that but yeah please give us some proper RGB one thing I did like was Galax how they put that RGB backplate on the card like that was neat it didn't really get enough attention it was unlike the exo see white the 1070 I had as an EXO so you had a - I think the white one you said it was a good 1070 it was a bit beige your son wasn't even white yeah yeah they messed up the color but the backplate they remember they had the RGB backplate that was like legit it was yes the LEDs showed like they showed through the side so it just looked like a nice strip going around underneath a backplate that was clean that looked really good I actually just used that card in a build and I I had three different like whites in the build I had a cool white a warm white and then whatever the heck the clacks card is like an eggshell beige color it was like the cringy estate bill I've ever put together just a bit of so you're going for the white on white on white paint color coffee on white on beige white yeah there's my new color fellas and this color is oh goody okay all right so we've got our r-tx 3000's gonna be delayed I've heard this from not just these articles I've heard it from sources as well and yes that's a definite right now who knows when this stuff honestly they're like from what I can see things will even have a taste of normality from July that's what I'm hearing like this this is gonna go on for a while this stuff the good thing is at least locally here they've dropped the price of burritos from $11.40 down to nine dollars and ninety cents that deserves a shout out in its own gusman's yeah cheap burritos okay anyway we're gonna hear rocket Lake this is the new architecture from Intel we've got a supposedly we got a new IPC gains but we've got the 14 nanometer edge still four o'clock speeds so they don't want to drop it to ten nanometer because they want to keep their clock speeds up but we're gonna get new IPC from Intel that is interesting and PC all right well it does four drives I guess Spencer I'm gonna be honest man in my in my in my workflow PCIe four doesn't really matter at all like no it doesn't for a lot of people that want it's just one of those things again you can just flex with your shirt off because you can I want I will point you out let's see on your shirt off like I died would do it I would do it but I just like I haven't got out in the Sun enough I haven't worked out enough but that's because we know that we're not yeah but we're just trolling people that's it kudos to the guy I mean kudos to the guy outside with his shirt off showing off is you know kudos I have to ask is this 14 animator plus plus plus plus plus you know it's 14 nanometer X to the 5/2 this actually still 14 nanometer yes that's what they're saying like that's what they gonna say rocket Lakes gonna be 14 nanometer we're gonna get Z 490 as well so the motherboard has a different socket too so it'd be different socket PCIe for UI PC apparently is gonna be a 10 core 20 thread so they come in with that this is all the rumors but yeah apparently more ddr4 speeds official ddr4 3600 controller maybe is this like I honestly none of this is very impressive like just knowing the back of my head that we're still in 14 I mean in Tony to come out they need to come out with something big and this is not like hey ty pcs good I wanna see this but this is it big I mean this is the same rehash crap with you tweet I said that I said they need to come out with something big I said this is sorry no that the chipset is the more impressive thing here I mean obviously you need a CPU that's compatible with the chipset for these features to work but I'm more impressed with the chipset just because it's offering things that AMD's already offered you know finally and and and that's sad I'm more interested in exercise I mean I'm just gonna throw this out do you reckon we'll get another security floor that only affects first second and third and fourth gen oh this one effects has well is this new security floor it just affects has well because like has was like one of the most popular like used platforms right now it is hot dude how yeah it's hot right now like not only is actually it's still pricey on has wells on fire dude because it still runs right you just sable spectrum meltdown on that thing it's really good I'll do a video on house well this month definitely like as well is it for you stuff right now I asked my supplies you got neat fourth gen stuff in broke fourth gen fourth gen everyone's looking around for 4th gen I big thanks to the patron dude who messaged me and Craig he messaged me I haven't responded yet but I just saw the message and he's like yo here's a link and he's like jump on eBay grab all these I snapped them all up these 4th gen hate Peas because the more you buy the more you say Eve as some of the some of the eBay sellers have that I like that feature so I saved 10% I was like sweet I'm gonna get some HP's delivered and then uh yeah yeah man reuse that motherboard power supply cooler you got the value there the value say and you've got an i7 now this is one thing I got to talk about with the CPU excuse apparently the i7 8700 is now gonna be the i-5 10 600 or something 10,000 it's like what are they doing like what are they doing seriously they you do realize I used i seven eighty seven hundred is then gonna have more value than intense 10600 because people people gonna look at that and go what what i seven is better than i-5 i want to buy the i7 and that's like i've critiqued him they need a change to like X or something X 5 X 7 get people questioning this stuff the whole I naming scheme is really I mean I it supports guy I shouldn't be complaining it supports guys like me to briefly stuff yeah so like yeah thanks Intel but if you're someone like me who's a little more kind of in the middle I would say I prefer new stuff partly because it doesn't over the price of new stuff but I also want new stuff just to be able to experiment with it and build cool stuff with it come on H snow I really wish they came off probably bad I like my I like my new stuff its I said this in a video I'm so sick of recommending AMD stuff not because I hate AMD I love what they're doing but I am tired of recommending the same stuff to everybody oh I have about six to eight hundred bucks to spend ok how about a 2600 or 3600 I have about 1200 bucks to spend I'm in a mostly game okay how about a 3600 and r-tx 2080 you know like I'm sick of the same CPUs coming up in these conversations because it's it's just like a one-way street now and that's good to an extent I mean the CPUs are available and they're pretty cheap but I want us I want to struggle to recommend one or the other I don't want to come across as like this AMD shill because that's all I recommend when in reality I'm just recommending because it's the only viable thing to reconcile told you go jump over to the news the use scenes where it's happened and except right now it's a difficult spot to be at because of the restrictions but there's a ways it's like every day I go out it's like a new kinder surprise in the use market you don't know what you're gonna get and it's like you know there are there are people who are timid I mean there are people who just won't buy used periods they just going variance with it that that's the those are the people I'm talking to I think there are more of them than there are people who are into the you stuff yeah at least who I deal with because they you know that's all that's known is just buying new doesn't buying used is risky and you know I don't like meetings yeah yeah that's because there's just these few bad apples they literally do this lazy dude though just like like yeah I had one guy calling me up a few months ago saying look I go to Bryant you're gonna be careful of this man and someone go I sold me a 1070 but he put like it some like like HD 5850 in there some potato GPU in the box and just gave him the box got the cash and took off and I said dude you've always got to check the GPU in the box never take that stuff for granted but there's people out there like that that will do that I remember years ago I never forget this guy I met him at the servo and he sold me an R 9 280 deliberately I said is this thing fine yeah man it's fine get it home and stalled it driver installs screen goes black I'm like yeah got hose I messaged in message to him I said dude what the you know I yeah so that's when I stopped meeting people at servos periods like yeah I'm gonna go to your house and pick that stuff up yeah and that's just what you I mean it's it sucks to recommend that to people and you have to be careful with with with how you word it because some people do it you know some naive person I just go over anybody's house it says they have something and walk right in and yeah you know be held at gunpoint or something insane but at the end of the day it's kind of what you have to do if you want to ensure that art works you have to see it running in the system yeah and you can't just take a whole desktop to like McDonald's I mean you probably could I wonder how many times you could do that before getting kicked out like you know you bring your monitor and your ear tower just like walk it into a McDonald's and plug that stuff in and here you go man it's all good maybe you could give like McDonald's or royalty on every sale if they let you do that I don't know someplace public like that you know so now we've got it now we've got it now we've got a campaign going on on Twitter so this stream is sponsored by Corsair they did say look guys yeah they got Greg a virtuoso headset who's always saying look we gotta get my man a virtuoso headset and he he pulled off a pop filter from somewhere - so he's got a pop filter now - absolutely yeah so this is a so what we got here is this is a crackling Iceman dam I think is gonna win like that's a pretty cool thing like he's put RGB Oh for the photo and spawned around like I like that so basically you guys can still enter we'll go to chat for like 10 20 minutes wow yeah we're good shot yeah we'll go to chat for 10 20 minutes I just reply to this thread anything you can do anything it just just make us laugh on stream so it's on Twitter take a city it's my latest tweet and just reply hashtag Corsair hashtag I'm virtuoso and yeah we'll read the replies after we go to chat and just chat with you guys so it's kind of a bit counterproductive here this is the most counter-offensive I've ever been it's like hey go Twitter but hey we want you to still come and chat so yeah and then we'll read them all then we'll read them all and me and Greg will select a winner who's gonna be this is pretty like dude crackling ice is like straight away that's impressive like well I've got it I was originally and I just saw one imagine looking this good while slang ah man thanks that's such oh okay that's pretty good but I mean you've got to decide to someone saying I'm looking this good doesn't know you've got half the vote is not good and you still look good okay say Haven yep TV Bora down he's like yeah dude Corsair virtuoso will you save me from I don't even want to say that word on stream because yeah yeah all right so so far I think Isis that's originality points right there from Kim Nino's ashtag I am virtuoso dying gracefully in cod war zone maybe because I can't hear them coming oh that's like oh that's that's a sad story oh yeah he's definitely playing the tearjerker and yeah he's flying that guys feel sorry for me I like you can get some fight you can get cheap man I see speakers getting thrown away everywhere so never no sound like absolutely no sound yeah I'm kinda like behind that one like you always got sound something maybe is you think monitor speakers brother is there is they ought to say he should just say I'm using multiple space that's fine yeah but I'd almost rather not have speakers than use some of the monitor speakers I've heard I just reviewed a really really cheap monitor and if it had to come out soon and the speakers just shouldn't exist they were absolute dog crap yeah worse audio clarity imagine it was worse than that yeah I guess they were just there it's the Pampas spec sheet okay so we got a question from mark and they said Brian how its Skippy in your backyard going skivvies good so there's Wallabies there's red tail Wallabies in my backyard and also big kangaroos they both of them there's families that circulate around here I like the Wallabies better they like they chillin they're like they look up at me and they're like yo what up and I'm like hey man you just you like in those backyard and ya like that the Wallaby family is cool like they're they're pretty chill even though they're usually the Wallabies faster and they're more scared than the Kangaroos these guys around to you they seem to like it around here and they just you know the chill or the chill around here a lot only in Australia now so okay yeah we okay Greg and Brian teaming up for the win yep so okay I just noticed your thumbnail I just noticed your thumbnail you just like wrote r-tx 30 60 over like yeah that's that's it man like this is well I made like what's the point why try because there's no official voice yet so they go to clearly design the cooler difference so I was okay so we got I think everyone's jumped onto Twitter so there's no questions guys we need questions so let's just start reading the the Twitter entry soon okay so okay all right well we'll go through we're going through still now so we've got funny is asking for a USB or wilds headset and getting this the USB just powers those pointless uncontrollable lights in the headset yeah that is really pointless actually that's a yeah that's just dumb like that is the dumbest headset design like yeah so they use what he's saying is they give you a USB and like a mic and audio jack so you get three jacks on that headset probably and then the USB is just to light it up it's like what what what that is I feel sigh he's getting some true sorry points I feel sorry for Trivial Pursuit that is a genuine I feel sorry for him he bought those well you know there's Brent I didn't even know like sadie's or something Said's everyone's like yeah it's so good and they might come back in five years time when you got mad tinnitus and tell me if they're still good techno tech yes yeah that's right techno City we're gonna get some bait Matthew says he says I really need a new headset my current ones give me course err course oh I like it yeah course yeah yeah all right not bad not bad that is pretty good that's a that's a good one if your son becomes a priest do you call him father no that's good that's good some of these guys are good oh I can't read those I just can't read them man like some of my car racer RGV should just replace the currency's the toilet rolls now yeah RPGs like role-playing games yeah they should toilet paper yep a like rolls to get like certain skin yeah I kind of I'd knocked the impact out of that joke myself because I didn't read it properly the first Brian how is your accent actually great can you do all the accent from now spirit your audience yeah I said we got to ask from Christos - two-one-two said Brian what model are the headset and how they sound well they sound them this is the virtuoso and they do sound really good this is the but I started using these on stream initially because I tried the mic out and everyone said the mic was really good that's the most important thing I was dreaming that's what sold me on it - I like having a headset instead of a condenser because I'd move around I'm throwing curveballs and when you do that your audio is gonna be off so at least with a headset you move around you got audio you go off stream you know hey guys you can't see me anymore but you can still hear me and that is the most important part and yeah this headsets really good for wireless because when I'm say for instance I'm building a PC and I'm chatting to someone I don't have to I can be anywhere in my studio and doing yeah but that's not for stream right people don't care if there's a bit of dial-up voice work when I'm having a casual chat right yeah that's right so you'd like at the start of the stream you sounded like you're on dialogue now you're good oh my god I actually I in the very beginning when we live streamed I lied to you and I said that I was wired when I wasn't and I saw a few people say oh it sounds better that is called the placebo effect my friend and that indicates to me that there isn't much of a difference okay these two that on their end uh after YouTube presses everything and Skype compresses everything because remember I'm going through Skype and then through your encoder so I'm really good double really good question here we've got is the GP any insight on why GPU prices are so high again even Jen cards are inflated F and yeah this is the whole thing it's the crunch this is what's happening use use supply you new supply it's all coming to a crunch now and what you're gonna see is prices just go up unfortunately and so that's why it's just the crunch that's it supply is tightening all around demand hasn't demand in actual fact has probably gone up more so because people like well I'm gonna be home for the next few months I'm gonna need a gaming PC or I'm gonna need a gaming PC for my kid because he's not gonna be at school as much so there's the demands gone up supplies dropped it's just that formula for higher prices man we've got I wonder what Intel wants to name their CPU as Rocket probably the IPC gains that's like they hey we've got some gains it's a rocket it's probably a play on AMD's rising right is risin like we're rising above our our mmm past plagues and until it's like alright let's come up with something as clever as risin so don't just said rocket cuz we want to rise above them yeah I guess one thing I'm curious about was stream is like every time I make a video Marco is like the first comment now like every time now I'm on stream he never comes in chat so yes that's mark anyway so I sweep that that's we got to finalize in the next minute we're gonna finalize and we're gonna read out the winners so I'm gonna say so far the Corsair yeah he's getting Corsair that's that's that's why it does that's my favorite and because it's applicable to the to the product being yeah I think that was yeah my man's he's winning the point board so far hey he's got the course air running through so as okay why a ten-year-old qx9 770 is still $200 that is a mystery to me as well yeah I'd have no idea it's it's definitely not worth that maybe collector's item I don't know you reckon I should sell my 3700 X now for the same price I bought it and upgrade to a 3100 x1 the rise in 4,000 drops not if you not if you're gonna like if you gonna try and sell it now and then try and get something else now I'd be very careful with that because even though you can sell what you got it for now everything else you might want to change to might have gone up in price - so relative economics situational economics be careful of that you're buying a good market you're selling a good market you sell on a bad market you're buying a good market you're going to lose money so and vice versa yeah well that's how the world works trade is baby trading training trading I love trading that's how you love trading no way these are expensive QX 97 70s for like 200 bucks but they're offering to China I wonder if China's like scoop them all up like this like the diamond trade you know it's a pointless CPU man I'd rather an i7 860 any day a week it's only a it's only a quad core isn't it yeah it's not even hyper threaded so yeah yeah okay I don't know that this the actual tweets like bugged out because it's not even show comments okay so when you find out oh yeah we're gonna start reading okay finalized now we're gonna finalize and we're gonna pick a winner so Corsairs went in so far when you find out that your normal daily lifestyle is called oh man he almost got me there alright that's I've seen that I've seen that meme like 20 20 million times now okay techno tech yes a Greg and Brian looking mint in those headphones time for RGB am i right yeah yeah mmm it's time for RGB but we need it we need a point we need a joke with shock value I think that's the thing I really need a new headset my current one gives me yeah Corsair that's it he's winning so Matt you're winning right now do you agree you think Matthews Matthews winning right now yeah the Corsair woman was probably the most clever if it had something to do with video games don't make us violent lag does that is true the true statement but Cherie but how does it pertain to the virtuoso headset exactly and the gaming headset yeah you know who's safe from all this mayhem a Corsair true Rodrigo he's coming in Rodrigo has come in with a pretty legit hit there so part right a pirate out in the sea is safe from all this mayhem very true I like man I play seas that's a good one okay that's a good one I'm virtuoso dying gracefully on cold war zone because I can't hear them coming yeah that was the cinema okay needing a new headset ripped too much wired headsets as a league player and also play gin the virtuoso with this headset I can become a [__] oh my god I was a bit too much yeah what a computer's eat when they get hungry chips yeah I mean that's a good one but it doesn't apply to the virtuoso more RGB okay crackling ice - something funny just kidding oh man don't post partner oh come on guys it's just a BM why don't I don't understand this me it's like a horse staring at an ocean but like nobody's on the horse and it just says man okay do you see that one okay so we trying to make eye maybe chat can fill in the context I feel like there's something I'm totally in my yeah out there maybe the horse is bored thank you okay so every day's with red days let's go through my headset clips with minor bits of loudness help me neither I am a virtuoso the street won't forget this wind brother that's right the streets won't forget this when we reach a present sweet but don't read it out loud okay is it yeah I like it eh [Laughter] I like it jafer is I like it dude wow that's I mean I live in Queensland it's this guy's that's funny oh okay I'm liking that so we got a we got some good contestants I think Corsair like after I'm liking all the comments that will stand out and then Corsair can pick I think maybe because I can't pick there's a few good ones here a-and I don't like go on round-robin so make sure you stay stay followed because stay father to me and Corsair and Greg and we'll pick though we'll pick the winners it's gonna take a while like okay so we've ran out anyway if your son becomes preschool and father we've heard that one I don't have anything funny to say my headset is just broken oh I'm sorry man I do feel for you I've got bro I mean if he's on the Gold Coast I've got a cheap Said's headset I can give to him that's I can give that time go okay good game Ryan that's fine okay so there we go manjae Perez really came in with like yeah alright so alright that's really dude I'm going with J Perez I'm going J for us yeah he's gonna be the winner like we saw the how would how would Corsair feel I mean those guys might think like like not not personal computer culture the other PC culture I've never been right I don't believe in being PC I've never been PC I just don't like it yeah sure I can't I can't be it I copy anti PC but if you can't see the funny side in that joke then man your life oh you'd be surprised if you can't see how it could be fine like you know I mean like I can see how like say for instance I don't laugh at a lot of sitcoms but I can see how it's funny so I don't yeah I don't rag on it but yeah I guess that's like that's funny funny sir yeah maybe you do like yeah maybe you have a like a vote run like yeah I can't pull up on see okay so we'll go yeah we'll have a poll and then we'll have a poll on Twitter those are the three guys and then we'll pick the winner so congratulations though one of you three guys is gonna win Corsair and then headphones and crackling crackling Isis in there too with the RGB so that's four yeah that'll be our fourth one yeah and who was the other one again it was the at you the course the Coursera one discourse in the part the part the mate yet alright yeah Rodrigo thank you go so we got four potential so yeah let's get back to chat will answer a few more questions then we're gonna scoot and boot for you guys so any any questions that we need answered before we get on out of here hmm because I've got to go mow lawn today do you know that I did that yesterday oh you did good guy Greg GGG triple G man good guy great I'm on the lawns what did you come back did you come back inside like in your bit sweaty and laces like are

loans and then come back inside say what's up okay okay so okay so we got some questions coming in now and there's yeah so we got some questions coming in now and it's is odd CX 3000 scared of crisis I'm not sure like I think I'll take 3,000 will be like the crisis Conqueror like that's what I think 19100 k long-term investment or crap okay is gonna be fine it's just it's gonna be it's gonna be like that it's gonna be a good gaming CPU for another like three or four years at least so cuz new consoles eight cores 16 threads just put that into perspective they're gonna last for another four years well when they eventually yeah you're looking at like eight cores 16 threads being relevant for quite a while and then okay tweet tweet have you got to go Greg sorry yeah oh yeah Xen three performance yeah we just discussed that before Brian where's your cat ah oh yeah baquette that's sad yeah my cat passed man yeah yeah yeah I didn't talk about it on the channel bit like yeah it's just you know he was almost 19 - oh wow yeah we had a good yeah degree had a good run man it's just it's sad I think you see they like family members dude oh yeah no I can't even think about em yeah poor cheeky man poor cheeky so yeah it's just as though sad man so my poor cat passed and just a lovely cat he was just a you know we picked him from an animal rescue place so it's evil man yeah we will we get most like cats like that's how we've had our cats in the past we've picked him up off the street and just giving him a life man so yeah it's there just the cats are so beautiful man though they're just amazing that's why I was I did a tweet on Twitter about this chick who was throwing a cat or something and the cat like he saw it on the Don the stroke the cat the cat was just I've never seen a cat do it never in my whole life day we've lived with cats our whole lives never seen a cat that like hate its owner that much that was so good when I've been bitter yeah but but she she there was a stream before of her like throwing it right and she liked it climbed up in front of her stream and she like picked it up and like threw it like yeah it's not like she just kind of like tossed him or like you know here you go let me help you jump this way I should just straight through him over her bag or something like that yeah it was man I mean I know they're cats they'll probably be alright but you still don't just don't do something like yeah so yeah some dudes call me like some dates calling me about my $350 like four night gaming PC like he's like it's like man I really wanted I'm really what I was like that one's already sold so like yeah I gotta I gotta take down my ads man so I like yeah yeah that's the ballgame is remembering to take down the ones that you've already saw yeah all right so we got do I stream on Twitch no like not really I just don't have time man between doing like all the stuff on the channel making the vids for you guys doing the hostel and stuff I do want a stream but on Twitch but I think we'll just leave it to YouTube for now because look we got we got something comfortable going on here Greg is yeah he's a good co-host man I like the guy we don't we don't argue like it's it's the thing is like you got to find a dynamic right like we don't argue like who moon I hate Europe in units it's like yeah hurry up it's just like it's just a conversation man like chill out you know what I mean so yeah Greg's chill that's what I like man like if you you know you want to get old pretentious and stuff like that yet take a hike brother like
