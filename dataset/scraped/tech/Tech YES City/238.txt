about a week ago i bought a couple of rtx 3070s and just let me tell you straight up, I am feeling kind of insecure now that the rtx 3060 ti is here, this thing is pretty much a cut down version of an rtx 3070, except you're going to be saving a hundred us dollars or in australia you're going to be saving nearly 200 aussie dollars so it's coming in at 399 usd and then in australia's coming in at 688 aussie dollars (AUD) however you're probably curious to see how it performs. Let's roll those gaming benchmarks and then get back to what has unfolded here in today's review. [Music] [Music] [Music] so there's the gaming benchmarks all done and what we can see here is that this little guy right here packs a massive punch especially for the money and the closer we get to say a 200 dollar graphics card being released the happier i am i think as we drop those price points down where i feel like the lower that we go down in price the more we're not just giving people value we're also sort of making cards more realistic towards lower resolutions like 1080p and 1440p especially where i feel like the 3060 ti really does well at 1440p in both 1080p and a few things that it does also do really well is that the power consumption numbers are lower than any of the 3000 series cards and in fact it's the best performance per watt card that nvidia has out at the moment it's also further amplified if you want to get better power efficiency by the fact that you can undervolt this card. Now when i was under volting it i did drop the power consumption roughly down by about 50 to 60 watts depending on the benchmark and it did respond pretty well now the 3070 3080 and 3090 did respond a little bit better in terms of undervolting but that's because they're bigger cards and they have bigger power consumption from the get-go another thing too if you want to overclock i'm going to say that this is one of the first cards out in 2020 where you may wish to overclock where we only juiced another 15 watts roughly but we were getting now performance that was coming close to that of the rtx 3070 out of the box and the funny thing here is is that it was beating the 2080 super comfortably so you heard the rumors before this thing was released that it was going to beat out a 2080 super and it did so comfortably in the benchmarks that we tested here today now we did test out the different resolutions 1080p 1440p and also 4k and i feel like this card right here is coming in either as a 1080p or a 1440p champion with its 8 gigabytes of vram being that of the same as the 3070 however they have cut down the cuda cores and also some ray tracing performance versus the 30 70. though the biggest win is that you're still getting a really high quality cooler weighing in at over one kilogram and the measurements are coming in very similar to 3070 where it will be fantastic for someone who wants to use this in a mini itx rig especially considering it's got lower power consumption than that of the 3072 though speaking of the cooler we're going to look at the temps and noise in the fan speeds right now where it ramps up to roughly 52 percent out of the box scoring about 38 decibels of noise and that came in at 75 degrees c however this was tested in 29 degrees c ambient temperatures which is quite hot where i am at the moment so delta adjusting them to my usual temperatures we see here that this cooler is performing very well setting things up to 60 manual showed that you would either want to leave this at 60 percent constant or at the auto fan speeds for the best noise and temperatures going up to 80 and 100 did score lower temperatures but did increase the noise significantly going over the rear of the car you've got hdmi 2.1 as well as three display port outs and the two axial fans are measuring in 85 mil each and that is encased around with a metal frame with a shiny silver s like design on the front and then 30 60 ti riding on the back with g-force rtx printed on the side and requiring that 12-pin connector however nvidia do include this in the box it's a 12-pin to 8-pin converter and with all those details out of the way it's finally time to talk about who this graphics card is for right here now for me personally the closer we get down to 200 the more happier i get with graphics cards because not only are we alleviating a problem of all those older cards just really not being a good buy anymore but we're also being more relevant to i guess a lot more people where i feel like the 30 80 and a lot of the higher end cards coming out are really more catered towards 4k gaming whereas opposed to this card right here with that 399 price point it's really targeting those people who want to play high refresh rate 1080p 1440p and maybe don't mind turning the settings from epic to high or even going to low for competitive games and still getting really high fps this card is certainly going to do it now ray tracing you will get a decent experience if you want to turn on dlss 2.0 in games and drop the resolution down to 1080p however stepping it up to 1440p or 4k the ray tracing will drop significantly in terms of the performance but it still is enjoyable at 1080p that's what i was finding when i was turning on ray tracing in fortnite with dlss 2.0 on for example but the ultimatum with the 3060 ti in my opinion is it's kind of making the 3070 in a tough spot right now where i'd personally be going for one of these over the 30 70 or i'd be going for the 30 80. so it looks like the even numbers in the nvidia stack this time around are the cards that i would go for personally it makes me wonder if they're going to release an rtx 3040 now because the 360 ti and also the 3080 are definitely the cards that i'd be eyeing off personally this one being a hundred dollars cheaper than the 3070 really is punching hard in terms of value for money but the best thing about this card is is you're still getting that full suite of rtx broadcast you're still getting the new encoder which works really well if you want to stream and you're still getting that hdmi 2.0 out the back of this card supporting 4k 120 hertz if you're a competitive gamer on oled for example or playing dota 2 like i sometimes do on 4k oled this thing will do the trick and with all that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today's review of the rtx 3060 ti if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and in terms of the card itself it gets a big yes from the tech yes and we got the question of the day here which actually relates to those ambient temperatures and it comes from mr dwickster and they say 29c ambien so do you like that hot weather or do you like saving money on aircon and i'm going to tell you guys i i don't know what it is about me but i've grown up on where i'm at the gold coast i've grown up here my whole life and i've just been used to these uh ambient temperatures it gets a little bit hot i've got air con in here but when it goes over 30 and i get sweaty i guess when i just start getting sweaty that's when i turn the air con on sometimes in the past i haven't even had aircon and i've just been sweaty in videos and that's been pretty painful but usually for me even if it's hot in the moment it's like 27 ambient while i'm recording this i'm very comfortable with these ambient temperatures and it's kind of funny because some people aren't but then i've went over for instance i went over to thailand and that's been really hot in my opinion over there and then i've seen people wearing jackets and i'm like how do they do that so i guess it's one of those things i guess they call it climatized so i guess i'm climatized here to the beautiful gold coast weather and the benefit of that is is you guys get to see the hardware being stressed more than otherwise would at least compared to the 21c and 22c ambient testers out there hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon oh and also yes i can keep the aircon off and i can save a bit of money in the process too i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
