so in today's video we are going to show you how you can get these budget Zeon's off Aliexpress take them get the turbos on them to all cause max multiplier now there are a few steps involved in this process it actually can be a bit confusing depending on which motherboard you go with now I will be covering a lot of these x99 motherboards in reviews I'll be doing a full round up but from my knowledge they have different ways to update their biases and another thing is this is the first step you have to update the boss it's crucial to take out what's known as the 6f to microcode if you don't take this out you can kiss that v3 full turbo option goodbye so what we need it in order to do this is a USB bootable I've got an 8 gigabyte one here I've also got an extra one which I'll be using for the machinist x99 board you won't need this for the other Aliexpress boards like the one and Z and also the atomizer but this step is unique to the machinist x99 board because it has this special BIOS on board we'll actually a newer BIOS called the 1 to 8 JV which is an update over the bv which unfortunately in the JV they've added some new security features so there's only one particular way that you can update this BIOS it's such a tricky thing and I had to copy/paste it basically from Russian into English because the Russian guys figured out how to do it god bless those Russian guys they know their stuff I mean they go through all these special procedures one version of ami BIOS and then also on top of that they managed to figure out that you've got to do it twice the same code drop it in twice and then it works like amazing stuff anyway that aside we're going to need a few programs on this USB bootable in order for this to work the first of which is if you're using not the machinist board and everything else you're going to need a bias program called FP TW and it's a Windows Update ax but it's ok like you're going to be absolutely fine using this program and windows I haven't run into any problems as long as of course with usual precautions make sure the PCs stable and you don't have any bloatware a malware before you do this update in Windows the second thing we're going to need to do is get the v3 dot efi extract files and then copy them over to a Windows bootable UEFI install this is one of the most important steps if you don't do this right you won't again just like the BIOS update won't be able to get that full v3 turbo unlock and then after that moving into the last step we then have to update the windows and patch it with a genuine Intel DLL after we've done all those three things you can then just boot your PC up like any other PC and you've now got access to those all turbo boost clocks and of course on top of that you've got some ridiculously good value for money in 2020 let's start off this tutorial join me for the ride a tech yes City and let's find out how to get these things unlocked [Music] and before we get on to the steps 1 2 & 3 it's important that we've got to do the preparation and that is making abrew first bootable because it's the easiest program I put it in the description below for you guys so it's all part of the pack and basically what you do now is you've got to make your USB bootable to what's known as free dose so you can put in some of these commands and you can copy things later on so what I like to do is I like to get I've got here an 8 gigabyte as I said before I like to load in and make this a bootable but also copy all the files necessary for this whole tutorial so I'll load in all the folders with mmm tool the BIOS updates as well as the genuine Intel DLL patch and I'll put that all on this after I've made it a bootable so in order to make this a bootable Drive all you do is open this Rufus program and then click the free DOS option and then just call it what you want and call it v3 turbo boot drive and then click Next hit that up and then you're good to go now another thing after you make this bootable we copy all the folders that we're going to need for today's tutorial on there that's generally what I do but there's also another thing you need to do and that is copy the very air v files which will also be in a separate folder as well so copy/paste them across to this bootable Drive right here but also when it asks you to copy over the original files you have to select no and then we're good to go for the next steps [Music] now we're at step one and this step pertains to the boards like the Adam eiders as well as the one and Z's and so if you've got one of these boards you're actually fortunate enough that you can quickly get this bios update done as well as backup your original bios and you won't have to rely on downloading any files off the internet now of course for your convenience just like step two I'll put the biases in the description below for you so if you just want to quickly download them then you can get ready to just do basically half a part in this step so basically want to do now is we want to open up FP TW and then pretty much copy the bios that you've got on your PC and make a backup of this and so you use the command which I'm going to show on the screen here so we type in the exe file and then we press the spacebar and then we call it what we want and essentially what this will do is it'll now start reading the BIOS on the chip save it but after we're done with that what we can do now is grab that dot bin file and load it into the next program called mm tool and so I've included this again in the description below open up that image and then we've got to go to the CPU patch place and then what we want to do here is find the 6 f2 microcode if there's more than one of these say for instance using I think some of Zeus motherboards and azrog boards might have this two of these you want to make sure you delete the patch data on the 6 f2 lines so you click left click on that line of micro code there and then you just go to delete patch data select that and then click apply and then after that it'll pretty much remove that micro code update from that BIOS and so this is one of the most important steps as we said before because we're now letting these other drivers that we're going to install into the ufi install do the dictating on what these V 3 turbos can go up to in terms of all-cause though I will quickly interlude here and I will say don't go out buying an engineering sample on the v3 haswell's and expect to get the performance that you're seeing in these videos that I'm putting out here on the channel because the es samples even though they still have that microcode exploit they unfortunately don't have the turbo-boost hard grained into the CPU itself and so what this means is that even if you do this mod on engineering samples they just have no turbo clock to relate to and since the quality samples that's pretty much the pre retail release samples and also the retail samples they carry the 6 f2 micro code and the turbo multiplier and the exploit they're able to then take away that micro code update and then boost to all cause however that aside we've taken out the micro code update we can now save image and then call this what you want to call it say for instance just call it X 99 turbo dot bin and then after this we want to go back now to the command prompt and open it as administrator and then go into that FPT bios file location type in the exe file type in the name of our bin so in this case it's going to be x 99 turbo and then putting the force command as you see on the screen here hit enter and your BIOS should be able to update and so this is the thing you'll see on the screen here is because we're using the machine as board it's actually blocking us out due to the BIOS chip that they used in this particular motherboard so what we're going to do now is move over to step two which relates to the Machinists board only so if you don't have a machinist motherboard you can skip this next step because we've now updated the BIOS on whatever motherboard you've come to the table besides the machinist in this tutorial [Music] so doing this BIOS mod I'm going to take you guys through it with the machinist motherboard I feel like this board is going to be extremely relevant for a lot of people given it 70 USD price tag and its support for quad channel ddr4 memory and also support for native m2 nvme booting so this board packs a lot of features for that price tag which is impressive considering it's also got a thick I believe it's an eighth layer PCB so the build constructions good the VRMs decent and it's also got those added on features and USB 3 front out to so quite a feature pack board and so with that this is one of the best value for money options we're going to go through one of the hardest things to get around though with this board and that is simply updating the BIOS so this motherboard they're using a new JV chip BIOS on it and it does have some right protections and it is a little bit quirky to update for instance if you try and update this in Windows you're gonna be met with error messages and it's gonna keep spitting out error messages and in the case of me wasting a whole lot of time on this board I tried using two different flash programmers and they both didn't work despite one of them saying that it actually flash programs successfully so if you want to manually flash program this with a clip then you will I believe need a latest and greatest flash programmer that's up to date with 2020 models of BIOS chips or at least 2019 models coming out though in this case we're gonna use a food Oz and a fedora sensually there's only one version I found that worked I tried the versions off the website all were giving me error codes or just saying it was read and write protected and I just could not update the boss and even when I thought I had updated the BIOS in the end it actually didn't update the boss what we're gonna do now is download the BIOS pin in the description below so I'll put the links for two different biases and that's right this is where it gets complicated with the machine as x99 motherboard there's two different biases because they put two different boss chips on when they'll shipping them out I happen to have the 8 megabyte version but there's also a sixth megabyte version and so in order to find out which version you have you then have to type in a fatass I'll put the link in the description below for the version I'm using as well and Rufus so you have to make a bootable USB Drive first off and then boot the PC from that USB Drive and then in the DOS command prompt go to where you've stored a fado so I've used the drive called C Drive flash and then inside that I've got the aphid s XE file and I've also got the bin file for updating the BIOS however before I did this I have to check what boss I've got what chip I've gotten so order to do this we type in alpha dot space and then we type in the name so I just called a test pilot dot wrong and then space slash o and now this will save a current image of our BIOS on the motherboard and so what we do after that is we then pull the mother the USB stick out go on to our main computer or another computer and just check the file size so it's either gonna be 8 megabytes or it's gonna be 16 megabytes it in the case of mine as I said before I check here it's 8 megabytes so I then download the 8 megabytes updated BIOS and then I can go back into a fado snell and I'm ready to flash and so this is the next step so this is where you're gonna flash the new BIOS on that is missing that 6 f2 microcode update and this is important if you don't do this step you cannot get the unlocked multipliers at all so in order to do this we type in a fedora back to where I've installed aphid austin c drive flash folder alpha dos space and we type in i call it small so this is what I call it because there's two different bio sizes I called it small dot bin and then you have to type in space slash GaN org an and then you hit enter and it should now update the boss if you've done everything right now once this is finished I want you guys to actually do this one more time because I did this and on the first go it just did not update the boss for some odd reason so if you do this then you should finally have the updated BIOS in there missing that micro code update and how you can check this is like we did before we can then do another backup so we can call this last backup so alpha dose space final backup dot rom space slash o and then we can load that into our main computer just quickly and check via our mm tool and load image and then just check in that CPU patch area that that codes missing this should only be three lines there and if you if you haven't successfully done it you'll see four lines there with that 6 f2 code that'll still exist from 2018 if that's not existing anymore then you've done it right and you're now ready for the next step [Music] and we're going back now after a fresh install and after you've updated your BIOS you are now ready for step two and we can see here we've got our boot override or a boot priority which is Windows boot manager from the UEFI install but if we're going to save an exit will notice that there is a another option down here and that is the boot off the UEFI you disc that we created and so this now has a UEFI essentially EFI boot that we made from Rufus and then we copied those air five files over to the Rufus drive so as soon as we hit this it's gonna boot into what's known as shell and when we do this we want to hit escape straight away and so we're going to go escape before it goes with the startup dot gnash I think it means startup Kevin Nash that old wrestler but most important thing is up the top you'll see fs0 colum and then below the fs1 column and if you don't see both these FS texts then you've done it wrong and you have to either go back and reinstall windows as a ufi and make sure as we said before that BIOS that Windows boot manager is coming up first or at least it's an option to do that and second if it's not coming up then there might be another problem which I personally haven't come into whilst doing this mod anyway once we're in shell we can now get ready for the next steps of this process now the command we want a first type is load and then we want to type in FS 0 colon backslash to make sure it's not a forward slash and then v3 dot efi so this is that efi file that we copied before and it's also allowed us to boot to shell and we hit enter and we should see the text v3 - old turbo set if you're not seeing this text then you haven't done this properly so this is one of the most important steps to drop in here and then because all the ceilings are different essentially you might see in some guides out there might see there's a different code for this v3 efi it might be a different number like 7 7 1 b 4 or something like that that's just means it's pertaining to a different xeon chip that that person's used but you really want to make sure that you see v3 - all turbo set and then you can continue to this next step which is a CP and then we can type in FS 0 colon backslash and then V 3 efi AFI and then spacebar and then FS 1 colon backslash efi backslash boot and so what this is going to do is going to create a new folder on your windows drive this is your boot drive now it's copying this v3 efi fall into your boot drive and it should say copying ok so it's made the new folder it's now got the v3 efi turbo details and so we're now ready for the last step in the shell command and that is the type in bc FG spacebar driver space ad and then 0 space 0 space FS 1 colon backslash and then after this we will want to type in efi backslash boot backslash v3 efi removes this space and this is what you want to call it a v3 full turbo you can call it anything you want really bit i'm just gonna call it V 3 full turbo and then hit enter and it should say target equals 0 0 0 0 and it should also say below that B CFG ad driver 0 0 0 then we type exit and now we want to make sure if we've done this successfully or actually it'll continue on the windows but we want to reboot the system as soon as we can and now in the boot section we should see here V 3 full turbo so this is that option we enabled before and it's all good to go we can now proceed two windows and we're ready for the final step in order to get this as the online working and now it's a time for step free ladies and gentlemen that's right not three free because we've just freed up all those megahertz on that Xeon and the last final step is to basically install this patch in Windows which modifies the genuine Intel DLL file now the beauty of this is that it all comes in one swift folder with one easily clickable executable and all we have to do here is right click on this file and just open as administrator click yes and we're good to go and with all that aside you can now restart your PC for the final time and boot back into Windows and enjoy that all turbo core multiplier at the max turbo multiplier bringing out so much more performance out of these eons also making them so relevant for desktop enthusiasts and I hope you guys enjoyed this full tutorial but I will state some things to be careful of moving forward and that is apparently if you reset your BIOS it can mess up the turbo updates so do be careful with this and that if you take your CMOS battery out or in the future your CMOS battery runs dry and there's no power connected to the PC then you could lose the turbo boost multiplied and you may have to apply all these steps again the second thing to be wary of is if you change your oh s Drive then you have to make sure again that it's a UEFI install and then do from step two and onwards and that is apply the v3 efi files and inject them into that UEFI install and then apply that genuine intel dll mod and then you should be good to go again however all things aside if you've got this all done and everything's working fine and you've got your power connected to your PC and your drive doesn't drop out then you've got a gaming PC that is just incredible value for money it's taken a few extra steps to get here but when we look at these six and eight and twelve cause you're just going to get phenomenal value for money period and the good thing about this is the have all those latest and greatest instruction sets and the power efficiency actually isn't that bad and I'll tell you the best thing is the price of these Zeon's is ridiculously good though you Zeon's are all happy they're cheering your name but you just can't hear cuz they're cheering it in digital code I will tell you something that can be cheered and that is the question of the day which comes from pure sign and they ask can you use non-ecc memory or do you have to use ECC Ram with this and this comes from the previous video where we actually benchmarked the six core and put it up to the test against the horizon 530 600 and also the eye 590 400 F spoiler alert it did incredibly well I'll put the link to that video up here if you haven't seen it really good this is why these things are just blow me away all day every day go back to the question at hand no you don't need ECC registered you can use the normal unbuffered stuff the cheaper stuff in this case because ddr4 unbuffered is a lot cheaper than the registered ECC as opposed to ddr3 it's the opposite story but no you don't need it and in my video that I used yesterday we actually just use unbuffered just cheap off-the-shelf stuff for sticks I think two of them were crucial sticks and then two of them was some bangers I gotta file Express because I just wanted a test mixing and matching Ram and what the worst case scenario would be and pretty much the worst case scenario even on the RAM side of things gives you great performance due to the quad channel memory that these possess so yeah I hope that answers that question and with that aside of course I will say though you can still use ECC registered memory in fact there's a different versions of these that have the different code names you'll know if it's this code name that appears as one that has support for ddr3 if you don't find it on the ark dot Intel website basically like the 26 78 for example that's the v3 that's not on the Intel website and what we know from that is it was made for someone like HP requested these and had special requests from Intel and then they put in a ddr3 controller for that special request that made those eons then pretty much the same as a 20-6 atv-3 for example but even better because it now supports ddr3 both unbuffered and both ECC registered memories and so there's a lot to love about these things they offer so much really exciting times ahead of us and if you guys want to jump
