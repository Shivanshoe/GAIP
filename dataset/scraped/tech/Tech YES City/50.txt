what if i told you that the cheapest b660 motherboard i could find on aliexpress could handle a 99 12 900k you'd probably put me in back in my seat and say brian you're out of your mind and uh i would just say in response to that hey yo hey yo because we've got the soyo which has been a classic since 1985 and i never knew this brand even existed before i bought this off aliexpress but as always when i don't know something there's always that one guy in the comments it's going to write that comment and go brian where have you been bro i've been rocking so yellow motherboard for decades bro you're gonna get with the times and actually after checking out this motherboard i am indeed getting with the times because this is going to get a thorough recommendation so let's get into the details of the b660 soyo motherboard classic are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2. links in description below welcome back to tech yes city and what we've got right here is a board that's coming in at around 120 us dollars shipped worldwide and also if you're in australia it's about 173 aussie dollars now when i was looking for a b660 motherboard to do a roundup and do some tests i actually found there was nothing available locally for me until i after i ordered this then of course the main four brands like the msi the gigabyte the azus and the asrock boards they came onto the market so i ordered this before those boards came out where i am locally and i'm glad i did because this board it features a 10 phase vrm eight plus one plus one and that's covered with thick heat sinks both on the sides of those vrms and when i started doing the test i basically started off with an i3 12 100 f and as soon as i saw these temperatures coming out of this motherboard i knew i was in for a treat basically we were running a cinebench r23 stress test for over 10 minutes and we're getting temperatures of about 53 degrees on the surface of the vrm then on the heatsink that was about 40 degrees and this is in a 28 degree ambient environment which in my previous testing in the past when i've tested budget motherboards from aliexpress these numbers in comparison to those cheaper boards this is very impressive numbers i knew i was in for a bit of a treat so i then tested out the 12400f that uses up a little bit more power the results were very similar and also the clock speeds were absolutely fine getting the same of that as say a z690 tough gaming motherboard from a zeus now also what i found very curious was the power consumption on the cpu was displaying pretty much the same as it was on the z690 tough gaming but also it was displaying the same where it was drawing power before the vrm which actually means that they've included a very solid vrm especially for the price point so when you look at these numbers and you cross reference them with a higher end part you're starting to realize that hey they've actually the marketing claims with direct mosfet and all that other fancy jargon is actually living up to the test when you look at the real numbers so basically in a nutshell if you're looking for a motherboard that's inexpensive and is going to power say an i7 12 700 f i5 1200 f or an i3 12 100 f for a long time and do a good job of it then this motherboard is certainly going to pass the bill and the temperatures are very low so it's going to do a phenomenal job of that and you won't need to put any fans over the heatsinks or have any active vrm cooling because what they've got out of the box does a very good job though this is where i stopped and paused and i'm like since the temperatures were so good with the budget parts why not try an i-912 900k and in the past i've tried a 16 core on a budget motherboard and i mean it's been one of those cases where it's worked but it's been throttled heavily but of course everyone always enjoys a good laugh when you put these power hungry parts with budget parts and this is where i actually wasn't laughing where we had this board pushing the 12 900k out of the box with its four point uh it's going initially to 4.8 gigahertz but then it dropped down to four point seven gigs but the bottom line was that the cpu was drawing around 250 watts in cinebench r23 via this motherboard and when i tested the direct draw figures from the power meter that was going up a little over 300 so of course the vrm inefficiencies were starting to show a little bit at these power levels but of course a b660 budget cheapest motherboard you could find was never intended to run an i-912 900k but the good news here was it did pass the test after 10 minutes of testing however when i was drawing the temperatures for the vrm i did have to take off a fan that i did put over just for this particular test where honestly i didn't want the motherboard blowing up or dying because me personally it doesn't matter if it's a used part a new part a budget part an expensive part i honestly don't like damaging my hardware i like to get the most out of it and it's not just for the fact that i don't like destroying hardware of course i always want to resell it in the future so i do like to take care of the stuff even if it is the cheapest part on the market and so i did have some active cooling on this board and when i took it off for the temperature test it did throttle down to 220 watts and that also the speeds of the 1200k did throttle down also to 4.6 gigahertz and then the temperatures the heatsink was going then up to around 56 degrees and the surface temperature the hottest we measured was around 85 degrees too so this board's vrm was then starting to get a bit hot but remember this is the worst case scenario pretty much for a b660 and it's still past the test and another thing i did in order to get these speeds was i did have to go into the bios and up the power limits on both stage 1 aka pl1 and pl2 and so that enabled me then to draw higher power consumption numbers out of this motherboard where by default it will have 125 watts so basically it's good for all those f cpus out on the market out of the box this is going to do a great job of handling those cpus but if you want to take it with a higher end cpu just and you watch this video you can do it but i would honestly start to tune it a lot more with the bios itself and here's some actual good news about this soyo motherboard and that is the bios is actually pretty detailed you can get all the settings that you would get out of most mainstream budget motherboards on the market from the big four like msi give by asrock and azus but one thing i will mention is that the bios was very easy to navigate and dare i'd say they've actually done a better job than gigabyte for instance but regardless of all that bottom line is you've got a motherboard that performs very well for the most crucial component you need it to perform for and that is its vrm and its performance and tuning out of the box let's go over some of the other features on this board six layer pcb on the rear you've got six usb ports four of those being usb3 two of those usb two then you've got your onboard audio which is only three ports line in mic in and headphone out and here's where the onboard audio is mediocre and that's what i'm going to call it just mediocre flat out it's not the worst audio i've seen but it's certainly far from the best on-board audio i've seen as well and also the mic in port itself that's very noisy if you're using this with any sort of mic you'll definitely want to get a very sensitive microphone and have the volume levels at around plus 10 db 60 max after that you do start to get noise creeping in as for the crosstalk that is decent as well you will get a mediocre again experience out of this on-board audio but again coupling it with a budget pair of headphones like some cost ksc 75s this will do a decent job for someone on a budget and moving through m.2 you've got two of those ports one of those being pca gen4 you've also got the top slot being an x14 pci gen42 so if you want to use the newer graphics cards and you want that full x16 pci gen4 slot this will deliver that too you've got two ram slots for supporting ddr4 and in terms of the xmb profiles i was able to lock in 200 megahertz on this board absolutely fine which if you're on a budget that is going to generally be one of the best sweet spots to go with also included in the box you get a single sata connection cable and also your input output shield and probably one of the best features of this motherboard is of course the clear cmos button which is included and i love to see it fan headers we've got four pwm solutions and we've got a usb 3 out as well as three sata ports on this board though you don't get any rgb connections whether it's 12 volt or 5 volt so that might be a deal breaker for someone who is focused on one of the most important things of pc gaming nowadays and that is rgb now all that aside it's time to give this thing a recommendation but i will go over my critiquing points first because i'm going to give this a glowing recommendation for its price point phenomenal value very impressed with what you're getting here especially from a brand that i've never tried before and i've never heard someone talk to me about a soyo motherboard but let's go to the checking points first thing is the outputs on the back for the displays you've got four display outs and this i feel is excessive where they could have just included one display out on the board and then maybe gone with some extra usb ports and as well as put some of that money maybe into upgrading the onboard audio a little bit so that's my first critiquing point for this board having no rgb on board i don't really care a lot of rgb manufacturers they actually include their own system that plugs in via usb 2 and whatnot but the next point would be the bios itself there's no option to save profiles and i do like saving profiles especially when i'm tinkering whether it's under vaulting which we will have an under vaulting video coming out soon for the 12th gen stuff where there is some good gains to be had but i like to either undervolt or i'm clocking memory or something like that and i love to have profiles to go back to if i've gone too far off the tangent so i would like to see them include profiles but speaking of the bios they have done a pretty good job where it's easy to navigate and as we talked about before it's actually a decent job but they're also on their website even though it's in chinese it looks like they are committed to offering regular bios updates for this motherboard so they have pretty much hit everything out of the park besides those critiquing points and i don't think those critiquing points are a deal breaker in the grand scheme of things as the vrm is the most important part the onboard audio is decent and they've done a good job of hitting both those and including them at a price point that's affordable and it's shipped worldwide at a decent price so basically if you want to get on 12th gen and you want a board that looks like at least it's going to last a while at least from the build quality that i'm seeing here this board is going to be surprisingly a big win and i've never really said this about an aliexpress multiple before i have tried out some of those waning boards and machinist boards and they were good but they weren't impressive this board right here is impressive especially for what you're paying and what you're getting i think soyou have done a really good job and that's all i can say if you guys are looking to get into 12th gen on a decent price especially when we look at the inflation and what some of the other manufacturers are charging for their boards this board is definitely going to deliver and of course if you want to get a video editing machine set up you can get two 32 gigabyte sticks and add all that in and you've got nothing but straight value for money and i feel like this b660 motherboard here as long as it's in stock at the price that i'm talking about in the video 120 usd i feel like it's going to be similar to the snowman where the snowman was pretty much even up till this date is my favorite aliexpress product and my favorite cooler of all time where you're paying 20 bucks for a cooler that just does really well it beats out all the stock coolers i've tested and also beats out coolers that are twice its price and it does so whilst remaining very quiet speaking of platforms this here does have the mounting the b660 soyo for the lga 1700 but it also has back mounting holes for the lga115x so you'll be able to mount a snowman cooler absolutely fine to this board which i do recommend doing since the original intel cooler is not that good on 12th gen so i would recommend upgrading if you can but also if you want to put a snowman a lot of people ask me about lga 1700 boards with no back woods compatibility mounting holes this will actually fit on lga 1700 it's just a bit of an unconventional fit you'll have to turn those uh push pins in sideways and line them up for the lga 1700 and then it will fit perfectly and it'll work absolutely fine so hopefully that answers some questions for people who are wondering about that though in the end great price great motherboard very happy to have uh stumbled on this one and if you're looking for cheap 12th gen definitely get on the soyo and with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comments section below what you think of this board the performance and the looks love reading your opinions as always and of course have you heard of soyo which is apparently been around since 1985. love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from jojen kang and they ask was it 1600 af which is closer to a 2600 than the earlier 1600 ae and they're talking about yesterday's video where we tested out a budget ryzen 1600 used combo versus a budget i3 12 100 f combo so for that video we use the 1600 ae and that's because that's what i picked up off the used market for the set price now he is right the 1600 af is very pretty much at 2600 it's virtually the same thing and you will get better performance also some people critique me in that video for not overclocking and they're right i should overclock get the most out of the gear i've got but that said the recommendation would have been the same anyway and that is if you're thinking about going with 12th gen definitely look around especially if you want to get a mid-range gravis card and because this stuff even at 120 usd for the motherboard you can get a cheap ryzen combo with the cpu the ram and the motherboard for just a little bit more then you can put that money into the gravis guard and you're not going to see a whole lot of a difference on the mid-range as opposed to say testing this cpu out with some of the top of the line gpus which a lot of us guys on youtube we're guilty of doing when we test cpus out for max theoretical performance but in this case since the gpu price discrepancies are so big nowadays i'm going to be focusing a lot on just testing the budget stuff with mid-range stuff and giving you guys a different picture which even if i did overclock i would have just bridged that gap even closer and the recommendation would have stayed the same but i do hear you guys and i will overclock in the future i won't leave it out on the table hope that answers that question and with that aside that brings us to the end of the line with today's video if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content may wish to hit that sub button ring that bell to get the notifications as soon as they drop and i'll catch you in the next one very soon peace out for now bye you
