the ryzen 5 4650g in my opinion is a special APU and it's a special APU for a few reasons. The first being it was never sold to the mainstream desktop market, in fact any retailer where i am locally in australia doesn't hold these apus... And i tried really hard to get one of these because ASRock sent us out the desk mini x300 and they wanted me to test it with a 4000 series desktop apu and when i asked around i just could not get my hands on one of these in Australia at all period it just wasn't happening i even asked amd directly and they said yeah these weren't stocked in australia so i then went on a few different places and ironically i found it just available on aliexpress ready to be shipped for 200 us dollars now there is two other variants there is the ryzen 3 and also the ryzen 7 4750g now the differences between the ryzen 7 and the ryzen 5 is that you get two more cores four more threads but you also get an extra gpu cluster unit now the gpu portion on the ryzen 7 is clocked a little bit higher too but i feel for the extra money that they're asking for this apu on aliexpress the extra 150 bucks roughly i feel it's not really warranted for that extra price tag and coupled with the desk mini especially which has its own power limits in place i feel like the 4650g is that perfect sweet spot if you either want an apu or even if you want something that can double down with a few extra features versus the ryzen 5 3600 but let's go over the key differences between the desktop 3600 for example versus the 4650g the first thing is is that the apu portion is on board the 4650g the second thing is is that the level 3 cache size is different between these two cpu portions and that is that the ryzen 5 3600 will have more level 3 cache on board than the ryzen 5 4650g the next difference is the 4650g is actually clocked higher on both single core and all core counts out of the box and so we'll show up some gaming results pretty soon but this does help i guess if you want something that's relevant now and you can utilize that ap portion especially if you're a streamer for example and you want to offload the uh streaming encoding to the gpu portion of 4650g instead of your gpu you can get a few extra frames as well on that merit alone however the next key difference is the 4650g doesn't carry pcie 4.0 support whereas the ryzen 5 3600 does so say for instance if you're making a headless server and you need that pcie 4.0 support over an nvme for example then the 3600 may be a better choice and now that the intro is done we've got the details out of the way it's time for the most important thing and that is the benchmarks what with this right here this apu what you got here is three different scenarios which i've tested them all and the first is how does it compare against the ryzen 5 3600 let's quickly get that out of the way with now the next test that we're going to throw in here is the apu the 3400 g this is an important comparison because 3400g you can pick that up pretty much anywhere it's at retailers it's in stock but there are some key differences the 3400g has the zen plus cores so they are inferior to the zen 2 cores and a lot of people want the zen 2 cores because they perform much better and it's not just in the raw performance in ipc actually too the imc i found on zen 2 is a lot better than zen plus zen 3 versus zen 2 kind of a little bit debatable i feel like zen three over zen two is not as a biggest improvement as zen ii was over zen plus but the imc has improved and so that'll allow you to overclock your ddr4 memory higher all other things considered so in terms of outperforming the 3400 g it does just that with of course higher speed memory now if you want to overclock you can overclock through the bios though it's really not in my interest to overclock the apu not until they put rd and a2 and we'll talk about that soon because we're putting this mainly my purpose for using this at the moment is putting it in the asrock desk mini and so actually if anything i'd like to undervolt it but what we're seeing here with the sodium memory versus ddr4 is that there is some big performance differences it was actually quite significant meaning the sodium memory even at 3 200 megahertz this was holding us back and so dim generally like especially if you want to buy value sodium you're generally not going to get as good of speeds as the desktop stuff so for instance 90 aussie dollars i could buy a 16 gigabyte 3200 megabits cl16 and even slightly tune that better this was 66 megahertz cl 19. i had to tune it to 3200 mega to spend a little bit of time so there is that difference between the sodium and the ddr4 desktop memory but you can also see that in modern warfare there was actually a pretty interesting result and that was it was performing very close to a 1050 ti now with this uh desktop ddr4 memory it was sort of like it alleviated a bottleneck and the game was in the desk mini review we did say that we did experience some problems with warzone and that was pretty much alleviated once we use the better ddr4 desktop memory so there is a bottleneck with ddr4 memory and apus that's what i believe at least what i'm seeing here in certain titles and so if there is that bottleneck this is something we're going to talk about with our dna and why haven't amd put our dna in the apus i believe they haven't done it because of just that the ddr4 memory because what we used here on the test bench was 4 000 megahertz xmp 32gb kit and this stuff is expensive i mean i got it on the used market for a really good deal 220 aussie dollars for the 32 gigabyte kit they usually go for like half a grand aussie and so amd knows that the apu's appeal is kind of budget right it's it's appealing to people who want good value for money and so if they want good value for money they're probably not going to go out and buy the best ddr4 memory they can to get the most out of their apu and so i think what they're doing is they're going to be waiting to put rdna in the apus once ddr5 drops and i think that will alleviate a lot of the bottleneck issues that the apus would experience if they put our dna on current ddr4 generations because as we saw here with the sodium even though it's 3200 megahertz it's just not performing like that well it's not as performing as good as it could and so the ddr4 memory on the desktop really did show how much better it can get but again would i go out and buy an x570 a really good cpu cooler and some of the most expensive ddr4 memory to couple with a 200 us apu and the answer would be no so i think this apu right here and we'll move on to conclusion time now because i think with this apu right here it's a very nice unit and i think if you're in the market for something say for instance you want the six cores 12 threads in a very small form factor this is definitely going to provide that as well as the low power consumption i think i love it in these small x300s there's also people that have reported you can get a beta bias for the previous desk minis as well put that on and it will support the 4000g i'll actually talk to azeroth and see if they can release that beta bias for you guys if it's not out at the moment um because that's important to get yeah people want the most value for money when they buy these apu's and the desk mini definitely offers good value for money but another thing is too is i think these apus they're good also maybe perhaps a budget streamer that's going with a mid-range graphics card and for instance you can get a ryzen 5 3600 for around 200 us you can get this for around 200 us as well and so you can utilize those extra gpu cores if you're streaming just offload to the apu's encoder and that's going to help you out a little bit on performance so there are some extra advantages to going with this thing on the desktop as well just keep in mind if you're going with a dedicated desktop machine and you want dedicated graphics or like dedicated graphics performance i'd go with a dedicated gpu but it doesn't help to say that this apu is not a bad purchase at 200 i like it of course i'm not blown away by it but i think it does have its purposes as we previously discussed and i think if you're in the market for either those two purposes it's going to serve you very well if you're just going to get this for a ryzen 5 3600 like replacement and you're going to use a dedicated graphics card i'd try and get a ryzen 5 3600 for cheaper where you are especially on the used market because essentially these are from what i believe and what i see they are being sold as used on aliexpress so do keep that in mind then there's the last question that i had personally and i'm probably sure a lot of you guys want to discuss too so make sure if you've got an opinion on this to drop a comment below and that is why didn't amd release these pro apus on the desktop to mainstream retailers for the average consumer and i think they've only released it to the business the business model market my opinion on that is is that they didn't want to confuse the consumer they didn't want people going out and buying these apu's over the ordinary cpus the ryzen 3000 because this was released before as n3 and that's probably why now after zen 3 launch you're suddenly seeing them pop up on retail channels even though aliexpress is unconventional i believe you're seeing it pop up on aliexpress now because it's like okay it's not a big deal now but i believe they stopped it from being sold beforehand because the four thousand especially like 4650g might confuse people oh should i go and buy a 4650g instead of a 3700x or should i go buy a 4750g instead of a 3900x i think they didn't want that out there in the market that's because that's the only thing that makes sense to me because the value of this product is pretty good because if this thing came to me for a review back when it was launched i would have been like it's not a bad product serves its market serves it well but then i thought about i'm like okay why wouldn't this come out to the average desktop user and that it's kind of like the only thing that makes sense to me anyway with that aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comment section below if you've got any questions or comments about this 4650g right here and with that aside we have the question of the day which comes from kanye 2003 and they ask isn't fortnite locked at 60 hertz and did you try turning performance mode on and yes i tried turning for performance mode on and the game is locked at 60 hertz at both 4k and 1080p and it kind of sucks that they would launch the console like i mean fortnite's a big draw card it's a huge drawcard i know a lot of you guys out there don't like fortnite but fortnite has been a catalyst for my channel at least my personal life selling pcs it's been a huge game anyone that sells pcs will know how much of a draw card fortnite is and so it's a big draw card for the ps5 and the xbox series x and so i'm not sure why i've got to test the the xbox series x out still but i'm not sure on the ps5 why would they lock this game at 60 hertz especially at 1080p like it's a huge draw car they really need to get on that when they're launching such an anticipated console i feel like they need to optimize this stuff because i feel like this is what draws people to pc is essentially all the customization the options you have now i'm all for people coming from console to pc because i do want to take a look at these consoles as objectively as possible but at the same time it's hard to when they launch i guess an experience that i wouldn't expect like i mean the rtx 38 when that launched i was able to unlock 120 hertz at 4k that was absolutely fine and that's a lot harder to fix i guess with the amount of different hardware configurations available than the ps5 which is only one hardware config and so i would have liked to have seen them get that right from day one but anyway i'm sure it'll be fixed with firmware updates i'm sure you'll be able to unlock higher fps but it does remain to be seen if they can like how soon can they get around that because for me i feel like the ps5 is just a very limited launch right now i i feel like you're gonna have to wait about three to three months to really start getting excited about these consoles because they're just launching at the moment feels like they're just making everyone beta testers that's the usual trend hasn't changed with consoles anyway hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
