what happens if you buy a brand new
computer or you build a new one yourself and you get a faulty ryzen cpu
well in today's video i'm going to go through this ryzen 3
3100 right here and we're going to look at how
it actually is faulty compared to a normal ryzen cpu
and this was the weirdest thing because i went to boot this thing up again after
i did the review and it still runs the cinebench scores
and it still does the cpu side of things absolutely fine but there's one big
problem it has where it can't communicate with the
graphics card properly and actually the behavior
differs from an nvidia card to an amd card now in the past i've only had
actually one faulty cpu that still managed to do a
little bit of work here and there and that was an
intel cpu i'll put the link to that video up here
but what happens if you get a faulty ryzen cpu
well in today's video i'll explain the best i can
about what the symptoms are of this cpu and what are some of the things that you
can do if you come in to this very and i'm
going to say this extremely rare situation and before we go on i
will say yes i've tried everything different motherboard different power
supply different memory and different graphics cards of course
different ssd and it is definitely the cpu and i know
there's going to be one guy in the comments he's like
dude have you even tried telling it not to ride on the highway whilst listening
to inxs yes sir i have even tried that do you
own a smartphone in 2020 well
i'm guessing most of you do and in that case today's video sponsor philmore go
has a very powerful free video editing software and it's a very powerful tool
where you can edit clips on your mobile phone or even import clips
from other camera sources and start editing with even one hand
it's got powerful transitions to choose from and the best thing is
it runs really smooth for a smartphone i was actually blown away
by how cool this application is so if you want to download it or find out more
information about fillmore or go then i'll put some
links in the description below for you guys
let's get back to the video so here we are now
in windows and what we can see now is the
display adapters here the 5600 xt is showing an exclamation mark next to
it and so naturally one would think if they
built their whole pc and they were seeing this
exclamation mark here they probably think wow my my graphics card's faulty
and this graphics card believe me it works on every other system here
in my studio so i know it's not the gravis card and so that's when i started
testing out everything else and i was like wow this is the cpu that's faulty
but this is a bizarre thing it locks in the
display resolution at the native 1080p it's as if the graphics card drive is
installed on the amd side of things but it's
not installed so if we even go to boot up something simple
like the unigine heaven benchmark which we'll quickly do now
it'll just crash out it won't do anything so let's quickly do that
so this is what happens when we boot up unigene heaven it gives us this
fatal error here and it spits out like a mammoth list of errors so
this is getting to be a little bit interesting so what we're going to do
now is jump into the bios and just see what's going on but one
thing i will say with this problem right here
is it's actually a little bit dangerous because this is the one reason and this
is how i initially knew something was terribly
wrong was i booted up my system and usually when i boot up my test systems
i've got 20 other things here to do in the studio
and then this whole system just shut off like i was like why did this
shut off and then i felt the gpu and it was burning hot so this gpu
currently basically the fans are not spinning and
even in idle the gpu will still use up some
power so the problem is is that it's just going to keep getting hotter and
hotter and hotter and then it will just switch off and
thermal like thermal throttle and thermal trip
and so that's a dangerous thing because this faulty cpu
could cause the gravis card to become faulty if it gets too hot i mean usually
the safety measures are pretty good but if you become unlucky in some
scenario it could make your gpu faulty
so when we're looking in the bios here nothing is out of the ordinary
everything was on default values the memory wasn't even overclocked either
however what we're going to try to do now is what i call a hail mary attempt
and then we're just going to up the voltages of literally
everything and see if we can get something different
out of this cpu this is the final attempt before we move on to
the behaviors on say an rx 470 and also an nvidia graphics card
um excuse me brian but have you tried just simply turning it off and on again
i've tried that i've tried reinstalling the drivers on different ssds like 10
times even with the hail mary voltage throw at
this cpu right now it's unfortunately still not working
this this is no chance for this but what i'll
quickly show you is something really cool and that is it
still runs a cinebench r20 [Music] [Music]
so this graphics card right here i'm glad i got this on camera because this
one just went to like a void where it made the whole
screen like sort of like a cream pixel color
and now it's actually restarting so you would think
just like the 5600 xt that this is a faulty gpu but we'll quickly try
um the last thing we'll try is an nvidia gpu one that i've actually never tried
before let's go with a gtx 645 old school and so this thing
actually boots up into safe mode and within safe mode it's
saying that the gpu the rx470 is being displayed properly but upon
trying to boot up a benchmark again unfortunately we are met with an abrupt
end let's finally try that nvidia gpu but it still says here as well like pci
device so i'm guessing the pcie controller is
what's really busted in this cpu [Music]
and then the cpu said to the gpu in a bogan-like voice
sorry can't help you mate so instead of finishing this video off last night i
decided to do a bit of research and digging on
google to see if anyone else has had this particular problem
and from what i could see is there was only maybe one person who potentially
had this problem it's just they never really replied to
the thread so you never knew but the symptoms they were talking about
were pretty much exactly the same as me but
the thread sort of put it down to the power supply and motherboard and stuff
like that and here's the funny thing after
thinking about it i was i went back and there was one reply on
the thread that said try all the different pcie lanes
i had tried only the top two pcie lanes or the 16x slots
on my motherboards now with a lot of am4 motherboards
the bottom slot even though it's a 16x slot is actually truly an x4 slot
and it runs off the chipset rather than going directly to the cpu
so what i decided to do here was put it on this real like at the bottom of the
board where it then blocked out the power button on
my test bed and trust me it was kind of awkward trying to turn the pc on you're
like going hey yeah trying to do a little like uh
flick shots in there to get your power button on but
anyway we gotta boot it up and the graphics card is now being
recognized completely normal and it's benchmarking absolutely fine
so that was definite proof that the cpu has buggy pcie lanes
and so this right now is just an extremely rare example of
what can happen in the land of pc or it can happen really in any
new product with electronics on it you can get a weird fault that makes it
through testing phases but then after a few
weeks of using it something just becomes faulty and really
what we put it down to now is what you can do if you come into a very
rare scenario like this and the news is kind of fortunate and
unfortunate depending on which side of the fence you're on
i know a lot of you guys out there who watch my channel you guys delve in a lot
of different hardware especially used stuff
and the good thing about that is if you've got spare motherboards and spare
power supplies and spare memory and stuff like that you can
quickly diagnose what the problem is in my case i changed
the motherboard the gpu and uh the ram and the power supply and
straight away i was like okay it's really just the cpu that's left to go
and so it only took me a small amount of time to figure out what was wrong but
if you're in that side of the fence where you've got the spare hardware or
you've got a friend who has a very similar setup and you can quickly
diagnose via pretty much trial and error what the problem is then
you are on what i consider the fortunate side of the fence
but then we move on to the unfortunate side of the equation and this would be
someone who's built their first pc and they don't have someone close by or
they don't have any compatible hardware to test out what could be
potentially faulty now in this case the worst case scenario
would be you've bought all your components from
different hardware vendors and you don't exactly know what the
problem is because if you take a working graphics card that maybe in this case
appears faulty back to the hardware vendor they're just going to get it and
say hey there's no problem with this graphics
card send it straight back to you and then you're going to be still scratching
your head and then you'll have to eventually be paying all
these shipping costs and all this time and money when it could have been
something else that's faulty so in this case i would say coming out of
this video if you're building your first pc and you're gonna be buying all the
parts individually i would try to buy them all from the
same retailer because this when i built my first pc there was a place
um about 40 minute drive from where i was
and it was called game do computers and i bought all my components from that
same retailer now i actually had a faulty stick of memory
and so when i built the whole pc i'd bought all the parts from them built the
pc and i said to them when i took the pc there i said guys i built this pc but i
bought all the components here and when i play brood war it's just
randomly crashing out and they then took the pc they said
we'll take a look at it they called me the next day and they said yep one of
the sticks of memory was faulty and so because i bought all my
components from there they were happy to take that whole pc that i built
and run some diagnostics for me so i guess that was one of the benefits of
buying all the parts from the same retailer but
i guess of course if you go out and buy from different retailers on sales you're
going to get a better price performance rig put
together but if it's your first pc and you don't have any friends that have
similar hardware or you don't have any spare hardware
to test things out on i would recommend just going from that one retailer
just because of what you've seen in today's video here
so now back to the ryzen 3 3 100 and if you're a consumer and you've bought a
cpu and it's faulty you can get warranty on that you've just got to return it to
where it came from and they'll replace it for
you no problems amd however they won't i think warranty
bent pins so that's one thing do be careful with your hardware
and don't make sure it's not physically damaged in any way shape or form
but in terms of the cpu i've got here it's going to be a very different story
because this is a review sample so i'm not sure
how warranty works with review samples the only faulty part
that i've had that i've claimed on and i have
had a couple of like minor issues with parts in the
history of the channel but there's only been one that's just been flat out bad
and that was an rtx 2080 ti from morris and they they took it back
they sent us out a replacement they really wanted to fix that for us
and amd i'm i've reached out to them they want
to do the same thing but i want to keep this cpu because it's
so rare like i've never seen this problem and even on the internet i can't
find a proper thread with this problem in it and so my
thinking is is it's like that uh if you guys i remember like when
i was a kid i used to collect basketball cards and there was a thing called
misprints and a misprint could be worth some some
good money as a collector so i kind of see this cpu
as kind of like a misprint where it was it just came out the
factory and it still runs cinebench and it still works when you use the chipset
pcie lanes so it's um just one of those rare things
that i kind of want to collect personally
and uh yeah that i mean that might be a weird outcome from this video but
i guess weird host weird outcome what did you guys expect anyway
recapping today's video the most important thing to come out of this is
that if you're building pcs you are going to
sooner or later come into faulty hardware
and it's just one of those things that happens and it's not the company's fault
in this case it's certainly not amd's fault
they sent me out of cpu it was absolutely fine and then it just
something happened it went bad and in the case of the rtx 2080 ti same
with auris they they it came out of the factory
absolutely fine then something went bad and so as i said before it usually goes
bad very quickly in the first couple of months if it's
prone to failure and in this case that's exactly what happened
so if you come into this situation just understand that there are steps to
diagnose what is wrong and the best way to do that and i mean
seriously the best way to do it is trial and error swapping out the
parts and you will find out what is faulty
sooner or later via that process and that's really the
only way i do it here at the studio it's the only really way i recommend
doing it because that way you'll get visual proof and you know exactly what
the problem or faulty part is and so once you find that faulty part
make sure you go get it fixed and the other thing is is don't run
faulty hardware if you know something's bad or it's not running right
turn it off because you as we saw in today's video earlier on
the fans weren't spinning up on my gpu that can cause
failure on another component anyway realizing life
that can happen and i think eminem and d12 they wrote a track back in the day
about this exact thing so it happens the way you deal with it is just take a
step back be calm look for any research that you can and
of course trial and error is always going to be your best friend
in the case of diagnosing faulty pc hardware and with that aside
i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did then be sure to hit that like
button for us also let us know in the comment section below
what kind of faulty hardware have you come into in the past
and what were the symptoms and how did you go about fixing it love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the
day here and this comes from pidspuder place and
they ask would the results be different if you taped the mouse to an intel
box or maybe a zen 2 cpu box just asking for a friend and they're
referring to the last video we did on input latency with amd versus intel and
i even threw in nvidia versus amd gpus i'll put the link up here for that video
it's definitely a cool watch if you're into that sort of
very like minute differences in hardware and stuff like that
um but spoiler alert it wasn't that eventful like it's not
you know you're not really gaining a huge competitive advantage by going with
one over the other uh anyway to answer that question what
have the results been different on an amd cpu box with a zen 2
box or a intel box and the intel box probably yes
because a lot of those intel boxes are skinny so the contraption might have
fallen over and it could have been damaged the zen 2
box no because i think the shape of the actual box is pretty much the same in
dimension so the reason i picked that box was uh i
was looking this is how i do things around my studio
i'm just like we're making this contraption
and i think i even made a whole video on how i made this thing it took a long
time and we're just looking around and i've i
i'm like okay i need something that's this this tall it'll fit in the frame
but it won't block the monitor out and i it needs to be quite big because i
need to put the mouse on top the light on the side
and we just there's an amd box staring right at me i'm like
perfect and i even use a i think it's like a 3 900
x box under my monitor now with the tech yes loving taped
over it the logo and stuff like that so amd boxes
they're pretty handy for not just having holding your cpu you can use them for
other things around the house i think someone's even used them for a
tissue box and yeah i've gone on long enough guys if you guys enjoyed this
video and you've stayed this far and you enjoy that content you want to
keep seeing it the moment it drops here at the channel
may wish to consider subscribing hit that sub button ring that bell
and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon
y'all have a great weekend and peace out for now bye
