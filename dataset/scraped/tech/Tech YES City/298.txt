everywhere you turn your head you turn to the left people are talking about rtx 3000 you turn your head to the right people are talking about rtx 3000 even console fanboys are talking about rtx 3000 right now that's how much of a buzz this is making but not many people are talking about rtx 2000 and more specifically getting a rtx 2000 deal which is what we're going to do right now we're going to head up to brisbane where i found a rtx 2080 ti for 800 aussie dollars and in my previous video i said this was the max i was prepared to pay so one's come up i've put in an offer of 800 from 900 and they've accepted so what we're going to do right now is we're going to go get this thing and then while we're up that way because it's a little bit of a drive about a 40 minute drive for me while we're up that way i'm going to check out more rtx 2000 deals on the road so strap on in come join us we'll pick up some used deals but also in today's video we'll touch on the rumors of the rtx 3000 supply side issues that could cause people to not get one of these cards at least in the first couple of months but let's hit the road first [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we just got that 2080 ti and the person was kind enough to actually let us inside their house and show it up all up and running and working so that's always a good thing to make sure you're confident in buying one of these cards so 2080 ti a zeus model it's looking pretty good but while we're up this way i'm actually going to jump on good old gam tree and see we can also find some more like 2070s 2080s and even 2080 ti's for decent prices because if you're going to build a gaming pc in the next couple of months i mean if you can pick up one of these 280 ti's for a good price then regardless of rtx 3000 that's still going to be a pretty solid deal nothing like a bit of old-school good old gambtree hi this is joshua community services so they didn't pick up their phone i just sent them a text message putting down an offer of 500 aussie dollars for the rtx 2080 um let's just jump on facebook quickly see if there's any other deals while we're out on the road so spending about 10 minutes now we've gone through a good old facebook and also a game tree and we found an rtx 2080 and that's available for they wanted 650 for it i offered 500 they've come back at 550 so i'm like sure i'll go pick this up because there is one more factor that we'll talk about later that has come to me in the whole time that i'm hunting these cards and i just realized that when i picked up this 2080 ti now but we'll talk about that soon because while we go pick up this deal we've also put out a few feelers there on rtx 2060s and also 2070 supers so hopefully they get back to us now the 5700 xt's i've been keeping an eye on them too but they're going for like 600 aussie dollars brand new from the stores and then i'm seeing people on marketplace and stuff ask more for their 5700 xt so it looks like at this point in time there's really only a sell-off happening with used rtx graphics cards at least where i am in the world that's on the beautiful gold coast but i'm up in brisbane which isn't the beautiful gold coast but it's actually a nice day here it's pretty good it's pretty beautiful up here too [Music] so we've just finished up picking up that rtx 2080 that checks out aok and the guy ended up actually upgrading to a 2080 super and he knows about the rtx 3000 series so he's just getting rid of it now the 2070 super i put down an offer of 480 they message back they said someone's picking up for 600 then there was also a 2060 which they got back to us and they just said they were holding firm at 4 30. so we're gonna head back to the tech air studio now and we've already picked up two satisfactory deals [Music] so straight away this rtx 2080 ti and rtx 2080 that i picked up they're aussie pricing so when you think of the usd pricing 500 usd you've got to add 10 percent on for us guys down under and that is 550 usd because we pay 10 tax and 770 usd automatically that's how we have to think of the pricing so when we convert that and we look at the 2080 ti that i got for 800 aussie dollars that's pretty decent deal and then the 2080 for 550 i'm happy with those prices but one thing that we're going to talk about is the rtx 3000 demand from everyone i'm talking to the demand is going to be huge for these new graphics cards so with that unprecedented demand you're going to see at least initially this big big wave of orders for the 3080s especially when that comes out and i think retailers in australia there's word on the street that they're going to limit it at one per customer and then there's this other group that a lot of people aren't talking about and that is businesses in rtx studio a lot of workstations are going to want to get the 30 80 and also the 30 90 for that hdmi 2.1 and also 8k video editing and stuff like that so there's going to be not just demand from the gamers for these rtx cards there's also going to be demand from the business side so these two factors together i feel is just going to make rtx 3000 demand through the roof and so supply is pretty much going to be a stable thing but demand initially is going to be huge and so with those two things in mind i feel like the rtx 3000 launch is just going to be a roller coaster now of course there's the performance figures and this was the other thing that came to mind when i was picking up this 2080 ti and that is you've noticed that a lot of the benchmarks pretty much all the benchmarks you're seeing is pretty much only 4k performance at this point in time and i feel like nvidia is doing that because if they show 1080p numbers there's going to be massive cpu bottlenecks in a lot of the games but then that relates back to how many people are actually going to be playing at 4k even to this date the majority of gamers are on 1080p and 1440p and 4k is still kind of a niche yet we're seeing all these benchmarks for 4k and so a 2080 ti is still going to be an absolute king card for people playing at 1080p 240 hertz and then of course if you're going up to 360hz you're still going to need a cpu and memory that's top end to be able to utilize that graphics card so really when you think about it the 38 in especially the 30 90 these are going to be more 4k gaming cards which we have to sit back and weigh up the question of are you going to be gaming at 4k and so when it all comes down to it you've got all these factors now that is just piling up to one of the most interesting if not i think it's going to be the most interesting launch of any tech product in enthusiast pc gaming in history where you've just got this massive market of pc gamers then you've got all these different resolutions all these different settings and so how's it going to play out that is going to be one thing to wait and see and so i just feel like all the content that's going to be coming out is going to be really cool so if you guys have like specific tests that you want to see with rtx 3080 versus 2080 ti's and 2080s and stuff like that do let us know in the comment section below and so two years ago i feel like when rtx 2000 came out especially the 2080 ti it was pushing the boundaries of how much are you actually going to want to spend on a gaming pc so with this new launch that question is really going to get revisited big time it's something that i'm going to be looking at personally but in the meantime however if i'm picking up these rtx 2000 cards under half the price of what they're going for retail here in australia i know one thing i'm getting a good deal where the maximum gain i saw on rtx 3000 cards not even factoring in that 10 gst was around 190 value increase so i'm weighing it all up and the deals that i'm getting here i feel like are right on my safety level i'm not going to be losing too much if these cards come out and they perform with that especially with the 3080 versus the 2080 with that 80 boost so in the meantime between now and the launch of these new gpus i really don't know exactly what's going to happen but that i guess in a sense gives a bit of excitement does it not i mean if you knew what the whole rest of your life was going to be like and it was mapped out wouldn't that be a little bit boring and so in ways i feel like us humans we uh even though we don't like to admit it we kind of thrive on chaos and so if there's that uncertain factor it does make things exciting and that's exactly what this month the start of this month and after that launch announcement i feel like just things have been so exciting and so with that every morning that i wake up i just can't wait to hit the record camera and just talk about pc tech because yeah that excitement's coming back anyhow if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comment section below what are the big questions on your mind right now and if there's any really cool things that you guys want us to make a video on then i'll definitely entertain that for you just like this question of the day here which comes from kawasaki and they ask 500 for a 2080 ti seems like a good deal dot dot dot until you remember that the rtx 3070 will be faster for the same price and i feel like this is one of those things where the 3070 i feel will come in the same league as the 28th ti but will there be big differences in certain areas in certain games where the 2080 ti could be more beneficial so that's one of those things i can't wait to see honestly and 500 usd for a 20 dti that was my max price that i recommend people paying for at the moment and of course at this point in time i don't recommend anyone pay any more for that because you are then risking losing money when the 3070 is not far off launch however there are some differences in that of course the 2080 ti does have 11 gigabytes of vram versus the 8 gigabytes on the 3070 and they are both still gddr6 despite the 3080 and also the 3090 having gddr6x and of course it remains to be seen as the 3070s memory is that being pushed at a higher speed that's not able to be overclocked that much as opposed to 28 ti's which you could get a decent sized memory overclock out of i do know one thing up until this point in time rumors and speculations have been quite a bit off as we saw with the live stream announcement from nvidia themselves where the day before people thought the configuration of the cards were much different to what we saw from that live stream announcement so we have to wait and see and i hope you guys are excited just as i am and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then be sure to hit that sub button and ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one soon and of course we've got amd's reply everyone's waiting for amd's response to the rtx 3000 as well as the new consoles like these last few months of this year are going to be shaping up to be some very very tech heavy month so hopefully your tech enthusiast adele is pushing out of the camera frame i'm out of here i'm out of here i'm going to get back to making some more hat hair cat hair ray traced [Music] yes
