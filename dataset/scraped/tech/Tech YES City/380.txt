it'll take you away from that page okay cool yeah all right so we should be live now um that's what we should be alive okay can you talk to me like we should be live and check one two check okay so you should be live okay we should all be live everyone should be live everyone should be happy and here we are with text something welcome back to another episode guys I hope you have been staying safe and you haven't been losing quality control up here so I'm sorry I just got hit by an ad oh okay okay cool yeah so Chat Chat is poppin I am joined here by a longtime friend Darth Darth Jar Jar and Greg Salazar Greg yes is all yo yo sorry oh yeah it's like super late yes so basically when we start off these live streams guys I'm a live streaming just I got to make sure it's everything's right so it takes a little bit of time to make sure it's all right once we know it's all right audio is coming in fine from Greg myself once we know this is good then we can start streaming for you guys because we've got a pretty hot live stream here today we've got Rison 330 103 300 X news this is what it's all about this is I mean so let's just we'll get straight into these topics because then we'll go to chat and we'll chat with the viewers about the whole situation right now because things are getting so weird everywhere everywhere in the world I think I think it's not just like over in the US you can tell me about what's going on but in Australia here everything's closing down like we're talking use parts supply lines new parts supply lines and I mean I check prices of new pcs right now and you know how much it costs to get a from a retailer an RX 574 gigabyte machine do you know how much it costs yeah ozzie dolls take a guess I don't even know what your conversion I guess that's about 64 cents so like okay yes one is a hundred bucks in the ballpark no no I said like I'm told about system the whole system with an Rx for 570 as the main graphics Callie it's the main centerpiece of this whole rig so retailers are charging around 1500 Aussie dollars for an Rx force 570 rig right now and it's like what CPU what platform amazing I'd be like you'd be like Rison 2600 I think like it would be like a chi DT like 18 core to me it's just like prices and you can't blame a man everyone's running out of stock like prices is just going through the roof right now and oh man I would talk about like one of I know another guy on the coast here he sold like literally sold a potato for like 750 Aussie dollars and I was like what like how did you like your markets being affected like much more harshly than ours it would be yeah it would be because I'd Bentley say because of the I'd say your market will be getting affected right now because didn't that helicopter drop just happen no it was a few I mean we're at peak in some states and some states are already starting to taper off now so we're like right in the middle of it I catch slightly on the downward okay okay so what happens is then like we got that check through like about over a week ago so it's just been flowing through and people have just been like snapping up rigs left right and center that's like they should have called it like gaming PC stimulus because it's like the perfect amount of money just to give people a go at getting some tech and see because well because they've closed off all public places see the last time a helicopter drop happened in Australia people just went and blew it all at usual spots like the Cass you know this time around they can't do it so yeah and it's like we got a first Super chat as well we got I am in Australia awesome and fellow Aussie and it costs lots for CPU GPU Ram yeah exactly so it's it's nasty here man it's nasty dude so that's why I'd like literally that's why you see potato on earth that's the birth of it because you know what you could do you could by a bunch of parts here in the states I'll ship them to you assuming your import duty taxes fees all that crap aren't too high you'd probably still make if you bump your margins up a good bit we could do that I mean yeah we work something now man we'll work something out so but yeah we got a week any but any news for you to report before we get into the juicy tech news hear from Tex something is there any news that you want to say look Brian this is so important in the tech scene right now okay I want to show you guys this I don't know if anyone's seen it yet so Lisa put this together and it's just an msi dragon blade can we get that off strain man just get that off it's fake Lego but I think it's really cool it's like it looks minecraft all right we'll go into the first story then alright so let's do it oh come on dude you know how cheesy that thing looks in real life let you go to play I'm gonna critique straight away be honest MSI you go to your booths and stuff at like events and you see this like cartoon dragon it's like can we get a real dragon like you look at here we get a real drag that is not a real track and their logo looks cool I mean come on that they have one of the coolest looking logos you gotta admit are you getting paid are you getting paid to say that no it's just straight up I just think they have one of the coolest we got him we got him all right so we got a Verizon three 3300 ex starting off this news it's a room from WC CF tech we don't know how accurate it is yet but it seems pretty concrete in what we're reading here rise in 331 hundred and the release the base clocks are to be determined by basically one hundred and nine dollars and a hundred and thirty nine USD right what are you thinking with this do you like either of these CPUs I know you're probably gonna say rise in five sixteen hundred AF and this is the thing before we even get into the risin fire everyone's saying that understand just heads up they're all saying that why would I buy this by just 1800 s so yeah yeah but before we get it yeah but before we get into that right before we get into that argument that CPU isn't available everywhere we've seen that with certain countries certain stock supplies I mean we did get it in Australia for 149 Aussie dollar bills only at one retailer so they had to pull some strings so yeah I mean I'm looking at the 3100 and I'm liking what I see but I really think that's good if you've got 109 bucks you can get latest into IBC and it's going to give you better fps and the 1600 AF will in a lot of titles this big yeah that was I was that was something I had said right at the beginning of the stream someone asked why you would get that for 105 109 whatever it is yeah instead of a six core or even if it was an original 1600 for 80 bucks or whatever you can find them for yeah that would be the better buy but you're right to an extent having more cores isn't going to benefit you if you're on a weaker inferior architecture and Zen 2 is noticeably better in a lot of especially when you're like in that 4 to 6 core range I think having stronger individual cores can go a lot further so in that case at a hundred nine bucks I don't think it's gonna I think it's split I don't know what the proportion of it would be but I would go for the the newer architecture at that price I don't think that's bad I mean we're talking about 20 to $30 Delta I don't imagine many people are gonna sweat over that if you can get a stock cooler included more power to you you know so yes this is where I'm like sitting on with this CPU this sort like it's good it's good it's not be all and end all it's not amazing but it's not bad and so when something's not bad I'm not gonna say I'm not really gonna care too much right I'm gonna say look Verizon 330 100 if it's 109 box and it's Zen - I'm gonna say it's pretty solid it's good it's gonna service a market where 1,600 AF isn't available cheap use parts aren't available and if it's available go get that because it's gonna be a good buy that's I'm gonna say about it yep I think we're getting into these arguments too much lately of go get this you have to get that and it's like well is this gonna do the job for what you need it to do and the answer is yeah this thing is going to kick some butt with a mid-range graphics card and in fact it could even be better for a lot of people as opposed to run 5 1600 AF because four cores eight threads I think it's real sweet spot still with mid-range cards so we're talking like even a used gtx 1070 1660 super that's where this cut that's where the CPUs just gonna fall in line with perfectly yeah so I mean you know it would be like a clutch until move they'll never do this but it would be pretty clutch they have the i3 90 100 F now which I'm running tests on because it's so cheap I think what's 70 something dollars always it that cheat boards Wow yeah it's it's it's under a hundred bucks I don't know exactly what it is but uh it it looked pretty compelling I was like this might be like the one semi bargain apart from maybe the 90 400 F ship that Intel make so I asked him to send one and that's what I'm that's why I'm testing it now but but uh what would be super clutch is if Intel enabled hyper threading on the core i3 charged a $30.00 premium or whatever marked it up to a hundred bucks let's say 110 like directly targeted the Rison 330 100 yeah would be pretty sweet because then you would have a struggle again to recommend one or the other you know at that point it would be you'd have to rely more on the platform I'm sure people would probably still choose Rison largely because of the just simplicity of the upgrade path although we expect Zen to or whatever comes next to be the dead end on the am for socket so who knows but I think that would be really close of Intel to do in a perfect world which we definitely don't live in oh we live oh man I gotta close my email down I think that came through on stream a yeah I just the email is people are gonna get hit so no no sorry about that guys that's one thing I forgot to do was close down my email client before I started live stream so it's gotta be one Blundell that's good it's all coming through it's like oh no that's gonna come out at livestream isn't it I say okay so what we're talking now what we're going through the ice rewrite the the new i3 is coming out on the 10th gen they're gonna have hyper-threading enabled apparently I mean it looks like it will be a definite with rising you know you look any other Rison 3 3100 having extra threads as well so that's gonna be a definite now that's gonna that's gonna hit really hard for Intel to I think it's gonna come down to who's gonna be offering the cheapest motherboard and CPU together at this price point so if they have a CH 410 heading out straight out of the get-go and it works with a cheap i3 entry-level and you can get this whole convo so you get the CPU it comes with a cool lot you get the motherboard it's 120 bucks then you add your ddr4 memory you're gonna be good to go that's like hey I would have said and at that point if you had had very competitive I 3 and our three CPUs like you said motherboard would play a huge part that's the next that's the obvious next step memory as well they're both on ddr4 but remember rise is gonna be more reliant on faster memory for that now a year or two ago I would have told you I would take in the Intel chip had they been the same price because you can pair cheaper slower ddr4 with the Intel chip and not see a huge reduction in frame rate just because the the ring bus latency is not tied to memory speed whereas the Infinity fabric is on AMD side but because memory is so cheap now like you can get a 30 200 megahertz kit for like 70 bucks 16 gigs you know Cass 16 16 18 18 timings yeah like really nice kit for 70 bucks that's really that was the only other Achilles heel AMD had and with memory prices so cheap now there's not really much of an incentive to not use them seeing that very easy here's the thing though do we think do you think ddr4 prices are going to go up and this is a scary thing let me tell you about ddr3 right now ddr3 is literally coming out I've got suppliers direct giving me quotes SSDs are coming down which is a really good news so yes these will be flowing through soon you see prices coming down on that ddr3 though is still like it's ridiculous how much ddr3 is at the moment it's literally the same price as ddr4 coming in like from suppliers and so but do you think ddr4 will then start to catch trend and start going up in price and my thinking is I'm going to stay straight away you can have a think about that I'm gonna say kind of no because of this naming scheme because they're going with this I 3 which I just think that people like they're gonna have their new I 3/10 Gen coming out and it's gonna be way faster than not gonna be Wi-Fi they're gonna be faster than i7 4770k is people on the use market are still going to go by ni seven forty-seven seventy-four 9 10 100 or whatever they call it and the reason being is because they just see I seven and that's what it is dude like that's what's going on um also we did get a super chat about it was a good question though there was a super chat about risin 7 1700 I didn't catch it do you want to pull that question oh yeah yeah he asked if he should upgrade is for 1700 to a 3100 for the sake of memory compatibility when you see a gaming benefit I'll be willing a lot of games that's yeah it depends on the game but I imagine you would if the games only gonna leverage for 6 threads at a time especially especially if he's got that 1700 and it's IMC just doesn't want to go like if he's - he's got 3,200 megahertz memory and he's trying to cash that in and it's just going nowhere and he has to lower that down like so he's not only gonna get the IPC he's gonna get the memory improvements - so that's why like I wasn't keen on 1st gen I've said this a few times like I'll say it probably every livestream I'm not that keen on 1st gen 2nd gen 3rd gens where it's at for AMD yeah there's that use so anyway on to some more tech news before we move over to chat we've got he'll asrock this is a pretty cool thing like look I know as a response to the channel I want to show them some love but this actually really caught like I get the email I get the marketing emails and I'm like wow this actually looks really cool they got their challenger 5500 XT and this is like an ITX 5500 xt 8 gigabyte and this thing looks amazing like you got this little GP think I have that you what anyways people they just released it now if you've got that I'm gonna talk to our oh man I know it says Challenger it says challenger 5700 XT for no no no no no this challenge of 5,500 xt5 that's what it is ITX it's a challenger 5,500 X I don't know is is it called challenger ITA yeah yeah so it's a small it's a really small reason wanted to talk about its cuz I really like what they're doing here this is what I think the 5,500 XT needs to go in this direction you gotta send me those links dude I didn't I didn't know the link up for that that's okay that's okay we had to start the livestream ASAP dude you know you know we gotta get this ya know I didn't know what you were talking about cuz you're talking about it article I can't see you can get back to that beautiful wife and beautiful I got to contribute somehow I can't do that without articles oh okay yeah that's why man you got you got freedom on your end I can't do a whole lot here otherwise we're gonna mess up the stream so the viewers get to see it before you do how that's why me I take care of you guys out there in the audience so we got here being on your channel yeah done dirty right now we got the 5500 XT ITX so this is small it's really small and that's about it so it looks pretty cool like I can't wait to get my hands on one of these because you could do so much with this little card and you're gonna get really good performance like it goes I'd say it's about tied with the 1650 super depending on what games you're playing they're kind of neck and neck and of course it's going to be after the driver optimization is gonna be a bit faster than a 50 RX 58 RX 580 so yeah I'm liking where this is at it looks cool what is the audience thing what is Greg thing have you pulled up a picture yet yeah did you mention MSRP do they have a no and that's that I mean once that hits the streets it hits the store it's but I just want to see more companies do this I guess that's like a PSA like yeah give us those low-powered even a 5600 XT I think they could do something with that before that V BIOS update because that was the power consumption figures on that before they did the V BIOS update we're really impressive yeah yeah and so I thought they could do something really cool with that and the other day it's like these these contests of having to be the best in that price point isn't that relevant as to just what would work practically you know practically work in a rig so what I'm seeing is there was not enough sellers if we go to this say the 1650 the original the non-super the one that doesn't need the PC a 6-pin I would have loved to have seen so many more sellers drop low profile versions of those but they missed that opportunity from the get-go and even now there's not enough low-profile 1650s out there so I want to see more of this and I mean this doesn't look like it's low-profile but I'd love to see when it if it does hit well if someone gets a low price just get more low-profile GPUs and ITX solutions out on this low-end stuff because it's really cool oh you mean low-profile you mean like one slot no so it's been it's thin so you know yeah you know those thin pcs you did like you get say a small form-factor HP like a half of the full slot link basically or whatever and they've got and this is the thing they've got they've got platinum power supplies in them like these these are little Briggs with platinum power supplies they've run so efficient and they're so nice well man super chats coming in hot today like wait they must be loving this tech something so I can't really read them like urine give you 1000 see if he didn't say anything I got cheese yeah these super chats at popping man mister she said please bring out a techie a city t-shirt much love from America oh we got some we got some merch I got to put the link and maybe I missed it in this live stream but we got submerged we got some merch crack and there's the tech yes all right there she'll on stream just like will quickly show courses virtual so for you guys because they yeah the sponsor the stream and their headsets really nice so the cost a choice solid headset man I haven't had I actually want to stream now because this headset I just want to put it on and talk to you guys they see before I had a condenser mic and I'm like yo what up I got it could get some like yo no it's not like that this is this freedom this is like yo what's crackin what's poppin now we got the last article here we're gonna go over to tweet town they posted this MSI 16 gigabits per second GD d are six memory on the new geforce r-tx 28 e TI gaming z tree oh wow like this is this is groundbreaking man this is what we've all been waiting for years after the original 2080 TI was released right right just pulled it up I mean I'm not impressed at all like whatever can we get on what is this I mean is it it's it gonna give you any was it memory bottleneck at all to begin with and I don't think so just like what's the point yeah I mean it's just like hey we got to release something maybe like I don't know invidious guy Nvidia really needs to release our TX 3000 will give us at ease like this is the thing I don't know why Nvidia don't just tease it a bit more like hey guys we got this coming you can look forward to this because we're all in lockdown we're all in lockdown we're all kind of getting bored I would have loved to I'd like to get I'd like to get teased right now and yeah and not in the way likes a good not in the way not in the way great see Greg's mind that's it Greg come on right away the wrong his mind's going elsewhere I think that's the right way respect so alright basically now we'll get a segue so we'll go over to chat soon but I wanted to talk about so there's all this laptop news coming out like Zen 3 CPUs Verizon 4000 in laptops and there's the 10th gen I Intel CPUs but here's a reason I don't even want to bother touching that because we haven't got the RT X 3000 GPUs and this said go this segues from this article into the laptops perfectly like why would you go out and buy a laptop now with these new CPUs but these older GPUs when you know rise in three thousands or I mean r-tx three thousand surround the corner it's gonna be so much more power-efficient gonna be more performance that's what you want in a laptop doesn't it take it doesn't it take them a few I don't know I'm late doesn't it take a few more months for them to bring like max-q designs or whatever they call them but that's but that's the kicker right now that we've been delayed maybe they're gonna launch laptops at the same time so like anyway that's my thinking's like you got such a big jump here for the GPU side of things if I was buying a gaming laptop I just hold out for now buy something cheap Lenovo what is that yoga pad or something where you do yoga on it just grab one of those for now hold out once the yoga yoga pads finished grab yourself an RT X 3000 laptop with the news and processors and stuff so it's like the CPU side of things it looks great but the GPU side of things in laptops right now really is like you got that little bit longer just weighed out and you're gonna get something amazing but so here's the thing too they you know if you want the biggest and baddest yeah okay cool that's that's fine but if if you were gonna get something like let's say you get a laptop with 120 Hertz 1080p screen and it's got a whatever the eight core Zen 4000 series CPU I don't know what it was which one it's called yeah but uh let's see you got that so you get a pretty sweet or actually a really sweet grass CPU in there but if you were gonna get like a 20 70 max Q or again whatever I don't if they're still use a max Q or not like to me that's all you're gonna need any way for a 1080 people in 20 Hertz screen yeah unless you're doing some crazy like ultra settings with like witcher 3 and mods i don't know but you know most reasonable gaming 120 hertz 1080p 20 70 max he's fine you would need to wait for the biggest and baddest thing to come out for me and even if you did then you could argue at that point okay well you've sat around with no laptop or upgrade for eight months and now that you've waited eight months just wait eight more months or another year or maybe another two years to see if nvidia comes out with something else but it's a laptop Pro it's a laptop I I'm usually on your side of the fence right I'm usually on that side if don't wait to upgrade but this is different this is like a big generation it's like it's like going out and buying update bohemia' it's like it's like going out and buying a ps4 pronoun be like yeah this thing's gonna be mad for years now just wait for the PS 5 per see my thinking yeah that's my thinking sometimes it's not good to hold out but sometimes it is good to hold out I'm just saying it's one of those situations where I think it's good to hold a you have to see utility in buying a laptop now and having a laptop now in order to actually justify it you can't just buy ABS you're in pain that's what that's I'm saying go by the yoga pad for now if you need that portability sure I mean you could buy a Chromebook for that matter I mean if you didn't need something a type on or search the web on go buy Chromebooks just why nothing and just type in the air yeah use your cell phone a lot sure use a laptop save some money I said we gotta jump over to chat we had a Kiran man Karen's going hard on the donations he's gone i have a gtx 1070 I wants to upgrade are two of them no should I wait for his Navi to I yeah you should you should wait for Navi to await for RTX 3000 that would be my Wednesday a view to kinda heard anything about Navi apparently so I don't know that's the thing so yeah these late dude these questions are so so come alerted made a video on this and I haven't released it yet but like should I upgrade to this or should I wait for this you know like they're they're really open-ended questions because we're gonna know what games you play we don't know if you're if you're currently satisfied with what you have now and and if you I don't know just have a hole in your pocket and you know you want to buy new stuff that's fine go at it but you shouldn't have to ask us if you have a hole in your pocket just go go spend the money whenever you know okay so by the 2080 now and then upgrade again later what's to stop you from doing that hurdle yeah that's it Hodel that's what he say you should hold and you just so check Canucks just bought a ps4 prone regrets here it was it used I could ask you if it was used if that feels use it's not bad you can get ps4 pro used for pretty cheap right now okay so let's move over who's got questions do you think I 787 hundred is okay as price performance for gaming with an RT X twenty eighty then an eighty seven hundred K oh yeah just get some good memory with that thing man make sure you get some decent DDR I'd say that sweet spots ddr4 three thousand megahertz at least from my testing it's pretty cheap if you can afford the thirty two hundred megahertz stuff go with that but you're gonna see a huge difference so you won't see huge difference with intel using 2666 are there yeah I know you still just want to get that yeah if it's like five bucks different you might as well get the faster right and that's my point like it used to be way different there Joyner megahertz a year or two ago when the memory shortage was you know really in its prime it was $50 Delta between the cheap 2666 stuff but I think is that 26 is it 21 33 or 2666 is like Lois is 21 33 you barely see 21 33 anymore just because they've all checked technically I think you can get 1866 it's just you don't see it okay but do you think I seven so next question we had here do you still have the MSI 960 100 is that the special edition I already yeah that bro they got a lot hocked long ago like yeah I'm pretty good on my turnover man my turnover is pretty quick and uh how's this I had a guy like this is the weirdest thing I've ever had like in the history of selling a PC I had someone yesterday right there like the the wife is like I'll call up my husband here's his number here's his number please call him up he's interested in gaming PC not this gaming PC in your add our gaming PC that's what it said so I call him up and I get abused like that's little Eva I I'm I hey man you're interested in gaming PC's like oh yeah is it available I'm like I just sold that one well you call me up like whoa bro like I've just here's the thing I got something what happened your screen just went internal temp hile out oh dude I've lost it yeah bro your camera I'll tell dude I'll tell the best story to you I'm sorry I fixed it keep going keep going yeah yeah give us a crappy webcam at least in the mean time okay cool it is hot what camera is that a 6400 I've never had my because I'm doing it in 4k it doesn't really make sense to do a stream at 4k but dude my Panasonic my g7 is just a workhorse dude this thing is amazing this is a G JT 5 'arrgggg still uses my main camera so it really fires the same thing yes so anyway I call the dude up starts abusing me and I'm like okay whatever take a hike and then I say to the lady on Facebook I'm like yo like next time you ask me to call someone you please not just like get cold up and get abused and he calls me back and I'm just like man what you know so I just blasted him and then hung up the phone and then blocked him and blocked it was so weird it's like the whole principle of yeah after a gaming PC and then you call him up and you get abused it's like man some people nowadays like anyway that was just noise frustrating thing I've had in a while so yeah like what I mean yeah is it because you're like one of the only suppliers right now it is like every [ __ ] apparently from what I gauge right those she probably gave out his number to a few other sellers already and they'd like one of these guys to walk so they'll call up straightaway I was just like look I'm busy I was busy Ashley yesterday so I'm guessing he got a few more calls from some other guys who had the same thing like look we've just sold by we're selling out of pcs like as soon as you list them they're gone sort of thing you got to be quick and so he probably is like look I just want to buy this what's available on Facebook or whatever is on gumtree it's like well man I try to explain them look bird it's not a normal situation right now you know what I mean it's you if you're not going to understand what the situations like then well I get angry yeah anyway yeah is this one of those weirdest things it's like hey call up my husband so you can get abused yeah that's what they should have said just bought a you used but re thermal pasted clean 1070 on eBay for 234 out the door how good of a dealer I get is that USD or Ozzie if it's a really good deal if it's USD it's mediocre I like no yeah it is you can get you can get 210 70s under 200 bucks no you make it last I checked Brian loves the use performance yes I do I love that use performance okay so we call through the questions man we got a huge backlog here jello hey jello what's crackin brother he's a really cool guy man he met us at Computex last year and we hung out and it's really cool is a 3700 ex with our TX 2080 pairing considered high-end yeah definitely that's a high-end PC like for gaming might not be a high-end video editing PC but it's a high-end gaming PC for sure Brian you inspired me to do a 500 dollar aud all-in it's okay sweet the performance rocks and they love both the guys vids they love your videos - Greg you happy yeah people want to know if your price in the thumbnail is in USD or USD I think it's USD 109 USD it wouldn't be $190 not with the US no way yeah yeah you'll be looking like a $60 for court thread on the latest Ebola okay so Brian posting to someone online about a $700 budget bills suggesting rx 570 and a 3200 G tech fast have a system for $6.99 that has an Rx 580 is that a decent system to recommend or nah 3200 G is the older IPC yeah so yeah I yeah I just might like yeah I'd try and get a risin 5 2600 in there instead there's no point buying an APU if you're not going to use it for what the AP is intended for that's just my thinking you're gonna really want like because the APU and you couple it with a dedicated graphics card it's not as strong as CPU anyway it doesn't have as much cash on a location yeah like it's just a weaker CPU inherently anyway compared to its same IPC brethren so they yeah it's off the top of my head so no I and I checked us have some really good deals but if you can micromanage that and get a better CPU in there definitely go for that that'd be my recommendation so let's move through the questions of the questionnaires well man it's moving so fast okay if you see questions you want to answer great go for it man one is a 3,600 X good for a GTX 1080 yep perfect no bro you could pair 3,600 X with a 20 DTI and in most games you're still not gonna be CPU bound I would be surprised if you were okay will a 2700 X and man these clip I'd lost it okay you just keep in mind questions I'll try and find something if they rise in five 1500 X good for streaming it's a good intro stream I mean it's not gonna be terrible it's definitely better than an arguably better than Intel CPU to the audio change over to your webcam mic or something that's crazy Oh okay so we're gonna get no come on got a GTX 1063 gigabyte for 160 Ozzie do you what do you reckon at the price in this current market yet GTX 1063 gigabyte even for 160 Ozzie is a decent deal man uh yeah you're gonna be hard-pressed to get that kind of deal anywhere for GPUs right now GPUs are just go whoo and it's especially around the low end to the mid range like anything if you're putting together a rig for under $1,000 right now anything that goes into those rigs is going up in price the higher end stuff is generally not as affected because the bottom line is people just want to get a gaming PC for either general usage or playing fortnight or even warzone and you can get that for under $1,000 dollars so that's what you're looking at what's this huge amount of demand right now that's why I did the potato Hana Series Brian what high end GPU will pair well with a 1600 af you get some good memory on the 1600 af but I would say RTX 2070 or 5700 would be like perfect pairing with that CPU if you know how to get the most out of the CPU if you're gonna put crap memory with it and and really limit the 1600 half then you you just go on with the 1660 or something like that but yes definitely good with a nice 5,700 and also at 2070 and that's a funny think about the RT x 2070 I don't say the super because the 27 TS can be half pretty much the same price as the 2060 super now if you're gonna flip that in the future having that 2070 branding name here it's so much better than having the 2060 super because I get people like they ask me about high in systems like does it have a 27 in it I'm like yeah but you kind of want the 2070 super and they're like oh what's that so you've still got that confusion out there about not having our super versus not super whatever it is so right so people don't thanks for all the love hearts guys you guys are awesome yo Brian what's our soso x79 board sell for an AUD if it's a branded board like MSI azusa specially with the Zeus or gigabyte or asrock you can get at least like 200 Aussie for that thing man if it's a decent board so I've got a question - love the potato hunter series can we expect more yep you can expect more especially as long as this thing goes on man potato Hunnam is going to continue I hopefully they'll lift restrictions soon but I got no idea when restrictions are gonna lift so its rise and Master good do you do you want to answer that I don't use it I mean it might be good that I don't use it 1080 or Vegas 64 man these questions you got ant you got to try them in here because what it does is it like resets and drops me all the way down the bottom again it's on that's what you you just kept going man I was just gonna okay just trying good okay so okay 2200 G bad with rx 570 knots about right would you recommend r9 390x 8 gigabyte use 485 USD yes that's a pretty good deal Brian is there a New Zealand review that we can see in the next yeah there will be I've got to do the motherboard roundup for the v3 Zeon's that's comin whenever I stuff decides to get it whether that's another month later I don't know Brian what's the latest meta it would be like at the moment where I'm at I'm gonna be honest with you guys it's literally I've taken to getting out of Seoul during I and that's how bad it is so I've run out of connectors and they're not coming in any time soon so the latest meta would be to get like HP fourth gens and start like literally sold if you if you're pretty decent I've gotten decent at soldiering so like if you can extend the power supply the CPU cables and stuff yeah you can get a really good build together like just with the 1650 or something like that it's getting pretty knots man how like how high demand is for these mid-range gaming pcs but how little supply there is everyone's just dry and up dude everyone is drying up and so people are begging me for pcs I'm like all right I can do this for you and they're like yep give me a please please please please please I'm like all right so yeah I'm taken to a soldiering on now to get builds done that's how bad it is so the latest meta though would be just be to get fourth gen hey chase like and if you know what you're doing with them there's generally a pretty good supply of that still like still and you saw me pace to use those cases you keep the stock cases with them ah no you got a read case of men like they look the stock cases won't fit the GPUs in that's why I was saying before but that's what I was wondering well some of them will I mean you'll get a low profile if you get low profile yeah sure that that's no but I mean the mid tower HP's what they make mid tower HP's - yes oh yeah yeah I did a video on them yeah I've sold all them you can find the Z there's a 200 black stations that's RC 400 yeah see 400 - they're a bit heavier so that when you get a kid if you get a kidneys mom rocking up to pick up a PC it's kind of like you've got to carry it to the car and you feel like you're gonna carry this thing out to you at home so that's why I like to see 200 it's just such a good balance of everything and that's that's why I recommended that so just recently picked up an RT X 2060 windforce for two hundred seventy bucks goodbye it's pretty solid I'm not gonna not gonna say it's about that's pretty good buy yeah a year ago in India or bought rx 584 300 USD ouch now it's a bit too expensive sorry gtx 1034 150 CAD on ebay are these deals scams I'd have to check out the listing but yeah I'd be careful of that looks a little bit scary Sh maybe it's faulty or something like that so what are your thoughts between our TX 2060 and 5,600 XT they're both good men like they're both pretty good I would lean seen for me because I flipped this stuff I lean towards in video and I've said this in the past Nvidia logo carries more weight than AMD logo if you want better bang for buck 5600 xt is gonna probably edge out it's gonna edge out the 2060 definitely it's gonna be a better price performance but if you want to reflect things RTX 2060 is gonna get people o like they're gonna be dancing with their jar-jar mugs okay so we go through the questions okay can you use a can you use a rise in 730 700 X and r-tx 3000 grabs cut can you do streaming while gaming yeah like you can do that with an RT X mm so you could do with the naughty x3000 easy it's 107 a fair deal for rx 750 you never heard of an RX 750 is a HD 7970 450 CAD a good deal yes that's a pretty solid deal I'd take that's not that up visa which CPU is the best for gaming if I get an RT X xx atti the 9900 K currently 10th Jen's coming pretty soon so I'd wait for that is it okay for four cores will hold you back at some point okay so have you any questions you want to smash through here Greg I've been seeing one from leo he's been posting pretty chill he said 95 sorry 9600 K will that hold for another the year only gaming pair of the 2060 super I think so I mean if you're only gaming I fives are still viable I don't they're obviously not the better value from my perspective but if you already have one I don't think there's a need to overhaul everything if you're just gaming very few games will fully saturate six overclocked course especially okay so we got a question he which is pretty interesting it's how much do you think I could sell an i7 960 12 gigabytes of RAM SSD and a GTX 580 4 in an RGB case honestly I'd take the GTX 580 out it's that's I don't know man like I tried using I tried actually selling a GTX 500 is a true story I tried selling a GTX 500 series card in a rig and the guys like trying to boot up cod the new latest Cod play multiplayer and doesn't even boot and I felt so bad when I come back I'll just change it over for something you know like that'll actually play it and yeah so the GTX 500 series is really just getting too old that's really old yeah and so I changed the GPU so yeah I 1760 still capable of fortnight and cod at 60fps easy even if you don't overclock it so I'd saved the GTX 580 for like a super potato build like we're talking if you say you get a budget i5 750 in and you just want to make like a basic fortnight gaming PC I'd like I'd leave that GPU for that Shoji 45 60 MB 250 M ATX board for $50 USD yeah it's okay SLI still worth it depends on the game and I made a video on SLI my opinion would still stay the same for SLI as that videos conclusion what was your opinion it depends if you're playing one particular game and you can get the benefits of it then yeah go for it like what okay let's say Shadow the Tomb Raider for instance bang huge gains over even in dx12 yeah so we're talking about say for instance when th TI versus 220 70 supers the true 20 70 soup is smashed the 20 80 TI same debe to 20 30 supers are liked white like not better I mean here - yo brass one for 5,500 bucks for a 20 70 super 20 80 is only 650 728 EDI 20 80 I oh sorry sorry I didn't hear the TA oh I see we're saying yeah okay so yeah that would get you almost identical pricing yeah will you continue the hundred dollar flippin series yes definitely it's just I'm waiting for things to get back to normal because I want to take you guys on a journey with that that's like my I realized the channel here has to tell a story and that main story is me I guess making my way up through the through the tracks and I want to help people out this is a community of the big strong part of takea city is turning trash into treasure and I realized that now so that series is going to be quartered the channel and once this stuff lifts I kind of want to really give that some attention so in the meantime potato hunt is kind of like a filler if you will a good filler like I'm enjoying this so it's it's having a lot of fun with it bit next question we got what is the most FPS eternity can handle on fortnight low settings like probably going up to like 354 I don't know I'd be guessing around 350 that'd be my that'd be my guess three more than you'll likely ever benefit from so it's kind of a yeah and the question unless you have a 360 or it's monitor yeah if you may if you go through juicy questions so risin 5 1600 on B 450 or s pro Wi-Fi with a GTX 970 what should I ask for it ooh depends on your market dude if you're in a if you're in a drought market with high demand I would just you probably get around 500 USD for that honestly easy like if it if it's in Australia like if you were selling that in Australia you could sell for 500 USD like that bang that'd be gone probably even a little bit more next question Linus don't do budget minded content like Brian and Greg oh thanks man Linus I can do a lot more of that than idea man Linus has grown this weird beard right now have you seen that thing yeah a good scrub it's about probably what I could do if I let it grow out yeah that's me it's yeah nothing to be nothing to be proud about but definitely different yeah I'm just gonna I think it looks better without the without the beard I actually like it it makes them look less I don't know like if I clean shave I look like I'm 16 like I'm still working on that's a good thing bro everyone wants to be 16 again man well then no one takes you seriously though I think you're a kid's kid now yeah I just thought oh man get some you got thick eyebrows zero good you know it's gonna look like I've seriously though if I clean shave I've looked almost the same yeah since I was about yea 16 so ever since like once you finish puberty it's like until you hit 3035 that's when you probably start looking different oh yeah so losses a few question we do you get some super chats I missed them and what did they Gabriel says have you answered my question about CPU cache nope what was it and then we got here body coming to India for a parts all I've if the road takes me to India it so say for instance there's an event in India I will hit up India I'm not gonna go just go fly directly to India just to be like hey let's do a parts on like I'm gonna be losing out on a heap of money if I do that and then we go so but that's that's the thing like so I piggyback a lot of the parts hunts on the back of events so copy checks for instance perfect example go over there yeah get to get the goods done but I also do the parts aren't there next questions are x5 Eddie with the 2600 or 3600 just go with the 2600 state but money next up we got my PC has an RX Vega 56 and horizon 7 1700 X 16 gigabytes of ram is it any good question is no no just joking decent PC it's pretty good balance so best CPU for dota 2 way too generic I need to know more Pacific's ok in so gabriel's he really wants this question answered in which manner I would benefit from having more CPU cache size last time I tested ages ago apparently Skyrim that was one way you get a little bit more performance depends on the game and how it interacts and how it's been programmed man yeah it's like of a CPU cache like yeah like astral yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah depends on how it can have an impact on it can have an impact on one percent point one percent frame rates it just depends on the game and I don't know are you disabling cache to test that I is there a way to even do that so what is it usually they're gonna make sure that they're not cache bound like if you if you have a CPU that's limited by the amount of cash it limited on a performance level then it's obviously not so the best way to test for that the best way to test for that is to get nice three and keep the calls and threads enabled then get an i7 disabled then disable the course yeah and again that kind of stuff takes a long time but there is a difference there is the difference and when I tested that in the past there was a difference ages ago but then let's see if like doesn't that defeat the purpose though because if you buy a core i3 you're gonna be Core bound at that point not cache bound but and then if you buy a core i7 you're never gonna use it as a fork or chip or a two core hyper threaded chip like they give you the cash that's that makes sense for the workload of the CPU and usually it scales with the cores so if you have two megabytes of l3 cache per core then you're gonna have four for two cores you know eight four four cores like it doesn't really make sense to me why it's okay so here's the thinking behind it more cache is better more cache is better you want like everyone wants cash right the government's handing it out everywhere with a Z on right I do this example because some of these Zeon's they have a huge amount of level three cache onboard cache for the aussies and you want that you honestly the more the better because when you're not utilizing all those cores and threads and games you are still utilizing more level three cache in games that's just how it is so having more of it's better and I can give you a smoother experience we've also seen this in the past with that fifth gen Broadwell that had the level for cache and that was given out some extremely smooth frame rates no no no the 5700 I forgot what it was now the broad well I 75771 ever that is a rare CPU it didn't really have long in the limelight because it came out so late because of no delays and it just really was just it was a short time frame yeah dude there's a broad world [ __ ] that came out like while ago and it didn't have long in the limelight before skylight came out but it wasn't right now I know like the 5820k 59 60 actually like that whole Prada you get but you could get a Zeus but you could get in a Zeus motherboard for that chip and you could utilize all that level for cash for gaming and it was a pretty good experience so our super chat came in on top of this now hey Brian I got a 5,700 the chat scaling so fast it's gonna flash it to roll up at along a 5th year it's gonna be flash to be a 5700 XT 1600 AF and I'm going to use CL 1632 hundred megahertz Ram and should I use precision boost mmm no I just manually overclocked in the BIOS dude because 1600 AF doesn't have good precision boost versus n2 like it does have decent oh you know that 1600 overclock that thing do I try and get at 4.2 gigahertz with a SIF million 5 so that'd be my advice just manually overclock it with the RAM also check yeah make sure you don't run audit voltage either a lot of those boards are terrible about a club playing vcore and you'll you'll have a much hotter C system if you just let the board and so we got the yeah was the I 750 775 C yeah the guys got in the comments thanks Chad we go here Zeon's will deliver better 1% performance than a 9900 k no not necessarily and the reason being is because there every time you get a generational improvement they improve the efficiency of the cache so just because the ev3 Zeon's have more of it doesn't mean it's better so basically the ninety-nine hundred KS got the best at the moment for Intel and it's pretty like ought to be honest it's pretty good stuff like in the 10th gen will hopefully have better level 1 level 2 and level 3 cache performance then the 9900 K making it a better gaming CPU as well that's hopeful we got to test that stuff but just because you got more of it doesn't necessarily mean it's better so you got less CPU so 1900 case a versus a 1270 v 3 or whatever so just like just like just say has wolf cash versus 9900 k cache it's it's different you're saying until the end still gonna have a difference in the speed so we're gonna matter just as much as the size so depending just you can think of it as GPU memory a little bit a little bit not a direct comparison but if you look at GPU VRAM you can if you have say for instance a a3 and you turn the shadows to max which stresses the CPU heavy you're gonna see not only you're gonna see the framerate drop you're gonna see stuttering and that's because the things getting overwhelmed it's not it's not the right CPU for the job so that's an example right there okay what's a good GPU to get for my i7 6700 1660 super call it aura gtx 1070 perfect combo any other collabs with other youtubers in the future are rocketjump ninja here's my boy he lives just up the road he can expect a few more clouds with him Greg I guess like I'm hoping to also collab with the boys over in the US like Ozzy talks hardware and stuff like that because I really like them guys man they're such it they go they're cool community going on and they love the use price-performance - so like nerd on a budget all those guys man like scatter ball yeah just all those guys like I met them before they're chill as man they're really cool guys yeah hanging out all of you yeah and I really want to hang out with those guys as well is you know they're not looking for cloud as well like they don't want to collab for cloud I just want to collab so you got the same passion and I love that so and the x58 platform quick question I have an ex 5660 and Zeus p6 workstation Pro should I use easy C memory with this combo or is that not possible you've got to check you can use definitely use ECC unbuffered but I don't know about ECC bhavat that's the problem ACC registered essentially I'm not sure about that you'd have to check with the motherboard and the CPU you have to check with the motherboard so Zeus p60 on their website should have if it can support it so I know the Zeon's they can even the mainstream can support you see see I know x79 x99 Zeon's will support registered not sure about X 58 I haven't checked that directly so don't know we got here do super chat do you know of a good 1440p 144 Hertz monitor for around 400 USD can you hit us Greg oh there's plenty of them I like to hit up my boys over at pixie oh they make really good budget panels msi makes pretty good panels as well but i should say they use decent the VA stuffs gonna ghost quite a bit so be wary of that you're playing the first person shooter yeah don't don't get it I don't get a VA like if you yeah you can find actually pretty affordable IPS panels now I would consider those if you care about color accuracy but and people are gonna cringe when I say this TN is straight-up still the best for first-person shooter I ain't curandero smooth so smooth I encouraging it all duty ends where it's at man if you're serious about gaming dude I got the 240 Hertz TN Morris I just smashed the response times to Mack oh yeah that thing's great yeah and like people like all over shoot over shoot I'm gonna talk about overshoot a little bit overshoot is only a bad thing if you notice it just because there's these tests with UFOs on them and they show a little bit of you know white white haloing that's like if you don't notice it it's not a bad thing I'll give you an example of a monitor that has the most worst overshoot I've ever seen in my life and that is the ASA 28 HB k 4k 60 Hertz you whack up the response times on that and you'll notice like black haloing it's a terrible overshoot but this here like I just turn it on Max and the overshoots amazing like even though the numbers will say it's bad it looks fine in practice and so TN still where it's out in my opinion for gaming and IPS still like Oh LEDs where it's out obviously OLED is like the best but we're not seeing OLED coming out in gaming monitors it's so frustrating because you want OLED when's it coming out yeah and like yeah monitor let oh Lola it's like when's that coming out like a 24 inch OLED 240 Hertz that would be like it for games ghosting oh it's amazing dude it's like 0.5 millisecond response time dude your camera cuz greatest again is better dude like it's perfect like I did this tests at Computex on this horas monitor that was OLED and it was like you saw the just on a thousand FPS camera you could see the frame just transitioned perfectly it was like it was just beautiful that's what it was purchased individual pixel oh it was just beautiful that's all I can say so it's like hit me with that outlet ASAP please but they're having problems with it so TV with the best response time I'd have no idea guys I don't game on TV a lot of TV response times are over pipe anyway yeah so we're using game mode Gabriel's hitting some pretty cool questions here he's like what the 10th gen Intel CPUs have similar prices to ninth gen processes uh yeah but you're gonna get more you're gonna get free hyper threading on the i3 s because AMD's forcing him to do that they've got no choice yeah good but I watched your video on the it's just boring to recommend a rising CPU now what oh did you watch the I guess I wanted to add to that I think of the reason you'll probably think it's a little bit boring is because we haven't like when we look at it we haven't really calmed that far in the last 10 years right that's why I've been that's why I've been going down the yeast rabbit hole because GPUs are now starting to stagnate pretty badly we're seeing that too everything's stagnating pretty badly let's be honest right yeah it's a graphics cards more on a I mean Nvidia innovated with the Turing stuff but I really like Pascal Pascal was great it was an awesome value big performance gains they kept efficiency up and then you move on to this Turing stuff and it's like okay but like did you guys now see what you did last time can you not give us that again you know instead of whatever the heck you're trying to play realistic shadows and crap like that and it's fine like maybe they just it was a rough first generation of this stuff maybe the next gen will be better and cheaper hopefully to be cheaper that's really the one thing I care about but uh and then on the CPU side like I was saying in the video it's like you know it's been two three years now okay AMD has been doing great they finally kicked it into high gear we're recommending actually we're recommending almost exclusively AMD so what the heck is going on I had plenty people say well where were you eight years ago when it was just Intel and AMD wasn't but I didn't see a video about how you getting tired of recommending Intel and a but it's but they're right in the sense that it was almost identical what's going on now is similar to how it was with Haswell and then well really it was sandy bridge that came out at around the same time as the 8300 all right I think and then I P bridge was 83 50 I don't remember but a piledriver bulldozer just kind of the biggest difference there the biggest difference there for me personally was the GPU market was picking up the slack like yeah GTX 970 came out bang it was amazing then you had ten threes come out you just had these like hit after hit yeah you were getting you were getting hit after hit and it was amazing so that was kind of like you had monitors hunt you know you had all these new monitors everything in the tech space was exciting bought CPUs now everything in the tech space is like you're beating a dead horse yeah that's the same thing yeah because both have stagnated now not just one and I'm even though even though CPS flip-flopped and AMD's definitely I would say aim these leaps over the last three generations have been more substantial than those we've seen from Intel for the past four or five generations if you want to count coffee lake as its own single like the revisions of coffee laker in my opinion just I need you things we need you things to get excited about and that's what I mean like there's just this if there was an OLED monitor coming out with 24 inch or 27-inch I'd be getting super excited but there's not there's just nothing on the horizon that's like really excited so I'm just going to use rabbit-hole because it's fun it's it's exciting then for like sent three stories gonna be good but it's still gonna be the same thing we're gonna have these same GPUs like hopefully r-tx 3000 comes out sooner than later and we can get excited again cuz yeah that's just me anyway that's my thing you add on top of that video like yeah it's it's it's a different scenario a.m. days on top but everything else is kind of like dragged down now yeah she's getting boring I didn't even think about when I was writing that script to address the graphics curtain market I was just thinking Rison because it's always rise and rise and rise rise but right I guess with the graphics card thing I mean I guess the difference between the CP market in the GP market right now is that with graphics cards we might not have gotten like the same kind of value proposition from Turing that we got from Pascal but at least now at this point we had AMD kind of eating in the in the middle of the field where if you if you look at what Vega 56 and Vega 64 and what else do we have from them we didn't have anything else from that was it in the the mid-range stuff last generation so it seems like you know AMD's got it together they've got the 5500 xt now I got the 5600 X T now 5700 which I don't even know why that exists anymore 5700 XT now of course they're still missing the high-end stuff but at least we have more choices to where someone asked me hey what's a good 1440p 144 Hertz gamer My Mind's gonna go to either the 2070 or the 5700 XT maybe 2060 super like it's gonna be in that range but at least I can recommend something from both sides whereas if you ask me the same question about a CPU I'm gonna think risin 5 3,600 and that's really it because that's that's the only valued chip that makes sense for a vast majority of buyers or in the world 2600 all fall Express oh yeah yeah yeah that's an even better value in my opinion it's just you're making compromises that some people might not be willing to make yeah say sideburns are getting white yeah then I'm going gray as a weird thing that happened in Japan like you know it's so so scary you know he's here this out about the gray herring of Teck yes this was happening in Japan when I was teaching at my second job that was at the high school and so I gave that job to my best friend he followed suit now I started that job before I started that job here was like not a gray hair on me then I started that job and alright for some reason I just went great when I was in this area it's funny because my best friend Damian he went over to that job and the exact same thing happened to him the job was pretty easy like wasn't the job itself but there was something in that area like I put it down dude I put it down to something in the green tea that we drunk at work cuz we both drank that tea when I was transitioning over to letting him out the job he was drinking the same green tea I was drinking and there must have been something in that it was just like maybe it makes you why is it yeah so I'll just I'll wear the wisdom strips now these are the wisdom strips so they've come in they come in together but something that makes you why is there not like an accidental like spike in mercury content or something like there's like a radiation spike in your area you never know do you there's like that's happened in New York like there were families living over like toxic waste and they had no idea and they were having kids with birth defects and stuff like what the heck what's going on dude you just never know man you could be over some crazy you know stuff that's the let's just die yes I had pineapples on pizza oh yeah look hundred percent yes look you said no I would explain have you tried pineapples on pizza yeah it's right it tastes like garbage tastes like like mixing Oreos with a ham sandwich like who would do that the two totally different flavor profiles Breyer please tell me you've never done gotta open your mind man you gotta open open my mouth up and I did not like what was did that's why you have a supreme right you have pineapples on a supreme on a supreme one my Supremes like you everything oh we don't know I don't need supreme I just eat all the pepperoni you saw Italian sausage maybe ham like meat lovers I don't like mushrooms or bell peppers or any of that garbage on it I just I like straight simple pizza I show anonymous ass heard there were some GPS that didn't support legacy BIOS motherboards is there an easy way to identify these GPUs not really there's no list out there so the easiest way is to look at the actual models of the cards themselves of the motherboards me I mean so like generally I find first gen Intel motherboards are fine with any graphics card even the OEM stuff it was when the second and third gen stuff came in especially HP they locked in secure boot they didn't allow the option to unlock it and they didn't give you an option to enable CSM so generally like there's an ax Lenovo board out there that's the second gen that won't support gtx cards 10 series or RX 5 80s from the get-go but as soon as you go into the BIOS and disable secure boot enable CSM it then supports those grabs cards they boot up fine so that's that's this thing there I'd say it's not so much the GPU but it's more so the motherboard in question I have to say something Leslie says bell pepper and mushroom are good for your body Craig's a picky eater I didn't say I didn't like bell peppers and mushrooms I just said only come on pizza it's the mixture of the different flavor profiles that I don't like that's the thing all these stuff separate any day I mean you mix them in weird ways I'm gonna call you an entitled pizzeria tuber you know one way and it works you know I can eat pepperoni pizza in any style as long as it's just pepperoni pizza it could be a deep dish it could be a thin crust I don't care I'll late a spinach pizza I don't care man ha I see I'd rather just have spinach like I could handle just spinach by itself but I cannot eat it on a pizza like I'd rather have spinach and a cup and then like some bread and then like a mozzarella stick I don't know like I just rather haven't separate okay so we got but basically dude the whole idea behind pizza is that anything tastes good with melted cheese you've got to learn to appreciate that do you ever have like the big we get we get the 1 kilo cheese bags in Australia I just sometimes grab the cheese out of the packet need it roar man that tastes so good dude I like raw cheese I hate melted cheese it tastes totally different when it melts my whole family loves melted cheese they'll put it on literally anything they they sound just like you did Oh cauliflower and cheese oh that's my lunch for today the idea what's the difference between a 1660 tr6 a 1660 super not much anyway continue that's a good question I think we have a video on that I think you do too now the whole chest talking about pizzas probably my fault oh dude Pete's is amazing like it's much it's obviously out right up there in favorite foods what's like what's like a good like if you wanted just a cheap but good pizza like large pizza I don't know like you guys use centimeters but whatever like a decent sized large pizza how much would you pay for that in Aussie dollars I mean Domino's 15 Aussie about 15 bucks so that's about 1000s for a supreme pizza from just a random place looking about 10 okay yes so see we can get him for about anywhere between like six bucks and maybe eight and nine dollars probably so that's mom between James says in the chat too he's got a PowerShell script to automate the mods that'd be great man send me an email I really would keen on that because every time I do a budget build especially if it doesn't have an SSD I do all these quick tweaks and it makes such a difference he is now the hero cheers brother I'm glad to hear that have you guys had dosa and sambar what is that is that American thing what is sambal never got a man sounds like something America would do so ii vegas 56 worth it yeah vega 56 can't be worth it now i think it's getting a bit of a boost over the 10th series because in video kind of like slowing down optimizations for 10 series cards risin 5 3600 4 point 2 megahertz wow that's really slow poor you could help that thing so alright dudes i will have to go soon sorry same it's like 10:30 over here yeah you guys have been amazing this month for chat everything for the support coming in as well behind the scenes on the channel this is weird times again we're gonna close this stream off talking about just how weird the situation is right now out there i like i'm gonna say if it doesn't get alleviated soon then the australian economy at least is gonna take a big hammering like we're already taking a hammering we're gonna take a massive hammering if something doesn't happen soon and the problem is you got this now you got this catch-22 you release the restrictions too early things are going to go bang and get bad again so I don't know man I look at I look at Taiwan and I look at Sweden I think they got the right models that's all I in terms of what they're doing didn't Taiwan like completely shut out tourism like I'm talking to this chicken Taiwan dude she's just like yeah it's all it's all finished like we just go out normally now as long as we wear a mask and stuff like there's zero apparel is like zero
