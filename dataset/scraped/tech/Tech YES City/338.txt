Yo! I've got a PC for you... yeah how much
is it? $200... and what's in it it's got? An i7 3770, R290, 32 gigabytes o... I'm there
tell me to pick up a dress let's go [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
what is crack-a-lackin' tech yes citizens it is that time of the month
and it can only mean one thing and that is used price performance and we've
already had a deal that's come here on the table it came to
me I didn't even have to do anything someone contacted me and said Bryan I
need to sell a PC straight away I need two hundred Aussie dollars,
I said sure what's in this thing they said it's got a 3770,
B75, 32GB of RAM and that was the biggest one that made my eyes
open and they said I had an R290 but I inspected it and it's actually
only a 270 X 4 gig model but still the fact that it includes a harddrive
everything's working and we've got an 800 watt power supply I have put it on
the power supply tester and the numbers are looking ok so that is the first deal
already done and dusted and therefore there is no better way before we jump on
gam tree and Facebook marketplace then to start this part on off with a deal
already scored let's go see what deals we can find and if you're wondering I
found some 2008 hair dye that I got when I was in Japan this stuff is og it's
called real file and I decided well for the rest of 2020 I better be bringing
the file so looking through Facebook Marketplace straight away we've come
into a power supply which I offered them $50 for two of the power supplies and
they said someone already picked the other one up and it's a mediocre power
supply looks like it's 600 watts it's used so I said would you take $25 and
they said yes and then there was also a deal for a GTX a 1050 Ti without I
wanted 150 Aussie and I'll put the USD pricing like I always do up on the
screen for you guys international and then I offered them 110 they came back
at 130 I came back at 120 and they accepted and so we're gonna go pick up
that soon as well and then the last deal that I came across was a fury X with the
water cooler that are asking 250 and then I offered $200 and they said they
knew me and they said that was absolutely fine
I kind of don't like the name giving me a discount but hey I offered the $200
and they accepted and I think this fury X I'm actually extremely curious about
how it will perform in 2020 especially with that water cooler because I've
actually never tried the fury X with the water cooler on it before so that would
make for some great content but other than that on Facebook marketplace itself
is looking like it's a bit of a dry market and we'll talk about this soon
when we cross over to Gumtree where it's a combination of things I mean as soon
as a good deal does pop up there's a lot of sort of hawks and vultures ready to
swoop on that myself included but there's also a at for instance a power
supply that was going for 40 ozzie dollars a Corsair 651 I asked him it was
still available they said yes but then suddenly they said no and that's how
quick things sold that was up for 10 minutes at $40 dollars which isn't that
great of a deal to begin with so you can really see that a lot of people are
hungry out there in the news market but moving over now to good old gam tree
what we managed to find up straight here was 16 gigabytes time to to so there's a
32 gigabyte kit of g.skill memory offered 160 Aussie dollars waiting to
hear back from them there's also a 480 gigabyte SSD 457 TLD dolls and offered
50 waiting to hear back from that too and then there was a gtx 1066 gigabyte
where i offered a hundred and eighty so we'll see if we get back on those three
deals after that we had a 2600 k motherboards he's thinking about to ram
and a water cooler they're asking over $300 i offered $200
so we'll see if they accept that offer now they said they're looking for offers
around their asking price but if something's been sitting there with no
offers it's usually always a decent thing to just drop in other than that
there's also a gtx 980ti which i've thrown two hundred and fifty
aussie down on they're asking 302 us on that and then the last deal on good old
game tree is a 256 gigabyte SSD they're asking for TLC dollars i dropped in an
offer of 30 they accepted and we can go pick that up after we talk about some of
these use prices right here this month I have not seen so many just weird
pricings and Sting's on stuff for instance this one
was the biggest eye-opener for me someone was trying to sell a 10 80 TI
and then put in they're broken and they're asking five hundred and fifty
dollars for it like if something's broken you usually get it at maybe 25%
of the asking price of 1080 t is now 1080 GI is it going for around 600 700
Aussie dollars where I am so asking 550 for one that's broken is just completely
out of the ballpark and then there's other ads out there
like resin 536 hundreds of 300 bucks you can currently get these on eBay for two
hundred and ninety dollars delivered to your door Amazon had them on sale for
$280 delivered the other day in Australia and then there's an 8700 use
for four hundred and twenty-five dollars you've got now the i5 10400 which is
just coming a little over 300 Ivy dollars and it's basically the same
thing six cores 12 threads so these listings that I pulled up for you guys
these were only just a few of the many whack ones that I've seen this month I
mean a lots changed clearly in a month because this is like the worst I've seen
for the amount of weird listings in terms of pricing for instance someone's
trying to sell a 980ti for 400 bucks I mean what is the point of buying a 980ti
at this price point when you can go get a 1660 super nude with the same amount
of VRAM uses less power will give you similar performance is brand new ship to
your door and has a warranty versus this which is just gonna be a way inferior
deal I mean the whole point of buying you stuff is to take a bit of risk and
get much better price performance but I mean if these prices start to continue
up I feel like a lot of people will just start ignoring the used market
completely because it would just be a waste of time there with that aside
we're gonna now jump into the loan 'mobile not the yes 'mobile because i
have the yes my bill until two days time and then it's gonna be like the last day
of the month and i do want to get this parts hunt done before the end of the
month but before we do all that we're gonna call les and we're gonna see what
his got crack-a-lacking for us and hopefully he's got some good deals to
sweeten up the stuff that we're going to go pick up soon
because it'll all make it worthwhile hey you got me pretty good yeah Jay's been a
walleye I don't have much in the way doc that's my problem I mean yeah this seems
like it's a weird time still you know we're just not much desktop stuff yeah
that's the problem good man busy but good busy but good
it's just yeah you know it's that time of the month where I'm just looking
around for some used deals always call up Liz
see what he's got cracking outside I mean I mean if you got I mean I'll pop
it on in if you've got something then like whatever yeah well I gotta come up
- Brizzy anyway - Krabbe what time I've gotta go out like how about four cords
or five at the latest okay so could I come maybe in an hour and be there maybe
3:30 okay see you pretty tight on time all right well I'll make sure I leave
soon no I made I'll see you okay Mac I'll be
there that's it see this bike [Music] so we got a bit of an update now and we
just finished up at lasers place and we picked up more than I expected he had 2
X 58 systems and he had quite a few other parts there as well as some
monitors and there's actually quite a lot here so when we get back to the
techy our studio all DP s-- all the less deal and we'll go through a bit by bit
but we've just now picked up a gtx 1050 TI and we scored that for a hundred and
twenty ozzie smackeroonies and i've also
messaged the guy about this $25 power supply that we're gonna pick up before
but apparently he said is only gonna be available from 7:00 p.m. and it's about
4:30 p.m. here at the moment so I'm not really waiting around Brisbane for two
and a half hours for a $25 power supply we also managed to get two power
supplies at lessers place too so that really sweetened up the deal but on top
of that there was this SSD that I was going to pick up this 256 gigabyte SSD
but the person hasn't messages back on good old gam tree and they also haven't
messages back I told him to text me on my phone the address and they just
haven't gotten back to me at all but from here on in what I'm gonna do is
since we're close to my sister's place I'm just gonna pop in and say hello and
have some dinner and then we're gonna see if any deals unravel between now and
then and hopefully they do but who knows hopefully we will get lucky [Music] [Music] so I've just got back here at the tech
yeah studio had a nice healthy feed especially with the onions in it that is
the important thing to make sure you're getting the onions we're going through
these deals here we've got three monitors two of those being 20-inch one
being a 22 inch 460 Ossie dolls for the three and this one here the 22 inches
Zeus just has a very slight blemish in the top right hand corner but we'll take
those off the desk and start going through the rest of this hall right here
because we've got that 1050 TI that was a pretty good score I mean at 120 Ossie
not too bad I mean she the person I picked it off she said that a lot of
people were messaging about it but because we already negotiated the 120
she was sticking with us so that was really good I really appreciate that
there's still like sense of loyalty in deals and negotiating and agreeing on
prices and stuff like that so that was cool that we scored that and I mean the
fact that someone was coming in willing to pay 150 asking for this just shows
you that the used market is still pretty like I don't know I don't even know
what's going on sometimes but keep going through here we've got three two
terabyte hard drives let's hook this these up for 45 a pop so they are a
little bit more than what I'm used to paying but when you look at the prices
of brand-new two terabytes they've also gone up in price according so we've got
three of these 135 Ozzie dollars and then we're going through the power
supplies where I got both of these I managed to negotiate both of these for
40 Ozzie dollars so that's a one 700 watt and then one FSP it's a 300 watt
power supply will actually 350 but with an FSP 350 watt power supply you know
it's a true 350 so you're gonna get all that power and that'll still power
something like an rx 470 build absolutely fine and then some we've also
got an a gigabyte set of ddr3 for 25 bucks
I do need ddr3 memory so definitely took that up so now going through the five
pcs here and this is the cheapest of the bunch this was one that less said look
this one's got a decent power supply in it
and the rest is like pretty crap and I said well the motherboard it looks like
it's got some bent pins and I said to him tell you what if you can throw in an
i7 with it and then he said 40 bucks and I said sure thing so at the very worst
I've got an HX 620 and an i7 860 but I will try bend these pins back and see if
I can get that motherboard working too because that will make it definitely
worthwhile I think even so the deals worthwhile without the motherboard and
graphs go the graphics cards like some 4000 series GPU but interestingly enough
they did have back sided heat sinks for the memory even back then so interesting
design from sapphire though that's the first of the bunch
next up here we've got a very interesting one to the likes of I've
never actually seen this before it's a first gen aspire with x58 now the first
thing that ticked me off and made me really want to buy it was not just the
fact that it's x58 but also the Delta power supply is a 750 watt power supply
with six hundred and fifty Watts available on the twelve volt line so
very capable power supplies they put in these systems and then of course the
next thing is is the motherboard does look like it's perhaps in as rock board
just judging by the blue and white Ram slots I will have to check that out once
I pull it apart and maybe perhaps I can flash a retail BIOS for whatever the
equivalent motherboard is on this motherboard and we could even possibly
see some Zeon's on these motherboards that's just me being like best-case
scenario hopeful but other than that it's got a gigabytes of ddr3 ram i7 920
motherboard power splay graphics card is really a non-issue it's an old potato
that's worthless and the case the good thing about the cases of all this
hardware is good we can relocate that to a better looking case and then use this
for an office looking PC another thing is - as these are micro ATX x58 boards
which I kind of I was digging micro ATX and actually to this day I really am a
big fan of micro ATX I feel like it doesn't get a whole lot of love but
some really good cases out there anyway 170 ozzie dollars for the pair of him
I'd say we picked up a big score right here the next one up here we've got is
the HP elite 8200 les wanted a hundred dollars for this I just said dude it's a
95 2400 I've got heaps of i-5 and then I said $80.00 he said sure but this one's
got a gigabytes of RAM so if I wanted to get my hard drive already installed and
all we have to do is just pretty much add a GTX 645 to the equation just like
that close it up and then we've got a gaming PC psych look at that so that's
what you can do here at a monitor keyboard mouse and we've got ourselves a
little budget valor ant gaming PC so I mean feedback is balanced hit or miss
some people are loving it some people are not loving it at all so PC like this
would do a good job of playing that game 1080p maybe even like 1600 by 900 with a
20 inch monitor but hey 80 bucks we're definitely winning with this
little guy and he were out with the loss of the pcs on the table and what else
that lens is dealing with him he just said before I was gonna take off he said
look I got this one well Pacey I said what's inside he said 2500 K and pretty
bad power supply three and 20 keep a hard drive I just said to him what do
you want before he said 100 bucks and at that stage he had already done us heap a
good deal so I wasn't gonna bust him on this at all so I just said look man I'll
take that and look at what we're gonna do with this we're gonna yet again put
in another GTX 645 and we got ourselves a gaming PC but other than that this
one's probably got the best case out of the whole lot of pcs I picked up here
pretty clean case and you can definitely do something with this if you had a
monitor keyboard and mouse but in terms of the tally so far let's sit down
weigh this all up and think of a little bit of a strategy going into tomorrow so
our total so far is now eleven hundred and seventy ozzie dollars and in the US
dollars that's about 800 USD so we've got a heap of parts already here but
we're not going to stop just there tomorrow I'm gonna wake up extra early
see if we can find some more deals though in terms of the other deals that
are still out there some of the people haven't
gotten back to us yet the 980ti the i7 combo and the person with the graph
scott did get back to us they said that they sold it for 220 Aussie dollars and
then the SSD person they've just ghosted us so that does happen you do get ghosts
I mean people just have plans things come up and they won't message you back
the news game I've seen it all heard it all it's it's fine it's nothing to worry
about but the Radeon fury acts and really good
news is that they got back to us said they would accept the 200 Aussie dollar
offer so we've scored ourself a really good GPU but in terms of picking it up
that's not an option it's it's actually quite a far drive from where I am so
they're just gonna post that for us so that makes it super easy on my behalf
though keep in mind I still have to make sure it works so in that case you PayPal
the money with the anything there's a couple of dollars fees but you do get
the buyer protection so that's just so I don't get hosed or anything like that
other than that there were some other deals that people didn't get back to us
on a 480 gigabyte SSD a 32 gigabyte kit of memory and also an i-5 6500 and there
was that power supply that we offered 25 bucks for they got home actually just
like an hour ago so it's pretty late here and they said that that home now
and you go pick it up and I was like well I'm already back on the Gold Coast
and they're up in Brisbane that's like a one-hour drive in between so I just said
if I'm back up in Brisbane in the next week I will drop in and pick it up so
that's really not a deal that I'm like super hanging for so it just ended up
being bad timings anyhow we're gonna get some rest now and we'll see you guys
very soon and now we are back out of the next day and we've already made three
gaming setups photoed them and we've also pulled that p55 out bend the pins
back and that fortunately is booting up and that's working fine with that I 7
860 also put the power supply under the power supply tester it is giving out all
green lights so that $40 deal ended up working out really well but from here on
in I haven't gotten any responses yet from some of those feelers that didn't
get any replies from yesterday so we're just gonna forget about those and
we're gonna start from a whole new tangent here so basically what are we
waiting for let's go find some more deals [Music]
so we have scoured Gumtree now from tip to toe and I've put some feelers out
there for graphics cards so we did find a gtx 1650 super but that was $200 now
someone's beat me to it apparently so I'm waiting on word back from that if
the person doesn't come through I can then get myself this gtx 1650 super
there was also a 980 TI that i put in an offer of $250 there was also another 980
TI up to sell that had some kind of problem with it and it did sound like a
very weird problem so kind of want to shy away from cards that have problems
especially if they're asking around market value for those components but
then there was also a potential deal on a gtx 1070 where we put down an offer of
initially I made a mistake where I click the keyboard too fast and put down $3
when I messaged and I said sorry would you take 300 so I mean it's pretty much
fair value for a GTX 1017 $300 but hopefully they take that and get back to
us so we're waiting on a few feelers on GPUs to get back to us
but then we scoured like pretty much the whole section of gum trees components
and we also went on Facebook and did the same and there was some monitors that
popped up for sale and they said make an office so they got some cheap 19-inch
monitors and I said what would you take five bucks for a monitor they said sure
thing so I'm gonna go pop around now and grab five of those and just so I've got
some bangers for banger PC builds if I do come into those sort of real budget
parts especially with the GTX 6-4 fives and it's still gonna feel with us anyway
but that aside let's get to the yes 'mobile and get cracking and I did say
the new yes 'mobile we have taken delivery in the last few hours of this
car that I will make a separate car video on that you guys have been
requesting I talk about cars for quite some time
we can go down history lane I do love cars they are a big part of my life
especially when I was a young a kind of guy and laws were a little bit more
lenient towards younger guys driving faster cars at least in a strap without
a side we will make a separate video because I want to get these parts on
done before the end of the month let's go hit it
[Music] [Applause] [Music] so we're now back with the five monitors
that we picked up and when I got there they asked me I could pick out what
monitors I wanted so I picked out this sanyo I guess it's a bigger 22 inch sort
of TV style monitor then there was a 19 inch and then 317 inches and before I
went there I said $25 but then they asked me if I had a PC a riser cable and
I said actually I do and so I traded a PC a riser cable for
these five monitors and then when I was there I asked me to had any more parts
and they said look come and check out my setup and what I've got and they ended
up having to foggy about sticks of RAM so I gave him 10 bucks for that so that
was a decent pickup and it was good to see that I guess everyone who's I guess
selling stuff is passionate about PC gaming whether they're into used parts
or new parts or whatever but in terms of the graphics cards the people haven't
gotten back to us with those graphics cards the 1650 Super's guy sold that so
there is a solution if you're in astray and you're looking for a graphics card
at a decent price we'll sit down and talk about that now and now we are here
finally at the finish line where the whole tally of this month ends up being
eleven hundred and eighty Aussie dollars and I'm gonna call it quits here because
it's pretty much me just sort of like in this perpetual cycle of trying to find a
quick one time deal and it's just not happening supposed to yesterday there's
all these deals waiting and I'm just snatching them all up and now it's sort
of like milk the cream out of the market and now we're left with some one timers
and here's the thing about graphics cards this still looks like on the used
market graphics cards are in high demand people are looking to snap up grabs
cards all the time that's the trend that I can easily see from looking at the
market as opposed to motherboards and all the other stuff seems to be like not
as in where I could still find some deals there but if you guys are in a
straight like I go onto Aussie bargains sometimes and I check because it's
really good like you can go onto eBay and see the sales and find those deals
but sometimes on Aussie bargains there's these really good deals where they link
these sites that you just I guess I never go to personally and they've got
really good deals and one of them is for 350 Aussie dollars for a 1660 soup ah so
that's a pretty good deal if you're in a strange looking for a graphics card you
don't want to bother with the use market you know on a basel with that whole
hustle like it's pretty crazy at the moment for GPU it's like just seeing
those jeebies getting snapped up and the thing about yesterday's graphics card to
that even the 1050 TI was that when I bought that card they messaged me and I
said look someone else is coming to pick this up they've offered me asking price
but because we agreed on 120 they continued through with that so I was
very thankful for that person I was like hey that's good to see someone stick to
their word that's awesome but you can just tell what yesterday and today that
it's just GPU craze and so if you find a good deal on a new GPU just go that
route don't even bother with the use market in that regard but in terms of
monitors like Ram 1st gen 2nd gen 3rd gen stuff that stuff is still readily
available the power supplies can be had here and there of course if you're going
to do that make sure you get your power supply tester and with all that aside
it's just been a crazy month I mean I am so tired right now just exhausted I mean
if you guys are tired to make sure you hit that like button for us to it's just
been like I don't know this month so much stuff has come through like the the
motherboards be 550 Zi 490 and the motherboard test when I run through
those reviews I've got to test them from tip to toe because I'm making
recommendations on them so that's super like I like to be on point with my
recommendations there so testing like it was like over 15 motherboards this month
it's just being crazy because I've got to do a z4 90 roundup still and I'm
basically like you know all those multiples reviews into one big review so
that's coming as well later this month actually not later this month will be
early next month and then after that we're gonna get onto all those juicy
videos finally that I've been promising like the input latency test with Intel
versus AMD there's also some other stuff that I have all thinking about lately
and it has to do with Mini ITX so I'm gonna be going down this whole latency
rabbit hole again because it does interest me quite a bit and also on that
note I may go down a power sumption efficiency curve rabbit holes
it is all these new things I want to try it and of course the Zeon comparisons
x79 is the main one that I'm gonna be comparing against that new 3,800 xt
versus the ten nine hundred k even though x79 is like seven years old now
that z on the sixteen atv2 doesn't matter i think it can definitely put on
a show if we run some of the best ddr3 memory through it so all that stuff is
coming hope you guys have enjoyed this month's part time as well and if you
have to make sure you hit that like button for us it lets me know that you
guys are loving the use parts hunt and I guess everything in between used mix
with new especially let's see what the use stuff can do so stay tuned for that
and also let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite
pickup of today me personally I'm gonna say x58 those Acer Aspire I've never
seen them before and the fact that they got x58 in them and the fact that we got
them for 85 Aussie dollars is just awesome in itself so that was a pretty
good pickup and also those red WD drives I mean they're not it wasn't such a good
deal but I love the look of that hard drive and that sticker on there Loki I
don't know what it is but looks pretty cool anyway that aside we've got the
question of the day here and this comes from just op rush Z and they asked video
on 3300 X with a 320 mulder board and basically I'm not gonna do another video
with 3300 X on a 320 because I've really done the risin 5 3,600 on the a320
motherboard I'll put the link to that video up here if you haven't seen it but
basically what I'll sing from coupling that CPU with an a320 was that that's
the max I would go with and now the 3600 does use more power when everything's
stressed and precision boosts going and doing its thing it's actually using a
little bit more power than the 3300 X so 3300 X is going to be absolutely fine on
an a320 motherboard and even in my recent video when I tested the I'll
express a320 multiples out put a link to that video out there I actually tested
out the city surrounded X on those cheaper motherboards which is not as
good as the gigabyte or as rocket or a zoo ceramic side boards and that held up
fine on the real cheap boards so 3300 X a 320
it's going to be absolutely fine and if you have already tested that and just be
careful with the real cheap I'll Express boards with a 3600 and especially a
1,600 AF hope that answers that question without sight if you guys have stayed
this spa and you're enjoying that content you want to see at the moment it
drops then make sure you hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
