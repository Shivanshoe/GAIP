over the last month I've been looking to get meself a good deal on a used graphics card but it seems wherever I look prices have gone up and the first two instances of prices going up in the past in relation to graphics cards had to do with cryptocurrency miners and buying up all the gaming graphics cards hence leaving the gamers without any graphics cards to purchase at reasonable prices just a basic supply and demand thing however this time around it's a lot different and that is we're coming off the back of a GPU mining craze where I think I was just used to prices being so low on used graphics cards about a year ago that I quite simply have to readjust and so the prices have naturally slowly creeped up on gtx 1066 gigabytes and also gtx 1070 s they seem to be the to cream of the crop graphics cards to get if you're flipping used pcs however that being said we are going into a very unusual time here in the tech space and that is due to some particular thing going around in the world at the moment making people sick but there's also another factor at play where I live personally in Australia and that is the Aussie dollar it has dropped over the last few months against the US dollar and since the USD is the world's based currency and that makes the prices especially for new tech go up in price we're talking things like gtx 1660 supers rise in CPUs are x57 hundreds all those things go up because all these companies like AMD Intel and NVIDIA do their business and MSRP s in USD first and foremost and as I've always said in the past the prices of new products will dictate the prices of used products and also vice versa they share a very strong relationship and examples of this have been prices of used i5s used die sevens and even use eons coming down a lot in price over the last couple of years thanks to risings competition but also on that note during the cryptocurrency mining craze we saw used GPU prices go up dramatically too but with all that precursor out of the way here today I'm gonna be looking to go out and pick up some use graphics cards and just see how much the asses have changed first a couple of months ago where I've got a few deals on the line here and it's night time so there's going to be no traffic and I can quickly and easily get some of these deals I'm also going to be looking on eBay seeing what I can snatch up because yeah there's a big gravitational pull for me needing some gravis cards [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so just got back now to the tech yes studio it's about 9:30 p.m. at night and usually I'm not this sleepy but I am a bit sleepy because I got like a head cold going on that's I don't know it's basically when you just like feeling pretty dizzy and you don't know why you're feeling dizzy anyway that aside we've got the goods here on the table where the first person that I met up with but this was for the GTX 780 lightning they are they threw in some goodies like they knew who I was so they're like do you want some Zeon's and I'm like whoa yeah I mean I could never say no to a Xeon and so they chucked in these 2e 5:24 40s and then they had an i5 4590 sitting around as well as an old ice 3 the biggest thing though was they gave me like 48 gigabytes of ACC registered ddr3 memory and I mean I know my values pretty well that much like the RAM alone might be worth more than that GTX 780 so thank you very much for that that's a really cool donation to the channel but speaking of the grass card it's the lightning 780 now this card and there's something that's really crazy about this whole story here we'll get onto that soon this 780 lightning I actually owned this in the past and this cooler is I believe like 1.5 kilograms from memory it's huge the cod is massive and back when it first came out it was there wasn't many made and it was ridiculously expensive and I managed to snag one of these up on eBay for 480 USD and well that was shipped from the u.s. to Japan when I lived in Japan at the time and his like the bizarre thing about all this I sold this card for Gorman Neeson and that was I I mean in strained all the terms right now it'd be like over like six hundred and seventy dollars or something like that and I'm getting it for $80 so there's the price difference in that amount of time but I sold this card and then bought this card which I also picked up tonight this exact same model this is the gigabyte g1 gaming and it's the GTX 970 so it's just so crazy because I literally like never get these cut like this card it's the first time I bought one of these on the channel and then the same night I get the card that I replaced it with in the past here as well in the same hunt like that's just really I don't know maybe that's meant to mean something but I don't know what it's meant to mean so if you guys have any ideas what this weird coincidence means then please share in the comment section below but then we've got the last one here the gtx 750ti just a little pickup great for some budget builds you can never say no to a cheap 750ti and it needs a 6-pin but even some like budget power suppliers have like basic six pins or you can use converters and you're not gonna have any issues with that two of these cards need some serious tech yes loving though this 750ti and this one in particular does need some real good tech s loving so i mean the guy did I can smell by the like the smell coming off this the guy did vape pretty hard so that's probably why the dust is a bit more worse than it should be but this gtx 780 is actually in really good condition but regardless all three of these cards will be getting some good loving when i go to put them in builds or if you guys really want to see a video with some of these popular cards maybe I can do a breakdown of the 1060 verse the 970 versus 780 that would be pretty cool just to see the value proposition there with those three cards because I don't know like the reason the 780 is probably not so popular these days is because it's getting old and was high powered right anything with that scenario or that combination is likely to fail sooner than later so the 970 is still pretty popular because it wasn't a hot running card it was actually pretty cool especially the g1 gaming but I know the GTX 780 did consume quite a lot of power so this card here although it's probably this card is gonna be fine because I put in some ridiculously good components on it and it ran really cool but a lot of 780 s they didn't get the cooling right on them like not exactly right so anyway that aside I'm going to wake up in the morning and we are going to get some gtx 1060 s because the guy is on the Gold Coast I messaged him denials late look I want to come through get these 10 60s and he said come in the morning he's busy working tonight so yeah I'll go pick them up in the morning and then we'll also check obey as well see if we can find any deals because I need to stock up more more more gravis cards this is the season to be in the city of gravis [Music] a new day brings about new opportunities and waking up and getting straight into eBay and also Facebook marketplace and Gumtree I found a deal on a gtx 960 they want 70 I offered 60 cash pickup they did say negotiable so hopefully they get back to me and they say yes though I did also go on eBay and run through some of the ads where there was 220 70s I've found still available for 550 oz eh so I snapped out both of them there's also 2 1066 gigabytes for 225 each with free postage so I snapped both of them up and then there was also 210 70s now the guy who's selling me 210 70s he does have like literally no feedback so I'm taking a gamble there but I know with eBay and new sellers they do hold their money in escrow for like 21 days and since he's local I do expect to get the cards in the next few days and so I am getting those 10 70s for 280 Aussie a pop which is pretty good in the current situation on the market and he did take photos of the actual cards themselves the easiest way to point out a scammer is if they're using pretty much stock footage of that graphics card rather than taking their own shots so that's always something to look out for though I'm still waiting on the guy locally with the 410 60 to get back to me so if we end up snapping that up we'll have over 13 GPUs in a one day sprawl here but in the meantime you guys pointed out on Twitter and also Instagram that the 750ti and also the GTX 970 they're in desperate need of some tech yes loving so we're going to clean up these three cards now and just see the before and after quickly [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and here we are now back at the studio with five more GPUs to add to the stack they're all in really good condition happy with these deals considering I personally have to readjust to the market where I am locally I'm looking at some of those prices on the US eBay at the moment and I'm getting a bit jealous you guys have gtx 1060 s 1070 s rx5 ATS Vega 56 is even all that stuff is available even at Buy It Now prices for pretty good prices though I know for a fact in the US if you go on places like offer up and Craigslist you can even get better deals like much better deals than those prices are already on eBay so that's the difference between the u.s. and Australia at the moment where I am personally where mining deals have completely dried up there's no more GTX 10 70s and mass to be had as well as 10 60s and since our prices of new GPUs have went up as I said earlier they used GPUs prices are going up - and I've just personally got to readjust to that even though it sucks you've got to be able to do that in the used market so if I want to be able to actually make a gaming PC I go to accept that my older pricing structure that I had in my head is now changing a bit and I've got to quickly adjust to that otherwise I'm not gonna have any gaming PC's for sales so it's gonna be an interesting market interesting times where I'm gonna be reporting for you guys what's going forward especially with this virus going on through the world at the moment and affecting shipping times where I was gonna say in this video that Aliexpress always has your back in that you can go on there and get our x4 70s rx 488 gigabyte models for really good prices and you can get them in readily available quantities but the problem is is you're going to be waiting some places like Australia a good 60 days I'm still waiting on some of my orders that I've got two months ago so the shipping times are basically a complete nightmare at the moment where if you're buying graphics cards and computer parts you most likely want to be buying them locally at the moment or unless you know that your country is not having any holdups in customs like some of the guys in the UK are reporting that some of the products from Aliexpress are coming through absolutely fine though I know for a fact in Australia there are some pretty big holdups at the moment does that being said let us know in the comment section below what you think about the market at the moment some of you guys have asked me to do a video on whether you should buy a PC now or not and I did get this question asked in a live stream which I honestly did not have the answer then and there because I did not research it enough and we've definitely got some differing opinions out there at the moment and of course should you panic buy a PC right now I'll probably make a dedicated video on that very soon here on the channel though with that aside today's video was focused on GPUs and GPU prices and how basically me personally as a guy who resells pcs I've got to adjust my structure to accept that sometimes prices go back up regardless of where you are in the world and that's just the way things go in life just that rollercoaster of ups and downs though we've got the question of the day which comes from Daniel I saw and they asked hello how did you decide that the RGB works and they're referring to our Jules Eon streaming setup that we did I'll put the link to that video up here where in that video we did have a motherboard that it did indeed have no RGB addressable RGB header connection and so they're wondering that they have an LGA 1366 x58 motherboard from a Zeus they can't get the RGB to work and so how did I get it to work in that video and the good thing about that was you'll notice that I bought this Gambia's power supply and it said RGB on the box but it's actually a RGB in that it's got its own RGB controller on that power supply itself and it's got its own header for the addressable RGB option so I plugged all the RGB into the power supply which then powered all the lights so that's one good workaround with that power supply that it offers for people who are dealing with older pcs without that addressable RGB header but also people who are dealing with motherboards like a320s and stuff without those headers on board too so really good design there that's why I got that power supply I did forget to mention that in the video I think but that's one reason I did get it so awesome design there if you guys are digging these videos be sure to hit that like button for us and of course I'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content and you know you're subbed and you know what to do and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now play [Music]
