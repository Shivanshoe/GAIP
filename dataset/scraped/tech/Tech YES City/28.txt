[Music] what is crackalackin tech yes citizens we are finally here in japan and what better way to celebrate the return to japan than a used pc parts hunt checking out the beautiful junk stores which uh the main one is the hard off everyone loves the heart off when we've talked about that one in the past and seen what pc parts they have but also i have uh sorry i haven't uploaded in a couple of weeks i came into japan i was really exhausted getting in here was a big mission and i will be making a video talking about japan because a lot of you guys behind the scenes have a lot of questions so i will make a video addressing all the sort of side quests that we did getting to japan and what's been happening in the last couple of weeks but the main reason for me coming back here was to see my son and reconnect with him and it's been over two years and it's just really good we've caught up on a lot of lost time but now that he is at school today we're going to go on a used pc parts hunt check out what deals a cracker lacking so let's get into it [Music] i don't miss the old days [Music] never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again with today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated as little as 15 dollars using that coupon bftyc links in description below so coming out of this first hard off i didn't actually get anything in there more so i just took a look around since this one actually isn't too far from where i'm staying it's only about 10 minutes so if i want to come back and get stuff here i can pretty much come back here any time but what i did was i just got a base line of the prices that they have and i'm going to compare them to some of the other stores that we go to here today so i know which is a better deal one deal that i did see that i was thinking about picking up i'll have to actually come back with a screwdriver or something and open the case up because it was like this nec pc a 5800 and it had a seller on d sticker on it but the power supply looked like it had been changed around and they said it had a gtx 680 in it and i mean that could be a good deal for a hundred dollars or i think the yen is a lot cheaper than the us dollar so usd wise would be closer to maybe 85 or something like that so having a gtx 680 in there and possibly even a better motherboard a better system could be an absolute win but of course we're going to go check out what other used bargains there are at the next place which is called one directs and so pretty much there's two uh junk store chains that you can go to in japan and that's uh hard off and also one directs they're my two favorite especially if you're in the prefecture that i'm in which is called chibaken [Music] so coming out of that first wonder x we ended up picking up this power supply right here 450 watt 80 plus bronze and it's got all black cabling on it and this costs 16 other than that the monitors were a little bit pricey in my opinion the laptops there was nothing really there i did see a in-wind case but the foot was broken and it was a bit of an older model so if i'm buying a case directly just for the case itself i definitely want it to have a clear side panel even if it's missing a foot i can usually fix that up pretty easily but the best deal in there which i definitely wanted to buy if i was in australia i would have bought in a heartbeat was a z5500 logitech surround sound system and they said it works perfectly fine and that was only i think usd i'll put the usd pricing up for you guys around like 58 or something like that just ridiculously cheap for a system of that kind of grade but the problem is is that if i got that system and put it in an apartment in japan it would probably shake the whole building and i'd have complaints on my hands so there's that element to think of but in terms of building a budget used gaming pc we have the first part here today but now we're going to keep on moving to these other junk stores and see if we get some more components ah [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] so we just did a double combo at the pc depot which for a few years back i remember this place used to have some pretty good deals on used hardware from time to time but now pc depot has gone like all apple store in that you go in there and it's completely different and they've even got like this pc building course in there yeah yeah that's fine that's fine that's fine i don't think it comes out in the background anyway so so that pc depot ended up just being a complete boss but then next door to the pc depot they have a heart off and this one's quite big and in the past i've picked up some really good deals at this hard off so going inside of this hard off there was a monitor 19 inch i found this in the junk section for about currency adjusted 4 us dollars and i decided to put that in the kitty and then going through the pcs they had just a lot of overpriced crap but there was one pc that did catch my eye and this was a 30 60 ti whole system with one terabyte ssd 16 gigabytes of ddr4 10 400 and they wanted around about 760 us dollars for this but what i tried to do was since i've got a three month visa and it's more considered like a single entry you get tax off everything visa i tried to use that there to get like a hundred dollars off and the guy said no we can't do that and i'm thinking to myself that's a little bit awkward because a lot of stores especially on higher priced items they do take the tax off and so i was a little bit annoyed i couldn't get the 10 off especially at a place where they advertise that they do accept us dollars like directly and they've got their own exchange rate there so i found a little bit odd because that for me was the deal breaker in that if you're an end user this pc would have been a really good deal but since it was like i've got to get it and if i want to do a flip i'd want to change it to a bling case possibly upgrade the cpu to an i7 it's kind of like i'm taking a bit of a gamble i feel if i'm messing around and since i'm only just new to the japanese market here i don't exactly know what i'm in for and so in the first few weeks i'm definitely going to be learning the hustle here and picking up the ins and outs and let's uh speaking of that journey let's continue on now to the next hard off something's burning on my heart tonight [Applause] and it's all because of you something's changing so we just rocked up to the next heart off and this place is called ajiki and going inside just like the other places they have a lot of just really off pricing on a lot of stuff a lot of the other pricing is actually kind of close to new as well so my thinking is why buy used if you can buy new for pretty much the same price it just makes no sense on a lot of these parts but anyway going through the inside of this place i looked high and low as i'm doing through all these junk stores and i did come through a b75 with eight gigabytes of ram a cpu cooler a cooler master cooler and they didn't detail the cpu and they wanted 30 roughly 30 for it and they said it boots to the bios but then they said when i was going to buy it they said look the pcie port doesn't work and i'm thinking to myself actually i think the pc because i've tested a lot of these uh third gen boards before i do think the pci report works i just think they used the newer graphics card on and they just didn't update the bios so i decided to pick that up since it looked like it was in pretty good condition and that's sort of like the only deal they had they had a lot of other stuff that was just the pricing was really off i mean like seven hundred dollars for a gtx 1070 system an i7 6700k so they're pretty much asking what uh facebook marketplace sellers at least where i am locally would ask for their pcs except there's no bling on their pcs either so you know you've got to put the bling on top and then maybe hard off might be doing a bit better so i mean there's probably a thought for hard off they can just uh add a bit of rgb to the store into all their items and probably be sold out but honestly guys at this pace i've hit up five places and i've got a motherboard combo a power supply and i mean i've got a monitor but i i don't really have a whole lot of parts to build a whole pc i've seen some cases but none of them have clear side panels at least for a decent price and in good condition and so i'm left sort of like whoa okay i need to hit another avenue because i think things have changed since i've been here and that i think the especially before the virus uh hit places like hard off were doing really well but then that hit and i think a lot of people from what i'm told i've asked around here a lot of people are now selling their stuff on merukari meodukari so i've got to jump on that app when i get back and see what's crack-a-lacking [Music] so my boy finished school and he came home and we're going to a place called kantidan now and it's on this sort of like big road but on the way going there i found this secondhand store and they just like re they call it a recycle yard and there's little let's say hello there he is there's number one and we found this right here is number two and this is a deal uh for a tempered glass it's got looks like it's got four rgb fans in it a view 31 they're asking about uh 3980 yen or something and i thought well it looks like it's pretty much brand new and i do need some bling so i decided i'd get this and they didn't really have any other pc parts there but again always getting a real good bling tempered glass side panel case for as cheap as possible is a win so uh let's get to the next location and also left my shades back in australia so i just picked these up for five bucks so let us know in the comments section below if you're digging the new tech yes shades [Music] so this place right here we stopped into is called a chiba kantedan now this place is massive but it was a bust for electronics at least pc parts they had pretty much everything else under the sun here comic books jewel masters which my son absolutely loves and personally i've been getting into it a little bit too since i've been in japan fire and nature for the win but yeah pc parts complete boss so there's a heart off about two kilometers from here so i'm just going to quickly dock in there and see if they've got anything hopefully we've got something i still need a graphics card and an ssd to complete a used pc but it's just looking like a lot of these places there's definitely been a shift in the meta since i've been here and i've got to learn the whole japanese pc hustle market and how it shifted [Music] [Applause] [Music] me so the last heart off that we managed to get to actually had a second street right next door and that's another sort of recycling used place where people just dumped their used things and unfortunately i have been to this location in the past and it was a bust in the past and this time around it was another bust but i did get a lot more clued on and a lot more information out of this last hard off which to me was actually a very good tell of what a lot of these hard offs are doing and one thing i noticed was there was no graphics cards that i would want personally for a decent gaming pc at any of these stores that i went to today at least at a decent price and so when i went to the last hard off what i saw there was a g-tune pc and now g-tune in japan basically make only gaming pcs and so this had like an i7 90 8 gig of ram and to be honest if i had 16 gig of ram and an ssd i might have bought it for that price i think it would have been a pretty decent deal but it just had eight gig of ram and no ssd and of course no graphics card but this company that makes these pcs originally they always include a gaming graphics card in them and then the pc next to that was another manufacturer that made gaming pcs and there was no graphics card in that again and then they sort of made a a note a footnote there hd graphics and it's like like well yeah you know that's the worst kind of graphics you can get on pc so go for it and advertise that but i just thought that okay these hard offs and these junk stores in japan are sort of clued on now to the pc parts and they want to start extracting the most value that they can out of it and of course i've got nothing against that just i'm really going to be shying away from going to these places where what we saw here today i lost count of how many places i went to and i picked up a power supply a motherboard which i just got home before and i pulled it apart pulled the cooler off and as you guessed it there's a pentium underneath completely useless cpu and so we've got a motherboard eight gig of ram and a cool master cooler for a 3300 yen and then we got that monitor for 500 yen and we got that rgb case the thermaltake vue 31 tg and so i was actually kind of happy that we got that because i thought it was a pretty good deal in order to make a really nice looking rig especially at a budget price point however you guys may be wondering well brian what are you going to do now at least for the rest of this part-time right we need to see at least the components to put together a gaming pc and that's where i've installed the app um merukadi i think they call mercury i think in europe it's pretty popular as well but essentially this is where just people put their stuff up online and speaking to a lot of people in the last few years instead of these people going to the junk stores they'll just check out what they've got and they'll put it all up on this app and get rid of it and they'll get obviously a lot better money by selling it on this app than they would by going to the junk stores where the junk stores will give you next to nothing for your stuff probably like five percent of what it's worth maybe 10 if it's a really hot item they might give you 30 40 percent but if you sell this on merukari then you'll get a lot more money even though merukari takes i believe a 20 cut it's actually quite big but they act as a third party so the seller sends the stuff off the buyer gets it then the buyer i think it has they have two days or three days to confirm that the stuff works and say the metacarter yep it works i didn't get hosed and then the seller gets the money so it's actually got a system in place so you don't get hosed so anyway what i'm going to do is i'm going to sort of sleep this one off it's like i came into japan and honestly in the next video we'll make i'll explain all the problems i've come into but besides me getting very lucky in order to see my son everything else has actually kind of been bad luck and i will detail that to you guys uh very soon but when wake up in the morning i will look for a gravis card i'll look for hopefully a zeon if there's a cheap one around an ivy bridge xeon or even a sandy bridge xeon another 8 gig of ram and an ssd and we'll put together a budget gaming pc in japan just like old times where that's sort of like the feeling i'm getting i'm just really excited being back here getting back to those sort of grass roots of what started the whole tech hustle even though the whole dynamic in japan has changed when we went to australia it was a whole different market there i just feel like it's a lot of fun learning the ins and outs and getting straight back into it even though things have definitely changed here uh since two and a half years since the last time i've been back anyhow guys we'll sleep on this one and i'll catch you in the morning and welcome back to the next day and we've been looking on this app mayo cudi and it's been the answer at least for finishing off today's parts hunt as well as finishing off the remaining components that i need for a gaming pc so what i looked for was i checked the gtx metal what was the card that's the best value on the used market at least in japan going through 980s 970s 960s even going through gtx 700 series and of course 1000 series cards i found that i think for the the best bang for buck card i could find at the point in time was the gtx 970 so i managed to pick up one of these for 88 us dollars and that shipped i believe it was a little bit more expensive because i just joined mail cuddy i was able to get a 500 yen discount and this also this 500 yen discount i've got to ask someone why i keep getting it but i found a i7 3770 for around 30 i think it's 35 us dollars when we adjust the yen to the us dollars and that was 4 299 yen so really good deals on those two used components and i also found an additional eight gigabytes of ram and that was a 2 000 yen or 15 us dollars so i want to have 16 gigabytes of ram in the system and also want to have an i7 and a decent graphics card but the last component of course was the ssd and this was a i was looking for a 500 gigabyte ssd and so looking on mail cuddy actually didn't show me any decent deals and so i went to amazon and they were having a time sale on a 500 gigabyte ssd and we managed to get that delivered for 38 us dollars so we've got some pretty good deals here i'll pull up the tally for this month's used pc parts hunt though with that aside do let us know in the comment section below what you think of the first pc parts hunt coming from japan and what was your favorite deal that we picked up here in today's video me personally i would say that motherboard combo with the ram it's got the cooler even though the pentium kind of sucked it still was a pretty solid deal considering motherboards are actually getting harder and harder to source especially for a decent price on that sort of second third and fourth gen gear though also that rgb case i thought that was a pretty good deal though i can't wait to build this pc for you guys in a video taken it back a few years where we'd take this thing out in japanese nature film it all that good stuff is coming back so if you want to see that the moment that drops make sure you hit that sub button ring the bell you'll get the notifications as soon as they come live at you and once again i do apologize for not uploading for a little while i have had to do a few things i have had to get set up as well which has taken me a while but at least hopefully the content will be coming better than it's ever been coming to your sub boxes here at tech yes city but do stay tuned for that video also if you've got some questions about japan be sure to drop a comment down below and with that aside we do have the question of the day which comes from jason and sorry this one's actually been sort of hiatus on the questions my internet sucks at the moment because i'm just using my smartphone even to tether to my computer and my reception isn't that great believe it or not and japan but i am getting hikari fiber that's the one gigabit per second internet connection tomorrow so i can't wait to get that that'll alleviate a lot of issues i've been having but we got this question of the day here from jason which is uh how come you can get into japan so easily and multi-millionaire pewdiepie can't uh so to answer that question it was not easy to get into japan let's just take the easy part out of it i had to call up the embassy for the last six months looking for a chance to get a visa and then finally in december they had a window there but it only lasted i believe like a couple of weeks and even by the time you got your application started processing they closed it off and that was in december last year and then this year uh from march they allowed the family reunion visa to start up again as well as student and business visas and so what happened was i just immediately took that i had the documents ready actually from preparing before because i asked them look what do i need to get ready and so literally like day one of march i just applied for that visa did take a long time to go through and then i got approved at the end of march and i was like look okay everything's good i did have to get all this other stuff sorted as well because australia had like this restriction on traveling overseas like even just leaving the country so i had to sort all that stuff out and it was an absolute nightmare so it wasn't easy at all so much paperwork so much documentation and then even getting here was even more like once i landed there was even more of a hassle which we'll talk about a little bit more in depth in this next video so stay tuned for that but also in terms of pewdiepie getting over here he definitely has the funds necessary to come to japan and so i'd say for him it'd be quite doable to get a business visa get sponsored especially by a tech company if pewdiepie does need some help sorting that out i'd be more than happy to help him and get him into japan because that'd be actually really cool to see some content coming out of pewdiepie being in japan that would be absolutely awesome so if he does need some help just if one of you guys are able to contact him i would have no idea how to get in contact with him but the offers out there but guys with that aside i will catch you in the next video very soon peace out for now from japan bye [Music] you
