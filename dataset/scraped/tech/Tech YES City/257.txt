Here i've got a hair light guys, you want to make videos you need a hair light i got one right here i've also got a 5600X from AMD. Their latest Ryzen 5, which is the cpu that's being touted as the one that's going to give you the raw fps the value for money, fps king from AMD Zen 3. it's also got that new ipc as well matching that of the 5800x and the 5900x , but i feel today where this cpu right here i just feel like it's stuck in between a rock and a hard place now i know it's probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but growing up i was never the popular kid anyway so i guess there's that probably because i had unpopular opinions but the cpu right here at 299 dollars it's going to get you those high gaming performance scores right if you couple with an rtx 3080 or an rtx 3090 or even amd's upcoming 6800 xt it's going to be a nice cpu and the one that we had here overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz stable and when i was testing the games out it did a good job now the other cpus that i've had come through here the ryzen 9s and also the ryzen 7 5800x they went to 4.7GHz all cores in the case of the 5800x that went to 4.75 gigahertz or course so i think the 5800x does have the best piece of silicone for getting a all-core overclock which will help you in gaming a lot especially if you're utilizing all the cores and all threads but i can't help but think that this cpu right here this is where we're going to go into the other factors where we'll get through the 1080p gaming numbers here where i'll include the overclocks and even though the cpu went up to 4.7 gigahertz it did crash out in the games and it was very bizarre because it passed all the productivity numbers absolutely fine at 4.7 gigahertz but then when i got into the gaming numbers it just started randomly crashing out in certain parts of the game and i was like okay i guess this can't really hold a stable 4.7 so i feel like the 5600x you're going to not get as good as a piece of silicon as you are with the 5800x even though that's 150 more i'm gonna be sort of weighing up why i'm not too blown away by the 5600x and the first reason is is because there will be a 5600 coming i know that and at this point in time you have to go out and get a b550 for the cpu and the b450s won't get the bios updates till january so if you're looking for that budget play where when the 3600 came out for example that came out with a real hard hitting price 6 cores 12 threads came with the race stealth as well but you could couple that with an a320 motherboard or a b450 motherboard and you were having really good value for money as well as overclocking some budget 3200 megahertz memory now of course there are cheaper b550 motherboards but they're still more expensive in general than a b450 and on top of that the overclocking on the cheaper boards is not really there and if you're going to use a race stealth with a 5600 x it's kind of like i don't see the point honestly you can go out and get a 3600 and a cheaper b450 and you're going to be getting much better value for money and we'll pull up the geekbench multi scores and also we'll go through the productivity scores because they are impressive especially for a six core you're getting good performance and if you want to overclock it to 4.6 gigahertz you're going to be getting really good performance on that floor as well but if we look at the value for money out of the six cores even just objectively on this six core versus the previous generation six core and also intel's 10 400 f we see here that the value for money proposition does start to erode away a little bit and now for me personally in 2020 six core 12 threads does represent a sweet spot for value and so if you're going to go and get one of these cpus and say couple with a high-end gpu this is the next point that me as a person who sells gaming pcs and part takes in the market quite a bit i wouldn't personally go with a 6 core 12 thread and a high end gpu and the reason for that being is the resale value is just not there and trust me i've tried reselling a 6 core 12 thread an i5 or a ryzen 5 with a high-end gpu and pretty much there's been no interest for it everyone wants a ryzen 7 or an i7 and if you've got a ryzen 9 or 99 in there thing moves like quicker than you can imagine not gonna put the i'm not gonna put the terms that i would usually uh tell my mates in this review but it just moves pretty slowly put it that way and so your resale value with this with the high-end gpu of course it's just not going to be there and then if you're on a budget this is the thing people like you should check out the ryzen 5 5600x for budget users if you're on the budget you should go with the ryzen 5 3600 so that's where the title comes from stuck between a rock and a hard place with this cpu i'd personally if i had the extra funds i'd go out and get a nice motherboard nice cooling solution and go for the ryzen 7 5800x that's just my personal opinions i've never held back and you probably may be wondering the next question is well what about the 10600k dude you took a look at that and you reviewed that and the truth there is i actually didn't uh take a look at the 10 600k i think i included some benchmarks in the 10900k review but i was personally not keen on the 10600k and i told people that as well so you can go back through my channel where i was actually probably one of the few guys who didn't like the 10600k so nothing's changed nothing's changed from amd to intel the brand names they it really doesn't matter to me guys with the brand names so what you're getting here with the 5600x is a cpu that will do the job but i feel like with all the augmented factors at play all the extras all the little gritties that come along with the six core i'd personally go for the higher core counts at this point in time or wait for the ryzen 5 5600 and the b450 updates to drop where you're going to be saving money on the latest zen 3 cpus when that comes out or you're going to be um saving money on a b450 motherboard or both and at the moment for me personally it's a patience play and i've as an individual i'm a pretty patient dude uh when i was a kid i remember i'd go to school and my mom would pick me up this is like when i was eight or nine years old mom would pick me up from school because she finished work at like 5 30 my old man was working as well uh till pretty late and so i get picked up at school like 5 30 or something pm and you know all the other kids would leave and i'd also see some of the kids that would get picked up 30 minutes late even sometimes an hour and they would be livid they were so impatient and i was just sitting there like yo like what can you do about the situation right that's just life so i guess when i was a younger a younger lad i learned to be patient and patience is a virtue especially if you want to make the best decisions or the best purchasing decisions then patience can really pay off and so that's where my review of the 5600x comes into play and as i said in the intro probably not a popular opinion but i've never held back here on the channel with my opinions on products and when i review them what's the take but basically if you want to get a taste of zen 3 ipc and you want to get into overclocking have a lot of fun see what amd has to offer especially if you've got um a cpu that's a few years old and you've got a four core and an eight thread cpu and it does you absolutely fine for games and you're like okay well i could use two more cores four more threads and all i do is game and i want the best fps possible and you're willing to go out and get the high-end graphics card this is gonna serve you great another thing is too as we look at the 4k numbers if we look at the 4k gaming numbers your money's uh better off saved and going with even the ryzen 5 3600 or the 10400f again so the numbers are all there but in terms of the recommendations and the opinions i guess that's just my two cents on the 5600x anyways if you guys enjoyed today's video of the five 5600 x be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comment section below what's your thoughts and opinions on this cpu right here do you have differing thoughts and opinions to me or do you think i've hit the nail on the head it's always good i love a good conversation in the comments section below just like this comment right here it's actually not a question of the day but it's from mike dg and they say straight to the point as it should be and this has actually been a focus of mine with product reviews lately you guys have certainly been loving the just get straight into the details hit it to you guys so you can make an informed decision and for me personally there is so many new products just coming out and they just keep coming through here and i'm like well i honestly have to make them a lot faster otherwise i'm just not going to get the work done and so i think somewhere in the process you guys are loving the faster reviews straight to the point i'm actually loving them too i'm like actually this is how it probably should be done so awesome that you guys have been noticing that thanks for watching and i'll catch you in another one very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the content as always may wish to consider hitting that sub button ringing that bell too and i'll catch you next time peace out for now bye [Music]
