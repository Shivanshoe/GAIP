we should be live just as soon as the chat starts popping up because we have a big one here today and i hope you are doing great wherever you are in the world hope things are looking up to you this weekend but we've got some big things to talk about the first thing we're going to talk about is crypto mining has gotten so big now that people are buying laptops now just to mine on just to mine cryptocurrency so this is the big breaking story we're gonna talk about here today because it just seems like we never get a break i mean if you're a gamer and you're looking to get a gpu it just looks like you don't get a break so chat's starting to pop up what's going on guys welcome to this live stream session the tech yes city live streams we are joined by the jar jar mug i know you guys have been loving this jar jar mug because you've been telling me like i haven't heard anything bad about it either people say they love it then i don't hear anything bad actually we had one guy he said you know he was um last stream while talking about the intel cpus and how they've gotten cheaper and the guy was like man what universe am i in yeah he's got a jar jar mug and he's starting to say intel cpus are pretty good again how times change fellas how times change so what we got now um okay so we'll talk with chat uh citizens tech talk i have to go back through my email i get spammed emails so unless they've got like an exclamation mark beside them i um i generally like i just breeze through them all because there's just so much like going on at the moment with uh youtubes and stuff like that but let's just chat today and um we've got the first story we're going to get onto this first breaking story here which is it's like look i'm going to say straight away i don't really at the moment i don't i'm not i went into cryptocurrency i went into it i got into it big time i really wasn't that impressed with crypto and i mean you got to believe in if you invest in things you got to believe in it right so like i believe in uh gaming pcs and stuff so i invest in gaming pcs now crypto is one of those things if you believe in it sure go invest in it but me personally i just i'm gonna be honest with you guys i don't really believe in it yet i mean i know it's got good merits but at the moment it looks like it's just way more of a speculative investment than anything it looks like people are just buying it to make money and when we look at some of the trends going through you know like i see xrp especially like there's this one called xrp and people are like man the banks are going to be using this cryptocurrency xrp xrp xrp we'll move on to this story first right but we'll get onto this story we'll just do a bit of a bit of a discussion here about crypto itself there's a big one called xrp ripple and people like damn you know this one's huge the banks are going to adopt this thing it's going to be crazy and then i started researching what are the banks actually going to adopt right like what are the banks going to use with cryptocurrency because the merits are there with crypto right the merits are there it's going to be quick efficient worldwide transactions are going to be really good really cheap to do so there's definitely merit there but then i look at like i start searching all the big banks and cryptocurrency then i find out like apparently like is it jp morgan or goldman sachs or something like that they're all they're all together now they're making their own cryptocurrency and it's privatized so they're going to be making their own cryptocurrency it's going to be privatized no retail investors will be able to invest in it so the big banks are going to be using xrp i don't know so at the moment though people just speculating like crazy even i think even dogecoin like this this cryptocurrency that i think the um the the developers abandoned it i think and uh that one's still just like going to the moon and it's just like yeah anyway crypto let's talk about it right now ethereum mining so ethereum mining is the big one now that is the most profitable we'll pull up the profitability chart because if you got even if you've got 10 30 60 ti's you can get sixty dollars a day sixty dollars us a day if you've got a 10 uh kilowatt hour price so i'd say like 10 cents kilowatt hour us is kind of cheap it's a little bit cheaper on the cheaper side but still it's obtainable by a lot of people especially in the us so this is why people are buying up these graphics cards because if you've got 10 30 60 ti you're making 60 us a day so i mean look the money's there the crazy money's there that's why people are doing it and they're buying it all up this is how the economy works but um now we've got the laptops right so once you can't buy a gpu and once gpu prices have gone up double their msrps people are like okay what else can i do to get something now that'll still retain its value because if the whole cryptocurrency market crashes right this is the thing if the whole cryptocurrency market just crashes falls flat out down people are then going to be selling those graphics cards whether it's in a gaming pc or whether it's back to the market now if you're paying double msrp and things crash then suddenly you've got to get your money back so you're going to be selling it cheaper so that's why people are looking at msrps of laptops because if you invest in a laptop at a thousand bucks and it's worth a thousand bucks then when you go to resell it if things go belly up that's their risk-free sort of side of the purchase but going deep into this one this is crazy because someone in china they went to a starbucks cafe and then started mining on this rtx 3060 gaming laptop and they're mining on it for two hours and they made a dollar in two hours and they used the uh starbucks cafe they used their power so they just use it they're like hey thanks for the free power and they were able to pay for a coffee with their laptop so i mean i'm waiting i'm waiting until i'm waiting until uh so we got people in the chat as well like someone bought a 100 million worth of ethereum damn what was like i'd love to know the fees on that too we'll get on to the fees with ethereum as well because a lot of people are telling me the fees are ridiculous so they go to trade some crypto and they go to buy and sell and they're getting hit like over one percent and that's why crypto itself is just at the moment if you're making money in crypto it's lucrative for everybody so like i think the people buying it and selling it the brokers they're just cleaning up um and so at the moment like the whole things i don't even like i don't get where all this money well actually i do kind of know where all this money's coming from government's with the money printer and that's you know how that one goes that one's gone it's going out of control but we got back this this laptop story here right this one's interesting because you're you know i'm waiting for the day where someone just brings in 10 laptops like you know bringing in a laptop casually into starbucks you can get away with that no one's going to look at you they're like okay he's bringing in his laptop he's just using it or he or she just using their laptop in this case it was a she i think she was using a laptop and but what if you got the guy who comes in and they they bring like 10 laptops don't just just in the starbucks start you know hogging up all the wallpaper and being like yo i'm a customer i'm waiting for that vlog if someone can get that done that'll be good lols just use up all starbucks power while you're mining so there's a thing it is profitable right now as we saw with this graph like we'll go back to this graph here it is profitable to mine crypto and it's very profitable and 360 ti i mean look a laptop's not going to mine as much as that but it's apparently getting 46 mega hashes or something like that so they're telling us now with a 30 60 ti you can get maybe 58 on a 30 60 ti if i do my math correctly as opposed to 46 so you could be making with 10 laptops you could be making 45 a day so your investment would pay for itself in maybe 190 days if i'm doing my math on the fly correctly so you get 10 laptops they've paid for themselves in 190 days and i mean look as much as i don't like mining and the fact that it's pushing people out of gaming pcs there are people out there who want to make money and if there's an arbitrage an opportunity for arbitrage essentially this is like almost like arbitrage where it's free money ridiculous returns on investment so it's like of course people are going to do it i just don't really agree with it i don't see like a whole lot of merit in crypto just yet because i'm waiting to see what's actually going to be mass adopted as opposed to speculative anyhow that's the breaking news there with that one because now that we've now that all the rtx 3060s have been juiced out now that we've got all the rtx 3060s and they're gone they're long gone we're gonna i mean sorry the 360 ti 3060s are the desktop versions at least from my knowledge they're not out yet so all the gpus are just getting snapped up and then it's spanning on now it's moving over to the laptops when is this going to stop and if we look at the price of ethereum this thing's going to the like this thing has been going to the moon like where's all this money coming from that's what i want to know because i've been following like low-key i do follow the markets and i do follow investments um quite closely and this kind of extra like this kind of speculation is absolutely insane there's all this extra buffer here so like are people just like where's all this money coming from because i've noticed with the gaming pc market lately oh sorry we'll get back to um we'll get back to the screen here like this is where ethereum is right now at like 7 1600 us dollars up from 120 dollars in march 2020 where even before that it kind of when the market was pretty healthy it was only 220 dollars so you see here just this massive wave of influx of money has just come into this stuff into crypto i got no idea like that amount of speculation and investment is insane in any asset so do be careful if you want to invest in cryptocurrencies i'm going to say to you guys do be very careful how you tread with this one and uh if you're buying the hardware look if you're buying it around msrp there's not a whole lot to worry about that is the that's why gpu mining it's inefficient this is what i've said in uh previous videos i've said with gpu mining it's inefficient because there's asic miners out there but now the like because of the asic resistant nature of ethereum people are going to use graphics cards for mining so that sort of plays into it all where you've got this whole situation where people are buying up all the gaming components i just wish they would drop the acid resistance of ethereum and then we'd see a lot of relief for these gaming craft scouts because once you get the asics in there once they start mining so much with much more efficiency they just essentially make it not worth it to mine on a graphics card anymore i think the rates i think an asic per watt like off the top of my head i forgot how much it was but i think it's like 50 to 1 or something like that it's ridiculous so that means like 50 gpus with their power could only mine what one asset miner could do with that ethereum miner so like that's why i'm all for asic miners but the problem with aztec miners and i've explained this in the past the problem with asic miners is that they don't have a lot of resale value once they're gone and they're out of date and they're no longer profitable it's hard to get rid of them so i think there's like this whole like we could go down the conspiracy avenue here we could go down conspiracy lane but i just think there's a lot more to it than meets the eye why are these crypt like their whole argument was okay we've got the crypto currencies here because we want to get the average guy we want to get the average guy into cryptocurrency and it's like man the institutions are buying up all these gpus anyway all the big investors are buying up all the graphics cards they're even getting them before they hit the retailers they're like going in the channels and going yep we want a hundred or ten 000 gpus we're gonna buy them up before but we'll quickly move on to uh we'll quickly move on to chat for you guys because we've got another breaking story that's in the works okay because one thing about this whole gig at tech yes city is i like getting the word on the street right the fresh word so we'll talk about we'll go to comments quickly and it's like hey brian question what should be the value for a used 1066 gigabyte before the pandemic like cheap so i mean you could pick up a 1066 gigabyte for like 120 usd right that was like the going rate around 170 180 aussie that's where they were going down to that was like pretty decent price um yeah 150 that was about right but after that they just they've shot up now because the six gigabyte makes them profitable for mining the three gigabyte gtx 1060s i've been noticing a few of those on the market right now and they've been coming in with a price point that i like so that's a one to consider if you don't like look and this is one thing i've actually been polling people on discord and friends a lot of us guys we just play um popular multiplayer titles lately i've been playing a 10 year old game well over 10 years old now starcraft 2 i think it's like 12 years old and i've been enjoying it mainly because it's like on 4k and all that stuff but i mean you don't need a whole lot to game with i mean i know there's guys out there like look i need so much vram that i can run um crisis off the vram itself and i know those people are out there but uh for i guess the majority of people a 1063 gigabyte is going to serve you very well even jar jar would agree that a 1063 gigabyte at the right price is not a bad buy so that's what i've been saying with the going into this year if you want to build a gaming pc definitely go for the cards that are no longer profitable to be mined on and so that's definitely the 1063 gigabyte and uh the four gigabytes are moving into effect they're coming into pl uh play plower i was going to say they're coming into play and power so we've got a question brian in caps i love like you got to get the caps on man is it even possible to turn a profit in mining when you're running solar yeah like of course i'm scratching my head with that question of course if you're if you're mining on solar you're getting your power for free that's even better so like that's a win-win i think a lot of uh farms out there are using solar power and they even got the batteries so at night time they've essentially got free power going through because with a lot of solar power uh when you feed it back into the grid it's not you're not getting as much credit as you would if you were using it yourself so it's it's much more profitable to get your solar power and then use all that power yourself instead of either buying it off the grid or sending it back into the grid so yeah we've got some strange topics today that's right this is some strange topics this is strange yes city today we're going with a weird live stream but uh is it 10 78 gigabyte good nowadays yeah it's still okay like if you can get a 1078 gigabyte and for a decent price i saw one i saw one in australia going for around 280 aussie dollars that's not too bad um i could probably sell my rx 578 gigabyte for more than i bought it yeah at the moment if you guys can sell if you think this uh like i'm gonna tell you now i don't think this whole crypto thing is gonna last forever and last time we saw in 2018 it crashed it crashed big time once there's a big fallout um maybe if you look at gamestop maybe that'll give you the trend of where crypto's going right everyone's getting in people have this fear of missing out and they have that like there's this mass fear that enters the market people think they're gonna miss out on um people think they're gonna miss out on uh getting crypto and the bottom line is is that what are you actually getting always look at what you're actually getting and so with me when i look at krypto i'm like okay what how's it going to help my life first of all i'm asking myself how's crypto going to help my life and at the moment it doesn't help one bit so there's things that i need for doing my job camera gear all that stuff all this stuff helps my life so i'm going to invest in that when it comes to cryptocurrency yeah not helping me one bit so i'm not really investing in it i mean and then when i as i said before when we look at what banks because the main the main use of cryptocurrency is definitely going to be the whole banking system easy uh peer-to-peer exchanges making it lower cost making it much more efficient making everything lower in cost and much more efficient and so if the banks are already developing their own cryptocurrency and they're keeping it private then outside of that you've got smart contracts on ethereum but it looks like ethereum's becoming so expensive to put a smart contract on who knows where's this going to go i just think it's gone up too much too quick and when i see too much too quick especially when you don't have wage growth and this is a very important one when we look at economics we're going to have wage growth and inflation to support those higher prices so you've got here a massive speculative bubble that's just my opinion so there you go i'm just going to put that one out there i'm waiting on the sidelines as well i'm seeing a bit of fireworks here so um yeah anyhow we'll get back to the next topic because this one's uh i don't actually have any articles for this next topic because this one's sort of breaking news but we'll quickly jump over to a quick sponsor spot break here from elgato the microphone that i'm using right now if you guys love the sound coming out of this thing this is the wave 3 you've got the quick mute function so i can [Music] then i can turn it back on on the fly i can mute the microphone turn it back on you can't even hear me that's how cool this thing is it's also got a uh a pop filter built in and you've also got the uh attenuation built in so you'll never be able to clip no matter how hard you're talking then we've got our favorite sponsor here at tech yeah city bringing so many people happy no activation messages and this is scd keys bringing you that solid key you can get here a two for one and that's cheaper that makes it eleven dollars a key and use the coupon bftyc in the description below that's if you want to get uh legit windows 10 pro cd key they got the single if you need the double grab the double they're all cheap cheap cheap jeep that's what we're all about giving you guys the good stuff giving you guys the good stuff let's get back to it though this one's breaking in that i'm hearing a lot of different reports i'd love it if you guys in the comments gave us some of your feedback as well this one is uh failure rates now i've been hearing some stuff i'm not going to name drop any companies or any like particular field because i don't want people getting upset but i've i've been hearing this and i'd love to get some statistics on this from you guys as well but i've been hearing failure rates on things like motherboards tech other tech the failure rates lately have been higher than they've ever been on a lot of tech coming through the pipeline now i have heard from industry sources this is a big one i have heard from industry sources that a lot of companies are booked up for components say for instance we've got chokes going on graphics cards or whatnot all these little components the microchips going on motherboards they're all booked uh booked up and selling out that they're now um and a lot of these companies right if you go say i'm not going to name drop again say for instance we've got company x they're booking up say 10 000 or a million microchips and the other guys in the field they want to get those microchips they'll then say to the company we need these microchips we need to make motherboards so then the companies are booked out and what's up guys i read in the chat we'll get this story done then we'll move back over to chat you guys are like yo chat chat chat what's going on chat's going poppin but this one's big because what's happening now is a lot of these companies are selling essentially b grade items because there's so much demand for the components going in a lot of the tech they're selling their b grade stuff and all the companies are still snapping it up because they've got to get products out the door so say for instance you've got a mean time before failure of 50 000 hours they might be selling stuff that's be great at 25 000 hours meantime before failure but the thing is it's inherently lower quality so i don't know with you guys but i've been hearing locally from a few retailers where i'm at that the failure rates on motherboards and things like that are starting to go up they're higher they're unusually higher than they've been so i want to know from you guys if you've been buying new parts quite regularly have you been having problems with hardware lately like that's a bit abnormal that's a bit abnormal because i i've been i've been noticing it too man failure rates around takeout city as well failure rates of stuff has been a lot higher in the last six months too that's my personal personal uh observation as well things like ram all the way to motherboard i had a faulty motherboard come through had some brand and i'm just finding these failure rates are going up so do let us know in chat if you guys have been having some uh quality yeah qc issues so we've got a five dollar dono here thanks for that pete the welder just got a red devil 6800 xt and i just learned the ek water block radeon special edition won't fit lol i have to get a reference now if you got hey if you got that 6800 xt at retail msrp you're gonna have no problems reselling it that thing's like gold at the moment so you'll be able to get your reference card uh but yeah the water block situation at the moment especially if we look at the nvidia side of things the water block uh situation is crazy because you've got them making uh water blocks for reference designs and then the founders card on nvidia side the founders edition isn't even a reference design so you now got to look if you're looking for a water block on an nvidia card you got to be careful if you've got the founders edition you're gonna be careful that you don't get the reference block because it won't fit and vice versa so that's one thing going on with the uh with the water cooling blocks at the moment so um og yoji i love your vids and christopher yee okay so thanks you love my vids but you love christopher yee how's that like does chris love you back i mean i love all you guys but just chris that's one thing and i've been saying this about mr yee i openly challenge him anytime i can't wait to challenge him again i want to challenge him again at the part time because that's one of the i look back in the history of the channel and i look back with chris and that was one of the most fun like the funnest thing i ever did was one of the funnest competitions i ever did was when i was in the us and we just hit the road together and we had this competition to build uh build the used pcs that was one of my those one of my favorite memories i don't know if it's like one of his good memories but i absolutely loved it i was just having fun man on the road in a place that i don't even know looking on websites that i'm not used to i think i was on craigslist and i was on craigslist and i found this uh rx oh man it was a 480 found the rx 480 and then yi was like sweating i remember because he had to take me around because i didn't have a car he's driving me to the deal and he's like he's sweating in the car so it's really good memories man some of the like the competitions are awesome like uh we're gonna get that going again it's just the whole covert thing is really making it tough oh we have a 20 donor thank you nefarious technology i've built 10 systems with returned motherboards and have had zero issues with it okay also witnessed over 40 graphics cards over the last two months no issues now the radeon 7 that's another story most issues have been user related okay you might have got the quality stuff on you got lucky maybe you got the different bin we got gravy with a one dollar thanks for the donut brother the easy one dollar and it's aussie too that the a means it's an aussie dollar but um here's jar jar as well cheers to jar jar would you recommend second hand water block ooh pie would i recommend a second hand water block depends you've got to see that in person right i wouldn't honestly i wouldn't buy a secondhand water block online unless there was some real high quality photos because what happens with secondhand water blocks is if the seals or whatever if the thing's been run in bad conditions you know it's it's much of a risk so i consider it more of a risk but if you can see if you know the person and you go meet them and they're like look just this thing's been babied all its life it's been taken really good care of the second hand water block can be a good buy but for a lot of the used stuff i'm buying now i'm actually checking it out before i get it i actually got two good deals uh we did the server pc i hope you guys enjoyed that last video we did with the server pc that one um that was interesting because i picked up a 1050 ti i got that for a good price and then 120 aussie uh then we got a gtx 1063 gigabyte for 140 aussie so i was happy with both those deals so it kind of looks like the the whole market for used pcs right now is getting pretty cheap in australia because i think in australia a whole lot of people aren't mining crypto as much as they are in america i think the whole crypto craze is definitely flowing through us like you wouldn't believe but in australia it's still sort of i think people got burnt from 2018 i know a lot of people personally who got burnt from the 2018 crypto mining phase and they're like i'm just gonna sit back uh we got sebastian lee with the five dollar dono thank you brother i'm an employee that works in the capacity industry we are fubar there we go we are so backed up and the amount of folding components have skyrocketed there we go thank you so much sebastian that kind of that kind of plays into the rumors i've been hearing about i've been speaking to quite a few people again not going to name drop and yeah you work in the you work in the industry don't name drop or anything that's kind of what we've been hearing about is that they just booked like the tech companies are booked through the roof for the components and that's and they've got to get like they've got to meet demand right i mean any business wants to be profitable right and then the business but the thing is it's not just the profitability side a lot of the companies are like look we'll take anything you've got so it doesn't really fall back on the the component makers they're kind of like some of them would be like okay we got a quality standard to maintain here and then they're like but we need this stuff we need to get products out say motherboard maker x they need to get component and so they're just they're just getting like it's just absolute demand fest right now and they're trying to keep up the supply so never seen anything like this and you probably the thing is you probably might not see something like this again in your lifetime so we're living in interesting times here with the whole market the market misha think the market is all messed up that's right jar jar the market is messed up so okay have you thought about uh putting the server gaming pc in a desk to turn it into a desk pc that that is a good idea that's one that's a really good idea i'd have to hollow out a desk or find one with maybe like the slide out or something that's a pretty good uh that's a pretty good idea with the server rig i kind of want to put it upside down and then just like just stick it on the back like just mass double-sided tape get the server stick it underneath the desk and then leave it hang in there you need some really good uh really i think you could do it with some good adhesive as well silicon as well that's a how to make do you guys want to see that how to make the easiest uh desk under desk gaming pc just grab a server rack adhesive slap it on the bottom there we go so now we got we got mushrooms again we've got someone spit i'll let one of them get the mushrooms spamming again man what's with the mushroom spam man we had the mushroom spam last time the mushroom span so let's go yeah rgb okay we can put some okay i'll make the look i'll make that a video okay i will you guys want it you guys want it we'll make a desk mount um on a budget that's what we'll do so we've got another question from the gandalf do you think btc will get to two hundred thousand dollars that's what they were saying man look i never thought i'd get the fifty thousand dollars so this is what i'm finding right and that's why they're saying like in all the investment news they're like there's a detachment away from typical theory and what's going on right you're seeing things that that otherwise you wouldn't expect to go up in value are going up in value like for instance i never thought apple would be one of the biggest companies in the world but here we are am i do i believe in apple products not really like i don't really i mean i understand why people like apple but i personally i mean i don't invest in apple i don't like apple personally that's just my opinion i like using android and desktop pc is much better but you know things that honestly this is one thing i've started to realize always follow the trends even if you don't believe in them sometimes if you see a trend breaking out if you see a trend breaking out then um don't don't be like ignorant to ignore it we got here from ryland uh moonian from the south african rand 70 rand thank you very much brother we got the south african rand i believe that would be maybe a 20 donation or something thank you that's about if i do my math correctly because one uh one thing i do um fifty dollar donut damn [Music] where'd you guys come in where'd you guys come from all these big donations coming in from corey atkins thank you so much i learned how to hunt parts and familiarize myself with platforms and chipsets as well as troubleshooting issues through your channel working with the xeons has been great i have made a second income with all your knowledge thanks brian you guys are so welcome and that's why i love reading the story because i noticed that like a lot of channels are going through difficult times other youtube channels man they're doing it tough but i think because we've made a community here and i don't mind sharing all these secrets man i come into a new secret and be like hey guys here's a new tip we're going to be covering that dell t uh t 3500 very soon we'll do a dedicated video on that and how to set that up because at the end of the day as long as i've got like you know as long as i've got my health this is the thing right as long as i got my health as long as i'm happy and as long as i've got a good income which i'm going to be honest i got a decent income especially when you guys are donating 50 bucks um as long as i've got a decent income it's uh i'm happy man i'm happy to share all this stuff and that's why i think i think there should be i think there's sometime in the in the world sometimes you have to ask is there a limit on greed and i've seen what i've seen firsthand what greed can do to people too it can change them so never let greed change you but always be humble that's what i think take your city man this is the humble city you guys are going to get all the secrets you guys are going to share i'm going to share the secret sauce that's what we're always always going to do we're always going to find the new meta it's always going to share the secret sauce uh we got here i missed the ten dollar nefarious tech uh technology thanks for the ten dollar donation uh linus has a video with uh sick leanne lee joule pc desk we'd love to see how that thing could hold up a minor and a lull as with everything temperature and undersized power supply is a big issue supply limited btc yeah i mean look the thing the thing i worry about with bitcoin um and linus is at the dual desk pc i mean that stuff costs a lot of money i think it's out of reach for a lot of us people who are like do i want to pay for a desk pc that's going to cost so much money and um so the donations are going huge where'd you guys all come from man i'm looking at these donations and they're just like going through the roof thanks so much this is crazy i just got to get through all the donation questions uh so supply limited btc let's talk about that quickly because this is the thing right you look at an asset any asset can be potentially like especially if it's not an essential asset any asset can potentially become out of demand so yes the supply is limited but again the demand is the most important factor right now the demand for bitcoin is is clearly there but that could change in the future there could be a i guess and like you look at the universe for example keeps expanding there's new stars born and all that stuff but then they predict that there'll be a phase where it's called the deep freeze that could happen with bitcoin so be careful maybe the deep freeze could be around the corner so you just don't know because at the moment the reason why bitcoin's so popular and so expensive is because there's all the demand coming from people converting their alt coins into bitcoin if bitcoin does get um circumvented in terms of a lot of uh exchanges and stuff you could see the demand of the alt coins with more merit go up as opposed to bitcoin so that ones do tread lightly i mean would i pay 50 grand for a bitcoin no i mean look for 50 grand i mean you can almost get yourself like a townhouse a place to live for 50 grand that's insane i think in some states in some places in the us you could buy a place to live with 50 grand or you could have a bitcoin so i mean look that bitcoin good up go up to 200 grand too who knows uh so we've got ryan uh million thanks for the zar the 140 uh zar donation thank you so much i have an aorus master 3070 with temps that are around 45 to 50 degrees idle which seems normal but the back plate seems to always be a bit too hot to touch is this normal yes that will be normal back plates do get very hot they do get very hot back plates so if your if your back plate is is getting extremely hot don't worry about it as long as you're monitoring your gpu temperatures monitor your vram temperatures as well that's another important one uh but if your backplate's getting hot it's nothing to worry about if you super worried about you can always put a fan on it but back plates do get hot nothing to worry about uh we got here next up from all skin officials canadian five dollars thank you for the looney they call that though i think it's called the looney the nickname thank you for five loonies hopefully it makes me a bit more loony okay what about the ryzen ap used to replace gpus for now i'm using 3200 g and 2200g ryzen to build basic gaming pieces at this time watching you from cuba canada um the apu's we talked about this the ryzen apus aren't going too far because they're limited by the ddr4 and even ddr5 is going to be a limitation in a bottleneck on apus that's why you haven't seen rd and a2 and apus yet because they need the higher speed memory so apu's aren't going to be getting that much better for a long time so that's just my opinion on that and of course when you look at expensive memory who's going to go out and buy an inexpensive apu and couple it with expensive memory you'd rather just buy a dedicated gpu and couple with cheaper memory on the cpu side i've got from orgborg five dollars thanks for the stream thank you guys for tuning in thank you guys for tuning in um we had here more sorry the questions are they're piling up uh canadian five dollars another five looney what's with the mushrooms yeah i don't know i got no idea what's with the mushrooms either uh but thanks for the donation we got here sky jinx five dollars buy a pre-built remove replace gpu and sell pc i've been hearing this is a thing i've been hearing a lot of people doing this lately a lot of people have been buying uh pre-built pcs taking the gpus out of them and then selling the rest of the system minus the gpu costs hey whatever floats your boat you a man's got to do what a man's got to do regardless of the economic times and as long as you're not breaking the law which you ain't then that's fine i'm absolutely that's a smart idea i know i have heard of a few people doing that so then we got the last two dollar donation from ian o'connor do-it-yourself perks did a in-desk pc yeah okay i'll have to check that out i'm looking for the bang job like when we do a desk pc thanks for the rush of donations too i had to get through them all brian you sound sick i'm not sick guys i'm actually feeling great okay sorry but we'll talk about the desk pc the desk pc's um the desk pc right this is the thing i want to make one that takes no time so we're going to get a desk slap the thing on it bang job complete bang job and then we got ourselves an und a desk gaming pc and i think uh i couldn't read the person's name i think it's russian but they suggested we just do a budget destiny pc with the server rack and i agree it's actually perfect so um there we go we'll get back to sorry if i missed your questions before guys lots of chat rolling in um what's with the uh p inspired music i don't know i've just got some background music going on it's just it's called lo-fi it's called lo-fi guys uh i guess that's what that's what people are doing with live streams you're putting on a bit of low fly music and then you're chatting we're just relaxing this is a relaxed stream even though i'm getting a bit tense with all this cryptocurrency stuff it's meant to be a relaxed stream here today meant to be a relaxed stream and that's one thing always make sure you're trying to minimize your stress and like i mean look oh we got elder part he's on the discord awesome guy he donates two bucks he says i have nothing to say just wanted to say hi elderpar you're a legend dude you're a legend so and now we got a question here groovy brain how is this mic versus an xlr honestly we'll talk about microphones a little bit the thing with microphones is i've stopped caring so much i used to care about what mic you use and i i see a lot of live streams where they've got the whole microphone set up and they've got the fancy pop filter and they're like yo hat backwards like they got this uh professional podcast going on but i've realized with audio as long as your viewers can hear you properly um then it doesn't matter like as long as you've got good audio then who cares and that's what i've noticed with the wave 3. this thing is reliable that's one thing i'm starting to look past so xlr mic sure it's going to sound a lot better but we're live streaming on youtube people just want to hear clear good audio and i think as long as your mic delivers that i think you've got nothing to worry about now the scary thing with mics is is that there's so many different types of mics in their frequency response curves because all the mic is it's a speaker in reverse right so just like speakers will have their own certain attributes will have and that's why you've got reference speakers right in the world of audio you've got reference speakers which are meant to be flat mics have their own sound profile so if you get deep into it enough you can start trialing out all these mics and seeing which one sounds better for your particular voice that's how crazy it can get but for me i'm just like okay can my audience hear me and honestly i think this mic looks really good plus the other features of the auto attenuation and it's also got volume control on the fly mute all that good stuff so there it is there's with mics but yeah the xlr mic should technically sound better but it's much more hassle much more hassle this one just plugs straight into your computer with a usb done and i think that's what a lot of people like me personally i'm starting to get past all that you know i used to have the fancy microphone but then my stream would not work properly so now the stream's working properly jared lee thanks for the five bucks i too have nothing important to say you guys start you guys rolling you guys donating me that crypto money you're like brian man i just sold an ethereum for sixteen hundred dollars here's a fiver bro thanks dude thanks if you just sold your bitcoin for forty five thousand dollars or whatever you're balling that's uh you can donate tech yes cities you can donate take your city in the jar jar mugs and that's some money so that's a we got here bro bro boy hey brian what do you really think for someone like me to pursue a career in pc flipping depends on the market right this is a good one the pc market where i'm at locally it's getting tight man i notice a lot of people are getting very competitive where i am locally it's getting very tight when the market's tight it's hard to get into it last year the market was just flowing it was so easy to flip pcs last year and depends on where you are in the world i'm hearing reports from guys in the us guys in the us are having a great time flipping pc still so it depends where you are depends if the market's hot but just understand that the market is going to go through phases especially something like the gaming pc market so um and that's a that's how you do it so we got here from sky jinx uh aussie two dollar donation thank you what's the crosstalk audio app you use uh so when we're doing motherboard reviews right crosstalk we'll quickly do an explanation for you guys that don't know what crosstalk is that's the amount of audio that leaks from the right channel to the left channel so the higher this is the worse the sound's gonna it's gonna sound almost like mono if you go up to you know near -10 level uh decibels so you want this as low as possible when you've got crosstalk right left and right get pure left and right channels now what i used to measure the audio what i use to measure the crosstalk is a program called um i haven't used it for a little while now rew it's called rew so you can go download that it's called brew now it's got a monitor there for your crosstalk right you've got to monitor there for your left and right channels and what you do with that is you then pull up a left and right speaker test so you get a pure left and right speaker chest that's only going to pump audio into the left channel only going to pump audio into the right channel then you can monitor crosstalk from that and all these are all these methods man i don't know like i just like that's what i do with tech city right people ask how did you learn all this stuff just trial and error baby and there's a thing i remember my teachers telling me at school they were telling me like they were like so certain i was like brian you can never do the trial and error is just a bad way of doing things and i'm scratching my head i remember when i was in high school i was like it's working trial and error is clearly working and like my whole channel is basically trial and error built up on trial and error you know fail on a few live streams eventually you're gonna get it right you get the formula right so i absolutely love trial and error i mean of course there's some situations where you you can't do trial and error when it comes to building a house right you can't exactly go oh yeah it looks kind of level and then the whole house falls over you're going to be up for astronomical amount of costs but there are a lot of things in life that you can do with trial and error and it can work very well i mean playing around with computer parts what's the worst that's going to happen you might especially with used parts you might lose a two dollar stick of memory so we got a 10 donation from the witch master is that from uh heroes of new earth i've got a question for you which of my uh the witch master is that from heroes and us if it is i used to play the witch master uh anyway hey brian uh what do you think about the 3080ti rumors only being 12 gigabytes of vram is that enough for high-end gaming at 4k 120 hertz 3090s are at 24 gigabytes of vram love your content mate thank you so much for the donation let's check it out actually i didn't even check that out the rumors let's go over we can check this out what to mine what to mine if you guys want to make some of that easy money right now just go get some laptop apparently you got to go get some laptops and start mining i wonder if they would i wonder if they would warranty the laptops i wonder if they would warranty laptops on uh the fact that you've been crypto mining 24 7 on them because the one bad thing about laptops is heat uh 12 gigabytes let's have a look here okay ah so this is fresh a fresh leak man that could be true hey that could be true that could be very true could be a 12 gigabyte card i mean just by looking at it like looking at it notebook check actually very good site we got the last article from notebook check these guys are on their game i'm going to give i got to give them credit on a live stream right we'll give them credit on live stream let's give these guys some credit no book check thank you for not having a website that's just spam like absolutely spam with ads everywhere so you can't even read the article this website is good and the information is like the articles are good easy to read thank you for that i gotta just shout out on livestream here for the hassle free experience while trying to look for some news okay the new leak it's now speculated to come with 12 gigabytes of uh gddr6x so pretty simple i think it's the same cuda cores as the 3090 but its memory bus has been dropped from 384 bit to 320 so it should perform very close to a 30 90 but this rumor man i think this is going to carry weight because you don't want people not buying your 3090s nvidia want you to buy a 30 90. what's the like here's the question i gotta raise for you guys what's the point in buying a 3090 if the 3080 ti has the same amount of cuda cores and has very similar amounts of vram no one's going to buy a 3090 anymore nvidia want you to go buy that 1500 gpu so i'm going to say that this 12 gigabytes of vram i'd be saying this looks much more realistic than the 3080 with 20 gigabytes of vram that's just what i'm going to say and i just think was i looked at it in the past with the 3080 ti or whatever they were going to call it it was like it looked like it was too obvious that they released the news like galax released the news and that was a fake i think they faked it out i think they faked it out but to answer that other part of the question is 12 gigabytes gonna be enough for 4k gaming yes i mean a lot of the games are matt like nvidia aren't stupid when they put vram on a particular card they're doing it for most people on most games sure there might be an outlier there or a few outliers that do need more than 12 gigabytes of vram is that a thing is that like a real nitpick for you then go buy the amd car with 16 or go buy the 30 90. so but for me personally i would be happy like i'd be i'm happy with the 30 80 10 gigabyte it's like this might be an unpopular opinion but the 10 gigabytes of vram's been absolutely fine haven't come into any problems except for god4 which was apparently deliberately made to have higher um bit rates on the textures apparently i'm not i don't tell you i'm going to tell you where i heard that from but apparently godfall had a lot more and then we got the next the donation here from matthew amelie uh have you seen that recent intel 4th gen dell optiplex bios update that has made xeon e3 12xx v3s compatible huge rambo thank you for the five dollar nation i haven't checked out that bios update yet but that's really cool that they're actually going back or who did the bias update was it an independent or was it dell themselves that did the bios update because that's actually really cool if they've gone back and now uh patched their older school stuff that's actually like kudos to dell if they did that themselves and what i i don't know what's with the shrooms guys like magic mushrooms you guys are just spam and mushrooms i can't like if you want to chat i can't chat with mushrooms i mean what do i what okay guys the mushroom it goes in the pc the mushroom and then the mushroom will give you some terrible fps that is the mushroom you get the mushroom i don't know what's up with the shrimps yeah i don't know maybe they're living back in the um the eminem song back in like 2000s he's been to magic mountain or something but nothing compares to these blue and purple yellow i don't know i forget forgot the song cool calm just like my mom with a couple of and then they censored that bit inside her palm i can't believe they censored all those old school songs uh hey brian aussie here finding gpus for a reasonable price is so hard would you recommend used gpus if so how can i know how long it will last before it's ended life yeah that's a good question from me me number number number the i was going to make a dedicated video on this because it is important to know that some people buying used pc uh use gpus are going to get hosed those gpus won't have that long life left in them especially if they've been hardcore mined for years on a crypto bench so that's one thing about um yeah the the shrooms the shroom spammers it's all right guys we'll still ca we'll still get some questions besides all the shrooms getting spammed we'll still get some questions in there i just don't live stream i don't have like i can't really go like this stream will go crazy if i start deleting everyone on mushrooms um but apparently chat helps like the more you post mushrooms the more my chat gets promoted anyway so thank you guys indirectly but yeah back to the question so the used gpus it's a tough situation right it's a tough situation where you've got to be careful on what you're buying so i will be doing a used gpu buyer's guide very soon for you guys it'll come this month so wait for that if you if you very um nervous about purchasing one i'll have that guy coming out and you'll be able to make a good decision on that so i hope that helps and we got here from adam w he's got a five dollar donor thank you brother i have a 1080 ti and i use up to 10 gigabytes of 4k are the eight gigabyte cards enough at 4k on the new cards doesn't add up to me it doesn't add up for me so the 10 gigabyte was good for 4k like the the 3080 was made for 4k i think the gta like the rtx 3070 was more made for 1440p so the 8 gigabytes is kind of getting there but the 10 gigabytes was definitely made with 4k gaming in mind so 12 gigabytes i think it's going to be nice it's going to be a good level uh 10 gigabytes may not make the cut on some games but even then you could probably just lower some of the settings and still get really good fps at 4k so i'm like and if you go back through the history of my channel the only reason i've cared about vram is more for sales than personal usage vram hasn't really been a huge factor for me personally and you can go back through any and my tune hasn't changed because i use a lot of hardware i play a lot of games i'm not a uh if you're a heavy model then definitely you're gonna want to invest in more vram because a lot of guys who mod their games need more vram so it depends on how you like to play pc games and that's a beautiful world of pc gaming beautiful thing about pc gaming is you can do so much different stuff so now the people are spamming all the mushrooms but they're getting held now guys it's too many mushrooms you're getting help from spam so there's no point um but yeah so uh vram is one of those things where it's up to you personally if you want if you want to do it or not like do you need more vram yes or no and judging by how many people play games on steam judging by how many people play games on steam uh i'd say the the ballpark falls in where the vram numbers currently are so can you play fortnite at 4k with 8 gigabytes of vram definitely so you don't need any more now we got a donation here thank you nefarious technologies and in between all those mushrooms spamming and stuff i i couldn't really read any questions like it's it's it's just weird at least you guys get a good experience it blocks out all the big spamming so we've got to hear the question i argue a miner's card is in better shape after three years miners tend to underclock and alter under vault a card and maintain their cards gamers push them hard and that's another thing very good point from nefarious very good point and uh depends on the miner you're buying them off most miners nowadays especially nowadays are going to be very switched on to under vaulting and underclocking when um when people were initially gpu mining they were just going weekend warrior slapping those things on at a bench on a mining rig and then just locking letting them go out of the box nowadays a lot of crypto miners do optimize their cards they do push the fans higher they do um undervolt the card and then raise the memory speeds a little bit one thing you do have to be careful of though is the memory speeds of course i have seen cards that have degraded on their memory to the point where you can't use them for gaming anymore so we will talk about that in the video but that's a very good point is that some of these mining cards check them out one thing you got to do is just look like grab the card sideways look for the capacitors that's the biggest telltale sign if the caps are bulging on some of those cards then yeah and also look at the rust another thing as well look at how much rust is on the cooler because some of these coolers will have all this rust on them and you're like what's going on here with this rust and you're like okay should i buy this gpu or not and i'd say like if it's heavy rust definitely stay away from it so there's a lot of things that i've i've seen with the used gpus and i'll share them all with you guys but we got here from orion app jippy sorry if i pronounced that wrong dude uh i was wondering if you had heard about zen one cpus killing ram sticks i've won i've one kill two sets of ram so far it's forcing me to upgrade finally ah let's let's google this okay what what is going on with chat now people are just spamming potatoes uh is that a potato like yeah it looks i mean potatoes are good i like potatoes kind of mushrooms is like you know mushrooms i'm not really vegan i mean potatoes are like vegan but like potatoes you know i eat them like almost every day so mushrooms i don't i eat them maybe once every couple of weeks so potatoes are good i don't eat clowns unfortunately i can't find anything i mean i've never heard of ram sticks dying from cpus like cpu's killing ram sticks is a weird one dude you might have a problem with your power supply or the mother like i'd say the power supply most likely so if something's getting killed off it's probably the power supply be very careful with that or the motherboard itself has gone crazy and it's over vaulting the ram way too much so be careful with that usually it falls in a part dying on a pc especially if it's like a ram stick it usually has to do with over vaulting and then it reaches a point where it just snaps off like internally something goes and then it's not coming back again so that's uh that that's what's wrong with that so we got here from joshua young 4.99 donation thank you so much if you had 700 usd would you keep waiting for stock of a 30 70 6800 or buy a scalper 360 ti or buy overpriced use thanks sir oh that's a good question because you you're in the us aren't you you're in you're in america man that's a tough one that is a tough one what do you do i would honestly see if you can pre-order a 360 ti at a lower cost if you want a game right now if the scalping isn't too bad like if you can maybe get a 360 ti for 450 us instead of 400 they're promised at 400 but if you're not paying too much extra for it it's not bad but oh man that's a question like it just sucks right i wouldn't recommend going out and paying the overpriced money because you just you're feeding someone money in a system that is is um is essentially corrupt like ugh i don't want to feed like i don't want to support that and that's why i've been sort of like i'm like look in the meantime grab yourself a 1063 gigabyte for cheap and just wait it out at a 1080p monitor just wait it out man don't give in to the scalp you you give in to the scalpers and you buy that 360 ti for 700 bucks you're just basically saying that this is okay so this is one thing about life as well you you see overpriced assets just hold off and they'll eventually come back down again so um yeah like ban the bots so hopefully i think par is a moderator hopefully we get a mod in here to start banning all this stuff so yeah just like i don't know what's up with like sniper i'm just going to put sniper in a timeout because sniper's one of the guys who's like i continually see that like i'll put them in timeouts there you go you guys are getting a timeout so with your peaches and mushrooms i don't know what why why the techies city stream why are you guys targeting the tag yes cd stream um i'm going thanks for the two dollars too i'm working on getting rid of the bots so we can have a discussion i ten dollars from orion applegate i thought the ram dying was also a power supply problem or a mobile problem so i replaced both these with new ram and it still died in under ha a year and a half which ram okay so i'm going to ask you directly which ram was that because i have seen ram sticks die as well ddr4 ram sticks will be good one day and then the next day they degrade and i have seen this with first gen ryzen i had some crucial 3 200 megahertz memory was running at 3 200 megahertz xmp for about a month and then it wouldn't work at 3200 megahertz xmp anymore so try reset your bios run it at 2133 but sometimes you can have degradation on the memory that makes it out of the factory but it's so tight like it's so finicky that it just doesn't work anymore especially with the first gen ryzen so be very careful with that uh time travel aussie dollars two dollar donation thank you so much for the donation but let's get back to some normal um i'm just putting people in timeouts who are just spamming like come on guys we want to have a discussion here in the chat so let's get back to let's get back to questions because yeah you guys talk with each other in chat too i love that it's like a place where people can chat hang out uh spamming mushrooms and peaches and and clown faces isn't that stuff for twitch like i go and check someone's twitch stream out sometimes and i just see like the chat is just constantly getting spammed and it's like i at least like to answer some questions uh when are you starting online tim's serious when are you starting only fans bro oh man so we got spam and now we got i'm not like i'm not kind of into that man like i uh i mean if you want to see the yes man do that kind of thing maybe when i retire so maybe when i retire okay from youtube like doing tech that might be my next gig all right but i'm not doing it while i'm doing tech because we want to keep things civil and besides i have um believe it or not i have spoke to people in that industry and you've got to be made for that industry honestly you've got to be made for that industry and i mean like there's things that i've heard with stories about those people that do that stuff it's just like yikes you know what i mean uh anyway jared lee five bucks can we get a slow-mo or get some of the discord as mods in here yeah thanks for the five dollar nation i'm taking care of it anyway so we've got it we've got it all it's all returning back to normal anyone's who's um yeah no slow mode like i don't know slow mode it's pretty cool it's it's civil now so we've got two corey atkins r9 290 and 290x uh lots of ebay deals in the us 100 bucks there you go that's a nice card that'll tide you over um just make sure that that r9 290x comes with kind of some warranty even if it's the standard ebay warranty because you do not want to be getting hosed on the gpu so um that one's not bad that one's not bad is the yes man getting sick so many people say i'm getting sick i'm not guys i am not getting sick i am not getting sick don't worry i don't know i think if we're on live chat i just i don't know why i like i feel great that's the second time someone said i look do i do am i honestly do i sound sick damn maybe you mean do i sound sick as in like do i sound sick as in like um like fully sick like this is this guy sounds mad like awesome if that's the kind of sick let us know too it's the mic uh bass frequency okay your voice sounds strange i mean yeah i mean i've been talking me and dadman have been chatting quite a bit this morning so maybe my voice has just worn out a little bit um jack valadez uh thanks for the five dollars just want to support keep up the awesome content thank you so much for the donation sounds a little hoarse losing your voice yeah maybe losing my voice i don't think it's sick i'm just um i'm losing my voice a little bit that's all it is so uh she's i've been talking to dab man uh quite a bit this morning we've just been chatting we chat away sometimes we have like a um a mid uh lunch beer especially on a sunday because it's sunday right so we have a sunday beer and we just chat so that's what we've kind of been doing today now he's off doing his own thing so um yeah we'll get back to some questions now so uh joker mate i bought the 10 400 yeah it's a good deal right now yeah like um 10 400 f we've been talking about this in the last live stream we talked about the intel cpus uh coming down in price to the point where it feels like intel we actually made a dedicated video on two intel is like literally what amd was and now amd's like the new intel right they got the performance crown then intel's got the price performance crown so don't forget to drink water don't worry guys i'm drinking i'm drinking tea with jar jar it might be also the cinnamon i got cinnamon and honey mixed in with this earl grey tea like i'm going a little bit fancy here [Music] i'm a big tea drinker you're either a tea or a coffee drinker you can be both but you kind of you're usually one of the other heavy tea drinker here okay so what's the stuff you spray on dead gpus to bring them back mainly multi-purpose spray aka wd-40 the stuff i use is very cheap i get it down the discount store for three dollars for a massive can and that stuff is just like generic spray it on a lot of stuff it cleans off dirt debris any filings if you've got metal filings on pc parts it can stop parts from working and also if you've got thermal paste that's in weird spots and it's capacitive can stop parts working so that's the idea behind cleaning the parts as well as as well as uh making the card look like it's brandy new again and preventing it from rust there's a few reasons but it's multi-purpose spray so that's uh we've done we've done a whole video on that too with the tech yes uh cleaning method as well so oh tea el grey hot yeah you guys are tea drinkers tea drinkers or a beer drinker yeah i mean you can't really dr uh drink beer all day around if you if you're drinking beer like for breakfast lunch and dinner i'm pretty sure your liver is going to clunk out on you because you do um you know processing all that alcohol you kind of need a break uh but anyway uh tim three time travel five dollar donation aussie five dollars thank you so much uh should i get a ryzen 5 2600 or an i5 9400f i'm planning to upgrade and not sure what i uh what to get i want the best price performance what do you suggest ryzen 5 2600 you got the six core 12 threads um a lot of the 12 threads is becoming very relevant in 2021. the 9400f is just six core six threads so if you had the choice between both of them in the same price i would go for the um 2600 in that in that sense but keep in mind i like the 3500 x more than the 9400 f and also the 2600 but that's gone up in price so it all depends on the price 3500 x gives you that gaming now but if you want to upgrade then you've got the upgrade chance on b450 ryzen look ryzen's upgrade path is amazing i do like what amd's done there uh we got voodoo child five dollar donation thank man it's been a long time how you been i haven't seen your name in chat for a long time my question is about that spray wd-40 has a distinct mechanical smell especially after it's heated does that stuff have the same smell uh yeah multi-purpose spray doesn't have the wd-40 distinct smell but it does have a different smell so a lot of people hate the smell that is one downside uh me personally i actually kind of like i like the smell like not like i don't like sniffing it like all the time it's not like you know i don't like sniffing that stuff all the time but i do enjoy the smell of uh like it's not bad doesn't bother me but yeah if that that one that can hold you back definitely definitely can hold you back hudson jackson 2 the second 10 donation thank you so much oh wait i lost that one uh what would be the good stop gap gpu that's better than a 1050 ti here in the states i would like to pair it with the 2600 by the way nightbot could help with mod duties sometimes ah from discord yes it could definitely help we'll get nightbot on but um a good gpu better than 1080pi is the rx470rx 570 and they should be cheap the four gig models the four gig models should be good the 1063 gig model should be good too and they're cheap so they'll be good with the 2600 as well um gtx 980 as well don't uh underestimate a 982 984 gig is pretty like i'm seeing them come up at pretty good prices lately too uh we got here the lg cx-55 oled over at costco for 13.49 and has seven years warranty is it worth it yeah that's just my opinion you're asking me like look i've i've said like i'll admit when i'm biased for things i haven't been biased for much like tech in the past but oled i'm very biased towards so you asked me a question about oled it's like brian should i mortgage my house and go get like 10 oled tvs yeah yeah go do it i love oled oled's absolutely i'm using oled right now i'm doing the whole stream i edit videos on oled i play games on oled i'm all oled now i've converted to oled and i'm not going back but we got here brad winter 499 donation uh cheers from utah usa uh subbed for over a year now as a used new system builder and love the content what's your thoughts on new eggs new shuffle system you guys are i have to go let's check that out what is the new egg shuffle system because i don't really use new egg that much new egg shuffle system what what is the newegg shuffle system okay oh i get it straight away the new egg shuffle program this is um thanks for the donation to it this is new egg shuffle program right so what they're saying is you get in with a draw like if you want a 30 60 ti at msrp or around msrp you don't want to get scalped you can go into a draw honestly this is the only logical way to do things right now it's like you know when you have a dispute when you're a kid you know your parents tell you hey just rock scissor paper it out it's fair game man it you leave it down to chance right and that's the only fair way to do things when there's too much demand and you want to keep a price ceiling on things as to not rip people off and keep up good um good customer relations this looks really good so yeah newegg good kudos man kudos good stuff the new egg shuffle then they can even start up one of those videos where they're doing the shuffle while they're dancing with one gpu and they got 10 people around them doing matrix maneuvers and they've probably got a jar jar mug if they had the gpu in one hand and the jar jar mug in the other hand and they started shuffling around that'd be really good too what background music was that uh i'll just quickly show you guys here it is here there it is there you guys want to know what what bgm is it it's a chill lo-fi hip-hop beats free that's why i like free right i got to use copyright free stuff so there's there's that um get back to chat now i've got to be careful when i do that because it kind of messes up the whole stream so that's uh that's that's how we do things around tech yes city we got the whole low fire beats going on okay back to chat let's uh let's start right so how long uh 3000 series gpus is going to be here is it future proof 360 ti people still use 30 10 30 gpus these days man if you're using a 10 30 like there's so many better options out there than a 1030 gta gt not even a gtx gt 1030 is just like man i've tried to play games on it and i can't like i'd rather a 750 ti any day of the week uh 1030 is a real weak card especially if you've got have you guys ever tried the the ddr4 version of that it is so bad it's not funny it's so bad the gt 1030. so i'd answer that question um okay so how long until they're going to be uh be here man they're meant to be coming into stock this month but i think because of the crypto demand and the surge in crypto mining again the february estimate is now like it's gotten worse guys easy because crypto miners like as soon as they come up in msrp these crypto mining folks they're just buying them up crypto miners are just like yo i want a gpu and i want to start making money off that gpu so they're just buying up all the gpus and we can't get our hands on one so that's it that's it that's what i was saying like that's why i was disappointed with intel like people saying like the intel intel market share like i'll disappointed with intel that they didn't deliver on the dg1 all it had to be was like a gtx 1050 and it would have been pretty good that's all it had to be they did that then again crypto miners might have bought it up but now if it stayed at 4 gigabytes of vram it would have been a solid card so i think right now we need amd or nvidia to start producing four gigabyte cards for the masses on the low end the crypto miners aren't going to keep snapping up so that's it that's what we need right now we need it gamers we need it i was going to go crazy right then earth is fire right now yeah even if you just yeah that's what i mean profitability is through the roof and i can't blame the crypto miners even if you've got a gaming pc especially if you're not paying for the power where you are just start mining you probably make like if you've got like a 30 60 ti in your rig you could probably make like ten dollars a day or six dollars a day or something just leaving that thing on so you like go out with your friends six dollars of your partying is paid for by someone buying an overpriced ethereum coin there you go so this is this is the stupid thing about mining it's like it's too profitable yeah blame them and i'm blame that's it drinking milk that's it i'm blaming the money printers that's exactly right that's exactly right so when they just keep printing money they keep like they need to do something better than just handing money out like sure hand out money to people that need it but why are they handing out all these cheap loans to all these institutions that are then just dropping it into assets so what you've got right now is i'll show you guys this is what you this is what the world's suffering from right now we'll go over the it's suffering from this here you go here you go right here this is what you want to know the world stagflation there we go this is what's happening 2021. you got pretty bad economic conditions you got certain economic classes not doing well but then you've got all these asset prices going up stagflation there we go that's what's going on right now because their solutions are like hey print the money stonks print the money get them stocks get them crypto currencies so you just get like stagflation man this is the first time i think we're gonna actually see it properly in first world countries because that's what's going on um look at this guy there's no use crying about it yeah hey i should stop crying about it just profit from it bingo this guy gets it money doesn't one thing about money is it doesn't care about feelings that's for sure money does not care about uh about feelings man yeah so that's in chat yeah i majored in i majored in marketing and finance i did economics um macro economics as well as the there was another one that was insane some of the subjects i took at uni is funny because a lot of that stuff like i look at the theories and i'm like man a lot of that stuff's still relevant a lot of stuff that i learned 20 years ago at uni 15 years ago a lot of it's still relevant um uh why your text streams converts into stonks ah because people like it's all related actually it's all related stonks at the moment stonks aetherium and uh gpus it's all tied in together it believe it or not it's all tied in together so stonks crypto mining and that's what i mean we've um so i how old am i now i'm 35 years old i'm in my mid-30s mid-tier i'm a mid-tier gpu so if you were to compare me to a graphics card i'd be like i'd like to think of myself as like a 30 60 ti right now you know i'm still efficient i'm still uh i still got the power but i'm not like i'm not pushing an rtx 3090 levels so i'm running a 3060 ti efficiency and uh brandon he says he's a 30 90. he's a 30 90. um did you chaos theory i love chaos ah man what was chaos theory again check out what chaos theory was i that actually is a yeah chaos theory man i remember we did a piece on this but i never really paid much attention to it um there's so many good theories out there that i like i love i have to research that one again i have to research chaos theory again but i'm not too familiar with it um so we got a man he's 37 he feels like a 2080 ti i'm 27 i feel like a 30 70. that's it that's it relate your graphics card like what do you relate to in chat relate yourself with your age and what you relate to as a graphics card do we have anyone out there that relates to a gt 1010 is someone like look brian i'm i've only managed to i've only managed in life to just get to a gt 1010 level is there any gt 1010s out there you're still new the good thing is you're still new so you look at the perks of a gt 1010 you're small you can weasel your way through now feeling like a gt240 damn okay [Laughter] what graphics card do you relate to i'm an 8800 gts and a 3090 body oh damn i'm actually going to put that on my twitter profile now you guys can start calling me a 3060 ti don't call me he or him anymore just call me a 3060 ti yeah this 3060 ti at that 360ti did an amazing job today out there uh building building building that pc oh man eventually it's just funny live streams i think all conversations eventually they just go down to some weird denominator and you know what i absolutely love it ah man so yeah chats chat's always awesome uh we'd like to keep it you know join the discord too join our discord we've also got really cool down to earth peeps there that's one thing about my uh my channel and my is we're always going to keep it real for you guys you know if you want to go bang your chest and be a big hero just head over to some other channel man go in there chat go bang your chest and be a big hero but all the boys on tech yes city man we're all good we're all chill everyone respects everyone's opinions and that's all you know um there's one saying that i always live by man you're better than no man lesser than none and never forget that that's one thing that i always follow so it means like when you when you know whenever you do something don't think you're better than everyone and whenever you whenever you do something too don't think you're lesser than someone so just uh that if you live by that motto man you can have a good life you know so that's uh that's the motto we got man feeling the vibes in the chat we're feeling the love feeling the love right [Music] here anyway anyway we've been going we've been on for a while now this stream's been going for heaps i'm actually getting a little bit hungry so i got to start cooking dinner soon so um i'll put uh also the discord link i'll start uh i'll put that in the chat for you guys i'll pin the comment for discord link as well as the timetable but we'll start winding this one down i think we've exhausted all the hot topics all the news you guys have asked everything you've needed to ask which is good um okay so uh the ab admins productions on my site we'll answer a few more questions then we'll get out of here on my side of the world shops force you to buy an ampere gpu with a complete build you can't buy them alone isn't it some kind of yeah that's what's been going on in a lot of parts of the world right because they want to sell all the other hardware they want to make they want to make profit and they're using the rtx cards they know the appeal of the new rtx 3000 series cards they're using that appeal to sell the pcs and i don't know like see that's where nvidia and also the distributors have to come in and say you can't do that but the thing is a lot of the distributors are down with that because they're able to sell their motherboards their ssds they're able to sell everything in fact i'd say it's more on the distributors than the retailers because the distributors i've heard some distributors are forcing you to buy 10 motherboards for one rtx 3000 series card there's so much crap going on that like i don't think nvidia would have predicted it would have been this bad right they would have heard a case here and there but there's so many um people price gouging now it's just like it's been crazy um so nefarious technology new sub been interesting watching you yeah thanks man thanks for tuning in thank you guys tune in always love it when you tune in um when will the bogan return bro well if you want to see the bogan come back in the parts hunt i'll make sure we do that so with the parts hunt like what i've been doing lately with the used parts hunt is we've been going macro right i've been buying so much stuff i want to kind of scale it back to like more small time one-time snipes and then we'll put the bogan in there to try and get those deals if you guys want to see that happen in the next parts on i can make that happen um the best gpu to buy for around 125 dollars to 160 usd again it's you yeah classical but it's your rx 470 or rx 570 uh even though the price has gone up also check out the gtx 980 especially if it's a good model like i got some of the zeus strixers and they're pretty they're pretty solid man they're solid um i bought one kilogram of gold how did you afford a kilo of gold man that's insane um if you hold that sure man gold's always gold gold's entire tide tied to inflation gold's a good asset to buy if you're scared about um governments and their handling of money that's it's gold's always going to be gold it's got um it's got real world principles so if you think the if you think it's one of the safest investments gold has always been one of the safest investments even dare some people even say above that of bonds so for instance if you're in a columbia let's just give an example if you're in colombia and you invested in gold that's a gold investment right because if if you invested in colombian bonds then i think the colombian government's gone broke at one stage so there it is it's one of the safest investments that's all that's all i'm going to say cheers from colombia exactly see geek if you're in colombia you might want to invest in gold and so that's why gold's always going to be there because it's an asset that people can buy and own physically and they know it's always going to retain its value it's a rare metal also platinum right now apparently the prices with platinum and gold are de-synced so you might want to check out owning some platinum platinum might come into a play is cinex doing that dodgy selling of gpus brian i see i can't name on live stream i cannot say that because like i don't want no one slapping a a suit on my desk you know what i mean so i can i can only i can only say okay there's alleged companies that have been doing this allegedly and um is cinex doing it you know that's a that's uh up for your interpretation but see i i need hard evidence to be out and say look here's what's going on here but i have heard from the grapevine that the distributors are doing some dodgy stuff so i own physical gold there you go so you guys are there we started the gold cartel the gold we're talking about gold all the time um so diamonds why do they cost so much uh diamonds are the rarest aren't they the hardest material on earth like the hardest atom diamonds or whatever they're made of the hardest atoms on earth so they if you've got diamonds the real applications for diamonds are like diamond bladed saws right diamonds actually do have some industrial applications and the reason it's such a tough tough material so diamond's always going to be a demand plus it's the rarity if you catch a diamond that's big and thing and you know it's going to be amazing anyway we're going we're going way off tech now we're talking about we're talking about diamonds gold and rare earth metals um uh and yeah silver silver's got speculation running into it basically guys careful with your investments right i'm going to say before we close out the stream i will say i'm seeing a lot of talk about stonks uh cryptocurrency rare medals be careful about investing in these things and i do say this you've heard the age old saying only invest what you can afford to lose but this time around do not buy in because everyone else is buying in that's all i'm going to say trust me when i say things can change so quickly so fast that you don't see it coming just like you didn't see your fear of missing out on getting that asset coming right if you knew that ethereum was going to go up to 2 200 aussie dollars or 1600 u.s would have you bought that in march last year yes you would have right but no one has a crystal ball no one knows what's around the corner so it's all risk and are you going to risk it now after all that influx of money into these particular assets are you going to risk the potential losses because it can go down just as quickly as it went up so my my advice would be very careful with your investments always do your own research and i always say that for anything you do before you go buy something and it's a serious purchase are you going to lose sleep if you lost all that money tomorrow right i go out i go out and get hosed on a 50 gpu i'm not going to lose sleep on that that that happens a couple of times a year i don't care just some douche bag ripping me off but if it comes to like say for instance i'm buying something for a thousand bucks i'm gonna do a lot of research i look at all the downsides look at all the upsides and then i'm gonna read all the different people's opinions because opinions are gonna be very biased so you're gonna sift through you're gonna get it basically if this is one thing about statistics and the beautiful thing before we close this off beautiful thing about statistics is aggregate the opinions aggregate opinions so you're going to get heaps of different opinions and then you're going to say okay here's all the people saying these are the positives and they've used the product themselves don't listen to parrots either if you listen to parrots you're gonna lose money um and then look at all the people who've used it and here's the negative comments aggregate that and then you'll be able to see what the benefits and the negatives really are so always use statistics always use averaging out as one uh good tool in your external and that's the same with me i'm just another opinion so in the world see we start going down this path of um tangents and it gets pretty crazy but anyway we'll answer oh man you guys start up the questions again right before i'm ready to right before i'm ready to start making some dinner we're gonna cook a lasagna we're gonna have a lasagna tonight a lasagna i love my lasagna lasagna okay so i'm mining on my 2070 laptop right now oh damn you're keeping me alive keeping me alive here are you 27 crypto mining on a laptop what's this sorcery yeah we were talking about that before oh we're looking at chaos series so this was the story here i'll link this story in the uh description yeah crypto mining or laptop if you missed the stream uh five dollars from one nightmare gamer thanks for the donation brother only way to fix stocks is force people in store only purchase for a few months basically making hots useless and people with tons of free time able to fly to store um yeah i mean the way to fix the stock is to limit it yeah one per person in store is definitely going to um drain big institutions out see the problem with the gpu mining is the big institutions are buying up cards they're buying up a thousand at a time sometimes even more so you limit those institutions buying those cards it's gonna make it very tough for them to keep doing that you know every day if one person had to walk in and buy a car to get a thousand cards that's a thousand days so yeah there needs to be some kind of limits in place and they're doing that some of these places are doing that kudos to that like in australia wow there's one gpu per person i think like if we look at this if we go to this site right here there's a one gpu per person and lasagna if you love lasagna go at it in the comments let me know your love for lasagna look i'll put a love heart in the chat too i was gonna put a love heart for search on the pc parts actually let's quickly do that too if your love for lasagna is there we'll put a love heart in here and see what comes up oh wow that actually did work okay we'll look at we'll look at an rtx 3060 ti and let's see what's in this is in australia prices if you're freaking out of the prices this is aussie dollar prices it's kind of like um normal okay none in stock well that damn that was a stupid example wasn't it do we have a 70 in stock oh here we go we got some 30 70s in stock wow let's have a look here what's the cheapest 37 we can get in australia right now it's in stock it's in stonk okay 1049 aussie dollars damn that's expensive still it's still pretty all right just give you guys an idea of how much that is 805 us dollars at the moment at the moment that's how much it costs to get a 30 70. that's the cheapest in stock limit one per customer there it is right there that's the limit so in australia they're limiting people from hoarding these buying them all up and the galax cards are usually coming in like these cards should be around 850 at best man these cards should be around maybe even 800 aussie dollars that's how much they should be but the retailers know that they're in hot demand they know people are buying them up they know the the money printers are they're just rolling the cash out so this is where you're seeing the demand for all this stuff just go through the roof and the price is essentially going to follow that so here we had a 500 usd card now costing 800 usd in australia now we see some of these other cards here this is like i remember seeing some of these 800 aussie dollars so there you go there that's a limit of one per customer that's that's that so i don't know how to get a 5 damage from one nightmare gamer thanks again dude thanks again i don't know how to get a 6800 because i'm using a 7990 okay and a 290x for vr resolution 58 i need fast cash and i need fast cash as well bro had to pop that joke in there and uh 4.0 vr chat is hard to run at 100 res so you need that 6800 the rx 6800 for your v8 chat um i have seen a few for sale but i mean at these prices one to two days okay there's one here for one to two days and that's kind of like isn't that that's the same as the the 30 that's the same as the 30 70 even worse i think in relative pricing let's have a look a thousand dollars u.s in australia a thousand us is the cheapest you can get an rx 6800 for it this is one of those stores that's been pretty good with prices like umart in australia are pretty good for prices isn't that sad a thousand usd for an rx 6800 weren't they meant to be 580 usd and even then the 6800 xt was like the better pick because it was 70 dollars more oh this is giving me a headache look and the last thing we're going to talk about the last thing before i get on out of here the last thing we're going to talk about is i'm going to put some of the blame on this whole covert situation it's like man until like until people are able to fly internationally and do normal things again then we're forced to buy this stuff because this is our only form of entertainment it's like it's like the checkmate that you didn't want to you know it's like you're seeing that it's like you're already having a bad day and then if you lose this game of chess if you lose this game of chess you know you're gonna like you've made a bet for like say for instance half your mortgage you know if you lose this bet you're going to be down down in the dumps for a long time and then you're just saying that the opponent checkmate you slowly like oh god this checkmate's coming in five moves oh god and you know it's how you can't do anything so you're like prolonging the chess board as much as you can you're like moving the pieces really slowly to try and prolong it and that's what's going on at the moment that is what that's what's happening with these gpus and their prices right now a thousand usd let's pull that up again actually pull that up again in australia a thousand usd for the cheapest rx 6800 we can even check static ice and uh one thanks for another two bucks bro you're feeding me right now i want to show video of how hard it is to run be right back uh you have to show i can't pull that up on stream man it'd be like weird as i don't know how i'd do that but um i might be able to if you've got a youtube link sure we can show the viewers how hard it is to run uh joshua 40 is that korean one thanks for the 40 korean one i think that's korean one if so thanks yeah i'm gonna go back to south korea again i need to go back to south korea i loved it there man that was that was like you know south korea was like the modern day journey of a monk if you guys have ever been to south korea you'll know like you go into south korea feeling a little unhealthy feeling a little tired and run down then you come out of south korea feeling like a new man that's what happened after i went to south korea yeah i miss traveling so much especially doing these parts hunts on the road okay what do we got here the cheapest one we can find is out of stock so the cheapest 6800 in in um is out of stock so that's just bait so in australia they've just got all these like what about pck skew do they have this in stock sold out so you're just getting baited whatever you do you're getting baited on these so even the cheapest price you could have picked you could have picked an rx 6800 up for the cheapest you could have picked one up for was 730 us minus 10 tax sure but it's still well above msrp so like that's the cheapest you could have picked one up for that's in the win that's in the win now so there it is hashtag forbid mining hashtag forbid the money printers hashtag stop printing so much damn money that's what we need a hashtag for that's what we need a hashtag for anyway more fissile responsibility please governments oh we got to get the banks oh we got to get the big banks through this one we're going to get the big banks through this uh financial downer we're going to get all the hedge funds through this one guys oh look at the hedge funds they only made like 100 million this year that's terribly low we're gonna get them up to 300 million profit guys oh they're doing it tough the hedge funds just keep the money printer going anyway i'm gonna go back i'm gonna get start cooking up this lasagna guys thanks so much for tuning in thanks so much for tuning in but there's we're starting like this laptop news closing out this stream this laptop news was kind of like a downer because mining on laptops and like buying up laptops to make profit on you know there's something going wrong with the world when you see this happen like look the crypto mining on gaming graphics cards sure but buying a whole laptop now to mine cryptocurrencies is taking it to another level now it's just getting beyond a joke so like yeah i don't know anyway guys we're gonna leave we're gonna leave this stream on a high note though and i'm not talking about um yeah anyway i'm going to leave this stream on a high note with darth da wait no just jar jar regular jar jar and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon so thanks all thank you all for tuning in i love each and every one of you let's keep the chat a little more civil so i mean at one stage in this chat we're just getting mushrooms and clown faces and stuff i had to give them time out but next time we'll have uh the mods out in full uh force so anyhow you guys let us know in the comments as well make sure on the way out make sure to hit that like button let us uh know on the way out in the comments too what's your thoughts about all this crypto situation mining on laptops love reading your thoughts and opinions and stay tuned for some of the thanks for the content ideas as well stay tuned for some of the content ideas a new video should be up tomorrow as well i'll get a video out tomorrow we're going to make a gtx 980 pc with the ryzen 3 3 100 and we're going to see how that performs so stay tuned for that it's going to be a nice because i think gtx 980 is actually pretty relevant nice card to buy just make sure you get a good one but yeah i'll catch you guys i'm going to love you and leave you oh i'm gonna put a love heart in the chat as well it's been an awesome stream thanks all for the donations as well you guys really appreciate everything you guys do for me and i'm gonna send that love back with all the requests and sorry about my voice as well but i'll
