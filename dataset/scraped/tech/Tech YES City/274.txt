what is crackalackin today we have a very special build because this is going to be the first time i'm doing a used build on the high end and this is because of this right here a 2080 ti i got this card for 800 aussie dollars now the reason this card is actually a pretty good deal at least in australia is because our graphics cards are being sold pretty much on the rtx 3000 a 3080 for example is coming well over that msrp a lot of the times so something like this for 800 aussie dollars actually marks pretty good performance on the high end and of course you can pick it up today it's pretty much in stock then the next deal we've got up here is an x570 motherboard ryzen 7 3800 xt and a d15 noctua cooler now i got this on a deal for 450 dollars because the person changed over to a 10 900 kf and when i asked them why are you doing this there's really no need to go from a 3800 xt to a 10 900 k they told me they just want that little bit extra fps and of course this is what happens if you can find people who are rich and they give away these parts for pretty cheap or at least this case a really good bargain then you can really make some magical fps happen of your own now for a power supply i got this in a deal with three other power supplies for 200 aussie dollars this is an 850 watt but it's also got 768 watts on the 12 volt rail it's actually got quite a few 12 volt rails six in total then for the last components here in the build we've got here 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory and also a nvme one terabyte now i did want to get these new because i didn't have much luck on the used market finding some higher speed ddr4 memory then lastly is the case and you're probably wondering why is there two cases on the desk here and initially i was going to use this avengers knockoff case well it's actually called the dark avenger from antec and i also can think of when i look at this case is rolling some documentary voice and explaining the situation with it the dark avenger occasionally comes out of hiding to find its prey the unsuspecting customer with a quite not so unique power known in nature as knockoff this power is seen in quite a few other species as well namely brand names you've never heard of though the dark avenger has to fear its arch nemesis the real avenger from marvel who could at any time invoke the power of copyright infringement and with it only having two 120 millimeter fans inside it may not be able to handle the heat so to speak so with that aside let's build this thing up and i'll also put the build tally and all the parts and how much they cost on the screen right now for you guys but we'll also talk about whether or not it's a good option to go used right now on the high end of the market [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] bye [Music] so we've already got some bad news coming into this build and that is the power supply that i thought was working actually doesn't work it shorts out when i hook it up to a power supply tester now i've already gone and given this thing a heap of cleaning aka tech yes loving and it still shorts out after i do that so unfortunately the one power supply we got was faulty but we've got here now a thermaltake tough power 775 watt and this is going to do the job absolutely fine it's ironically got the same amount of power on that 12 volt rail as the cooler master power supply did and this one actually works when we hook it up to the power supply tester now i would usually get angry that i got hosed but in this case the guy who dropped around the parts he was pretty he's been genuine so far i've used a heap of other parts that i bought from him and he did say to me if you do come into a problem with any of these computer parts just send me a message and he'll hook me up a refund so we should be getting that fifty dollars back and i mean he has had a good track record up until this point in time so i'm not too worried about that had i met the guy down the gas station for example and that was the only part that i bought then yes i would be quite angry but that's not the case this time around but this power supply works and let's continue this build [Music] so this pc is all set up and running however i am a little bit worried about this exhaust fan the airflow seems a little bit on the weak side and since they were molex connected fans they're only going to run at this one speed so although the noise is good i am actually going to be a little bit worried about the upcoming temperature test so if you guys like having a guess then do place your guesses right now on whether you think this airflow is going to hold up or if it's going to fail with this 2080 ti but we're also in the bios we've just got to set up the xmp profile super important so sometimes ram manufacturers will put in two profiles with the same timings and that's just basically one for intel one for amd where some of the sub timings might actually be a little bit different and that's just to ensure that it works on either platform so i think we'll lock in profile 2 and then we'll be good to go and after running furmark on this system with the side panel on versus off it's unfortunately pretty bad news for this bling bling case right here and the reason being is that with the glass on we got 85 degrees maximum on this 2080 ti in a 26 degree ambient environment then once we took the glass off same fan speeds we got 77 degrees but also on top of that the clock speeds on the gpu were higher with the glass off so that just really is a clean and simple test to know if the airflow is pretty crap and in this case it is pretty crap in this silverstone pharah rgb case and the thing is i would buy a different case because at this price point 109 aussie dollars which is what i paid for it there are options out there for even where i live for 10 aussie dollars cheaper that give better airflow and for instance i'm talking about the gamdius athena which is one of the cases that i recently used in a video here on the channel so this case here from silverstone unfortunately for me personally it doesn't really make the cut where i feel at this budget you'd want something with decent airflow from the get-go and you're just not getting it with these three molex fans that don't have any individual rgb control either so there's two things that aren't really going for this case at this price point and i'm not going to sit here and bash the product but i'm just going to simply not recommend it and i'm not going to buy it again [Music] so we're playing boulder's gate 3 up here at 1080p ultra settings and we're averaging 111 fps which on a 2080 ti for 1080p is not that great but this game is really graphically intensive and we can see here that the cpu is doing a pretty good job it's clocking up to around 4.4 gigahertz and this is on the vulcan engine for this game so they decided to go with vulcan and you're probably wondering what i'm doing here and this is because um boulder's gate is actually still in early access so it's really early in the development stage and they've actually only released the beta to the public in the form of chapter one so what i'm doing is i've played through well i've actually finished chapter one but this is sort of like a side battle that i'm versing a dragon on where it's kind of i think it's bugged out you're not meant to win this battle but i don't know like the the game is very difficult to play like you've got to use a variety of strategies and you have to go through so many different um positioning phases and you probably sometimes you'll be replaying the same battle like five or six times because it's that difficult to win and this was one battle that i was fighting here against level five people and i could only max out to level four in early access and it's really really it's a blast to the past like they've improved on boulder's gate too in so many ways and the combat system is just phenomenal so if you're a dungeons and dragons fan you're absolutely going to love boulder's gate 3 and i can't honestly wait until they finish the next few chapters and at the moment because i mean you've got to pre-order it or pretty much buy it on early access on a steam and that'll give you access to play the game so um this is kind of something cool here that the dragons just like so i mean they're not obviously they don't want to release a finished product when it's not finished so some reason the dragon's just like chilling here and he doesn't have any loot but uh this dude right here is uh he's now freed from the place but i guess he's somewhat something else is going on but regardless the pc is running absolutely fine the fps is really nice and i've been playing this on my 4k oled monitor and the experience is just phenomenal this for me is what video games were like it took this game to really bring me back into pc gaming and just realize what the newer titles a lot of the newer titles have just gone for quick easy to play and there's no difficulty there's no challenging your brain but this game just does it challenges your brain in such a way that there's so many different spells and so many different ways battles can go down and also the character customization you can choose from so different many different characters that you can really just make it a different sort of whole game even if you decide to replay it so i do remember and recall playing boulder's gate 2 over and over a few times just making all these different classes so this is early access and i'm just blown away by it already and i'm really looking forward to when they release the full version with all the classes unlocked and everything so really good job from larry and studios here i'm sorry it's come out and like you used a new build but this game is just it's honestly probably even worth a video on its own but the fps is running absolutely fine and we won this battle which i didn't think i'd win but we got there in the end so right now we're not really playing a call of duty modern warfare we're actually playing what i would call call of duty lucy in the sky zone and it's just i i've never seen this before where it's kind of like it just looks so weird i mean the good thing is at least the fps is absolutely okay we're getting over 200 frames per second here on ultra settings at um 1080p like max settings but these aren't clearly max settings something else is going on where i can i don't even know what is going on here it's just really bizarre i've never seen this the whole time i've been testing out this game so i'm guessing i'd probably have to reinstall uh call of duty on a fresh install because this is just like one of those things that happens with this game but there was also another problem that happened and that is the load screen took so long to initialize on this game i was waiting just for like over a minute just to try and get into this practice battle royale and then it sort of came straight to life and this is what it came to life too is this weird mode right here and after all that testing we now have the used and new parts coming together to make some really good fps as we saw in those two games that we just tested it was very smooth fps but if there was two things in hindsight that i would change with this build it would definitely be the case where we talked about getting something with better airflow for even ten dollars cheaper here in australia i definitely do that and then for the graphics card it's not that the dual oc that we used here today is bad and in fact it's a really good price for what we're getting but it's just that it is a flagship graphics card or it was last year's or last generation's flagship gpu and i do like graphics cards of this caliber to be running a little bit cooler where in this case literally it was getting to about 80 degrees on the default fan profiles where as opposed to us testing at apples to apples with 100 fan speeds it was still getting up to around 77 degrees so this model in particular it is a little bit lackluster for a 2080 ti i would like to see me personally i've used other gpus even the sg card that i got in my main rig they like to sit in the 70 degree region which i'm very comfortable with at 25 degrees c ambient this one just creeping into that 80 degree level is a little bit uncomfortable especially if you want to game on this thing 24 hours a day not 24 hours a day but if you're gaming or you're doing hardcore gaming on this thing having it at 80 degrees for all its life isn't that good considering it's actually a big outlay of money to be spending on a graphics card in the first place so those two things the case and the gpu besides those two things i love everything else about this build it's giving out really smooth fps it's quiet and it does the job even the power supply that one is passing the power supply tester absolutely fine i had no hiccups whatsoever besides that infinite loading screen in call of duty which apparently is a well and wide known problem on the internet but other than that mixing new nu's together i've done this a few years ago i got into a big phase where i was doing this a lot on the channel it seems to be something that's going to be coming back again where the market really is weird that's the easiest way to describe it rtx 30 series cards they will be coming into stock i mean nvidia wants to make money on these cards but there's a supply problem at the moment but when they come in stock or if you can't wait until they come in stock this is definitely a good option to consider where you can get some extremely good raw numbers but not break the bank so much and you can find people who just want to get that latest and greater stuff or even if they want to prepare for that latest and greatest stuff and they're impatient and they just want to sell it off on the used market for cheap so me personally i am keeping an eye out for bargains like this and if they come up then i'm definitely going to pick them up and make something of them as well as just checking out what you can get for the money where today's build came in with some really good price performance considering it's a 2080 ti and that was never really a price performance graphics card to begin with other than that something else that i checked out was the power consumption it's running at about 420 watts from the wall so that's decent considering we've got an eight core 16 threaded cpu in there and we've also got a 2080 ti now in terms of the x570 board that is a really good thing too because it gives us the option in the future to upgrade to the latest and greatest zen 3 cpus when they come out too but me personally i am waiting out to see the gaming numbers and see how it compares to the other counterparts especially those two cpus that they did in their own benchmarking against the 10 900k and the 3900x for example but until then i think something like this is a very safe play well i actually think anything on that regard is a safe play in the land of pc gaming if you can get it for a really good price in this case we got both these components pretty much at half the msrp of what you could go out and buy them for on the shelves but at these prices you can't lose like literally that's the third time i've said literally in this video we're now fourth anyway with that aside if you guys enjoyed this video then you know what to do also let us know down below what you think of mixing new and used parts together do you think it's a new meta going forward where honestly i think the used bargains are becoming less frequent because a lot more people are looking for them and there's a lot of guys that are looking for them from a profitability standpoint where they like putting rigs together and making money and you've seen this even in the realm of new parts and these guys are known as scalpers in the new parts where they try and buy limited stock items from rtx 3080s to ps5s to xbox series x's and then they try to resell them for a profit so there is a lot more of that nowadays i think it's actually at the peak it's never been higher in the history of tech than it is right now so if you do want to look for bargains you do have to be very quick don't forget that though with that aside do let us know your thoughts and opinions just like this question of the day here which comes from vasha varsha and they asked bro what is the best i5 3rd gen 4 gigabyte ram or i5 second gen eight gigabyte of ram uh i would go for the second gen with eight gigabytes of ram if you had to choose between one of the two eight gigabytes of ram is bare bones for gaming in my opinion as opposed to four gigabytes of ram you just won't get a playable experience even on games like cs go which you can run on potatoes so eight gigabytes of ram definitely in that scenario where the two i5s the 3570 for example third gen will perform a little bit better than a 2400 but same time the 8 gigabytes of ram is much more crucial in this regard i hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far then there's some options there for you too and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye
