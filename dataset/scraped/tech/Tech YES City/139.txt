or phone and type the following web address help.microsoft.com thank you 
for calling microsoft goodbye   okay this is crazy you've got to like go on the 
website now to get hold of someone just wait hello the last time we called up microsoft support 
center we found out if you have a single end   user license for windows 10 and it's activated 
then it's going to stay activated indefinitely   however in today's video we're going to be calling 
up the microsoft support center yet again but   this time we're going to ask a couple of different 
questions the first question i want to ask them is   is windows 11 the copy that we're using is that 
legitimate the one that's getting leaked around   the web and then the second question i'm 
going to ask them is if it's indeed true   that you can activate windows 11 off a 
windows 7 or 8.1 or a windows 10 key but   before we do get onto that phone call today's 
video is sponsored by a channel sponsor here   scd keys and they're bringing cheap windows 10 
key pro licenses for as little as 13 for one   or if you want to buy two of these licenses at 
the same time you can get them for around 11 and   a half dollars each after you use that coupon code 
bftyc and also if you want to get office 2019 then   they've also got that available i'll put the links 
in the description below for you guys make sure   you use that coupon code bftyc but let's get on to 
the phone call and find out what the real deal is   thank you for calling microsoft you're speaking 
to harshita could you please help me with your   microsoft email address using phonetics oh hello

please read out the product key to me sir b for bad is it okay m for manner sorry t for tank uh t for tank yeah okay just give 
me a monitor let me check which product is this   uh i'm not sure my friend gave me windows 11 
and he said i could activate it with this key   no sir this key says that this 
windows 7 pro windows 7 pro okay   yes but the the my windows 11 
says it's activated right now sir could you please go to your 
windows activation page yes on the screen at the top you will be able to find   which edition please check for that so oh yes 
it says windows 11 pro and then it says dev windows 11 is not yet launcher it 
should be windows 10 please have a check   uh oh okay but it says activated with a digital 
license windows is activated with a digital   licensed that that's what it's saying on 
the screen i just wanted to know like is   this windows 11 is this like it looks legit 
you know like it looks like the real thing and i was just wondering is you know my friend   is he i think he's a good friend 
yeah like is my friend a good friend i have no idea sir i can't judge your friend 
okay okay but if if my windows if my window so   that windows product key i gave you is that's 
working yeah like if that says active if that   says activated is that activated uh-huh okay 
because i just want to make sure that's all sure sir there is no windows 7 yet 
windows 11 yet sir okay and windows   10 edition version we have not 
reached a windows 11 yet okay   but i mean if will windows 7 will that key like 
i got this key will that work for my windows 10 right now your windows is activated sir so 
yes i don't think so you would require for the   activation all right thank thank you that's all 
i wanted to know that's all i just wanted to be   yeah i just wanted to hear 
it from microsoft you know   uh just to be sure that's all so uh 
thank you for your time you're very kind thank you for choosing microsoft have a 
wonderful day okay thank you very much so that we have it straight from the kohl center 
themselves that was really interesting because   she the lady on the phone kept saying 
yet so windows 11 hasn't been released   yet and i got that quite a few times so 
i think windows 11 is definitely coming   possibly tomorrow this 24th announcement date 
that microsoft's going to announce i think this is   windows 11 i think these people at the call center 
behind the scenes know that's coming uh so i think   she kind of let the cat out of the bag by saying 
yet so windows 11 isn't released yet though the   second thing i wanted to do was confirm my product 
key which this time around they decided to ask   for the product key and then they told me exactly 
what that was for and it was a windows 7 key now i   use std keys they're a channel sponsor and so what 
scd keys will do they'll give out single end user   licenses when i check these they're all retail 
licenses and even though on their website it says   oem they give out single and retail licenses 
for either windows 7 windows 8.1 or windows 10.   and so all these product keys whether it's a 7 and 
8.1 or a windows 10 key will actually work fine on   windows 10 to activate it and since we've got this 
developer copy and it says windows 11 activated   there i'm pretty sure that all these previous 
three generations of os once windows 11's released   will activate windows 11 as well so coming out of 
this phone call they just wouldn't admit directly   that windows 11 exists of course for obvious 
reasons since microsoft's already taking it   down if they find the leaked iso any chance they 
get but if you manage to get a copy of this i've   said it in the previous few videos that we've 
done it works extremely well and it's actually i   feel like it's got less crap baked into it so i do 
recommend making the switch if you can i'm making   the switch here at tech yes city because i feel 
like it just works better than windows 10 i mean   mainly probably because it's actually a developer 
copy as opposed to it being a retail launch but on   that note the most interesting thing coming out of 
this video was how microsoft's call center support   has changed a whole lot since the last time i 
called them and i didn't call them that long ago   where the last time i just got a number off 
google contacted the number went through   clicked what my problem was and i got a hold of 
a call representative this time around however   i had to i initially called the number that google 
gave me and that was directly to microsoft but   then when i selected i had a problem it like 
literally just palmed me off would not let me   have an option to call someone and send me to a 
website but then i eventually found another link   where i got a virtual like agent and i said i had 
problems and then it gave me the option eventually   to call someone at microsoft or have them call 
me and so that's what happened this time around   i finally got a hold of a call agent and we got 
the word for you guys and i guess that is at the   moment windows 11 isn't official yet and of course 
if you've got a windows 7 or 8.1 or a 10 pro key   then that will work to activate windows 10 which 
is what the channel sponsor we use here scd keys   they use the single end retail licenses and they 
get them at very good prices so that's why i've   been recommending scd keys here on techya city for 
a long time because i know the keys work they work   well i haven't had one of them ever deactivated 
and there are these ones that go on ebay but the   ebay keys are actually the volume license keys or 
the mac keys these keys are not meant for gamers   like you or i who just set up a pc at home and we 
use it those keys are strictly meant for business   to business where say they've got to deploy a 
hundred pcs at a office and they just get one   key and that services all the hundred pcs and 
it's easier for them to maintain their records   and these are never meant to get out to the single 
end user so do be very weary of the ebay keys   because you're not meant to use them for starters 
but on a second note they can also get deactivated   in the future if of course that agreement for 
those keys runs out with microsoft and with all   that out of the way if you enjoyed today's video 
be sure to hit that like button for us also let   us know what your thoughts are on windows 11 and 
if you've got any questions or comments about the   stuff that we talked about in today's video and 
drop a comment below and i'll try and get back   to you as soon as i can and without aside we got 
the question of the day here which comes from fat   hentai man can we get an update on this video been 
running the tech yes os for a couple of months now   no problem so far how do we keep it updated and 
they're referring to our custom windows 10 install   that we did here on the channel where we cut out 
a lot of the bloatware and made it from the get go   you could install windows 10 but i think with 
windows 11 on the horizon we're just going to   wait and then we'll do a custom one of that once 
we can remove all the crap from that windows 11   iso so stay tuned for that once i've got 
confirmation that you can actually distribute   it microsoft won't take it down and whatnot then 
we'll distribute that one for you and if you're a   gamer then you'll just be in absolute heaven and 
another thing is too we're just i'm i'm enjoying   the windows 11 content mainly because it does take 
us away from the gpu problem with gaming pcs right   now gpu prices and the whole crypto crap it's 
actually a breath of fresh air for me personally   even though crypto is dropping right now we do 
need it to drop a bit more before the miners will   think about selling off their cards that's when 
the big crux will come in for gpu prices because   the supplies already stabilizing now supplier 
these graphics cards are coming back into stock   but as long as the miners still have 300 days to 
get their whole investment back with crypto mining   on one gravis card for instance then they're still 
going to buy up those graphics cards if the prices   do come down between the prices now and the msrp 
prices so what we need is that one big one more   massive drop then you can see some sweet cheap 
gpus and hopefully that comes really soon anyway   guys if you stayed this far and you're enjoying 
that tech yes content then be sure to hit that   sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in 
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
