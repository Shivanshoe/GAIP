we have docked into the magical land of Sydney, Australia and it's about a nine hour drive from where i usually do my parts hunts where i'm located and i'm collaborating with another youtuber DesignsByIFR for a different project in a different video but while i'm down here i thought i wise will check out what the market's like see what different places around the world or at least in australia are going through in terms of used pc parts and the prices they're experiencing so we're just going to jump in the tech yes mobile and see what deals we can find while we're down here let's get it on but also make sure you get those used price performance parts hunting capes on let's see what we can find if you want to get yourself a cheap legit windows 10 pro key license then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 when you use that coupon code bftyc you can get windows activated right now links in the description below so pulling up some fresh deals here on good old gametree and facebook marketplace shows us that the market at least from what i'm seeing preliminary here is very similar to where i'm at in the gold coast and that is graphics cards right now are pretty much overpriced everywhere though you can find some decent deals amongst the mix you've just of course got to be quick when something decent comes up for instance on facebook here we've found uh there's a 1660 that they wanted 300 aussie and i put in an offer of 250 they said look if you come at 270 you can have it and given the pricing right this is the funny thing that i'm finding is it looks like a lot of the gpu prices both used and uh some of the sort of newer used stuff like 1660s and also rtx 2060s all that stuff is pretty much coming in at pre rtx 3000 series pricing now due to covert so be prepared to pay a bit more for graphics cards if you do indeed want to build a gaming pc right now also what i found on facebook was a 32 gigabyte kit of 3200 megahertz cl 16 rgb memory they want a 200 aussie i put in an offer of 190 because i actually always need rgb memory especially ddr4 stuff and if it's over 3000 megahertz and i can save even 20 under retail then i'm getting a pretty good deal so they messaged me back already said that they'll accept that come pick it up anytime so out of facebook it looks like we've already potentially scored two deals of course you never get the deal until you actually pick it up and and of course being in a whole new area where i don't know literally any of the suburbs i'm google mapsing all the suburbs when i don't know where they are roughly to try and map out some deals but moving over to gumtree i actually found a heap of different deals here that are looking very promising first of all was a gtx 1050. they said a hundred i offered eighty dollars and i'll put the us pricing up on the screen for you guys too to give an idea of worldwide pricing uh waiting for them to get back to me we've got a gtx 780 ti they uh i wanted 150 i offered it 130 and then there's a gtx 770 i offered 70 they were asking a hundred then there's a 780 ti i again offered 130 for this gpu and then there was an old-time favorite the gtx 645de which is the same as the 650 just it was the oem model and i've covered this one in the past i put down 30 aussie on this because these graphics cards go great in those systems where people just want to play popular multiplayer titles and they don't care too much about getting max graphic detail these cars do very well and then there's another one here where there's two gtx 670s i offered 110 for both of them so that brings it at 55 each of pop they've actually already messaged me back saying yep that sounds good when can you pick it up so i'm going to message that back and see if we can get that then we're looking at rtx 2060 for 500 asking but i dropped in an offer of 400 we'll see what they say there and then there was an i7 4770 cpu motherboard and ram combo and because it had 16 gigabytes of ram i offered them 160 and that's from an asking price of 220. now there was a ryzen 3 3100 i always love getting these especially if they're coming under retail i offer them 120 aussie for that waiting on to get back to me then there was a ryzen 5 1600 cpu plus the stock cooler and offered 100 from 150 asking so with that aside i'm gonna jump in the yes mobile and see if we can actually start picking up some of these deals and let's go on a little bit of a journey into state [Music] [Music] so we're now in sydney in a place called crow's nest and we just picked up our first deal two gtx 670s 55 each was 110 aussie for the total and uh i gotta say some of the deals got back to me like the gtx 1050 they said they wanted 90 dollars i just said well i'll give you 80 cash come pick it up now they said no and then the motherboard the combo the i7 the 16 gig of ram they said they wanted um 200 and i just said 160 like i'm sticking firm to my prices here because a deal is a deal you don't want to get ripped off especially when the rip-off rip-offening i'm going to say the rip-offening is only really happening on graphics cards not really other parts like ram ssds and cpus and motherboards that stuff's still relatively fine except for of course the new ryzen 5000 series which that's because of the tsmc drama and now we've got the car manufacturers involved but uh still when you're looking at like even a 14 nanometer intel let's hold that to spec and standard and get ourselves a deal on an i3 10 100 f for cheap that should be our baseline and our borderline so we're sticking to that and of course that's new so it's like hey just because we want just because we're interstate it doesn't mean i'm gonna get ripped off i'll go get ripped off on the gold coast the next deal i ended up picking up came unexpectedly out of nowhere which is going to give me a pretense to how to operate in sydney if you guys are in new south wales sydney then after this deal we'll explain what we got here i think there's a trend that i'm already seeing breaking out here and basically this deal was a 4th gen lenovo system a wireless mechanical logitech keyboard and mouse and a steering wheel and they were asking around 200 for it i offered 150 they just wanted to clean it out today and so we scored this with just a lot of gear for 150 aussies now the thing is what i'm noticing is deals come up quickly and so you can literally sit on in an area like this you can sit on this place because there's so many this big population in sydney you probably just sit on this marketplace or gum tree and refresh deals and you might be able to come up on something that's if you're really desperate to get the best deals available you can sit on there refresh refresh hit f5 and beyond that if a really good deal comes up you can swoop it up really quickly that's what i'm finding and that's sort of like if you want to get deals like we just got now you can really hit them up really quickly now another thing is too you're probably like well it's getting dark didn't you start this parts on earlier in the day and it's like yeah it did but i do have to see a lot of my family while i'm down here in sydney because i haven't seen them for a few years so i'm sort of mixing a whole collaboration in with another youtuber that's designed by far i'm also mixing in family visits and then now we're mixing in the stuff that you guys love to see and that's the parts on so let's continue on and see what else we've got lined up here where i think 32 gigabytes of ram is the next dealer we're going to go pick up and picking up the third deal was pretty close to the previous deal we got the 32 gigabytes of ddr4 rgb memory 3200 megahertz and of course when you get a deal like that it's not like a great deal of course i'm not getting half price but if this stuff i would need to buy it brand new from retail anyway and that's about 250 bucks for this thing so i'm saving 60 bucks if i do a higher end build with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 so so save myself a smooth 60 that i could potentially make in a gaming pc later and that's the thing about going for a shave if you shave 60 off here shave 50 off there that's all adding up to your total profits when it comes to flipping a gaming pc but but what i'm going to do right about now is head back to the base station and then we go back to the base station we're going to see what deals are popping around there because one thing about sydney is it's a huge huge area so there's always deals coming up all the time so hopefully we find something else [Music] so on the way home we saw a deal and it's for a gtx 970 and they say in the end they got a power supply with a 550 watt uh corsair power supply and i'm like okay i'll offer 150 cash pick it up now they're like yep yep yep get to the deal and i'm like okay does it work and i'm ready to meet them and we're in a car park right now and then they say oh i already sold the power supply i'm just saying to myself why don't you mention that in the ad and then they're like oh 150 for the just the cards fair i'm thinking to myself no it's not so i'll pay like i said to him i'll pay you 120 they should give it to me for 100 for messing me around but um yeah they just said no sorry not going any lower than 150. let's like update the ad to not have the power supply in there as well that's the whole reason i put down the bid and went to pick it up and the good thing is it's not too far away uh from where we just picked up the last deal so i guess you you just gotta be careful like like i mean really confirming what's in the ad before you go to pick up the ad luckily it was only a five minute drive but still if you're selling something like and you're gonna have an ad there and you agree to the price on what's in the ad then when you get to the deal you take away something that's in the ad anyway guys as you know shi7 happens [Music] and here we are at day two of this parts hunt and now we searched around uh gumtree and facebook this morning and there really wasn't a whole lot that came up i did message someone about the rtx 2060 where i threw down 400 offer and they came back to me and they said they'd sold it on ebay for 550 but the guy was yet to pay so they're going to get back to me if the guy doesn't pay then they'll probably sell to me locally for 400 and then there was a ryzen 5 1600 where the guy got back to us and said that they would take 120 and though the ryzen 5 1600 6 core at 120 isn't too bad i'll take that it's just barely just below that threshold i'm willing to pay for it so hopefully the guy gets back to us before we leave sydney now here's the thing about sydney came down here for a few different things but last night i stopped filming the parts hunt because i went and saw my family it's it's a very personal thing but all i'm going to say is guys is make sure you just you tell your loved ones you know that you love them and you show them that you love them because you don't know how long you've got left on this earth in terms of spending time with those that you love so it was just a real like this whole trip has been a bit of a shock to me in other ways but you know you just you just got to keep rolling as i said in the past so many times on the channel you just keep rolling with the punches and that's all you can really do so uh that's what we're gonna do right now with this this part somewhere you're gonna keep rolling with the punches and speaking of a punch we've got a 780 ti where i offered 130 aussie they got back to me they said they'd take it and i've messaged them and waiting for them to get back but the thing is we've got to leave here before the afternoon otherwise if i don't i'll be getting back to the gold coast at like three or four in the morning and driving late is as fun as driving is at night time driving like past 2 a.m really starts to set in especially if your body clock's not used to it and so we're just going to hopefully get some deals before we get on out of here if not we may have to stop halfway between the gold coast and sydney where i'm at now in order to just uh relax and recover but we'll see how we go who knows just keep on rolling baby you know what time it is [Music] and now we're back in the tech yes studio after a massive drive yesterday and uh it's quite a long journey but i guess you guys want me to chime in on the my thoughts on the sydney used parts market and what i think of it and it's definitely a i'm gonna say i prefer locally where i'm at and in fact i prefer a lot of different countries japan being one of my favorites korea also being pretty solid as well uh when it comes to sydney it's one of those cases of the road network i'm going to say lets it down a lot in that we were traveling around going getting all these deals and i'm going through one place and it's tall here four dollars 50 tall there 4.50 and i guess if you don't take the toll road then you're going to get stuck in traffic and it's going to take you a lot longer so maybe if you wanted to do the sydney parts hunts it'd be like maybe nine or ten at night would be the best idea but even then would people want to meet up with you and do the deals at those times another thing is that we got ghosted as well on pretty much two of the five deals that i went to pick up i got ghosted on one another was just straight up wrong where you you put in a price on an offer and then they pretty much change it right then and there when you're going to pick it up so i mean definitely i'm going to say i got it better up here in queensland when it comes to sydney i think it's more of that massive city and you just got to be on the on the go on the go 24 7 constantly and i'd say it's more localized where you're going to be looking in a very small radius where you're searching for deals say for instance when i'm on the gold coast here i search 50 kilometers as my base default sometimes i'll even up it to 100 kilometers and in sydney i'd say you probably just want to max it out at 20 kilometers where you just want to stick to your local area and pick up deals around there because outside of that you're going to be wasting a lot of time people can ghost you or then say all right someone else is coming to pick it up sorry mate and then uh dog you but overall prices in sydney with used pc parts can be pretty good we did pick up three awesome deals i'll put that tally up on the screen but before i get on out of here there is one good deal that i've picked up locally and we're going to go score that right now that's a 10 400 for 150 aussie dollars that is good to be back in my hometown so we're going to cop that right now and before we do we have the question of the day here which comes from al gorn de enzo and they asked 10 more performance than the 2060. some brands are charging 500 off the rip no thanks hard pass even at 350 this is the worst value cost in video card in three generations i keep seeing reviewers giving props to this card and it boggles my mind i think the mining craze is broken some of these people's minds or their money all mostly shills so this comment here really makes me happy i like the fact that you guys are starting to see there's a hard pass when nvidia and the retailers and everyone want to charge more money for these cards just let them sit on the shelves and that's what we're seeing here in australia these cards have come out the 3060s and they're charging way too much like i didn't think they'd want to charge 900 aussie dollars plus for a 30 60. i mean come on the 3060 ti was 700 aussie 360 ti when it came out in australia i was like wow that's a pretty good price i was recommending it to people when it first came out in australia and then the 360ti went up to a thousand plus aussie dollars now this 3060 this kind of i think a lot of retailers especially are banking on the fact that there's this massive demand and people will just blatantly easily and happily get ripped off at those prices and it's great to see that the stock is still sitting on the shelves you guys are sticking to that hard pass when the prices just get too ridiculous that's good to see it i mean in the meantime you can just hold out with a gtx 670 for 55 aussie dollars until those prices get better because the 3060 it should be around like max 600 650 aussie dollars max that's the max you should be paying for it even with this crypto boom as we saw those performance figures it wasn't the best performing card surrounded rtx 2070 2070 super and yet it's coming in for more than the rtx 2070 was when that was released at least in australia here so absolute stupidity i think with these prices at the moment and i'm glad you guys aren't falling for the bs but also we're going to finish off this part time right here because i've got a heap of other stuff to get onto and i'm going to get that deal as well so do let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite deal of the day it's probably going to be this 10 400 for 150 bucks or it might be that logitech kit that we got that was really good as well but do let us know and this won't be the part time of the month this is just a special bonus part time of the month is coming at the end of the month so if you want to see that the moment it drops stay tuned by hitting that sub bell ringing that bell and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
