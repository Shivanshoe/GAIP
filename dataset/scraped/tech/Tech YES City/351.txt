you are looking at a build right here
that i was going to build for the new release of valorant
but then i checked the minimum system requirements, and i was shocked
they're recommending a GT 730 for like recommended system requirements
and i was going to put in an rx470 (for this gaming pc) and i thought to myself... that's way too
good for this title if they're recommending a gt730 so what we're going
to do is we're going to scrap this build right
here this will be for a later date and it was still going to be of course
good price performance but we're going to be putting together
something under a hundred dollars which you guys have been requesting
this is a gtx 645 and we're going to see if we can get some smooth
fps in valorant and look at this recently, i just added rgb to my table
and this was in like celebration of this new release
tech yes citizens i have negotiated a new 18%
off coupon code on a windows 10 pro single end user license with today's
video sponsor scd keys for as little as 13 bucks using
the coupon and the link in the description below
and with all these parts on the table this
is what we are now looking at gtx 645 we got this for 27
aussie dollars in a recent parts hunt and now the funny thing about this is
it's pretty similar in performance to a gtx 650
except it was made for oem dell systems and it didn't need a six pin or anything
like that which is going to go perfect with this motherboard and power supply
and i5 2400 combo right here so this power
supply is a 200 watt power supply so very low
power we can't do much with that but we only paid 15
aussie dollar reduce for this whole combo right here but
the problem is is it's untested i don't know what could be wrong with it
so we're going to fire it up soon and see if it works but if it does all work
out then we also have a 60 gigabyte ssd and a 500 gigabyte hard drive which i
got in a combo for 20 aussie dollars and then last up is the 8 gigabytes of
ddr3 ram which we got for 25 aussie dollars
though this case right here this was actually
free it was just a dumpstered hp pavilion case
which i got from someone who was uh selling us a heap of parts
and like a lot of them were broken and stuff so this was just a chuck away
so i mean hopefully the power switch works that's really all we've got to get
out of it so this leads this whole tally now to 87
which in usd terms is 60 usd roughly so we have come well under
that budget so let's see if we can actually get this thing to boot first
and if we can then we're going to clean everything up
and see how it performs in valorant [Music]
guys we are out here live with heavy winds reporting from the lenovo
think headquarters but you just need to hook up this thermal sensor and then it
should all go away that's much better much better
so lenovo thinkcentre is working fine here on its first boot it's recognizing
the ssd we've just got a basic two gigabyte ram
stick in here because uh that's pretty much the simple thing
you can do when you're booting up oems for the first time is
just boot with a single two gigabyte stick
because sometimes and we've recently done this in a previous video
where it these boards can actually suffer from a thing called bit rot so
what i'm going to do is i'm going to now put in my 8
gigabytes of ram and if that boots fine then we can start putting that in the
build but if not then we're going to have to
update the boss on this motherboard so we're now trying to boot this up with
the blue memory and it's just not taking it's not giving
us out any signal so it's kind of just like we thought where this
board is really old pretty dirty and so i'm gonna just get
on with that bios update right now [Music]
and after a lot of trial and error and troubleshooting we now have
a setup with eight gigabytes of ram i5 2400
and a gtx 650 it's not a 645 it's a 650 so let me get some rest now because i'm
super tired after doing all this and i'll come back in the morning and
tell you guys how you can get a lenovo think center
m81 to work again with i guess uefi boot gpus
and fear not think center for you have been out thought
[Music] that it is up now done that exercise
freshened up and that elliptical rider by the way
i picked it up like for like a quarter of the price you get it brand new for
and then i cleaned it all up and it's good to go but this story right here
this is the lenovo h61 uh motherboard that
is called the m81 now these won't work with newer graphics cards
to an extent and so there was a bios update
that's needed to support newer graphics cards and that was last released in 2014
so when you update to that bias you'll then gain access to six and seven
series cards that will now work but you don't get the option to disable what's
known as secure boot and you'll need to disable that in order
to get the graphics cards or any graphics card
to work if not you'll have to go through a list and so
that's reliant on lenovo adding cards like this
onto that list so we're now able to use a gtx 650
but not a gtx 645 since this was an oem made for dell so
i'm a little bit disappointed about that because this was five dollars cheaper
than this so we have to take 27 off the budget and
then add in 32 aussie dollars for this but the biggest thing that i'm concerned
about here is this needs a six pin and our budget power supply here doesn't
have a six pin so what i'm going to be doing is i'm
going to be adding a one dollar connector here
and i'm going to have to solder that on and i've also got
since we need two sata ports still i'm going to use a starter splitter
so another one dollar extender on this power supply so that's two dollars extra
in our connectors we've also got five
dollars extra on the gravis card now the last problem that we had
with this motherboard was the memory the two four gigabyte sticks here they don't
work in dual channel funny thing is though
they both work on their own and they work on other motherboards in
dual channels so going through other memory sticks trying
to get dual channel to work it just simply did not work
on this board so the board is inherently semi-faulty
but i guess the good news and the saving grace is it
one of these slots and only one of these slots that's the fourth dim slot
works okay so we're going to put an eight gigabyte stick in
instead of two four gigabytes six now we're going to take 25
off the budget and then we've got to add 28
to the budget because this one costs an extra three dollars when i picked it up
in a used deals hunt so overall we're adding 10 aussie dollars to the budget
roughly 7 usd we're still coming well under 100 for
this budget build so let's finally get this thing cleaned
up and built [Music] [Music] baby [Music]
baby [Music] baby
[Music] baby
[Music] and now it is time to talk about
the under 100 pc and it is working it is working absolutely fine so we're
running a stress test right here while we download valorant
and i've downloaded the latest graphics card drivers which are important for a
newly released title like valorant and the good thing about the gtx 6
series at the very least is that it still gets
new driver updates as opposed to say a 5 series and
below nvidia stops supporting those cards
quite a while ago so this should work fine in valorem well
i got my fingers crossed but the game's actually pretty quick to download
i'm just running a stress test now to make sure everything's fine
nothing's out of the ordinary nothing crashes everything's working 100
before we boot this game up and i've also done the inspector taking off those
security update things that make my i5 2400 run slower
and we've tuned this pc up so it is ready to go
and you may notice i decided to mount the drives in a weird way on the power
supply that's because i was just feeling a
little bit different with this build and the 3.5 inch drive trays are missing
i decided to leave the front panel off the plastic front panel protector
just mainly because i didn't like the pavilion branding
the hp pavilion especially second gen is one of the worst
pcs to work with in terms especially in terms of motherboards
and the bios updates there like is no bias update i'm actually grateful that
lenovo did at least give a bios update so this gtx 6 series card
could work and with that aside there's only one thing left to do
and that is boot up valorant and see how this gaming pc performs [Music]
and now here we have it for under a hundred bucks and against all odds
we built ourselves a pc that can run valorant
really smoothly and this was at 1080p low settings so as soon as i jumped into
the game i took a look at the settings and basically there is one setting i
would change if you're jumping into this on something like this a low spec
machine that would be the anisiotropic filtering it had it on one x
and i set it up to 16x and everything looked pretty good
and the fps this was an even better response here
where we're getting over 100 fps average going around 120 to 130
most the time while we're playing on this map ascent
and it seemed to pick this map i played three full rounds in a row
and it seemed to just keep picking this map for me and it's basically a five
verse five mechanism like cs go so if you're used
to playing cs go then valorante you'll be able to just
jump into this game and start playing it no problems now the abilities are a bit
different and so there is some differences between
the two games but overall the feel of the
game is pretty much identical and i dare say that this
has better sort of server registry and bullet rage even though cs go was
really good for that this feels like it was just that little bit better so very
responsive game and it did run really smooth even on an i5 2400 and a
gtx 650 which we had here today though i will say the one percent lows
were looking pretty good though around 60 to 70 most of the time
but the 0.1 percent lows did dip and this especially happened when it was
on big events like if someone was planning the spike
or if it was changing between rounds i noticed it would sometimes dip to around
four or five fps but all the other times it was going
around thirty to forty point one percent low so
the game ran really smooth it's just be careful of those big events it could
especially if you're in a clutch play for example it could affect
your ability to get that w but other than that i mean we look at
how this pc came together and it was just a miracle that it ended up working
i mean that single stick of ram seems to work fine for valor ant though
of course i do recommend dual channel that'll make things run that bit better
though the gtx 650 that's a perfect card for 1080p low
settings on this game i would say even something like a gt640
would work but i wouldn't go any lower than a 6
series car just because of that driver support and if you're on the amd side of
things hd 7000 series card or better i'd say
even something like a 7770 that would work fine for this game too
so this thing here will play cs go valerant and all those other easy to
play games like league of legends dota 2 absolutely fine though what about
fortnite and that's where i've already tested the gtx 650 it's good for around
720p low settings epic distance so this thing will still play fortnite
it's just won't play it at 1080p that well anyhow some other benefits
involved with this build since we're going with the open air design
if you guys haven't checked out the previous build i did
put the link to that up there where we just used open-air chassis this is kind
of going off the same formula where we paid nothing for the case
and the temperatures were really good 50 degrees on the cpu
or under 50 most the time and same with the gpu that was under 50
and the noise wasn't that half bad so the pc itself is running really nicely
and that ssd this is the like funniest thing was we put a 60 gigabyte ssd in i
expected the 500 gigabyte backup drive that we used here
to be needed though valerant was like i think it was like a four gigabyte
download or something like that it was pretty small game you could
download it within an hour on most internet connections
and it just fit completely fine on the ssd to begin with
and with all that out of the way that leads us to the best part of today's
video and that is valerian is free to play so
it matches perfectly with a budget potato so if a lot of your
friends are playing this and you just want to get into it and say
you've got a console but you just want to play
on pc then you can definitely get away with building something super cheap
like we've done here today though keep in mind all the problems that we've gone
through in today's video that was it was a bit of a task to get
here and also another thing that i had to do
was the this is a hp case so the power switch was actually
routed a lot different you didn't get the standard 2 pin
it came in like this this 10 pin pack so i actually had to keep adjusting it
until i found the right configuration for the power button to work properly
and that about does it for this valerant gaming pc right here if
you guys enjoyed this one then be sure to hit
that like button also let us know in the comments section below
what's your experience with building budget pcs or
if you've built a pc for valerian yourself what's your thoughts on the
game love reading your thoughts and opinions as always
and one more thing before we get on the question today this system didn't juice
up a whole lot of power either it was using around 125 watts from the wall
whilst we were playing the game itself so that was good to see
not juicing up a whole lot of power getting some really good fps
you'd be able to match something like this with 144 hertz monitor
if you could find one of them for cheap then you'd have a really good experience
on this game though speaking of the question of the
day it comes from ken patchy strength and they asked what's the highest gpu
you would pair with an e3 12 30. they're speaking of the e3
1230 xeon this is a sandy bridge part very similar
to the i7 2600 for course eight threads i'd personally
pair this maximum with like a 1650 super rx 470
something like that will match really nicely with that cpu you'd be able to
play a lot of different titles at 1080p and
get smooth fps hopefully that answers that question and
if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then be
sure to hit that sub button ring that bell
and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon
someone's banging some wood outside now so i'm going to get on out of here
peace out for now bye [Music]
wow
