Heya you know i've got to cover the cost of it going to the supply the suppliers got to then do the test themselves also and see if they can get the problem and then from there then they've got to send it back to wherever they bought it from if they don't have one and even if they do yeah man okay so the whole supply situation is just a mess right now eh so you so new zealand, new zealand aren't having big player down problems but i'm not saying they're not having too many problems but bbt probably owe the marketplace there and they probably can get a lot of it quite easy because they're buying bulk amounts so have you heard any update on the radeon 6800 xt or 6800 or what all i've got is one on back order and um yeah i haven't heard anything about that at all i'm seeing what i'm seeing with that is like in the us they've raised the prices of the board partner cards it is this is the one everybody wants but once we get one and like they might back order there's zeus tough or maybe strict but as soon as we get one i would say once we say what we've got they will say yes to it so would you have any do you have any idea when these cards like you're going to get back in healthy supply or nothing in back february normal i reckon you know i mean i'm not saying that shops don't have them of course you know everyone will have an opportunity to get one you just gotta act quick i guess like every single time i get one they're pretty much they'll say well that's what i'm finding about i'm fine dude as soon as like i get a chance to get a 38 i'm just like yep give me that 30 80. like asap i'll take it whatever yeah um that's an intel logo on my shirt man viewers are gonna say like dude you're an intel shield you're an intel shield so we'll just cover that one up [Music] now i'm a phantom gamer i've been speaking to a few people in the industry and i'm asking about 6800 xt 6800s rtx 3080s and what i'm seeing is 3070s and 3090s are starting to come into stock like you can just go buy them off the shelves but 3080s are just still in such high demand and if i was to pull up a paint shop diagram here for you guys is you every time i do a paint shop diagram you guys absolutely love it so we're going to put in here the 30 80 demand on the scale here for you and we just see it's through the roof like if this was pinocchio's nose it would just so rtx 3080 supply if you're after one of these you may be waiting as we heard there until february because they've got to fulfill all the pre-orders now 6800 xt i've been asked to check the prices here and from what i can see the aib pricing is very odd because at least when the 3080 launched there was cards at msrp now 6800 xt 3080 had the exact same problems there just wasn't enough supply and there was way too much demand but what i've seen with the 6800 xts at least with the aib cards is that they're not even on sale from scalpers on ebay which is kind of odd because usually the scalpers and the bots are the ones getting these cards as quick as possible even if they're one per customer kind of thing they're on top of that and you'd see them being re-flipped on ebay but you're not seeing that for any of the aib cards at least from what i can see right now but we are seeing reference 6800 xt 6800s on sale on ebay so if anything i'd say amd are going to have the exact same problem that nvidia's had where there's not enough supply whether they've got a little bit more supply or a little bit less supply than the 3080 on launch it doesn't matter demand for these cards especially the 38 in the 6800 xt in particular is through the roof and that's not going to be alleviated until all those pre-orders are fulfilled but what's going to happen in 2021 is that there could be more hiccups like 2020s has been this year where everyone stayed at home and i feel like that has pushed demand to artificial levels that we've never seen before with uh tech products so these cards right here this rtx 3080s and all these other graphics cards coming out they're almost like digital gold they're almost like a bitcoin except they'll actually give you a gaming experience so bottom line is with stock problems i've spoken to a few gpu manufacturers they are shipping out cards as soon as they can and i spoke to gigabyte as well they said they had stock every week they've got all models coming into australia they're fulfilling orders so they're doing their best and that's what i've heard from retailers too not just from gigabyte themselves and don't worry if there's someone who wants to buy a graphics card and give a company profit you can bet your bottom dollar that they're going to be trying to fulfill those orders as soon as possible so bottom line if you want a 3080 or 6800 xt in particular they're going to be the two most demanded cards on the higher end so if you are desperate to get some good frames you may want to consider a different card especially from a manufacturer other than a zeus with the azus tough where i'm told from everyone universally that that card is just through the roof in terms of demand anyhow the latter half of today's video is going to be talking about driver issues or black screens and other problems that people have been uh telling me people have been dming me as well and saying look what's up with 38 i've been hearing there's been some problems with black screening and i've been hearing uh other people on other gpus have been having problems and one thing for me i'm going to actually talk about this a little bit more in focus here where gigabyte actually loaned me for their cards because i said to them like yo can i test a heap of your cards to see if they crash i want to inspect this and i want to get to the bottom of it so i spent a few days testing out the gigabyte cards here just leaving them on stress tests benchmarking them and none of them cut out but one thing i'm going to say is this right here we're gonna look at a just a power supply that i got here off the internet it was like a pretty mediocre one not even mediocre we're gonna probably do a dedicated video on this later but this is a 650 watt power supply that's what they're saying on the box but when we look a little bit closer this is not a true 650 watt power supply i think it's more like a 450 watt if that but we're going to see now if we put this rtx 3080 on this power supply right here what is going to happen are we going to get these issues that people have been reporting about where you get potentially a black screen or your pc resets because i think that's what's going on if you're getting a high-end gpu like a 3080 then you've got to be spending a bit more money on your power supply here is where it makes perfect sense but here's the thing in the past we have done videos on budget power supplies but they've always been true rated power supplies and so i feel like if you're going with a 3080 make sure you're getting at least a true rated 650 watt power supply or in this case nvidia recommends a 750 watt power supply and that's a 750 watt continuous with the big w but let's put this power supply through the tests here and see what unfolds so this beautiful 650 watt power supply there's already one little problem and that is well actually two little pro two big problems and that is the eight pin there's only one of them and the gtx 3080 in particular needs two eight pins and some if you get a custom models they might even need three eight pins so this power supply is just like not geared up from the get-go we're gonna use an adapter here to get the other eight pin connected and another thing is the gauge uh wire the thickness of it is so thin like it's like i'm gonna be honest this is the thinnest gauge wire i've seen on a so-called 650 watt power supply so before we even hit the power switch i'm feeling a little bit nervous so we're now on the tomb raider menu and we haven't even benchmarked the game yet our power supplies booted up we are running about 650 watts from the wall i think that's smoking i think i heard a noise i think i heard something let's see if we can run the benchmark let's see if this 650 watt power supply can really do 650 watts i just i didn't hear a good sound coming out of it then uh this thing's gonna blow up dude like this does not sound good oh okay it turned off it did itself well no it cut out okay there's your black screen there's your black screen and restart right there i'm um okay yikes i i like that is just it's not good to do that that smells rank yeah okay we're not like look i know i'd like to show you guys these tests but i generally don't feel comfortable doing this stuff because you can also take out components when these power supplies like this do this stuff we've got to open the window here damn that that reeks okay okay that stinks so basically this is what happens like we've shown you a pretty garbage tier power supply right here it says it was 650 watts it i mean look it was running 650 watts for like a couple of minutes from the wall but it was not giving out 650 watts to these components i've tested this setup or something very similar and it does use up about 480 watts on the shadow of the tomb raider benchmark so what we're seeing here is the exact problem that a lot of guys may be experiencing if they're running high in gear and that is they might be using a mediocre power supply they might have something better than this right here but it's still not a hundred percent for their 30 80. and so what that means is you will get a black screen you may get a restart and it might not even be nvidia or amd's problem if you've got these kinds of power supplies so i think what we've shown here is good enough to at least say hey if you're experiencing black screen problems and you're in forums and you're asking for help or you're on driver forums maybe state what power supply you've got and the rest of your equipment and now we're going to close this video off with saying if you're in the market for a high-end pc and you're putting a high-end gpu in there always check your power supply and what you're using and so what we're going to see is when people say oh did reviewer x have problems with their gpu a lot of the reviewers are probably not going to have problems because i know for a fact like all the guys that i know that review cards are using high-end power supplies i'm using a hx 1000 on my test bed and that's a platinum rated power supply course there are channel sponsors so they love it when i use their gear but that being said it's an expensive power supply but it's got some of the lowest ripple and some of the best power delivery in the game so when you do these things you want to make sure that if you're buying a high-end graphics card buy a high-end power supply and so this vp650 from game max this thing didn't even pass one benchmark in shadow of the tomb raider which i know that game when i've loaded it up in stress tests before from a decent power supply it'll use under 500 watts with this configuration so the fact that it's going to like 650 and then even 750 at one point shows that not only is the efficiency terrible but the things just heating up and becoming like its own worst enemy and then that's what caused the whole system to black screen and shut off though you probably in that vlog section heard me uh worried about using this power supply and that was because it was going over its limits and so when something goes over its limits it should just shut off automatically and so i heard these weird ticking noises and i've heard those noises before as though something like this doesn't have i'd guess proper protections in place either and so that's when you're going with a cheaper power supply do keep that in mind in fact the only time i'd ever use something like this power supply right here would be on an entry level banger that's using maybe 100 watts from the wall and even then it's it's kind of like well anyway we'll make another video towards power supplies because i think it's people really need to understand that if they're buying high-end gear or even a 30-70 or 30-60 ti is going to come out soon you need to couple that stuff with decent gear because of the fact that we're going down to eight nanometer and on amd's side seven nanometer it needs very good power delivery anyhow another big thing for you guys out there with the gigabyte cards especially the eagle people were like well the eagle was crashing out and my guess there would just be correlating the fact that they've bought the cheapest rtx 3080 and they're perhaps cheaped out on some other components so when i tested the eagle i had that in the studio here i had the vision g i had the gaming oc so these four gigabyte cards that came through here they were absolutely fine and in case of the vision g and the gaming oc and the eagle they all shared a very similar cooler not just in weight but also temperatures and noise and i'll pull these numbers up for you guys here because this is one of the most important things when you're buying a high-end gpu because nowadays especially nvidia and amd are very tight on their board partners and what they can push through as being okay for retail shelves i know this because i've spoken to both sides of the camps and they have very good um board partner policing let's put it that way and what we're seeing is that these cards out of the box they're giving out decent noise levels uh vision g was 75 percent 66 degrees and this is in relatively hot ambience too the gaming oc was very similar and also the eagle was performing absolutely fine though the 60 manual speeds were getting pretty hot near that of thermal throttling levels so you will want to leave it on auto which does take the cards to roughly 75 to 80 percent but it was around about 43 to 44 decibels noise so that's absolutely fine the 30 70 that came through that was uh 75 percent at 67 degrees too so the noise and temperatures as long as your card isn't thermal throttling you're getting what you're paying for especially on a 30 80. so that's the most important thing with a card make sure it's not thermal throttling if it is thermal throttling then do make sure that you've got good airflow to that gpu as well if you put it in a really low end case with no airflow and it starts hitting 83 degrees then that's because it just doesn't have fresh airflow it doesn't have cold air coming in to cool it down so that's another thing to consider too anyway that aside if you guys have any questions or comments about today's video then be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below hopefully this has answered some questions about stock problems driver crashes and what's going on in 2020 now one thing i will say it's just such an unusual year nothing's really changed in terms of what i've done two years ago compared to what i've done this year where in my recent auris 3080 review a lot of people getting angry that tech tubers are getting cars to review but from what i'm told is these cars are coming in stock there's just so much demand that it's just outweighing supply heavily and what i'm told from different sources is that they've actually got more cards than they did during the touring season so nvidia's doing like i know nvidia is doing their job to get these cards pumped out as much as possible it's just it's hard to get your hands on one and so instead of having the question of the day we got the comment of the day which is from our lord cryden and thank you for understanding the situation he says all these reviews for gpus lately i don't agree with people when tech tubers review them and they get mad at you now this is your job and when they do come in stock it's not like these reviews are worthless so just pausing that bit there it's exactly what we're doing this is like this is my job and when gigabyte and auris and all the other companies and zeus asrock when they send stuff in for review that's my job to test it out share all the details with you guys to help you make the proper purchasing decision but also i take those points from the video and relay them back to the company and say look you could improve on this this and this basically what we said in the review and for instance from yesterday's video with the euros 38 i said to gigabyte you guys could touch up that silent oc bias it's the only thing that i found wrong with that card everything else was really good and at the end of the day it is a crap situation that 2020 has brought upon us this is just one of those extra crappy things where everyone wants to game on pc and they want the high-end stuff well the market for the high-end stuff has really increased with the amount of time or the amount of more time that people spend at home than they otherwise would and i mean nothing's changed in the way i've been doing my job for the last few years it's just you know it seems like you're now the target and people are like locking on and they're like yo here's the problem the tech reviewers and guys really when you think about the tens of thousands of cards that are being moved every month tech reviewers would only account for like point zero zero one percent of those cards the one more thing i will say is that it was much easier for me to get 30 70s than it was for 30 80s and so that's why i was talking about 30 80s in the intro because the 30 70s seem like they're just coming into stock now people can buy them and i mean look the 3070 is a really good card it performs really well i just think people want that gddr6x they want that extra performance from the 3080. anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button for us and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon also on the way out if you're enjoying the tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] you
