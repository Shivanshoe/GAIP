[Music] is the supply choked like is that all [Music] have you built a PC recently only to be met with the windows needs activation message in the bottom right hand corner even whilst you're playing games well if you want to get rid of this message the today's video sponsor s CD Keys has you covered for as little as 15 bucks after using the coupon code TYC SK you can get yourself a single and user license quickly and easily then you get the key click on change product key in Windows activation click Next and you're good to go links in description below to get your key today so just finished up at you might now and this is one thing that's going on now it's just absolutely crazy and that is I've got my order here and it's just been split I ordered this like five days ago instead of to take around two days but they've got over like a hundred orders even still to process where their systems just getting overloaded and I essentially ordered in two cases that they said they're adding stuff and they didn't so a lot of computer places are just having this problem and this is all gonna tie in with today's video topic hear me out here where basically there's just mass delays now and because demand is so high right now there's just these new delays that are being introduced plus we've seen things like power suppliers getting sold out and that's even pushing on now to cases and also graphics cards [Music] and now we're back at the tech studio and we're gonna talk about the buyers first the buyers side of things and then we'll go on to the sellers market and basically if you're a buyer right now you should be either thinking of two things and that is buying budget or finding the best deal you can or waiting out because all the information I'm about to talk about points towards holding out at least for a couple of months well what we've got right now is this massive supply that's now coming through that's going to account for that upwards demand however what I think is gonna happen in the next couple of months is that demand is going to wane off it may even wane off a lot and so since this massive supply is coming through that could then you could see really cheap prices in a couple of months on tech believe it or not even though it doesn't seem right right now it may happen and so what I'm finding out from suppliers is that they're now shipping through a lot more containers than they otherwise would the same time last year for instance and so what this means is is that you've got that pent up demand there it's there and you've got to account now for the supply which is coming through and so basically what happened in January and February was that supply got cut off it was pretty much came to a stop and so that sent a big disruption through the chain but also on the same time you had people staying home a lot more which artificially raised the demand a lot more than it otherwise would be and so what you've got right now in the buyers market is you've got this massive amount of demand and I'm seeing this locally I'm talking to a few reps and they're saying the same things and basically that's not going anywhere for another couple of weeks but then you've got the supply that's really ramped up to supply this demand and that's still going to come through the pipeline so basically what that means is things will get better and if you're really looking for good value for money especially for a new PC I'd be holding out a couple of months and this is the thing this is counterproductive to what I do locally as they basically that's real talk for you guys I don't need to put that stuff in the titles or in my videos you know tech yes given your real talk all that time and here's a funny thing about that it's counterproductive to what I do locally basically telling you guys not to buy pcs right now but I'm selling pcs and I'm getting affiliate links on new products if people watch reviews and stuff like that but if you guys have watched long enough that's what the tech yes is all about let's move over now to the seller's market where this is a different game altogether there is one thing one commodity that is born out of this whole thing right now and that is the instant demand the fact that you've got something ready to go I'm finding right now when I list PCs and I'm putting that in the description especially in the first couple of lines this PC is ready to game right now it's built it's ready to go play your games straight away and the funny thing is people are coming around and they're actually telling me that - they're saying look I really want this PC because it's just ready to go now and I'm thinking to myself well that is working really well and so basically that is now a commodity because the retailers are getting overloaded with orders and there's two got the same amount of staphon and so that basically creates a new plot where orders are getting delayed a few days and sometimes the orders aren't even getting fulfilled because the systems are getting overloaded so basically if you're a seller right now that is one thing you can do to really set yourself apart even if all the other sellers are doing it on wherever you're selling locally at least you're putting yourself apart from the retailer's which are currently having a problem with supply and demand anyhow guys in relation to the used and new market in my opinion supply is gonna be getting a lot better in the next few months so if you can't hold out do hold out if you're a buyer you might also want to take a look at my previous video where we talk about GPU prices there's a lot of juicy advice I'll put the link to that video up here and if you're a seller of course if you can't get the deals at all then they should be popping up a little bit more in the next couple of months but of course if you're not just ready to go but you're reeling to go then be sure to hit that like button for us and also in the previous video I got accused of sort of going behind lessers back and stuff like that now you guys you should know me better if you're thinking that because I've known LEDs for quite a while now he's a good friend of mine and he knows that I know the guy that supplies him to and so the story behind that is last year I was at a tech event and I got invited from another friend who owns a small IT shop and that's where I met the supply that he came up to me introduced himself and basically from there he knew what I was about with my channel he said he watched the channel and he knows that I like the really sort of you know hard to clean stuff the stuff that really needs to take is loving and so les doesn't really like that stuff at all and a lot of buyers don't really like that really filthy stuff and I'm like look that's my opportunity that's my stuff right there so I basically like to get my hands dirty literally but not metaphorically if that makes any sense and yet me and let's talk about it he knows that I know the guy and I don't really step on his regular turf and that he does a lot of different products especially the OEM stuff and you'll notice if you watch the videos the stuff that I got in the previous video differs a lot to the stuff that I got from les and in fact I went to the two people in the same video so you can see the contrast within that video itself anyway guys with that aside we got the question of the day which comes from Wahab files and they asked are you using normal wd-40 or wd-40 contact cleaner well normal wd-40 screw up plastic fans on the GPU and the answer that is no normal wd-40 is pretty good but there are a lot better solutions out there I find that on average wd-40 tends to be a lot thicker than the other multipurpose spray stuff that i use the stuff that i use now at least in my workflow is some of the best that I've used unfortunately it seems like it's only sold in the stray so where you are locally if you're in another place in the world you'll have to find what works for you I find the CRC 5 5 6 stuff that works pretty well I think it's a bit better than wd-40 but of course you can get the ACC stuff too there's a lot of different options but if you're in Australia the multi-purpose spray is the way to go and you can get it from the discount stores which is a lot cheaper than super cheap - they self like eight bucks discount store sell for like three dollars a can bargain though before I get on out of here do let us know in the comment section below what you think of the buyers and the sellers market do you like these kind of videos love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and if you've stayed this far and you're enjoy that content and you know what to do hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you in another take video very soon peace out for now BAE [Music] you
