welcome to tech oled city and right behind me here we've got the two OLEDS that i use these are the 55 inches the b7 and also the cx as my main monitors now the first thing we're going to go over before we get into the tuning profiles, best settings and presets, is that one important thing about oleds is they do have a glossy surface so the first thing you want to do is you want to have your environment set up so that there's no direct sunlight coming on the monitors themselves this is going to give you the best experience because if you've got light directly coming in from outside and it's hitting the oleds and bouncing off it you're going to get reflections that'll be very annoying when you're gaming another thing is too say for instance you're having a nice gaming session definitely set your room up so you can block out light if it's bothering you because i'm telling you now these things are going to give you the best visual experience and we just got finished doing the cx 77 inch there uh he's the young guy here he's telling me he wants an oled i thought this was techo that city i want to overhead too well i don't have enough money to to get you one more i haven't got any money either but what about a monopoly kit so you're saying we'll get the monopoly money and we'll go buy an oled why not all right well let's go get this video done for the viewers then we'll see if we can purchase an oled with monopoly money let's try [Music] welcome back to tech yes city and on the left here we have a lg b7 these are a few years old now and they only support 60 hertz over 4k 8 bit this one here is the cx and the good thing is is if you've got a cx or even the b series the b9 series for instance b9 c9 or cx or bx you're going to be able to get a lot out of these new oleds and the difference is not just in the fact that they've got 10 bit 120 hertz 4k another thing is too the input lag in particular i found on the b7 here there's only one mode that i can literally use for pc usage and that's game mode and even then the game mode will have input lag over the cx and if you turn off game mode then the input lag is absolutely horrendous on the b7 so straight away if you're on older oleds you're pretty much locked to one mode and that's game mode but if your tv for instance the b9 has the instant game response then you don't have to worry about which mode you use because you can turn on instant game response and then you've got the really low input lag on any profile you use so what we're going to go over today is four different profiles and we're going to start for competitive gamers so let's get into the first profile on the cx here now if you're a competitive gamer you're going to want to have a few things and that is you're going to be want to see in dark areas pretty easily you're also going to won't be too distracted by colors and the main thing about today's video is going to be mainly focused for b9 c9 cx and bx users so now we've got our oled here we've got our remote and if you don't know how to use your remote this is not going to be the video to show you how to do it but we basically click our settings button and we want to go into all settings here and on picture mode there's a few things we're going to do before we get into the actual mode itself we go left uh we'll click here use the same left click too much we go to picture mode we can see we've got a heap of different options here 10 different profiles without hdr turned on and if we turn hdr on i believe we've got six modes in that as well they're actually separate so vivid in hdr and standard hdr will have their own profiles within that so you'll have two standard and two vivid for example and two game modes depending on if hdr is switched on or if it's switched off but let's start off with the bass lines we're going to go to game now first because this is the one we're going to set up for competitive fps we're also going to go back to this main screen here and we're going to just make sure we go back again and just check out some of these main settings first things first aspect ratio settings make sure just scan is turned on if you're on a pc or a new gen console that's going to make sure our screen is as big as it should be without essentially making the screen bigger and your icons are off the screen and you can't see them that's the one for that then we go to energy savings i like to leave this on auto personally because i find the cx series and also the b9 c9 they do an excellent job of having good energy savings off the get-go if you turn this off over i mean sorry if you turn actual energy saving off you may over time be susceptible to burn in a lot quicker than if you left this on auto and if something's static like we've got a static image here the screen will start saving power so i like to leave energy savings on auto and within all our profiles that we're showing here today which we're going to have six profiles in total based off of technically four profiles but again two of them duplicate into hdr we're going to leave this on auto and that's going to flick through all our different profiles here today so that's going to be a staple that goes through another thing is too additional settings we want to make sure that hdmi deep color is turned on so we see here it's actually turned on by default here but you just go into this tab and make sure that is turned on instant game response this should be turned on by default as well you do want to make sure this is turned on too you also want to make sure you've got an hdmi 2.1 cable to get the most out of these oleds as well as an rtx 3000 card rx 6000 series graphics card or of course the new gen consoles now amd freesync premium this one here i turn this off because i'm on an nvidia rtx 3000 series card if you're on an rx 6000 series card i'd definitely turn this on that'll allow you to turn on freesync in the graphics card options but because we've got g-sync enabled because this is a g-sync compatible tv we can then go into our windows settings and enable g-sync on both full screen and windowed mode so they're the settings before we even get into it those three settings there i like to make sure they're correctly set up before we move into the actual fine tuning of the picture mode settings itself but once we've done all that let's go into game mode and we're going to start setting this up for competitive sps so that means we can see the shadows easily and we're going to contrast here and i'm going to set that to 90 and now we're going down to brightness here and i'd like to leave this on 50 and i'd like to leave this on 50 on pretty much every profile that we're touching here today reason being is because if you've got like say for instance you've got a jpeg image you drop this down to zero you drop this up to 100 you're heavily distorting the image 50 is going to leave the image alone in terms of distortion so this is not really an oled setting in terms of hardware it's more of a software change that's going to in my opinion degrade the picture so i like to leave this on 50 it's the default it's the middle ground it's essentially not doing anything at this setting which is what we want it to do just like sharpness here where i'm going to grab this and then drag it all the way to zero and if we drag it all the way to 50 we can see that it just brings out all the noise and it essentially sharpens the image in this case it's over sharpening the image now what a sharpening filter does if you guys edited edited videos before you edited a photo a sharpening filter will make a blurry object more easier to read whether it's text or an object or a human face in this case since we're the user and we're using the tv we would hope that the content that we're playing in the case of games or movies is already perfectly in focus to begin with or very much in focus now in the past i have made videos where a few of the clips have been out of focus you guys have definitely pointed me up in the comments and so if you saw that picture in that video you could then quickly just blast this to 50 and it'd be easier to see but for most other well pretty much all content out there you want to leave this to zero for what it's worth and this is going to be a setting that i'm going to be doing for pretty much every profile that we touch here these two are pretty much going to be the same across all the six different profiles that we're going through today now onto color this one is your saturation and i find the lg depending on how much you want your color to pop this one is going to be a gold mine of a setting where i'm going to put this for this competitive profile here at 65 and then we're going to go down and tin this is another one too i would leave tint alone because just like brightness it's really distorting the image whether you go left or right now let's go over now to advanced controls where here we're going to have a few different settings to play around with one of these is dynamic contrast and i like to push this on low because it brings out the shadows a little bit more and then i like to go to super resolution turn this to off because we're not upscaling anything i mean if you wanted to upscale you can also use dlss if you're on nvidia card amd have their own upscaling technology as well the fidelity fx stuff so we're going to leave this on low for dynamic contrast super resolution we're going to turn that off color gamut we are going to put this to wide now you may be wondering but i've been told to leave this on auto and that's true you should if you need color accuracy you should leave this on auto and let the tv or let the software tell the tv what color gamma to use but i like my colors one thing about me at tech city is if i'm using this whether it's playing games competitively or for a user experience i love color i'm a man that loves his saturation so i want to put this on wide and let lg give me a little bit more richness in my image so we're going to let that set to wide and then we're going to go to gamma very important for competitive gaming this one is the most important setting here for getting those details out now we drop this to 1.9 the gamut 1.9 we can see here it's pretty much brightened up everything highlights and also shadows have been brightened up and now all the other settings will pretty much make it a darker sort of look and when we're competitively gaming we want to see everything so putting this to 1.9 is a really good idea now for white balance we're going to go to color temperature now i'm going to do something a little bit controversial i'm going to put this to cool and the reason being is i think it works well with the next two points that we're going to do and that is we're not going to touch these other settings here this is really this starts to get into a more advanced picture where you it's good if you know what you're doing you can change the greens and blues and reds at two different methods or you can go to 10 point eye area 22 point and play around with that but i like to do something different with the reds and the greens i like to go to the color management system and then i like to focusing here on red i like to then go to saturation and give that a little bit more saturation so our reds and our greens our human eyes love reds and greens we see detail through it we're going to give them a little bit more saturation as well as a little bit more pop we're going to drop that to 10 luminance and give red extra 5 saturation now with green we're going to go down to green here and do the same thing we're going to give that a boost of 5 and we're going to give that a luminance of 10. and that's just going to give that us that little edge when we're competitively gaming and so that's the first profile done now for our gamemode user on 8bit in windows 10 and this is going to work for pretty much all those competitive titles out there csgo apex legends uh call of duty there's going to be a really good one for you now the next one we're going to do is my personal favorite period this is the one i use the most when i'm gaming and this is based off the baseline of the hdr effect this one's super easy to do but you may be wondering at first like okay what's happened here i don't really like this picture but we're going to make it so you really are loving this picture this one is just when you want to get immersed in games and since a lot of titles out there don't fully support hdr and this is the thing hdr hasn't really been properly like it's getting implemented it's getting it's getting a lot more support as time goes by but it hasn't been a lot of content still i guess is 8-bit and it's designed for 8-bit so this one here is going to be the 8-bit buster and it's going to be some of the most eye-watering picture you can get out of this thing so let's start off with contrast we're going to leave that at 100 brightness leave that at 20. oh sorry 50. sharpness we're going to drop that all the way down to zero then we're going to go through here color we're going to increase this now to 80. this is going up and this is really you can see here the colors are going to start really popping out but we're also going to do something else with the color temperature it's pretty much set all the way to warm all the way down so we're going to drop this back now to c2 and that's going to give us an absolutely gorgeous look but we're also still going to go through some of the advanced controls here because dynamic color we want to have that on high then we want to go to our color gamut and it's already set to wide so that's a bonus there that we've got but super resolution we can turn that to off and the final one is to go now back to the main menu here in the in the user profile and go down to picture options and then go to black level and we're going to put that on high so make sure that's set to high then go back and this profile is going to be an absolute winner it's what i play dota 2 with and i play dota 2 like kind of competitively in turbo mode and i just absolutely love playing dota 2 with this picture profile the greens the reds all the colors just pop so hard and now moving through the 8 bit profiles here this is going to be the last one for video editors and then this is going to segue or should i say way of the seg into the hdr profiles where we're going to sort of push this one it's going to be a little bit different in hdr mode because you actually lose some picture profiles when you switch it over to 10 bit but here it is right here this one's super easy if you want to get pretty much accurate colors out of the box with changing very little so what we're going to do is go to this isf expert and it's called bright room and then we're going to change this a little bit this one's actually pretty accurate out of the box but we can make it even more accurate i've actually calibrated this on the display beforehand just to test that this works as best as possible so drop the contrast to 80 here and then move along leave the brightness drop the sharpness down all the way again to zero we don't need that on and then we're going to go into advanced controls and we're going to make sure the color gamut is on auto so whatever software we're working with it's going to automatically make the colors as they should be so our previous two profiles were like yeah we love a bit of extra saturation we want lg to give me that will make my eyes water this is different we're getting probably a lot of people use this profile getting paid for work they need the things to be accurate and then they can go from there gamma leave this on 2.2 does a good job white balance this is another important point this is the last setting you need to change in this profile just go to color temperature and then put it on warm one and that's pretty much as color accurate as you can get at least according to my tests here for a profile without doing very little it's it's only minuscule and i'll show you guys before and after quickly on how minuscule the difference is once you do this between having it perfectly calibrated versus not so now we're going over to the hdr profile so so far we've got a competitive gaming profile we've got a color beautiful saturated tech yes profile and we've got a color editing profile a lot of people would just stop here but a big benefit of the oleds especially these new ones is that they can turn on hdr and that now gives them access to 10 bit rgb colors which if the software this is what i'm going to say this profile even me i don't use this a lot of the time because a lot of programs don't take advantage of it yet even though they might say hdr they actually don't take advantage of it and so when we do this we're also going to be the tv itself starts reacting and it's got different profiles now so we'll see that we've lost actually quite a few profiles here where as opposed to before we had a heap more so we now only got vivid standard and filmmaker pro in game cinema and cinema home for me now i'm going to focus on two of these profiles well actually three of these profiles first of all we're going to go with standard because we're going to go off the back of editing videos and if we've got a 10 bit picture or whatever we need to work with we can then edit this and make it proper so contrast we're going to change this in standard we're going to change this to 80 again magic number we're then going to go to sharpness get rid of this completely we're then going to go down all the way to color and again set that to 50 and that's going to drop just that artificial because we're editing videos in this mode at 10 bit we don't need any of that stuff now color temperature simple we just grab this and we drop it down to w7 in this mode here and that's what i've found to be pretty much similar as before but there are still a few little things we need to do dynamic contrast i'm going to turn that off and then we're going to leave dynamic tone mapping on dynamic color we'll turn that off as well and then we're going to go to color gamut and we're going to leave that on auto as well just like our standard profile we want to be having what the colors were intended if we're video editing now super resolution i like to turn this off and there we go we've got now ourselves a 10 bit photo and video editing profile for those video edited out there it's going to be relatively accurate it's going to be pretty accurate just like our previous isf profile was accurate so the next one is a simple one for hdr users people who want a clean hdr experience but don't want to change medics many settings at all contrast we can leave this at 100 because we're going to want in hdr mode to really pop everything and make it pop as hard as possible sharpness we can go drop this down to zero we don't need that sharpening just like we did on all the other profiles color let's give this a little bit of a boost to 65 then all we have to do outside of that is one more setting and that is dropping this here the dynamic contrast to high and i find this is going to give you a really nice experience when it comes to getting low input lag great hdr experience and also getting a really good picture now if you want to if you want to even go just even a little bit stupider you can change it to wide but i find the auto setting here already really stretches it out on hdr so i just like to leave that on auto anyway and this is just a simple one for those who want a great gaming experience on hdr and now we're at the grand finale where this one's going to work off the vivid profile so we've already set up our video editing profile on hdr we've got our game profile on hdr now it's time to get out sort of like this one's a little bit eye watering but at the same time i really like the blacks to be extremely dark a lot of the times so i'm going to go to vivid straight away this is our base profile contrast i'm going to leave that at 100 sharpness we're going to turn that all the way off again and then we're going to go down to color give this a nice boost to 75 and then we're going to go oh hey get back to 75. the tv can't keep up with me and we're going to go to color temperature here and just drop this down to c2 now there's one more important setting here and that is the black levels so this will be in uh picture options and we just go here to black level and we go to low and you see here that's really making the shadows a lot darker as opposed to order or high so this really makes that sort of like if you're say for instance you're playing metro exodus or something where there's a lot of dark scenes and dark areas and you want to get immersed in that feeling and this is this profile it's going to provide that it's going to give that real in my opinion sort of like immersive hdr experience and that's pretty much it for the tech yes profiles guys i'll put all the settings in the description below for you so it's easier for you just to follow on text but let's move over now to a quick conclusion and after all those profiles are set in you may be wondering well brian what do you use for movie watching and that's where i use the hdr effect and also as we set up that vivid profile in hdr mode itself i use those two profiles not just for immersive gaming over saturated but i love watching movies in those two profiles as well so hopefully this guide has helped you guys in setting up the oled and making it giving it a better experience now one thing i will say is the beauty about these monitors is there's so many settings you can change and if you like a particular setting don't be afraid to go with it these are just settings that i use and i've been absolutely loving oled and the reason why i'm making these videos and they may be a little bit from the norm here at techya city is because oled's finally that tech that i've been waiting for like it's over six years ago i made videos about blue light and how bad a lot of these blue leds that are going into monitors is not how bad that tech is for your eyes and it's finally years later where we've got this high refresh rate tech now with a technology that's not that expensive really when you look at oled compared to definitely other technologies like full rgb uh leds in the back of monitors this stuff is actually coming in with very good value for what it is 4k 120 hertz 10 bit and it's got that beautiful pixel backlighting that just gives you an absolutely gorgeous picture and it's good for your eyes and i can't help i can't stress that enough if you're using these computers for hours and hours on end every day you definitely want to be treating your eyes to i guess a better image quality than you'd get out of a older led technology technology so that's why i'm really excited about these and i'm happy to share my settings and hopefully i'd like to see oled come down in price as well and definitely when we can see some maybe 22 inch or 24 inch budget monitors that would be really cool to see out there in the market so hopefully some companies can get on that and even bringing oled to competitive gamers on 24-inch setups with even higher refresh rates or just regular i guess sitting on the desk in a small desk uh gamers as well that'd be really cool because you may notice here with the oleds i've set them up and they're pushed way back from my desk that's because if i had them any closer it just i couldn't function with a big monitor like that too close to me so i'll put the link in the description below for the oleds and also for the stands that i'm using to attach to those o-lands so about a hundred aussie dollars each for the stands and i've got two of them and i love having these pushed back to sort of make the size a little bit well the perceived size a little bit smaller than having it close up anyway guys if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below do you have any tips or tricks of your own in regards to oled or is there anything you wish to know about this beautiful panel technology and i'll get back to you as soon as i can and with that aside i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now [Music] bye [Music] you
