over the last few months i've been getting a couple of reports in about people claiming that the older versions of windows 10 say for instance what we've got here in our hand an install from 2016 gives you more fps on older hardware so we're talking like first gen i7 x58 x79 etc it gives you more fps in games than the 2020 install of windows 10. and so what i've noticed however when i've done comparisons over the years with the older hardware i've noticed it has kind of been getting gradually worse whether that be the graphics cards have just been getting better and giving more fps on the high end which i think going into this video is the most likely scenario but there is a possibility that certain updates could have an impact on performance with older hardware so what we're going to be doing here today is testing out this old x58 and the xeon x5675 one of my long time personal favorites and even though it doesn't have avx2 instructions and stuff like that it still is a hallmark especially here at tech yes city so we're going to be grabbing this old cpu motherboard combo and we're going to be comparing it against the 10 900k in a few games to see if the rumors are true let's get on with it today's video is brought to you by scd keys delivering you that retail single and user license key for only 12 bucks after you use the coupon code bftyc that's right this month only you can get a 30 discount using that coupon and link in the description below so we're now going into the night with this testing and a bit of an update we have finished successfully the numbers on the 2015 windows 10 install and we had to do this on a 6900 xt where i had to then extract the i got the drivers for review um pre-release and i've put them into a program called bandy zip and extracted just the drivers and i was able to manually install that in windows 10 the 2015 version and so that enabled us to then test some of the games here and so we do have some results that are ready to go we've got four different games here because unfortunately dx12 wouldn't work on the first edition of windows 10. so working around that we've got some numbers here you have to excuse my handwriting it's not the best but we're going to now test the 2020 version on this right here now some interesting uh differences already is that this edition here did not have any spectra or melt it's like when i open up inspector the options are just grayed out on this version of windows so it's pretty interesting and the 3080 i couldn't test with that because the new drive was impossible to get the new driver manually installed on this version of windows it just wouldn't work no matter what i would do and so i tried everything that's why it's going into the night the testing so we've got some results coming up now we're going to do round two of testing on the x58 and then report back [Music] so and here we are now at the finish line with some of the most tedious benchmarking i have done in that as we said before we couldn't get the 30 series to work on the 2015 install but we did get the 6900 xt to work but it did have its bugs and these bugs were very interesting for instance on the 10900k when we were doing the final testing i could only test for honor all the other games just wouldn't work on the 10900k system so i was able to still though get out results that showed us that it's not so much the hardware that it's at fault here and we're going to pull up some of the results here because these results show that we're outside margin of error for saying okay it's just margin of error brian depending on the benchmark run you do you're going to see results vary from benchmark run to benchmark and i'm going to say because we're using the same x58 setup on both windows installs there's pretty much no variance in clock speeds no variance in anything else but the os and so what we're seeing now in cs go and also for honor these were the two games that showed us a difference here where we went from on single thread performance when we disabled multi-core performance on the x58 system we saw that we went from 210 fps down to 192. now we were able to recuperate some of this loss and some of this difference by disabling the spectrum meltdown updates which is why i do recommend especially on the older hardware that you do disable these updates and even i disabled them on my 10 900k test rig now going over to uh f1 2020 showed us we again we did lose some fps going from this game so we did get a lot more fps however running this game on dx12 and then moving over to far cry new dawn we saw fps pretty much similar across all different uh testing scenarios 2015 versus 2020 versus 2020 with spectrum meltdown updates disabled and then moving over to the last game for honor which was the game that was most important for me because we did see roughly that 10 difference that we saw in cs go but also on the 10 900k we did see an improvement as well and we went from around 450 uh 8 fps here on average to 488 so we also gained 30 fps by going back to the original edition of windows 10 versus the latest edition and then with the 100k i just simply wasn't able to run the other three games on the 2015 edition it just kept crashing out i tried to run these games and they all just gave out errors i'm guessing that was to do with just the driver it just wasn't having it with the 6900 xt so there's the results what do these all mean if you're a gamer out there one thing that i'm going to look at is that i'm just going to say that over time there has been these slow i guess injections of i don't know whether it's telemetry or just crap that's getting baked into windows 10 that's giving a drop in performance and that's the only thing i can see because it's happening on the 10 900k as well so if it was a deliberate nerf on the x58 systems then it wouldn't be happening on the 10900k in for honor for example but it is happening and so it's happening on both the older hardware and the newer hardware but i think because the older hardware is not as fast in total system performance you're noticing it more on the older hardware another thing i will say is that the 6900 xt for example and the rtx 3080 they're massive leaps and bounds ahead from when years ago when we're testing the 1080 ti and we're testing that versus what was latest and greatest at the time the 8700k so things have changed definitely on both the cpu front in terms of more cores and in intel's case they've just gone over five gigahertz on their base speeds and then also on amd side you've got zen three you've got zen two they're bringing hard value for money they're also bringing performance gains of their own a while ago the linux vs windows 10 and in one of the games that we tested there there was a difference and that was in dota 2 i believe where it ran better on the linux based system than it did on the windows 10 base system so whatever's going on with windows 10 i would love to see them give gamers a just clean cut version with none of the crap another telemetry baked in but if microsoft were to do this they'd get a big kudos from me and i'm sure a lot of gamers would like to jump on this because it wouldn't just trickle down to games it would trickle down to things like streaming and recording but when i did record directly from the encoder we did get a drop on x58 but the funny thing was those drops were universal and they were right in line with the original results it was just a performance tip on both sides so in a nutshell we're going to sum things up on today's video and that is the first thing is to the guys out there who notice this stuff keep noticing this stuff i love doing these tests it's a lot of fun another thing is too it's these kinds of tests that keep the industry honest as well so when people pull you up and say oh it's all in your head and whatnot don't just ignore that because i mean in ways i've built a whole channel off doing these kinds of tests and proving people wrong and so this time around we were kind of proved that it was both sides were right no one was really wrong here it's just over time windows have added in all these features whether they're good or bad that has caused a consequence of that to drop fps and games for for people across all sorts of hardware and more importantly it's these kinds of conversations that help us just get a better understanding of what's going on especially when it comes to getting the best gaming performance so if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button actually don't just hit it smash that like button for us and with that aside let us know in the comment section below have you noticed any other differences any other weird things going on love reading those thoughts and opinions and can just be weird things in general doesn't have to just be to windows 10 i love reading those comments you know if you're at home and you're like brian um there's someone outside my window and he's holding a copy of linux just drop that drop that comment down below i would like to read the rest of the story but speaking of stories we got a email here that came in and it says hello how are you i've been watching your channel for a while pretty awesome i'm still using x58 rampage to extreme that's pretty much exactly what we used here in today's video awesome choice of motherboard but he wants to ask if it's compatible with the new and video graphics cards again very good channel good day so the x58 is going to be compatible with the new 30 series cards i would say like you've got to be careful here because the old stuff the used stuff and we'll sort of this question relates to the used stuff directly x58 it's amazing i love it but it's losing it's starting to lose its appeal as time goes on i mean some of the new stuff is getting very cheap now it's getting very competitive and the old six cores they lack the uh newer instruction sets they're even though they'll work in majority titles still you're going to be missing out in some cases on fps you're going to be missing out on the instruction sets and you're going to have a less efficient processor in general but that relates to mainly the biggest thing that is bothering me with the used market right now is the prices of used parts they're they're hideous to the point where i've honestly been starting to build new pcs and it's just a lot easier it's a lot less hassle there's and i'm finding too there's a lot more hosing going on in the use scene too but we will be making a dedicated video on a used market update because these aren't stories that are just coming from me they're coming from a lot of other people too and it's just trends that you notice that goes through the industry so so that's that question directly yes it's still compatible and the pcie x 16 pci 2.0 is even fine all the way up to the rtx 3090 in terms of gaining the max performance if you're playing at 4k for example though if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content you want to see the content as soon as it drops then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you in the next one
