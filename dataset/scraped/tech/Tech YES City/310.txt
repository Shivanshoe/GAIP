what's up guys it's ya boy recently there's this game that is
making a big buzz across the scene called
fall guys and we're going to build a pc for it and this is just not
any pc since this is a new game we're going to be using
a new case and our good friend on the gold coast kevin
he's been uh he got a container in now word on the street is like
damn man kev he got a container in full cases and all this other stuff
and everyone's been buying up these infinity mirror
game max cases and i thought well you know one thing if you can't beat them
join them so we got this case for 115 aussie dollars and in the u.s you can
actually get it for i think 90 usd so it's not that bad priced considering
it's got this rgb mirror effect on the front of the pc
though that aside we've got the other components here of course a used
banger we're going to be putting this pc together for as cheap as possible
and when we look at the specs that's required for this game it really is
ambiguous because this whole like steam requirements just says you
need a two gigabyte gtx 660 or an i5 or better now if we look at an
i5 do they mean like an i5 650 because
that's a really really bad cpu if you put that in you'll
probably be getting some big stuttering and stuff like that
anyhow we're going to be putting in an x5670 which is a six core 12 threaded
xeon and these go for around 15 bucks readily
available on good old aliexpress the other good
news is i paid 100 aussie dollars for my x58 motherboard
and 12 gigabytes of ram but even then you can get x58 boards on aliexpress
that are really cheap as well as ecc registered ddr3 memory so you can pretty
much get the same configurations as i'm doing here
for pretty similar prices now let's take a look at all those prices and then
build this thing and see how it looks and of course how it
performs if you want to cop yourself a legit windows 10 pro oem
license and today's video sponsor scd keys
has you covered for as little as 15 bucks
using the coupon code tyc you can get yourself one of these keys
instantly delivered and they've even got paypal links in description below [Music] so [Music] so here's our infinity mirror build aka
the game max abyss finished in all its glory and i gotta
say it is a definitely a different look to all the other cases out there at the
moment for the price it's not too shabby i mean
it was very easy to build in but we've got to now download
our four guys game which is only around four gigabytes so
it's very quick to download unlike call of duty warzone for example
which is around 250 gigabytes nowadays so
very uh quick to download this game we should be up and running in no time but
i still do want to install call of duty warzone
for you guys because i want to see how it runs and that's one of the most
important games when you're trying to flip a pc
after you're done with it however that being said i'm going to run two sets of
benchmarks here today one which is stock so if you're buying
say an aliexpress motherboard you generally don't have overclocking on
a lot of those boards so this numbers that i'm running for you give
you an idea of the performance you'll get
with this setup so if you do come into an x58 board like the one we're using
here today the gigabyte then you can see how much extra
performance you can extract out of this thing
though let's jump into those games [Applause]
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Music] so
[Music] problems problems and more problems but
we'll start off with the good stuff first because the problem list in
today's video is both software and hardware based but
anyway four guys if you guys want to run this game the good news is
is it'll run on a potato like that i5 650 joke that we made in the intro
might just be fine for this game i'm guessing an i5 750 would run
absolutely fine and a gtx 750 or maybe a 7850
from way back in the day will be fine for getting smooth
60 fps with this game now the thing is it looks like four guys is hard capped
at 60 fps even with vsync off i tried changing some settings
but that's the max fps i can get out of it so it doesn't really matter if you
overclock your system or not you're pretty much bound to 60 fps
however fps aside this game is quite a bit of fun you go through
round robins and then basically it averages out that
if you're good at this game you're gonna get through and win uh me
playing for the first time i was really just kind of getting used to it i
didn't know what to do especially in some of the events but
that being said i did get the hang of it and i started making it through and
progressing a little bit though this is where the problems start
to creep in for four guys and that is the server issue
so i'm based in australia and on my ip address
from australia i could not play this game it just would not let me
get into a match lobby and meet up with 59 other contestants
where there's 60 for starting out and then i decided to go into steam change
the server download server to new york in america
that didn't work and i was waiting for like a good two
hours just trying to get a game and i just bought this game then i
thought well i spoke to some people on the
discord they said there's only servers in europe and us at the moment and i'm
thinking to myself well what's the chances i log on to a vpn
in the us and then it starts matching me up to a lobby
and so i went on a vpn and based myself in seattle
and then lo and behold i was now matchmaking pretty much instantly so
this presents in my opinion a pretty big problem
that's if they are blocking out ips in australia at the moment because
they're selling the game in australia so if you're gonna block my ip from
australia from playing the game why are you selling this game to me it's
a pretty pretty big issue where i'm thinking about getting a
refund because me going to a vpn in seattle
that's giving me a lot of like lag in the process of making the game
not as enjoyable as it should be so there's the big problem with fall guys
at the moment i know they'll fix the servers in time but
being transparent about this thing is much better than me finding out that i
can log into a vpn and then play the game
internationally i think that i mean i don't even know like
might even be borderline legal in australia to do that or anti-consumer i
mean to the makers of fall guys i would encourage you guys to fix this or at
least stop selling the game in australia if we can't play it you're probably
thinking well what's the reason for them to block
out the ip in australia and that's just simply bandwidth
international bandwidth costs a lot more than local bandwidth
anyway moving on to call of duty warzone this is a game that i pretty much
benchmark a lot now the reason being of course when you go to flip a pc
a lot of people want to know can it play call of duty warzone and
i'm happy to say that it does play it at 75 average fps on low settings
at 1080p with 100 screen resolution the 10.1
lows were also really well controlled and then overclocking the gpu
i managed to squeeze out an extra average 4fps
with 10.1 lows also being pretty much the same
and this was with the cpu running at pretty much 3.1 gigahertz on all cores
or threads so the x 5670 is pretty good to go even
if you go on aliexpress and get a cheaper one and z motherboard
you should be having no problems whatsoever
power consumption of this build wasn't too shabby either using around 230 watts
with the gpu overclock really not making that much of a difference
and then about 110 watts on idle though here's where the second problem of this
build and today's video comes into play and that is the gigabyte
x58 usb 3 motherboard it just would not accept an overclock and i've seen this
once with a gigabyte well i actually seen it a couple times on different
gigabyte motherboards where they just refuse to lock in
overclocks and then basically as i'm booting up the pc i'll
get this recovering lost dram error and the pc then just pretty much only
seems to want to work on default settings so i tried updating
the bios that didn't work the only thing after that is to change
ram models and the most important part with this motherboard and the problems
like this i've been down this road before
you can spend a whole day and still end up at the same result that we've got
here today and you've wasted all that time and had
all that frustration put on yourself needlessly this pc as it stands it's
working absolutely fine the temperatures are pretty good
especially on the cpu side with that big cooler and the zip tied fan
and the gpu temperatures were going around 70 degrees both out of the box
and on the overclocks so in the end with this pc things ended up working out okay
and the infinity mirror case do let us know in the comments section below
what you think of this case do you think it's good for the money
i'm personally it's one of those things that pops up and you're like wow this
looks good but i think i still prefer the bright
ring led fans they are they're going to be
hard to beat i mean the infinity mirror is all nice and all that but
it kind of gives off this like i don't know it's like
you're mixing makeup and pc cases together it's kind of like some makeup
brand has decided to make a pc case that's how
i feel about it even though even though this case feels
of pretty good quality i've tried some other game max cases and
they're kind of hit or miss this one is pretty good the sata
connection at the back that connects to the rgb board
that is a real big mystery you are literally just plugging in a sata cable
to a pcb board and the weirdest thing is you can plug it in both ways and it
works fine mind blown and with all that out of the
way if you guys enjoyed today's full guys gaming pc
then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comment
section below what you think of the game what you
think of the build love reading your thoughts and opinions as always
just like this question of the day here which comes from james t well it's
actually not a question but it's a pretty important thing which
i don't kind of don't want to make a video on because
sort of a lot of people don't really care too much but a lot of you guys do
care but anyway it goes along the lines like this brian
facebook recently implemented an ad review system and i've been getting
flagged a lot for selling gaming hp dell oems could
you look into this as it's been quite frustrating
having my ads taken down with no explanation the only thing i can
think of lately there seems to be this rumor
going around facebook marketplace that if you use the same picture
on different ads it will automatically take it down because essentially it
thinks you're spamming the system so my recommendation would be uh take
different photos for different ads every ad here on in
try make a unique photo and you can even try using a different background
and see if that helps another thing as well if your account has been flagged
you may have to give your account a cooldown
i have experienced this in the past where i was doing a stupid listing
and i realized after the fact that i'd made a lot of mistakes anyway i'll put a
video up here for you guys if you want to check that out
and with all that aside if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech
yes content and you want to see the moment it drops
sub buttons down there ring that bell and i'll catch you on another tech video
very soon peace out for now [Music]
bye [Music]
