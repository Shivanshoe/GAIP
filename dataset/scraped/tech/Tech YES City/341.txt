just tell me if it's live too so tell me if everything's live you want to tell me if everything's live when we go live I don't know if we go on laughs hey guys I think we should be live hey I think uh since I'm waiting okay I did hit live so if it hasn't gone live there yeah now you Chi okay so we're all live welcome back to tech something I am joined by my man the one the only Greg yes Azhar how you doing Greg God I am super stretched out I just know okay yeah so you've got a big stretched head that is what that's it that's how you get it to stress we got a Corsair sponsoring with the lovely virtuoso headset you want to show that stretched out logo and we haven't strained for a long time so I saw a guys it's been literally the busiest month and I do say this in the past like there's months the busiest month but this month I've been sent over like 15 motherboards it's it's just like what is with this motherboard craze right now are they not like are they not selling motherboards that's probably what it is [Laughter] is that all of this actually it looks like consumer spending on them on the like computer side of things has gone up I know a lot of vendors have told me internally that like they're selling things faster than they ever have before despite people being furloughed etc yeah well yeah that's I can only like this is the thing people will I dude you've got to make an update video about predictions and prices and stuff so I it's going to be a little bit bias if I do that now because might like countries have all different types of lockdowns there's different channels opening up between different countries so it's actually gonna get very messy I think that's that's the prediction going in for the market of course I think it the prices are gonna be a lot better than what you saw a month two months ago I think that's gonna be a given supply is gonna ease up a bit because there was massive rush there's also gonna be a massive like I'm seeing a trend as well where we've got a heap of used PCs coming on the market so I think people who wanted to get into PC gaming on the cheap got in during covert and then after that they started armed they want to upgrade their PC so that's what's going man I said that word I hope I don't get G monetized a yeah I hope hopefully by now so what we so what we're seeing is a lot of people got a taste for PC gaming and now I think they're gonna want to upgrade as well so we've also got chat up as well so I will have to monitor that soon but we've got some juicy stories here today we've got the RT X 30 80 30 90 everybody's talking about this man it's like have you been seeing the news coming out with this yeah 30 80 the 30 90 kind of being one of those like ghost rumor things I mean who knows what was it was it a benchmark that popped up just like a mysterious benchmark for the 30 90 that's got people going crazy I guess it's uh it's looking good like I want performance gains end of story yeah I want more performance and I want it now and I think a lot of people do I think a lot of tech enthusiasts just want to be excited they want something new especially on the GPU market because yeah now we're going back we're cookie cutting v4 haswell's and like you know you want that new performance where you're like okay a new CPU is or justified now because it's gonna give me much more FPS whatever if they make game engines with much more physics and they deliberately bang all those physics on the CPU then hey they can sell some more CPUs I don't know but the market is just crazy right now it is a crazy market crazy times we're also gonna be talking about be 550 versus be 450 this is uh I see a lot of arguments about this it's pretty like for me I've got the answers right here will show you on livestream what you're looking at you can even just see it quickly there but let's quickly roll these sponsors before we move on with this show we've got the course of virtuoso go grab yourself one of the best headsets I do like to keep mine wire just because the voice quality I think it sounds better when you got it wired it is a good wireless headset though if you want to do work around your place and it's it's it's a bit expensive gotta be honest bit expensive but it's my favourite headset in terms of utility mainly because it's a mic and so the sound quality is good it's not gonna be like thousand dollar headphone sound quality but it's a solid pair of headphones the sound quality is good the mic especially is the biggest selling point of this headset then we've got SCT Keys coming in with the clutch here they got 18 percent off Windows 10 Pro keys make sure you use that coupon TYC and you don't use graphics like coupon code not Gregg's and you get a nice dish yeah I just dumped dumped on your life just got dumped on life that's right so I'm tech yeah city to chef with that aside guys links for those two in description let's get into the first topic here RTX 3000 and what we're looking at here is apparently twelve gigabytes of gddr5 over to the big screen now cuz people want to see that people want to see the news in the big screen then they can see you I think you're not stretched in this view I think you'll be like normal size now yes I'm bringing I'm bringing you back to reality so he had a bit of a stretch yet is might show time now that time is over unfortunately so we got GDR 6x this is the big one I think a lot of performance gains are going to be had off this alone that's the that's the truth there so a lot of its gonna be had off this massive memory performance but we're also seeing an increase in CUDA core performance as well that's not critical performance story we don't know the CUDA core performance / critical but we're gonna see more CUDA cores over 5,000 I mean I'm hoping about that that reference cooler what do you think about that okay that's actually a big big big topic of is the reference cooler and the different design I mean I think there's too much evidence for it to be a high possibility that that is what it is okay like it does look weird doesn't it like my first reaction was it looks weird now when the r-tx founders came out people were dumping on that saying it looked like a toaster but I looked at I was like damn that looks good you know my gut reaction was in the right setting it could look good my question is the performance of that like a single fan in what does not look to be a blower style configuration is not I mean I just don't see that holding up to a car that supposedly you know maybe more efficient but at the end of the day 1.5 X more powerful or what have you it's still gonna pull a ton of power from the wall and run fairly hot so how they doing that I mean what I was gonna finish saying was I liked the 2000 founders my gut reaction I don't really like this like I just think it's so weird like it's it's not like I'm used to seeing two fans on the bottom that's it and I don't know if I'm ready for change you know what I mean it's like all the sudden you've got this new processor in the game and people are like dude I prefer my AMD CPU I prefer my Intel CPU and then suddenly got this new player and they gave me like well how do we take this so this is what this this kind of design is its new I'd have to see it in the flesh before I make a call on whether I actually like it or not and see how performs but it's definitely Nvidia or definitely taking things to the next level with this design like they they're doing something different I like that but at the same time it's sort of like do they sort of I don't know I'd love it if they sort of had this closed group of youtubers or whatever me they say they say hey here's the design you can we'll send you over a cooler and we signed an NDA or whatever and we just check it out we're like no you got to change it in the chat that it has to fan where's the second fan is it just it's on the back it's on the back on the back yeah yeah so basically I only saw this chord this picture one time I they're saying I didn't do my homework I haven't I don't dig enough rumors I wait for official announcements okay I'm learning this literally right now um so it's on the back of the card and it's using like yeah so good so if you see my mouse that fan is on the back but what doesn't make any chances if that's the case why is this not ventilated on the front you know what I mean like it doesn't make like it's gonna be a weird reference design where airs gonna be blowing back in your case you know what I mean like it it's sort of like to me it might be in video just trolling the world I don't know cuz it just seems so ever designed it I mean they're getting paid big bucks to design whatever they're designing so I'm sure it's functional I just wonder how effective it is with respect to previous generations of reference cards especially the architects 20 series cards right because those are more those look kind of like aib coolers in a sense like they're using a traditional dual fan kind of open heatsink design whereas previous generations have have been for the most part blower style yeah I wonder how that'll fare I mean especially with the card being more powerful we're assuming it's gonna also again pull more power that's assuming it's real that's assuming it's real so like I mean the PCBs are meant to be like smaller so think of maybe 50 rx 470 reference right there block the cooler goes over and the PCB is actually quite small that's kind of the same design so they've got much more power efficiency off there no drink they've got they're using much more higher speed memory which is apparently is where a lot of the power consumption is coming from and yeah that's that with that they're able to design a smaller PCB and go with this radical design so I mean I take it as it is I think the performance though is the biggest thing for me I'm not like coolers are coolers right AI bees are gonna get that stuff if the reference coolers not good the AI bees will do a good job of rectifying that problem so either way you're gonna win with cooler designs just like AMD like I mean I actually kind of liked AMD's reference design on the 5700 XT like Loki I thought it was cool I'd it looks good in certain settings yeah you know cards that have these wacky designs kind of the same way they only look good in certain cases certain aesthetics may be complementary CPU air-cool or something like that yeah yeah I think I think that the AMD reference cards look would look really good in like really compact cases you know like where it's just the card in one compartment and that's all you see like that would that I could deal with but if it's in like a mid Tower and it's just kind of blocky there's really nothing there I mean some people might really like that I like something a little more flamboyant oh oh okay is there something else you know there's like a modest Beauty card like I would say an asus strix court is a very beautiful elegant car but it's nothing like bizarre like I've seen it's a freaking crazy bizarre power color hey I like you know coolers before I'm just like who like who in their right mind this is this something you're not telling us in the viewers about the new intern Nate wait boy there's something you're not telling me about that then you in turn eight you know this situation never mind never mind just staring the flood they don't just stare right so Greg wants a more flamboyant design guys okay quick into it let's get back don't worry I got you all let you publicize I mean I do they could be a lovely guy I've met him I I don't know here's the big I without using the word flamboyant again for I don't want to be categorized here there are different takes on aesthetic and I don't really think have much of a difference in the way of performance but you could go with something super simplistic like a reference 5700 XT or something bizarrely crazy like a gigabyte horas Xtreme one of those cars has like a single LED on one fan blade and it does all these crazy like you could go that far or you could find a happy medium I think a happy medium is something like an Acer Strix card that's or an EVGA one of the XE cards I like those models as well so I mean we got video cards up here next and they're saying the r-tx 3080 is going to have around about the same cuda cores as the 2080 TI and then the 39 it's gonna have that big jump and they've sort of come out like video cards are pretty reliable with leaks I'm gonna say that like a lot of the leaks I look at on their site are pretty concrete man like so yeah they pulled up the front of their marketing campaigns I think they purposefully leaked stuff just just to build hype you know and and and steer viewers the potential audience away from other news from competitors you know a family I have seen behind the scenes dude at at some events like the companies do hate leaks they do hate it and there's always that guy who's so excited to I guess he knows that he's the reason for that leak so here's the guy that'll last off and but at the same time like you have to you have to hate it publicly like you have to well if you don't hate it publicly then it comes across as intentional and if it's intentional it's not a leak it's it's it's you're purposefully disclosing information that's not I mention legally if they got caught doing that manatee could be big ramifications and like stock price you know they're gonna say this stuff I mean you don't even have to know the consumer doesn't have to know that there's an NDA and they could just say hey I'm gonna give this to somebody and call it a li call it whatever you want you know yeah at the end of the day holidays anyway so we got here much higher memory speeds 21 gigabits per second that is extremely fast and then we've also got 19 gig at 18 or 19 or 18 that remains to be seen on the 30 80 so that's some really that's the big bump up in memory speeds even on the standard G DDR 6 right the 20 atti and stuff like that they were using G DDR 6 but I think it was a fourteen or sixteen gigabits per second he was 14 I'm allergic or 2080 I was it 16 or 14 gigabits per second 2080 ti6 16 14 I'm 44 yeah that's that's a massive boost even with the 30 80 versus the 20 atti right so that's a huge boost so yeah you're getting a big what was that card memory but I mean to what extent was it already memory bound I know that but it's like if you look at CPUs as well symbol its symbol are not the same of course but the higher you bother you and assume they scale on yeah they they just they just things just get faster anyway so you're going to gain more force we saw this with the 2016 50 super especially right that gained some huge performance I mean it might have been memory bound but it you do gain more performance by upping the memory speeds of course it gets to a point where the memory just can't go any faster and it'll crash so if you can get the extra speeds out of it you should and that's what they're doing here and then with the CUDA core performance are they just going with what would be just a refresh drop down to seven nanometer that remains to be seen or are they actually given us a completely different from the core up architectural design so I kind of think what it looks like is just much faster memory and then stuff shrunk down to say I don't know we gotta wait for it right and we'll say five thousand three hundred and seventy six suppose at CUDA cores and this next gen Titan yeah if you kept the same the same fab like the the same I guess precision rocket X node yeah that die would be freaking huge okay normos and at that point I don't think it cooler like the one they've designed would be effective enough at least assuming that it that's a 39 tia that we're looking at and that's gonna be somewhat similar to a titan i don't think that the rumors about it being a dual GPU core or true just because of the nature of scaling it just doesn't seem that they're talking about they're talking about a coprocessor so it's yeah like a chip low type thing it's like yeah okay so it's just something for you know processing AI stuff like that and yeah so I mean from apparently it's gonna have a lot better r-tx performance which is good right that that is something they need to improve on and then they can finally start to get the r-tx drive properly going even though it's been a long like RTX was basically yeah as they said back in 2018 you're investing in the technology when you bought an ITX card back then you were investing in nvidia to say hey here's here's your R&D money go and develop this and I'll take the hit so think I mean the consumer pays for it they always do so yeah I don't know anyway that's that if you guys let us know in the comments what you think about our TX 30 90 30 80 I'm personally I'm pumped it's just something new I want to see something new out so we can yeah just have a new market you use comparisons versus you all this all this goodness that's gonna come out of this now AMD's answer its kind of this is just flooding my ain't like people asking about 3000 series so we'll talk it may be next stream will talk about AMD solution answer for that so but what it sees what it seems like is I've heard rumors ever coming out around August September so I think it'll be announced in August come out September I think maybe that's the that's the gist of it either hello yeah I'm just this is the first time I've seen this stuff so it's kind of read into it okay so what do you want what do you want do you want B 450 versus B 550 or do you want the exit okay let's let's talk about this okay so the great debate here B 450 versus B 550 the only I cannot I've asked around to every single motherboard manufacturer I'm like can you give us the licensing costs right Intel put it up on their website Z 490 50 bucks and there's B 460 $26 or $28 and then H 410 26 bucks they just they they'd leave that out that's out there in the wild that's your license costs right your chipset license costs AMD how keeping this stuff so harsh harsh it's so secret and I cannot extract the information out of anyone I would love this to be leaked so if somebody knows these licensing costs that would be great then you know as a consumer where the value is for your features right what are you paying for in a chipset license term and are you getting that value worth but what we can see here is be 550 in Australia right so this is the MSRP one hundred and $69 Aussie versus a hundred and thirty-nine Aussie so we're paying an extra thirty Aussie dollars for essentially be 550 it pretty much the exact same boardshorts got a slightly different design different heatsink but what it's worth it looks like you're paying an extra 15 to 20 USD more just for B 550 just to say hey I've got PC a 4.0 from my cpu essentially they're the same board but you've got now PCA for unlocked from the CPU and you charge it in you being charged 15 bucks for that or 20 but is that worth it do you think it's worth it I'm out I'm gonna ask you the question do you think that's worth it well in my video I basically justify be 550 only for people who are I all answers simply I don't think it's worth it because of the nature of the b-series chipset if you're already on B if you're already considering a B Series board you're probably budget conscious buyer and you're probably gonna pair it with something like a $200 Rison v 3600 whatever comes out next 3600 XT or what-have-you if you consider the price of the CPU to around 200 bucks for a board like that then to opt into the Gen 4 ecosystem and to use a Gen 4 drive which would inevitably cost over 100 well over $100 at this point it just doesn't make sense for someone in that tight of a budget to allocate a solid chunk of it for 5,000 megabytes per second of you know sequential versus 3,000 you know like they're both bloody fast and you're probably not gonna tell the difference in real-world testing anyway we will use I should say so why waste the extra 30 box quote-unquote waste for the faster speeds that you likely won't notice or benefit from in the real world you could buy a better CPU cooler with that 20 or 30 bucks you could buy a arguably better graphics card especially in the used market a better case better power supply more reliable power supply now also on that note it's cuz we're getting the higher and b5 50s n look that they are pretty decent some of the higher end be 550 green I'll give them I'll give them the point of approval right you but even then we don't know how much money we're saving versus X 570 because no one knows the chipset license costs so it's like I mean you do get more features still on X 570 with PCA you for so at the moment it's kind of like I want to know this information but at the same time I know for a fact a 320 is currently the best value in terms of just pure you're paying AMD the least amount of money for a chipset license and that's why I've been kind of a semi endorser of a 320 providing you picked the right 3 a 320 for the job so if you've you know the budget gigabyte nazarov once they do handle the risin 5 3600 fine now if you go buy that use a stock cooler go buy the 3600 you've got yourself essentially the best bare-bones value on AMD side of the fence providing you don't want to overclock but even then you can lock in your XMP profiles absolutely fine so it's kind of weighted one with a 39 yeah it with slightly questionable power delivery definitely wasn't hitting peak frequency of it okay I'm actually hosting work see a 520 I'm hoping something cool comes out of that because let's be honest like overclocking on AMD side isn't that great because of how good precision boost is right yes a lot of people I just tell a lot of people they're building you pcs I might do don't even bother like you know how do I overclock I'm like it's gonna take me this long to explain it to you now you can just put the CPU in lock-in XMP profiles and you've got 98% of the performance already this is especially the case with Zen plus chips because they they were a little more voltage tolerable like you could get them most of the time above 4.2 4.3 but past that you get a wall and a single core with XFR 2 is already boosting to 4.3 4.4 and a lot of games in split-second intervals are gonna leverage one or two cores at the most now you'll at one time probably see six or 12 threads pegged around 7080 percent utilization sure but at the end of the day I'd rather have one or two cores boost higher by a couple hundred megahertz then have an all core Manuel overclock that's only hitting 4.2 or 4.3 when I could get 4.5 from one or two cores like I'd prefer higher single core scores just for most things you know the difference in frame rates is not going to be anything substantial but when I'm doing daily tasks scrolling things like that anything that's single core oriented I want that extra boost it's just nice to have so you don't prefer high voltage I don't really care either way I'm not really voltage sensitive I know there are limits I never go above one point I wasn't asked I wasn't asking about the AMD chips I was asking about your personal life you don't like being high voltage you know you pump your your own adrenaline you're excited to get the job done you know yeah yeah yeah you high volt you don't like being high voltage okay alright well Greg Greg's missing the jokes today man that's a second I've never heard like someone refer to somebody else's I mean I don't know I've been out on the building site and you know in Queensland it's like yo pick it up get a swearwords I mean anyway all right so we got next up here from the beautiful dear dr. Ian cut hrus he's telling us about the Rison 3000 XT CPUs Zen 2 with more megahertz so we can't talk about anything like in terms of personals we can talk about the news right up here so what's on this slide so what do you think what do you think about the 3900 XT okay so that's it that's an extra hundred megahertz right the argument here is that AMD is doing what Intel's doing in the sense that Intel is just rehashing the same architecture giving it small base and boost frequency bumps and calling it a new chip right a new generation whatever I don't really see a problem with this only because they're not charging more for the new XT versions variants of these chips like they're the same price like the 3600 X is the same prices of 3600 XT Oh supposedly I don't expect there to be huge inventory you know bottlenecks with these chips at launch especially the lower end ones the 3900 X okay maybe just going off of precedent but the 3600 xt especially i don't think there's gonna be a huge deficit there granted you know then you could argue okay well i can overclock the 3600 to 4.4 or 4.5 I can already hit that frequency and I'm saving 50 bucks okay I totally get that and if that's you know if that's your argument I really can't say anything to it but with respect to the whole Intel verse AMD thing how they're trying to follow Intel stuff I don't agree with that just because of the price not you know they could charge more but they're not they're choosing not to you so do you think these will be out of take high voltage how much more overclocking Headroom do you think these chips are gonna have I mean no idea I mean I've heard rumors already about 2020 3,600 going bit higher like they're better in terms of efficiency a little bit yeah better bin so what you're getting here is essentially a 2020 made rise and yes rising 9 rise 5 so it's nothing like super I think AMD are getting on to the the trend that you just keep releasing something every few months to keep your brand name in the press honestly that's how I'm looking at it it's just like because I'm saying like be 550 was not that exciting but because I'm pretty sure I a lot of tech reviewers are just getting set flooded be 550 s we got to do we got to do videos on it so it's like seeing all this be 550 discussion and this is the same thing you know these CPUs straight after a little trickle out oh it's the new 3900 x10 people but of course people gonna be curious because they're you know people buying tech all the time so it's like they want to know what's the best and how does it differ and I'll probably just be yeah I'll probably just I can't say what I'm like yeah I can't really talk about what's going on anyway I was gonna like Robin said that they don't ship with coolers does she does pretty sure yes I didn't stop there mean on the next and that is something I I got the Box here but I haven't even opened it yet I try to get through the but I can't I think it is okay to say that the 3600 XT does come with a cooler if it doesn't then there's just a big box with nothing in it except the CPU but it's the kind of box you would expect the cooler to be in 3800 X to the 3900 X are the skinnier boxes that's so no Mohammed rate a good point he makes a good point and that's something - you're not getting a cooler this time that's what I'm here 3800 X came with one didn't it the 3900 X came with one yes came with the right prism the the 3700 X came with one that was a race button that's why I like the 3700 X the best because it came with that Wraith prism it was eight core 16 threads it was a really good buy and then that got sold out.i there's all this stuff and then 3600 was really good performance as well so the whole lineup by AMD did a really good job with the 3000 series you know and then the one thing I was disappointed about was 3500 X getting blasted off I'll expressed that was that was such a cool CPU like I really did like it now I miss it you know a lot of people would message me they're like dude I missed the 30 it was like a hundred ten bucks shipped man us like and you yeah you bang that on an a320 and you've just got really good gaming performance it was just geared up towards gamers and there is something I've noticed with war zone especially Call of Duty and that is the fall cause they do struggle little bit with those points there oh yes have you noticed yeah I was gonna ask you it's the 3,500 X that's the four that's four cores eight threads not six calls 6 threads but it's got big a cache let's go ok kind of like your 4 cores are in that group of little daddies six core just makes it into the Big Daddy category so do like yeah I would say that's yeah that's really good for over just over 100 bucks if that's what you were getting them for yeah yeah yeah so you're getting but you're getting a slice of Big Daddy for cheap and you know like with your four cores you're still in that little year that you're at the top end of little daddy category so I mean yeah do you want basically yes until I 5 $400 off we could talk about i3 i5 I mean they I think 3000 series 3,300 X kind of stole the show with the the i3 10 100 by Conde I think I think that it's it's the motherboard selection I mean it's always been Intel's problem with the lower end trips especially in the beginning yeah CPUs first launch but it's you know the the motherboard proliferation on AMD side it's just it's so much healthier now granted at this current moment finding anything be 454 in X 470 even X 570 to an extent pretty difficult and it's just a it's a result of everything going on in the world right now but it's it's way easier to enter the a.m. for ecosystem because so many more boards exist and there are so many different price ranges to choose from if you want this but you don't want this well we have this for you at this price but if you want extra we got this at this price like it's a smorgasbord it's like a buffet that's good at sports oice for the consumer who doesn't like a buffet ah dude speaking of that we dude that's that's banned in Australia now speaking of buffets that's like the saddest news at the moment yeah and straight so I don't know I mean I can see why okay so where we're heading over to chat now guys that is about the topics done if you guys want to know more we can talk about it in chat as well and we'll go over to some questions talk with the audience me and Greg will also be bouncing off one another I am however I won't be flamboyant about it so I love it I love see this on me I love Morty it's me I love this chat they know like they know I could go to a limit Ryan that limit yeah I like to push that bounce of that limit you know so much you can do on YouTube Ryan spensive you like ability and stuff like that so yeah we keep it PG but we keep it you know a cool PG smooth the fact that we didn't get to go to Taiwan this year man like we missed out on our chances to dig some sushi and have a couple laughs you know like we usually do really yeah yeah yes that's um that's sad like Computex was completely cancelled if you guys didn't know I I was that's my favorite event of the whole year like we go to these events and I've been turning down other events just because they're so tedious to go to you got to go on 16 hours on a plane and then stay one night and then get busted about releasing your video 30 minutes early because you were told you could release it early once they stopped talking about it and then you got a mess like yeah anyway I'm not this is so many like there's some some of the events just really sort of grind my gears that's why I don't think I don't like about copy text is the plane right like the total travel time from office I one more game is about 28 hours yeah and then the heat I mean like Taiwan is basically just like Florida weather and like when I travel I'd like to not experience the same stuff yeah so I feel like I'm just at Florida and like I just flew all that way for no reason at all except for big buildings and a different culture oh it's yeah I love it it's beautiful city beautiful country and it does suck that we can't go so it's yeah well core tight Taiwan the best thing about it is I will last thing we'll talk about what tight Computex you go there and you've just got free rein it's like you're in this tech heaven and you got all your friends there the parties are amazing he's just such a cool atmosphere you you just go to a booth and you're like alright I'm gonna release this video whenever I want I got freedom like as opposed to go into these press events you know you control you under an NDA and all this company just just free reign I like that so I like such a cool event and then you meet up with people who are there who are tech enthusiasts if they watch your channel they go there they love it you have dinner with them it's just such a cool cool sushi express yeah oh yes she's fresh oh man we're looking forward to that one oh yay we did we did do some stupid stuff at the sushi listen man your brother - your brother was egging it on so hard like his brother was like right do it more do it more do it more and I've had like at this time I have had some beverages so I'm sort of like yeah I'm like yeah let's do it anyway and people dude it's fighting you have funny thing about sushi Express was everyone in the sushi Express was laughing it was good vibes okay so we'll go over to questions right Luke Thomas says I have a rise in five twenty six hundred twenty four hundred megahertz of rent ooh okay you gotta get now you could I was thinking of selling the RAM to move to thirty two hundred megahertz it will cost me around eighty Aussie dollars do you think it's worth it I get the most out of your two thousand four hundred megahertz the easiest way to do this is to just look up and find a profile online for three thousand XMP just copy paste all those settings in 1.3 five volt and your twenty four hundred megahertz might do it if not drop it down to say twenty eight hundred megahertz and then yeah and then I say well if you just copy a three thousand XMP profile right you should be able to get that on most memory if not you should be able to get maybe twenty nine thirty three or twenty eight hundred so spend a little bit of time with it and you might because if you're asking right if you're asking then the value is a conscious decision he's asking is it worth the $80.00 so obviously that eighty dollars means something like it's a big decision so I would just try tuning what you've got and in the process you're gonna learn to overclock memory and and it's a good thing so I would recommend doing it especially fast-track memory overclocking that's what I do I'm not a big fan of like spending a day trying to get this max out of my memory I've always been about that fast track memory OC so arm that questions are moving quick okay so take a city what would be your baseline build like all of the big money components but what were your best bang for buck for 1080p 60 Hertz gaming which includes about 90% of users is this for used or new if we're going with new I would go new with 90 P 60 is easy that's like that's okay I would I would honestly say if you're going new right you've got six like in Australia right this is the thing 1650 super is actually good value it can be had for really good prices on sales so I'd be like 1650 super budget power supply and a risin 330 100 and this is where I'd recommend the 3100 a 320 or 10 100 and just H 410 or something and that way you're getting and just eight gig of a 240 X sticks of RAM if you can push it up to 16 gigabyte it will be worth it so push it up to 16 gigabytes that would be like 90% of your base and at least so and it's not too expensive so and then we've got let's move on to the next question so you guys are kind of answering okay Greg's okay that's him oh yeah how is the little cat let's see if she jumps up here sometimes when she wants food she'll jump up quick yeah okay so someone says when's the last time you've heard of dual-core 1 thread I've it was there ever a dual-core one thread what okay you're just taking a dual-core down to one thread okay what what is your drink of choice Brian oh man this like I nowadays I don't have a drink of choice like I'll I'll be drinking whatever people are drinking I do like my the N Cola like that's just classical for me I don't know if we should be saying that on strain like the the names of the beverages but yeah like I'm I like bourbon and cola that's my that's my thing mainly I like slide gonna be all that good stuff so it's all good stuff I like it all and then we've got next question Greg what about YouTube what do you like bourbon and coke don't you favorite drink yeah I not only bourbon I don't like dark liquors I'm more of a vodka guy I think I would do vodka cranberry vodka orange stuff like that like more like like fruity acidic vodka drinks and then like beer like I'll drink like dosa Keys Corona those two two easy ones and go anywhere I get the okay alright so let's move on to the next question here low latencies in low latency memory Network I don't know what they're talking about there so I'm bad at these I'm I'm so bad at reading questions would it okay so we're up to the latest question would it be worth it to upgrade a 1080 to a 3000 series GPU for 1080p 144 Hertz or is it still viable in 2022 21 as with upgrading man it just get like usually most gamers will be playing two or three games right two or three games yeah so if you're 1080 is good for 144 Hertz if your tenant he's good for 144 Hertz then just stick with it if not you need to upgrade so it really thing is like if you if you have to ask if you should upgrade then you probably already have the cash to upgrade and if you have a hole in your pocket and you feel like spending money then just do it your if your budget conscious you're gonna do the research to figure out if it's actually worth it or not but if you just feel like spending money you're just gonna do it anyway you know that's the princi that's the problem with tech right there is what you answered that's that's why I got into the use scene because I found I was buying these new products and I just wanted to go buy a new tech it's like Oh paycheck just came in what's new Oh mad pair of headphones pair of headphones I buy them and then like two weeks later I'm like oh I've got five pairs of headphones can I sell these and you're gonna lose a lot of money and so it's like then I started getting into use stuff and I'm like wow I can I could just build these pcs I can tune them I can have fun with them then I can flip it and make a bit of money like what is this concept is why I only buy used cars not necessarily for the flipping aspect yeah but because cars always depreciate so much the first couple years maybe two to three years of their lives especially if you drive them you know the industry standard mileage it's to me it just doesn't make sense to buy a new car when you could get a used one with a certified pre-owned warranty that's gonna cover you just as much as a new warranty well at almost half the cost in some cases of a new car you know if you just wait a couple years of your patient or if you're willing to just look used in general usually you can get more bang for your buck and when you sell it again or trade it in you're not gonna lose as much because the car is already depreciate it kind of - up to a point you know if you buy car for 20 grand that was originally 50 you're probably gonna get 16 to 18 for when you sell it versus if you bought it for 50 and want to sell it now it's they're only gonna give you 40 for it you know because it's not new anymore it's not the new tax I have no car at the moment I sold my car go yes tell them I like this I've considered one I really have okay so I saw black I sold my car it's gone I went into the deal I was like look can you give me a trade-in they like they offered me 17 K Ozzie and I was like whoa that's way too low for my 1 to 4 and I've garrage my 1 to 4 but they offer you it was 17 Ozzie 17 K Ozzie so I'd be like 13 12 chaos yeah 12 K USD my 1 to 4 was like in really top condition I said straightaway to the guys like dude that's way too low and get 27 for it and so I went and sold it and got 27 exactly for it so now I'm a free agent but now I was looking around and I can get you can borrow some money and I can get myself a Kia stinger and I was like yeah I gotta get a Kia stinger is new because you can because I'm gonna be using it for business no thing is confusing business in Australia in Australia we paid GST C so we pay GST you pay all these costs that you can't get on a private sale so automatically you get all that GST back because using it for business and the government in Australia at the moment the government has a thing where you can write off the whole car like the whole car against your business instantly it's it's pretty crazy so they want business to keep going hard and I'm like well perfect opportunity because my little my little 1 to 4 it just could not fit tech in it like it was too small it was way too small right it's like a Miata platform yeah and so and so for a lot of the parts hunts my friend would have his day off and he'd want to come with the parts on and so that's why the parts ants will always be on random days because we'll be borrowing his eight-six and I had a bit more room like it was actually quite spacious compared to my one to four so the yes mobility the yes 'mobile is gone the yes mobility is gone unfortunately but the next yes 'mobile is gonna be even better I promise you that I will drop a car vlog people have been requesting a car vlog for a long time so like I will drop one at the moment I'm driving without a car literally just calling up all my friends and I'm just be like y'all pick us up truck I'm Vegas cab at the moment thought it's good so I guess I got really cool people here then we got a great support network on the coast like where I'm at man people are just so cool so like people are taxing me around and I was gonna tell you when you when you were talking about the tax write-off thing for the car so you can write off the whole car in the first year right that purchased yeah on business the whole states in the state see we would say you've depreciated so you would depreciate it a hundred percent like the first year that you bought it you can only do that in the States with cars that have a curb weight of over six thousand pounds so that would be like large trucks large SUV's there so actually a list online you can find that has like every car that you can buy new that meets that criteria and it includes past like you in the car so if you're in the car you can add your weight to the to the curb weight of the car so that you meet that criteria but those are the only cars that you can like right off 100% and it's a I forget what they call it it's luxury the luxury luxury tax yeah see there is a limit for luxury tax so you have to make sure in Australia you go under that otherwise you will be penalized a bit so whether that's luxury taxes or whether it's knocking off one eleventh of the purchase price you can't claim we've got the next question though we got I just like you to compare the be 550 a pro with the be 450 a pro what's your opinion on that difference I haven't checked it yet I'm sorry but the the be 450 versus the B 50 gigabyte ds3 H was a perfect example to try and ascertain how much the licensing differences that's why I pulled that example up because they're essentially the same board at the core I don't know when so that was a 5 plus 2 or 6 plus 2 it was it you saw I was it okay was the VR I'm slightly better too I think yeah and he said something else but it was really vague it was like he said it was like a better built bourse not like I don't I don't know maybe it's a good piece like this six layer PCV versus the four okay well I'd say my my saying in the intro no one knows how much these license costs are I'd love to know I wish yeah I wish they'd opened up the transparency about that so in the meantime we're just gonna be making guesses so anyone's guess but at the same time I can guarantee you're paying more for a B 550 license than you are for a B 450 and so your values being eroded away there if you just guess we could expect we could expect be 450 boards to probably drop in price soon as well yeah if they're still being produced are they still being produced I mean with be 550 already here yeah be 450 still being produced I'm pretty sure yeah yeah are you you think prices on those are gonna drop at all especially considering the inventory shortages that we know B 450 ZL man dude everyone that's what I think that's what I'm thinking we got in here next up a Brian if you got offered to do just new builds on your channel would you do it or do you have a value fix nah man I've got to make used content for me it's like therapy you notice that Aliexpress video I had to know the answer right that was for me to like I do these videos for you guys but also doing for myself as much as I don't for you guys like I gotta answer my questions and all that okay well otherwise would make a video on this recording the questions and the answers so that's why it kind of when you do these videos they are long because they're more like they're more like a vlog sometimes in that I just I have so much things I want to go through and I might will hit record and show everyone what I'm going through with this stuff so yeah I'm not gonna stop doing use stuff because for me it's--it's I'm very passionate about it I think it's it's I love it right so it's just so cool it's such a good market to be in yeah anyway next question man sweeps of questions come in I haven't even scrolled yet I'm just trying to catch up with the backlog so I might yeah on Aliexpress would you go with rising 520 600 or 3500 X $200 yeah see that's what I mean 3500 X has gone up in price and that's the problem now it's like it's gone up in price and it's not worth it anymore I'd go with the 2600 440 Ozzy dollars cheaper it's just it when they were when they were similar prices I would have went with the 3500 X so there's that and then we've got here should I upgrade my 7700 K for a 3600 X plus B 450 for 290 pounds dipendra 90 euro no depends on your graphics card I'd say most likely no unless you got a really good graphics card even then yeah I'd invest in a cooler so get overclocks yeah in five months I'm gonna go buy a risin 930 no 120 80 super for Adobe After Effects does exist a better rendering GP at the same price as a 20 80 super ah look further doing work with the dhobi I like in video that I just keep using a video I don't have really any problems I've only come into one problem recently but that was 2019 Premiere Pro moving into 2020 automatically are you on the beta snow that use discrete card acceleration yeah yeah yeah so that's what I've jumped so beautiful yeah your rendering by like that's what I mean it might even be worth it might not even be worth putting in Premiere Pro rendering comparisons anymore because like the final reverie time it's gonna be different exactly 20 80 TI if you got 20 80 eyes you like the box moves two minutes man like it's it's insane how FAR's really nice yeah it's a good feature so yeah I'd say 420 eighty soup is a pretty good card I would go the 2060 super because of the eight gigabytes of vram it's the best value that's what I feel what your thoughts on you remaster command & Conquer have you guys tried it is it worth buying again I've actually been eyeing that off and I do want to check I love the command & Conquer series that's a good question from Adam I do want to get I haven't tried it yet haven't had time but I do want to check it out so that would be pretty cool just to play it you know just have a bit of fun with it so that'd be cool next up we've got a super chat from Jose thank you and I have a rising 5:30 650 700 XT and I get random CPU spikes to a hundred percent while gaming and I believe everything is up to date any advice that sounds like usually when you get cpu spice you got a background process so like you've got so you've installed some crappy widget or there's some sort of possible malware on your computer that's spiking your CPU see if you're just getting random stuttering and it's a drop in performance then that could mean that your CPU or you whatever is under your rounds under vaulted possibly just on that fine line or your X and peas aren't locked in but if you're getting a CPU spike that means something in the backgrounds like hey I'm gonna pop up while you're gaming so I'd check just control it delete check what programs are in use and what programs are spiking and then seek to eliminate that program sorry Greg I'm going to let you do the next question how do you drive to the deals without a car that you sold yeah or yeah and so the key is and this would have worked a lot better before all the health concerns sprouted but you would get yourself an uber all right and you would over to your meeting location yep and then you would I assume maybe pay your uber to hang out for a few minutes maybe slip them a five or a ten or something and just say hey wait here I'll be right back and then and then yeah then you take the uber back home roundabout the guy said Greg's like look get a hundred dollar GPU spend 50 on the Yuba valley value right there Longman get the value going on you can walk there you could take a skateboard but you still got to bring the thing back so you need some form of transportation this is why I wish us had trains it we had trains like like Europe did if trains were super common and the infrastructure here was a lot better than I'd take a train everywhere dude I wouldn't even own a car yeah sure that's true Marmite or Vegemite Vegemite next question we've got I just sold my B 450 or s elite as a combo I thought the vrm would boost better with B 550 how with boost speeds it actually depends on the manufacturer and what algorithm they've got for boosting like dude I saw this on a 320 boosting the 3300 ex the highest it's ever been now the RAM overclocks absolutely sucked but the boost algorithm does depend on the board maker not so much on the vrm so I've saw my 3300 ex go on one of the crappers boards I've seen to the highest performance out of the box so it all depends if you're relying on boost speeds it does depend on the board maker next question here we've got a willis if you handling PC a 4.0 on a B 550 affect CPU performance mmm shouldn't shouldn't really do any of that I've heard that I've heard sometimes the 5500 XT and the AMD new Navi cards can run better on PC a 4.0 I haven't haven't even checked out really a WoW okay I mean in theory they should because it's just a it's just a matter of bandwidth at the cards not saturating PCIe three then there's there's no reason why it would perform any better but there could be I mean when you talk about raid on cars it could be a software problem maybe if it detects PCIe for it triggers something in software that allows the card to fire you know just just compute things differently in some other efficient way who knows and that could fix things I mean what I'm going to do when like when the when the new r-tx cards come out I'll run some tests and see if we can drop it down to PCIe 38.0 versus PC 48.0 16 verses 16 and we'll check out the differences so yeah anyway yeah any anything you want to add all oh no no that was it I mean a there there in theory like my hypothesis would be there'd be no difference at all it'd be placebo but it's just the software is so inconsistent even still on especially 5700 XTS I've noticed it's just I'll see GPU usage spike and drop in the middle of a cutscene let's say like it's totally you know just random when it'll do these things it'll stutter hard and then it'll be fine for 30 minutes and then it'll stutter for five minutes repetitively and then it'll be great again yeah you know and it's it sucks because the cards are good in every respect except for software which has still not been totally worked out yet and it's like it's the one thing they can actually fix you know the good software is fixable yeah it's just mr. frustrate it's not like it's a board defect or something or a GPU defect it's just just programming you know yeah so anyway we've got here we'll get around wind up soon but it's pretty cool question I know it's out of your usual wheelhouse but do you think apples switching to a RM for macs will trickle into the PC market yeah like actually but yeah if one company is big as Apple is using a our end and that's a trend and that could be a trend that could sweep through and that's my main Intel and AMD do have to be careful because didn't a RM just make like the world's biggest supercomputer or something I saw some I saw some news article or something I I didn't really flick through it I just saw the title I was like cool like that looks pretty cool but the ramifications for that over time man is yeah that could come in and you could see a new competitor I want more competition and I kind of want like a RM fanboys to be in the mix you know what I mean then you'd have this three-way fanboy war it would be so cool like you know to mid you'd have like a MD and a RM fanboys then team up against Intel fanboys and then you'd have Intel and a RM fanboys be like yo we're dumping on a roof it it would just be like this diet like you'd have to make a video game with three races and they'd all go at it you know what I mean so like you've got the Zerg Protoss and the Terran you could have the a RM the Intel on the AMD and then like they throw their bazooka at each other anyway let's keep looking up I don't know how accurate this is but I just wanted to know the three reasons why ARM processors aren't actually used yet in like desktop PCs one of them has to do with performance like they're just objectively slower the next 36 we'll see I don't know this is probably an old post and then power consumption is not really the biggest concern on a desktop computer obviously ARM chips are a lot more power efficient because they're weaker as well and then software compatibility most people a desktop PC they can't run x86 software is a definitive no no according to this person so I think that for what you will okay well there you have it I again I haven't really researched the topic on I know I have a match so take that with you yes yeah good question new shirts in the making year like I gotta get back on my merch game because I'm so I've been so lazy with my merch game baby alright anyway we're gonna round this up guys thanks so much Greg for tuning in I hope you guys have been enjoying this livestream it's been a while since we'd livestream bit rusty had to flick off the proverbial live streaming dust and we had some trouble earlier with like YouTube trying like I was trying to save the title and it was like you can't save the title you can't save the title I'm like yeah it had the last title locked in but this time it went a lot smoother I'd say no one's complained about yeah every time we're ready to stream Brian has some sort of hiccup on his YouTube livestream page there's always something always something now I'd like to blame YouTube primarily for these hold back hold ups here but it might be a little bit of Brian easy mixed up in there that's oh dude I saw I saw one of my old videos recommended to me as like hey guys what does that be a brain is he coming back to you guys were like damn I gotta bring that back man you guys want to see that in a Python will get Brian AC back in the pot song baby yeah alright I kind of missed that like I was i okay I'm gonna delete JIT say one thing I think I was smarter back when I first started YouTube than I am now for some reason I've become Dahmer over the years I think you're mentally fully mature at like 30 okay yeah okay so I'm going down it's all downhill okay fair enough there you go guys so grim I love the hot truth you're slowly dying right just hit me just hit me just hit me okay all right anyway guys we're gonna close off with the I'm gonna go to the American accent Greg is gonna do the Australian accent this is a thing this is a thing you come over to text something you want the thing the text something and you're gonna get oh also what would you say if I I've been thinking about making a new hairstyle so that right before we move on to the closing out we've got the end of financial year in Australia and for me I'm like well I've got to make an end of financial year Year's resolution because New Year's New Year's is overrated like it's just like it it's just all right it's like it was day of the month where this fireworks there's nothing special about the end of financial gear is something special you've like got all your books done you've got a your accounting done you're ready to rock and roll you feel like a fresh man so I was thinking about dying half my head gray and then keeping the top of my head brown because I don't know it's just like I've got this weird contrast thing going on and there was a dude that used to like give me he just used to make fun of me like he used to make pictures of me being half gray around all around the side and then just brown on top and I'm like you know what it might his name was a Thiago tunes so I'm going to give him his request wait you're going hardcore grey I'm going like half grey half brown on top why don't you just go all gray no just no brass not know we know you just iron it okay I'll think about it we'll go halfway and then we'll see what happens we could pull off you look like that dude from from Pokemon what's the main character and like this Ruby and Sapphire series yeah that'd be you man you can rock it like a rocket I just said I start doing anime anime oh man I don't know it's gonna say some Japanese man I would speak Japanese for ages well when you're not a rounded I can tote like this is the same way with Italian like she you even want you to live in Germany she never spoke Italian so it fades Corsica what come on that's why I I forgot my Japanese so bad now dude like it's bad how are you are you Brian I'm 34 34 35 found you you on site actually no no five years let's start grand no no God Shepard also do it again alright alright let's go finish it off yeah we're gonna finish it off we're gonna Oh what do you mean what's the girl what are you alright anyway let's do it okay so American accent let's go American accent hey guys I went down the bank the other day and I got some free hand sanitizer now I could even show up Gregg on this deal cuz I got it for absolutely nothing now when we're talking about nothing right we're talking about getting a budget banger now I went over to this dude's house and I I'm being serious with you guys here I went oh this dude's house and now this was the same guy that had the pit viper and now like that pit viper that that thing just it's finished you know the pit fight for it's gone can't like we been to its funeral I feel sad but he had a deal for me right and his deal was a pair of Corsair HS Savin ease and they they had a bit like the the ear cups had some flaking on them and I was like dude is that thing used and he was like no dude this is new no I had to take a step back as I did that's that's used and he's like no it's new can't see it was flaking and I'm like dude I'm not gonna take that and then his like telling me he'll do me a good deal and it's still under warranty so I got no problem so okay how much do you want for him and he said $30 so I bored him for 30 got back to my pad and then I put him on and they didn't even work and I was like dude I took him into Best Buy and then they said sorry dude like this warranties not legit like this is just a pair of knock-offs and I was like oh damn it got hosts alright yo 10 yo turn there we go that's the story slightly more north than I'd like I need to teach you the proper southern southern accent Nancy Chesapeake southern lady from Alabama what do you think yeah you got a different camera you got see Gregg's got a different camera all right let's get yo 10 hit me with that Idol ice I'm so bad I'm just embarrassing man ice like this crap you Australian accent I can't even pull it off halfway through I just blend back to my gnarly dude that's my that's all I know from American dude that's all I can speak I speak American oh good hello I speak American that's honestly here from India okay I hit me come on hit me yeah you want me give you my Indian accent yeah no no no no no no one Australian accent come on I suck at Australian accent all I can say is crockie might that's all I can say is Crocky might say only cuz I watched I used to watch no what's-his-face Steve Irwin is my yeah think about it try and do something that's all trying to channel my inner stever it was actually funny because the guy out of New York said Brian you sound exactly like me so yeah he's after you live overseas if you're an Aussie you develop this sort of like neutral accent now finally mine's all over the place so like my natural ozzie I do speak it a bit like the natural Aussie tongue yeah mate come on Greg gotta go push it out for us push us out of natural Aussie accent already hurry yeah come on the view is a waste you're wasting the view is Tom mate sorry yeah yeah sorry can you just get on with it already hurry up Stephen mate kemell so I was scrolling through all of their a Bay 3 Bay and found myself cave it go come on RTX 28 TI yeah I said to myself rocky might know that boy here how much you pay mate caught up my mate Joe bought the Gold Coast and found myself 2080 I what problem is the guy said to me he says oh you're going a little bit into an English year come on bring up yeah I know I notice that I noticed it but there's a fine line between English and Aussie and I just don't I don't know it told my Moy I said I Susan mates is mate mate oh right yeah yeah mate anyway my Mike paid for it because I didn't want pay for I didn't have enough money and then we travelled back down the Gold Coast back to my home in what south of Gold Coast Brisbane Melbourne went to Melbourne one of those Sydney I went to one of those southern see other and maybe say you went down Sydney you got a deal what else met whatever story ok Greg is off his game I'm gonna make sure he practices before the next live stream again it's gonna practice in Australian accent okay we all right we'll do that next time we can do that okay yeah I want you to practice okay I want you to practice all right guys thanks so much for tuning in I love each and every one of you out there in the audience you guys are awesome this is tech yes City joined by Greg Salazar previously aka science to do previously Salazar's to do before that science studio and got it yeah there we go i remember i use i saw the progression dude I saw the progression so I was previously tech city previously Tech yes City previously Brian easy [Music] Brian easy I gotta bring it back man Brian easy I miss him i watch the older videos was like I miss that guy man that was before that was before I knew how tainted the world was I that's how yeah the world was so innocent before that now I do want to thank your chat for not absolutely roasting me and devouring me over my dead chat arrabal chat see we want to laugh either we kind of got a semi loft like all right guys so anyway Greg did a massive epic fail I'm gonna move on out of here because it's dudes like yeah I know you guys got upset I'm not gonna I'm and every time I like I'm a I'm not gonna let you guys down I promise you that like I'm a on top of that hey get over it bro like you did the epic fail and I was like yeah all right Greg I'm out of here Bruce that's it yeah links in description below we'll catch you guys if you got some dying topics you want to get off your chest drop in a comment and we'll talk about them in the next livestream thanks you all for tuning in and we'll catch you in the next one Greg's gonna take it away with a piece out for now bye let's do it priest out from now boy I think
