let's see just do a double check i i've got all the fancy buttons set up too good on you you got it okay [Music] okay we came back with a bit of a surprise for you guys we should be live and it should be fixed everything should be fixed this time i do apologize about yesterday uh that was like okay so you know how you win the lot like some people win the lottery i got the opposite of that in that like the elgato cam link thing it cut out with the x79 board then after that my internet cut out like that wasn't my problem so i just like uh it was two cut outs and i'm like yeah it's just not my data stream you know what i mean it just it just wasn't happening so but hey good news is we are back and i'm joined by mr gregory yes yo yes's are that's it that's you that's your nickname dude and anyway i've got a sound board so if you're watching the live stream back you can hear like because you need practice with your australian accent oh god no yeah i've got a little aussie i've got got a little aussie sound board for you you ready two right i'm ready i'm i turned up the live stream nice swipe right that's it if anyone remembers heroes and us too i made it into the sound board it's delayed by about 25 30 seconds okay i've got the best one too you're gonna hear the down under it's time for you to go down under okay almost there [Laughter] two roy is that what he said all right so that's right yeah we got the best soundboard we got the best soundboard here on youtube so old school on players will remember too we got some of the we got some of it anyway we were going on yesterday about the 240 hertz guy right the guy came to buy a pc office he wanted three two thirty hertz monitors and you know the difference between that guy and me yeah his stream actually worked [Laughter] anyway brian was you guys don't know but brian was beating himself up pretty bad yesterday he was pretty upset that it didn't work out for you guys yesterday so uh he he worked his butt off today to make sure that uh streams gonna be hopefully spotless and uh back to its usual self yeah and so that's what i mean like i even improved it with the sound board so i hope chad is doing well um yeah i will and so i will check the dms later guys i do put it on dnd just so we we got a smooth stream but yeah we'll if you guys are going hard enough and chat but the we had the one guys so we start off the stream and we'll sort of recap what happened yesterday because i basically deleted that live stream out of existence it was just horrible like i was like no i can't have this on my channel i was like well we caught in two times and the stream was just sitting there how long was it waiting for like oh at one point it was waiting for 10 10 or 15 minutes before we cut it it was just like look we'll just forget that stream ever existed we'll go through the same points talking points here today in this live stream and um yeah so we'll get it together this time for you guys and hopefully we have even a bet that's what i mean so this is what sort of like mistakes and problems can do they can give you a better product than you ever had before so don't be afraid to critique me guys just say look brian you did a horrible job yesterday i did i did but now we gotta good on you you got it and uh we've also got a yes boss so right on stream man you're gonna love this sound board i hate that i can't hear it like in the hand i know you can't react to it i need to share that too hey i need to share it to you but anyway we got the three 240 hertz guy he came around and i said to him look you don't need to buy three 240 hertz monitors to stream you only need one 240hz to play games on and enjoy yourself then the other monitors can be cheap as and you can even get away with just like that's what i've got at this setup here i will do a video for it now because i've finally mastered it all there are a lot of things if you'd want to do a single pc streaming setup to be wary of and uh the biggest one is the motherboard actually making sure it's it's sort of like a newer design board and it's not an entry-level board because you need all those usb ports if you if you're gonna go with the cheap route then you have to go get those usb hubs with the separate power adapters so they power all the usb ports separately and so that's sort of like that was a big thing for me and i mean i trial and error man hey at least if you have like multiple drives plugged in at the same time aren't you like gonna you're gonna cut into your bandwidth your transfer speed rates yeah but i mean a lot of like streaming devices like a microphone can run off usb 2. oh you just me oh yeah yeah but a lot of them have like all these led lights on it and so it's just one of those things but um yeah i mean rest in peace stuff jar jar that's it he it that that build some people message me after personally they're like man i love that build and i was like yeah i loved it too but if something's not gonna work properly i i want to use it and show it to you guys in the background another thing i did too was i fixed all the bottom you can see there the leds now all glow through the whole bottom so i fixed that up and made sure it glows through the whole bottom of the case so there's a lot you know there's a lot of good stuff that comes out of a bad stuff another good thing that came out of uh something bad do you know what happened yeah so anyway i washed my jeans the other day and then i realized oh i'm missing a memory card because like if i go out on a part-time or whatever i have a spare memory card i just put it in my little pocket on my jeans i got a little pocket and then i'm like oh no i left it in the jeans and rolled it through the wash and then dried all my jeans off and everything and uh memory card still works nice that was a good recovery i don't know what thumb drives before yeah same thing or i just forget that they're in there like money you know when you find money in a in some clothes you just watch it's like free money you just came out of nowhere it's nice oh yeah the the money doesn't have electronics in it so there's the difference so oh i know but it's still a good feeling when you find something like that in there yeah but anyway other than that we're going to start off today's live stream we've got some news topics for you guys intel in apparently big trouble i'm i'm going to say that yes and no i feel like i feel like x86 the apple news is more damning than the delays i think that's why the stock price is down because apple is switching to arm and that's huge man they just posted a record quarter yeah but they announced i mean the stock price tumbled when until announced the delays it didn't tumble when apple announced the departure from intel chips yeah i know and that's because people are like oh we're fed up with this we're fed up with this they're not going to be competitive well they know too that like apple is only one like they're only one buyer one african you know whatever you would want to call them uh of of those chips the intel still has plenty of partners so to speak you know who they sell their chips to so i don't think that was as big a blowout probably i'm looking at the i'm looking at the trend rather the trend but anyway we'll go through the news and then we'll talk about the trends because i'm always looking for the trends right the trend is you it's always going to be your friend so anyway um the chief engineer uh murthy rendu chindala i had to say that slow so i didn't butcher it i know someone's gonna be in the comments it's gonna be like dude it's spelled renducidada i'm like okay dude i don't know i just anyways i throw a disclaimer out there just throwing a disclaimer out there you can butcher my name too okay i even butchered the word gravis card i even like i just say well i say graphics but i say it so fast that the youtube algorithm thinks it's grabbers so i'm like all right we'll just we'll just roll with that what is that's not a word though is it it is a word it apparently means multiple graphics yeah it means graphics no i know but the way that they spell it like that's not a real word it's substituting it so it's just like screw it this is what it sounds like that's it so well the so the share price fell by 16 percent they took a tumble amd and nvidia stocks have been rising like have you seen nvidia's stocks like 422 yeah they're above apple now they're talking about buying arm too that is i saw that like that is like okay and this is the thing like man i made a joke about this like not even a joke i just made some predictions back in 2012. i think i did it on live stream if you guys followed us like auto shut down initiated uh okay what my headphones okay hopefully my headphones are still working it said something about auto shutdown on my headphones can you talk for a second yeah yeah it should be good yeah it should be good okay come on corsair wireless don't shut down on me not during the livestream it should be good wait it sprays your battery no i charge them i charge these before stream they should be fine if not i've got a quick pair of headphones that'll only be a minor issue guys if my headphones cut off but um okay so we got the share price fell heaps on the intel stock and then amd and nvidia rose heaps and then nvidia like anyway years ago i made a prediction that nvidia would actually dominate not just graphics cards but also other things as well and that's looking if they take over arm that could be a massive possibility you know what i mean that like yeah that's like a scary like reality and it's like i got called an idiot at the time of course like people like oh you don't know what you're talking about you're an idiot blah blah blah so i think i feel like this is an anti-trust thing like i feel like this this could potentially spark a lot of debate about how big some of these companies are and you know if they if they did follow through with this i mean nvidia would be huge they're already huge but this is just to me this is borderline anti-competitive i think yeah so anyway on the news of intel intel just seems to keep going though that's the thing like i remember like couple of years ago like they had problems with 10 nanometer and they're still chugging along they're still like their revenue is still posting record quarters and it's kind of like i don't like are businesses not adopting to amd like you know like data centers and stuff like that in in mass you know what i mean because you've got to you've got to follow that that money right and if businesses aren't adopting in mass to amd then that's going to be a problem for um amd of course so i don't know it's it's a weird it's a weird situation because i feel like the seven nanometer delays for intel is like another blunder where they've had 14 nanometer delays with broadwell they actually had 14 nanometer delays believe it or not then they had um their delays on 10 nanometer which was wide widely reported now they're reporting seven nanometer delays it thinks it seems like delays are the norm for intel and yeah it's just like they got to get it together i mean three strikes in a row for these guys now well not just that i mean they've delayed 10 nanometer more than once i think that's why people are so pissed like it'd be different if it was just you know one time hey guys we want to push back the launch our yields aren't as great as we thought they would be yadda yadda but you do it two or three times like you're on the same art you haven't even moved on to to the next node you're on the same node that hasn't been released yet and you keep pushing further and further back the launch of desktop skews on that node that's just you know how many strikes until you're out in that case that's exactly right so i don't know it's it's a weird one isn't it it's weird to talk about it's weird to like they've got to get it together because they they will lose a lot of ground and it'll happen so quickly that's the thing right they'll be they'll be cruising along and then all of a sudden they'll just drop off big time so at the moment they're still got so at the moment they still have they still have that gaming performance lead right they still do have that but i feel like for for the average consumer if they lose that which is a big possibility with zen 3 if they lose that they are going to be in for a world of hurt especially on the consumer side so yeah they're in they're in weird they're in murky waters the only way to say with intel they're in murky waters man murky waters yeah and i think from our side of it you know like just general consumers we're looking at this like well okay most of us are comfortable with amd right now the fact that intel is sort of letting us down in terms of innovative new stuff coming out we keep seeing the rehash thing over and over isn't as big a blow as it could be because imagine this happening six years ago when we were sitting on piledriver bulldozer stuff ashira from amd which everyone knew by the time skylake came out that you know those that process was highly inferior and then they pushed out the what the 95 90 the chips that you you know could overclock to five gigahertz but it didn't matter because single core performance was still terrible by comparison imagine if intel was having these problems then i think at that point people would have been way more fed up than they are now it's just a good thing that we have some viable alternative and ryzen happens to be one of the the best value launches i think in a good while yeah i mean ryzen zen 2 was their big one like the initial zen was a taste and then zen 2 was just like okay this is what we're going to do so anyway zen 3 i'm really looking forward to it is that going to be the one that breaks intel properly on all fronts we're going to find out that's what that drum roll but here's another thing i noticed right notebook check i should i should slice an end tech directly sorry an ntec um that's just me being lazy with pulling up articles but they spoke to um basically the intel cfo right and he said okay the 10 nanometers going to be less productive than 14 nanometer 22 nanometer then he's like okay he's basically saying um what they'll see in seven nanometer so it's almost as if like there's a possibility i feel like there's a possibility they're just like they looked at 10 nanometer they're like all right this is a dud let's just try and push it out to laptops and stuff and milk this node as much as we can because it costs a lot of money to do this like what we said yesterday with global foundries i mean they ditched 10 animator all together like screw this like we can't you know we we either started too early or we're just hitting hurdles that aren't worth tackling at this point we'd rather look even further ahead to seven and you know focus all of our resources there yeah so this is well this is scary because like well it's not scary it's actually maybe a positive thing for intel there's actually two positive things that i've took out of both these articles or a few of these articles and that is yeah what they'll see in seven nanometers so basically in if you were to decipher that okay seven nanometers doing pretty well that's what i'd say but then they're just maybe they're deliberately delaying it so they can get as much as they can out of their investment on 10 nanometer that's basically how it's how i'd interpret that maybe it's detective b going too in depth here and i've been eating too much just wait for it just wait for it autumn shut down cancelled i hate that i can't hear it okay i feel like i'm missing like i just said oh it says have some of this vegemite all the time okay all right so anyway um we've got here so back to the other article the second piece of good news is is ann uh kelleher has taken over the place where mr murphy left and i've met her at an event and she's she's brilliant so just like i said lisa sue was gonna be brilliant when she stepped into amd i'm predicting that and's going to do some great work for intel in this division so there's my prediction there so i think hey whatever's going on it might be maybe a turnaround for intel this might be their turning point but of course they're going to have to deal with zen 3 in the process so somebody sorry somebody's saying that you're i think it's got to be your headset because mine's not doing it but they say they can hear every 30 to 60 seconds that beep about the battery warning or whatever oh they can hear that coming out of the stream i think they can yeah all right well i'll just keep the sound board up i think that fixes it all right that should be good instead of hearing that yeah we'll go anyway next up here we've got um okay so apple let's talk about arm and apple yeah that's what i mean there's there's always going to be a problem when i live stream so just that's that's any live stream got to be some sort of problem i think like the the headset thinks it's idle so what's happening is it's it's going into automatic shutdown mode when it shouldn't be so if i play the sound board that might be the savior so anyway apple they posted a 84.3 billion wait sorry i read this one wrong okay so they blew away the expectations sorry which article is this oh this is q1 yeah yeah so the revenue is sorry there's so many billions here that i just i'm missing so basically their revenue grew again for 2020 first quarter and that grew over 2019 which grew over 2018. so yeah um i was gonna say this is q1 like they just released q2 earnings by the way like two days ago or yesterday actually i only know that because i hold apple stock but uh they're up 11 year over year for q2 as well despite all of this going on that's yes basically basically people just keep buying apple products that's a trend right so we're looking at trending this is the most important thing people keep buying apple products it doesn't matter i haven't got one apple product in my studio like i just don't use apple stuff i don't there's always like you know pc i guess any enthusiast pc users maybe don't have apple i mean some people do this is the funny thing some people use the mac macbooks the actual notebooks and then they use a enthusiast desktop x86 i mean windows linux but this is the weirdest thing right that i just i find it baffling how so many people just give away their money to apple yeah and with the trend recently too with you know how expensive phones are i mean you remember like this wasn't very long ago when a a flagship phone was maybe 600 bucks you know like and that was considered back then a lot of money i know there's inflation and other things to account for some of that but yeah i mean the amount of r d that goes into just the the chipsets alone like the cameras how how crazy good the freaking mobile cameras are now especially apple cameras uh google pixel cameras like the software behind these cameras as well um it's just insane that like people are willing to just pay over a thousand dollars for i've never spent anywhere near that personally i did for lisa uh but that's only because she's a hardcore apple fangirl but uh i personally never would have spent that much i would never have done the payment plans where you're like pay by the month or you subsidize it into your uh data plan or whatever for yourself i've just never i've never understood that like that's so much money for something that you're going to get rid of in a year or two for something even better you know so here's the thing um this is the thing right we got um so this is the thing i bought an apple iphone 3 back when it was first released that was my first and last apple product that thing became so bad after a year that i had to chuck it i just chucked it in the bin out of frustration because i remember i was getting a call it was something some really important call and like my battery just shut off and i'm like what i had like 60 charge or something on the battery and i was like no i can't do this anymore flip phone was more reliable than this latest and greatest iphone three that was at the time i'm like yeah man i'm never buying an apple product again but at that time i already got hosed i already gave my money to apple so that was like yeah i guess you learned the hard way so yeah anyway we got a donation tour i'll save that i'll copy paste that and i will talk about it when we go to when we go to chat so next article here is we've got the arm apple's moving over to arm and this is a big one because i feel like this is a massive one right because they've used intel for so long um if it sets a trend and this is what i was talking about if it sets a trend greg mr greg if this sets a trend where other companies start ditching intel and going to arm that's a dangerous trend right there i doubt it though there's too much they these are okay so arm is is they're manufacturing the chips right but apple's designing them um like apples chips that are in i know like lisa has like an ipod or ipad pro that has like this blazing fast chip and i forget if it's like the a13 or 812 whatever but they're really good because they designed them around the software and when you have like that kind of harmony it just it seems that much snappier it's like a really good tune on a car you know it's just software but if you get your fuel mixtures right and all that stuff like your car just runs so much better i don't think that a lot of these other companies are capable financially or even willing to just like reallocate resources around to design their own ships i think that's too big of a bridge to gap for a company like hp or lenovo or whoever else you know uses intel oem stuff for their desktops i i just don't i don't see that apple's apple's apple they're just on a different planet it's i mean yeah but according to this article saying they're approximately four and a half percent of the laptop market and 2.6 of the desktop market so the finance that's what they're saying the financial impacts not going to be significant i'm just looking as i said before looking at the trend here that's the biggest thing so if it sets a precedent where hey if you know and this is the thing if arm is the better architecture if it is the better way to go then maybe people will realize that i don't know it's just it sets one of those things that could be a it could snowball that's what i'm trying to say it could attend it could potentially snowball when we're like hey look at what this can do look at what arm can do versus x86 processors they've been traditionally very like they've been much weaker traditionally and then they're for lower you know i don't want to say lower tier things they're just for they're just they have different applications and that's why we haven't seen it yet and i think the reason why apple can i think apple can do it because of the operating system the operating system is so much like it is like ios even mac os like you can do so much more when you design a processor around that operating system it just it makes things so much more efficient you don't have to you know sculpt your uh you know your preferences around just some cookie cutter uh chip out there and that's that's why apple i think they just they have this right mix because they do the software they make their own software it's proprietary stuff and then they're also on the other side going to manufacture their own chips to coincide with that i mean that's that's both sides of the coin right there they're trying to tackle so that's why i think it's an apple exclusive they're the only company that has their own like widely accepted operating system love it or hate it mac os ios it's it's proliferated you know okay i mean that's that's a that's a good argument i'm just i think okay so i think going forward right going forward with apple using arm automation oh sorry about this guys shut down cancelled [Laughter] i don't know the timing on it if someone knows the timing between when a corsair initiates because it thinks it's idle and i'm listening to you right everyone's getting your audio i'm listening to your audio it must be some kind of bug that i didn't i didn't account for so it must be obs stream labs must be locking in the channel directly for the line of audio and so it thinks it's it's idle which is weird anyway my my biggest thing is that there are supercomputers using arm chips now right like i think in japan like there's some i think it's like is it fuji or something someone's using like arms and they're super computers right really yeah so that's that's the thing so that's it they're using it in super computers so i think like this is a bad a bad trend that's going to go through for x86 because i'm an x86 enthusiast let's be right i'm an x86 enthusiast i think a lot of people are and i mean what would be a world what would in the questions what would a world be like with uh no more x86 and only um arm so anyway we got up here the next article we got ryzen 7 pro 4750g and uh the new desktop ryzen 4000 series have you seen that have you uh not the dest i mean we were talking about the apu's just the aps right yeah not 4000 series like because there's a difference because like the 4000 series apus are zen two not zen two plus or zen three whatever just want to make sure that people aren't confused by that um yeah but i've seen this i've seen the apus and i've got to say that the probably the most appealing part of this the part i'm most intrigued by is the tdp i mean these chips have look at the the 4750 ge max boost up to 4.3 okay that's not stellar base clock of 3.1 but the default tdp is 35 watts like how are you getting that much power into a chip that's only consuming you know less than half of what its regular desktop sku is well the biggest thing for me is like i'm looking at the pro series right the desktop skus anyway so i'm not looking at the mobile like the desktop the ryzen 7 pro 4750g like what i'm seeing here is that they've got now they've got the uh zentu cores on them which is great but they've left the vega graphics on there and so if you look at the comparisons there's actually a few comparisons up online and um it's really not that much better than a 3400g when it comes to gaming so people like i would love to see them put our dna cores in this thing in their apus yeah i think it'd be too hot it'd be too like i don't think they could fit all that into an am4 chip i just don't think it's like physically possible i think it's possible for them to do something pretty cool like they can do something better than 3400 g and then that would make actually like imagine getting like just a cheap four core eight thread with rdna like a little piece of our dna in there that could actually play games pretty well you would have that coupled with maybe like this is a possibility right couple that with a a cheap um a320 16 gigabytes of ram and you get yourself a really good gaming pc of course the ddr4 ram speeds would come into effect since it is running off that but it is a it opens up for a world of possibilities so yeah a couple people are saying who believes tdp my 105 ycp pulls 150 all day just so we're clear like intel and amd measure tdp differently it's like totally different and intel uses some intel especially uses some very sneaky ways of getting around the traditional tdp standard because they have other core enhancement features that will allow the chip to consume far more than what it's rated for amd not as much amd i found is much more conservative and much more true to their tdp than intel so if you're using your intel chip to compare my reference to tdp i think that's like totally often left field just because the companies do it totally different okay well i mean tdp is one of those things where just i like to wait and see how how it is there's a tdp oh yeah yeah i think there's a tdp spec which they they're all manipulating now right they're all like they are here's the best one is doing it more one is clearly manipulating tdp way more than the other and that that's the point i wanted because it sounds like the 105 intel intel's definitely intel's definition intel is definitely uh pushing that tdp boundary yeah it's a 65 watt chip huh why is it running it unless you overclock and yeah i mean there's so many variables there but stock you should see it go you know double what the rated tdp is that's just it's yeah gdp is a joke like i the guys in the chat have got it right on the money like when can we just get a realistic up to i think that's the best way to look at it up two because every chip is different i mean that's the thing like even if you're in the same family as chip let's say you have two i you know 3700 x's at the same frequency and the same voltage one could still pull more power from the wall than the other just be just by you know the nature of how efficient each chip is um how much degradation there is in terms of you know what transistors function which ones don't i mean there's a certain threshold for passing as a certain skew but you could have one better bin than the other that just can do the same amount of work by consuming less power so it's not even like it's not even like a blanket statement would be accurate because then you're making your chips seem worse than they are you know worse than they should be and they're definitely not going to do that okay nice sweat mate all right so um anyway i had to do the sound board so we got the next article up here and this is the av aya eve switch handheld gaming pc sports ryzen 4 500 you see singing about the ram have you seen this little thing no like it looks really cool uh it's basically like a nintendo switch but with like pc parts in it and they're like they're packing 16 gigabytes of ddr4 4266 ram in it like it's huge like this thing's gonna be like i would like to get one just because it looks so cool and it's got pc hardware in it and you can just do so much you got so much freedom with that you can run all your emulations no problems there's no yeah so it it's yeah anyway i absolutely love little things like this i thought it'd be cool to share this with you guys i thought this this was like one of those things that i'd love to check out personally because yeah it just looks like it's what's possible now with technology anyhow that's that article done and dusted we've now got um so there's rumors now of a the rtx 30 90 50 percent faster than the rtx 28 ti in the early benchmarks so i guess it's looking like it's pretty concrete at this stage that you know rtx 3000 is going to be big but i still don't know like i'm still it just seems like it's it's shift between late this like we're in august now so it's later this month or early next month or mid next month later next month there's still that gap of when it's exactly going to be in our hands and you can actually buy this thing that's what i'm finding we've got a bit of a bit of a weird one going on that's for sure anyhow i don't think you sent me that article i don't even have that article in here no i did pull a little shifty on you i gotta admit yeah i'm gonna say i'm honestly looking for it i pulled a little shifty on greg before we went to it i tested it and then then we got a fake then we got a fake 6900xt article and they've deep like adored tv debunked it which they said the shadows on the radiator don't match the card and it's like yeah that's true um i mean amd is going to do something it's just when are we going to see actual leaked benchmarks and that's the thing right if you're seeing leaked nvidia benchmarks you're definitely going to see leaked amd benchmarks nvidia have such tight control over their leaks amd man do you were you at this event in the us where like they said don't listen yeah and they said don't leak this information and like literally like an hour later it's just all over the internet and i'm like well that's the thing i mean like you know you're signing ndas to not you know you're agreeing to not spread the information publicize the information that's under nda but you know there are so many different people there who i'm sure passed along the information on the dl you know unofficially and then these these media outlets that just thrive off of rumors and leaks are gonna go ham you know as usual so i always take this with a huge grain of salt i mean like they some of them have been accurate and that's great but i never take leaks or and especially rumors as gospel because i've seen some pretty ridiculous leaks people thought were true definitely not happen and people were upset by it people fell for the hype and then were disappointed because their expectations were set so high with some of these products you know so you got to be careful right here that's it so anyway i got the right er button that's going to keep my headsets from bumping off the stream but i completely agree but amd i'm going to say one thing amd has a leak problem like they've got a problem where they're trying to weed out all these leaks and stop them from happening so there it is that's with that i'm gonna wait for some actual proper benchmarks that we can see and people like wow anyway last thing we're gonna talk about before we go to chat is stock prices i mean look at man i can't believe this both nvidia and amd are just through the roof i mean i don't touch stocks personally because i just don't believe in them but i mean who who would have predicted that nvidia would be up to 424 bucks and in three months the stock prices have over doubled for a massive multinational company then we've got amd it's like pretty much the same story almost a double job and then we gotta then we got intel they're just like hey guys what's up well look that go back to amd pull up the five-year chart i've said this so much yeah on amd yeah oh man no no no two bucks no not in video oh sorry i'm looking i'm looking at the livestream yeah if you bought it like two or three bucks like can you imagine it's almost like it's almost like bitcoin it's almost like bitcoin at that stage hey actually it is it kind of is a bitcoin scenario yeah like hey guys you want to buy so you want to buy some bitcoin here wait i mean amd stock i mean i mean that's the whole thing like hindsight is 20 20 but geez you know if i if i had i mean look this was literally and the stock started doing well when zen came out you know when when zen one launched that was kind of about the time that the stock started moving off of single digits and since then man it's just and now it's it's sort of an inverse of intel or if intel does bad andy does good and the opposite i'm sure would be true as well if we heard some bad news from amd but i i don't think that's that's the thing now i'm starting to realize how it works i don't know right would we would we get done for insider trading if we um i'll just quickly do a quick writer hang on right here so would we get done for insider trading if we bought amd stock this is the thing i have no idea about the legalities of this if we get say say for instance we bought a heap of amd stock yeah and then we're like and then and then yeah and then we're like on our channels we're like guys this is the best thing you got to keep buying this and you just keep spamming people with how positive amd is or say for instance in video whatever i mean it's no different than like anybody else giving stock tips online i think that as long as you disclose where your investments are at to an extent you're probably okay just because i'm relating to what i see on cnbc and wherever else where people are saying hey this stock is great i've got you know i've i've got a thousand shares and so and so and i think that they're gonna do well in the future like you're just recommending people buy the stock insider trading is when like you know something that the public doesn't because it hasn't been announced to the public yet and you trade on that information without the stock reacting yet because the stock hasn't gotten a chance to react to yet because nobody knows about it um maybe the case for us would be like if we were sent samples for ryzen 4000 desktop skus and we got them a month ahead of time you and i tested them the night we got them said wow these things are game changers they are insanely good and then we bought a bunch of amd stock before the public knows how the chips perform because we know like for whatever reason these chips are just like miracles from heaven and and the stock's going to freaking skyrocket i feel like that would be more applicable than but then again where's the line right because we have yeah because we have ndas i'm pretty sure we are in a situation where we couldn't do that because we've got that privileged information under nda so it does make for a um interesting article i'm just going to quickly do a vegemite quickly here okay and now back to questions so let's go we'll jump over to q a because yeah we got amd stock right if you bought amd stock as well congratulations you made an amazing decision you made an amazing decision nvidia stock too like if you bought nvidia stock like you know back in 2016 around the same time if you're just like look i'm gonna buy nvidia stock amd stock to be fair look dude if you look at the nvidia stock to be fair it's almost seeing this same price increase in percentages like no i mean not to be afraid a lot of tech stocks are a lot md's made a bigger of course amd's made a bigger jump but nvidia still made a massive jump in the field yeah and this i mean if if you put you know a thousand bucks into the s p even if you you know let's say you did it in 1995 right and then you went through the dot-com crash and then you went through the housing crisis in oa like you'd still be up i mean like the market almost always corrects unless you know a country ceases to exist or that country's markets or that currency that it's reliant on just disappears but the markets always recover um and that's why people you know throw their money into mutual funds and bonds etfs and just straight up stocks for the long term because it'll give you way more returns even after you go through all of those economic downturns then a bank will you know giving you a half a percent of interest a year you know that's the banks are laughable at this point oh yeah it's a weird situation i just have to take a step back and i'm like nah man i'm just going to keep doing what i do and that's uh building pcs and making tech videos for y'all yeah that's it like it's you just yeah who could predict this brian you're a little risk-averse there huh i am man who could predict that this was gonna happen in 2020 man like i'm thinking nah like some of the bitcoin guys out there have a point this is why bitcoin was made man governments are printing money at stupid levels you know i read an article this morning i woke up and got it on my phone it's a cool article and it said the government printed in the last month more money than they've had in debt since 1776 is that when the u.s was founded yeah and i guess technically until like 1960 until like 1979 or something in 200 years in one month they've printed more money than they've incurred in all their debt for 200 years you know why right because we went off of the gold standard at around that time i think in early it was like 81 or something like that maybe late 70s but it was around that time when we ditched the gold standard which means our money no longer relies on an another commodity you know a fixed commodity and because we took it off of that we went fiat and we can print as much as we want now you know and now we just have the consequence of you know having to deal with how our currency stacks up to others not necessarily how our currency stacks up to what we have in reserve which is i mean it's ridiculous but that's that's how it is now right here that's it man right here so anyway we'll go over to q a we'll go over to q a let's see what the audience has to they get they're actually enjoying the deep and meaningful conversations but we did get a uh we got some donations before so hi guys love the stream could you do a viewers build segment to see some of the builds the other guys who are subbed here have and yeah like i will do that like i would love if you guys want to submit your use i want to do used builds like what you can do on a budget that would be my thing right i'd love it yeah i'd love to see like i'd love to see what some of the viewers have done that is unique right because you can do so much with pc i'd love to see what some of the viewers have done with unique things like really unique things and i know there's going to be some cool xeons out there that'd be cool verizon first-gen stuff um yeah there'd be some really cool cookie-cutter stuff out there i mean what about you on your channel would you do yeah i mean i my thing is like i don't want to be like everyone else like i don't want to do the same things that they all do and to an extent that's unavoidable but um like when it comes to reviewing builds like i think my take on that already is like reviewing you know the ridiculous ads and stuff and i've done some where like the ads are really good i'm like hey y'all should check this one out because it's actually priced fairly well so that's kind of like how i uh that's kind of my spin on it like i'll look at just listings online or even viewers listings they'll submit to me like hey what do you think about my build you know do you think i've priced it well enough and kind of go from there i guess that's that's how i've approached it yeah okay so we got a question here about upgrading of course and it's always the same thing it's like should i upgrade to um yeah yeah should i have a video on this so we'll be we'll be serious should i wait until next gpus come out or upgrade from r9 290 to gtx 1080 or vega 64. uh i just wait until the next year we're so close to next gen coming out that you wise will wait for that to happen yeah yeah and you have to ask like if you don't need it so bad to the point where like you don't want to ask because you know you need it that bad you can probably wait that's that's that's my but that's what i said that being said i do remember before the 1080 before the rtx 2000 series was released i remember 1080t price at 1080 ti prices here they were down to like 820 aussie brand new and dude they like they still carry around that price point like they're a little bit lower but this is like whatever over two years later you haven't lost much money so graphics cards you can see trends here let's go back to our little friend the trend you mean gravis gravis cards gravis cuts right gravis cards they have fault they have changed over the years where if you had a gtx 6 series when the seven well sorry when the nine series came out that thing was worth yeah nothing um so you had your 400 gtx 670 being worth peanuts now but now what you're seeing is because it's slowing down and and because like you got to look at the mid-range not the not the upper echelon that just keeps the upper echelons those are always going to be more and more expensive it just keeps going it just keeps going it's like cell phones it's like cell phones like they're just going to keep going up in price that's it so the performance the performance you get more the performance you get more but you're paying for it yeah but yeah you're paying for it that's that's how just like this amd stock you're paying for it you want some of that amd stock fellas eighty dollars a pop you want some nvidia stock ladies and gentlemen four hundred and twenty five dollars a month come and get it just for one one little share in nvidia you know how many shares are there in video oh their market cap has got to be let me see i mean but how many actual shares have been issued well you would just look at the market cap that'll tell you i believe how much this is money is yeah you pull up the calculator i'm not touching this string i'm only just doing um a little sound bite 261 billion to 261.12 uh she's doing the math zero zero zero zero zero divided by 424.5 i don't even know if i did this right i don't really remember much of what i learned in school to be frank uh 615 million roughly shares if i did that correctly someone in the chat if if i did it wrong they're going to yell at me but i think doesn't matter so there's over six how many shares against six hundred 615 million if i did that correctly i think i think guys go get go get one slice of that for 425 that's right go get one slice of that 600 million oh yeah that's a big number right i think actually two though like the stock price changes over time so and then if you split just like apple's probably into a four to one split with their stock so that'll screw things up i don't know it's in the it's in the multi-multi-millions of shares out there let's see i just think it's funny man like yeah this is the reality of it right when you put it that way it's like go get one one little slice of that for four i mean like that's that's people can live off that for quite a while in some especially in some countries man and you got one of 600 million like it's gonna get to the stage where it's like hey it will represent eight billion eight billion people so like which which company has eight billion stocks so like yeah anyway it's it's it's crazy to think about it so anyway back to q a back to q a so what's my gtx 964 gigabyte g1 worth now actually a little bit the four gigabytes of vram is the saving grace that is the saving grace for that card so if you which part are we talking about sorry which card the gtx 960 oh yeah the four games yeah because they are the two and the four yeah that's it he's got the four gigabytes skewed so he did well so anyway anyway uh not many que people just talking to each other we're not getting any questions in here uh yeah they seem to be i mean they're talking about what we're talking about they're just they're just chatting with us about okay rock on this is usually we get flooded with questions um and i've got to like i got to just go back through it it's cool okay keep this up guys i love tracking the market he said 650 million shares outstanding and changing wow that's yeah so 650 million shares that's huge so i mean yeah i mean look i'm a deal hunter like as a deal hunter i look at this i'm like that's not a deal [Laughter] i mean there are premiums like a lot of stocks now especially depending on who you ask people will tell you that these stocks are at premium prices like way above the threshold for being premium just because how quickly some of these stocks rebounded after the you know the drop so right here who knows man just that's it that's the main thing about it so we've got the sound board popping let's go is x58 dead it is going that way i'm going to say it is going that way a bit but of course if you can pick up this is the thing if you can pick up as i say with x58 if you can pick up the board and the cpu on the ram cheap enough it's going to make for a fine gaming pc i mean personally i'm thinking like locally where i'm at x58 is starting to become less frequent so it's not really dead it's just there's not much being sold and then because it's drying up so much the amount of x58 being sold is really sort of squeezing out and then people like well that's a nice board someone still wants that so yeah i mean i get x-58 boards if i pull them out of 50 systems i'm not going to lie i go and get that x50 8 board and pop it on ebay and make a hefty little profit while i've got the cpu and the ram still there so x58 boards sometimes they're too good to put in budget pcs because they're worth way more than they should be in a budget pc so i would say it's more like x58 is a weird sort of it's always going to have a place in my heart but yes in mainstream like picking up deals for x58 that is slowly dying that's what i think um x79 though that's where x79 the shift's just like hey let's just jump onto x79 and x99 so it's like an easy transition it's like hey here's the next best thing and it's still cheap it's still the exact same argument and formula the x58 was so you're just getting more cores more threads and you can utilize cheap ddr3 ecc registered more than you ever could especially with those x99 boards off aliexpress that's amazing so um anyway wireless headset recommendations i'm only using this headset because uh on this stream i needed this the spare headset i'm gonna go back to the virtuoso which is wireless and wired i think for me like we got asked which is a good wireless headset i'd say the virtuoso is really good and yeah the audio like the the microphone on them virtually yeah next stream see i thought i thought because i had the wave 3 that i could get away using wireless but then yeah i've got to hit my sound board every couple of minutes with a right here and to make it smooth you know what i mean i've got to keep that otherwise it starts initiating auto shutdowns like no i wouldn't get this problem with wired and that's why this is like ladies and gentlemen this is why i just don't like wireless stuff in general there's always an extra problem that could go wrong and if it can go wrong what is it murphy's law if it can go wrong it will go wrong whatever will can happen will happen yeah kind of a weird like law it's like one of those laws where it's like duh but like yeah you know it's a philosophical thing i guess that makes people feel smart when they say it so we got to ask that how much do you guys think a strix 1080 is worth gtx 1080 plain vanilla not the 10 yeah three oh a regular in usd a 1080 if i can find one for 300 even today that would be a buy a lot of them now are about 350 though strixers are going for even more than that it seems yeah 300 us 400 aussie yeah that's where you want to get them at of course they go for a little bit more but that's where you want to get them yeah so i completely agree yeah it's craig you're getting used right i know my used graphics card that's the one thing i've been a huge proponent of i'm like look if you don't want to buy new you know if you want to save some money and you're not huge on like the peace of mind you get one fresh out of the box like buy used like graphics cards are you know a dime a dozen on ebay even now like with how tight some of the inventories are you can still find a number of graphics cards on ebay for decent prices maybe not the best you know maybe not as good as they used to be but um they're still competitive you know to the moon man bitcoin to the moon do you reckon it's going to go to the moon i have no idea my brother is so big on bitcoin i've never touched bitcoin or like any cryptocurrency just because a lot of it used to be totally unregulated and uh a lot of more pump and dumps as well i'm still i'm still mining zen cash believe it or not so what are you mining with what are you doing yeah i got 257 i got two asic miners upstairs so yeah they're on this is the thing right they're on the corsair power supply and they're whisper quiet and before that i was like why are these things so loud it was the power supplies they included just a quick right here right here and um they they the power supplies they included were just uh garbage like they weren't garbage they just had these really loud 40 mil fans and they just screamed like jets and so yeah i was like what is this and i didn't want to touch my miners because i didn't want to disturb them but no zen cash has been good to me and it's one thing that i've said on the channel in the last couple of years it hasn't been that good like in the last year it's just been completely flat there's nothing happening with it but it's the only cryptocurrency i sort of delve in and it's been fun and it has been a lot of fun so you're mining it you're not you're not just trading it you're actually i'm mining it but yeah i mean that's that's the thing i was you know i wanted the main reason i wanted to mine it too was like you're a proponent of what you do right so if you jump on an asic miner you're then pushing people out with gpus and it's like then i'm collecting those gpus on the used market so it was like hey guys how you doing yeah everyone should buy up asset miners and then put the gpus back to the people and that's what i did so you got i think if you practice what you preach you're gonna go you're gonna have a fulfilled life greg you're gonna have a fulfilled life oh is that so is that philosopher brian here tonight just killing it all right okay so now we've got the questions coming in i think when we ask for questions people just start going ham so i've lost track we had something about gtx okay in the uk i've sold gtx 970s for 100 pound what's that in the us 130 usd that's about right like that's pretty much about a right er right here i'm going to give you a right er on that one uh wireless headset depends if you want to spend 200 800 yeah that's true and we'll quickly go through some more questions if you see a question too that's juicy just jump on it so is 60 us a good price to sell lga 1366 or zeus p6t locally i'd say it's a little undervalued you can usually get closer like i'd say about 80 to 90 us you could get but if you if you're conscious about making a little you know that's a that's a man that's a ribeye phillips steak bro i wouldn't turn that down so that's just my opinion there i will zen 3 be more expensive than zen 2 at launch that's a good question oh i like this one i've got to sit back and think about this will zen 2 be more than zen zen 3 will that be more what do you think what do you go first what do you think will zen 3 be more expensive than zen 2 at launch uh it depends on a number of things i think i think the rate the markets are going now uh depending on how currencies are affected by governments just printing cash i think that you could end up paying more just as a result of just pure inflation or depending on how far we go into this you also have a deflationary spiral risk as well which would mean you have problems getting money at all and your money's worth way more than it used to be uh but i i think that aside uh the yield i mean the yields that's going to be a big challenge for any manufacturer going forward especially as you're approaching that threshold of like you know five nanometer and beyond like you're getting into some seriously crazy like wacky physics when you're talking about ultra nanoscopic degrees of precision so i expect the yields will be worse especially in the beginning and i think because of that we'll see higher prices per ship but i think that people will be willing to pay those extra those premiums if if the chips are that much better maybe not from an efficiency standpoint and a lot of people said that power consumption is not a huge deal to them that's fine whatever if the chip runs a little hot that's fine whatever if it's just core for core that much better i think they'll be okay with it i mean how much worse can it get intel's already kind of shafting us on their side with prices so unless they turn into an intel i don't see people complaining nearly as much two right that's it i just said two right so that's it i can play i agree with that my gut reaction though i was trying to like just gut reaction i think yes i think they're gonna be more expensive this is my gut reaction right i look at all the factors going on like you said inflation government's just printing money i think that's what's going to happen zen zen 2 will be cheaper than zen 3. same core like we're talking a call for core so good question i like it i'm gonna go with yep zen three will be more expensive um and you've got trends as well b550 is more expensive than b450 x570 was more expensive than the next 470. i'm just going to put my money down on yep going to be more expensive so let's move over now to the next question baby oh yeah we're going to do our accents so have you been man i've even got you a sound board here too right and you've got a sound board now with aussie noise noises so you can come on the stream and you can practice your aussie so with a human malware aside do you ever put tech yes loving into restoring a mechanical keyboard ah me cleaning out mechanical keyboards i did one in the recent parts hunt how i clean mechanical keyboards is so like i've watched people i've seen these videos where they're cleaning and they do they're spending hours and hours on cleaning a mechanical keyboard i've just got the quick tech yes method dude just get the the brush like i've got the soft brush just hose it in multi-purpose spray just clean it all up data vac bang that thing comes up like brand new and it only takes me five minutes now when i've got 20 keyboards coming in that are all used from les or from other people that i get to use keyboards from and they're dirty i got to clean these things up quick and get results so yeah i i do clean keyboards but i clean them in a different manner i could i go 99 with 10 of the time so i mean or maybe somebody would be like no it's only 80 percent bro 80 of the cleanliness so anyway yeah that's what we got so okay i think we're not going to go into crypto too much because uh we will start up a crypto conversation that we can we will never come back from it we'll never come back so what's the cut-off for pascal cards to be somewhat future-proof uh nothing ever really truly is future-proof right especially graphics cards versus cpus i'd say cpus have had a much better run than graphics cards um so when you're talking about graphics cards i'd say i mean you're 98 was pascal's that 980 ti sorry i uh pascal's 10 series sorry man seriously yeah it sensor so 1080ti is still going to be fine 1080 is going to be fine 1070 is going to be fine 1060 is going to start struggling a little bit i think with some of the games coming out soon and that's so i'd say cutoff would be 1070 for like you know if you're talking 1080p just good smooth fps at high settings or whatever yeah that should cut off um let's go next question next question ramo but you both said mining gpus were killed by intel what what do you mean killed by what do you mean i don't understand that question they might maybe they talk maybe they're talking about to each other sorry yeah okay someone said uh do you think 45 is a good deal for an h510 even though you don't recommend it uh i don't necessarily not recommend the h510 i think it's a nice looking case um it's not the best for airflow but it'll do it's not horrid uh 45 bucks is that's a great price um so i would definitely consider that especially like a budget build where you want your system to like look more presentable than it otherwise would in like a 300 build um or 400 build i think 45 bucks is a that's a fair price for hi even used okay so now we've got um okay well we're gonna start wrap up i think this like this is could ryzen 4000 compete or be intel current gen in gaming it could yeah that's what we're all waiting for that i think no one's going to know until it's released and i think amd's really going to work hard on that they know that's their that's their last thing they have to do is they have to beat intellect gaming if they can beat intellect gaming then they're going to finally be able to put them like then then the amd fanboys can finally go yep intel's finished but until then intel still is winning out on fps in games and it depends on which game you look at so they still are on top in general two right just gonna hit a two right there two right that's it ten nine hundred k worth it at four hundred dollars versus thirty nine hundred x 10 900 k is a good cpu man i'm using that right now so i'm doing a video where i if you guys saw on twitter and instagram stuff i made an amd rig i'm going to try the 3950x because i just jumped off x299 that was really good for editing videos 18 core 36 threads that thing was huge it was really good for editing it in adobe it was i called it the unstoppable force it was really it was a beast then we've got the i've tried i've been trying the 10 900k in the last week and i can already tell the differences there are positives and negatives that's the bottom line there's no there's no silver bullet there's no silver bullet in tech for anything you do remember this guys there's no magical cpu that's just going to do everything the best and i think you've seen that with threadripper you've seen that with ryzen you've seen that with intel as well they've got their own x299 platforms they've got their own mainstream desktop so there's no silver bullet in tech and so is a 10900k worth it depends what you're gonna do but i can tell you now it is a good cpu a really good cpu i think the biggest problem i have with the 100k is you can't even find it in stock for the price it's supposed to be listed at i mean if it was at msrp everywhere that'd be that'd be one thing but the only people selling them at least in the states on amazon where i imagine a lot of people are buying them are third-party you know small mom-and-pop shops marking them up by 80 it's it's insane like that that is the most frustrating part to me is i can't even you know even if i wanted to recommend a 10 900k i couldn't because there's nowhere financially feasible to buy one you know at least responsibly in australia they're coming in stock i think they got the 10 850k as well because the bins they had to release some of these cbu's that didn't make it to 10 900k so that's fair enough i got a question here when will we see the one and z xtx99tf two right that's it when we i didn't know you guys wanted a review of that i've sort of i've got it here i've got it here and i didn't even know that you guys wanted to review it so i'll review it if you guys want to see the one and z uh the x99 i got the 12 core for it i'll review it with the 12 core that's not a problem i love x99 i'll also probably do that bios mod for it i gotta say i do apologize for like the last two months have been there's been a lot of work coming through like in terms of other sponsor spots and all this other stuff and i've been i have been super busy with um flipping as well and i don't show a lot of that on the channel i wish i could and people like why don't you stream bro why don't you stream and why don't you stream your deals hunts it's too hard in australia aussie internet sucks as you saw yesterday on the live stream it cut out and that was just my internet it's weird um if i live stream that on wireless man that ain't gonna happen but also another thing is another reason i don't really live stream my builds and stuff like that is because i love listening to copyrighted music my channel would just get owned if i did that um there's i i i'm gonna be honest i do swear a lot off camera like it's just like i'm from queensland bro like where i'm from everyone swears up here like it's just it's part of your vocabulary so anyway yeah that's uh that's sort of why i don't live stream but anyway like not builds and stuff and like behind the scenes stuff but yeah maybe if maybe if we do it on twitch would you guys like to see it on twitch and we give it a trial ron i'm down for that i just gotta make sure it's yeah anyway right we're good we're good we got a donation as well which is really cool they say love the yes greg salazar earth is flat have you been saying have you are you a flat earther oh no not a chance no way i think that's bait is what that is just trying to beat me oh gosh is this pre-recorded no it's not man i can see chat i can see it live anyway all right so we're gonna um we're gonna bail we're gonna bail thanks for tuning in guys i'll next episode i i'll fix this wireless thing from buzzing in the chat sorry about that it's um yeah there's always there's always a problem but hopefully the product has been good today the product we got the chat we've got the windows we've got everything set up greg's not so uh stretched out this time and uh hopefully the mic is a little bit better maybe i don't know like is the wave three some people have said it sounds really good the chord this is the corsair wave three they send it over i was like okay you know what i love the virtuoso i'll give this a go so this is the wave three but i gotta figure out what this headset white's even though i've got audio from you i've got active audio from you it's like nope i'm uh i'm uh shutting down and it's like okay that's weird so and uh someone says pat the cat but because they're swearing so loud it's like hiding their messages they're asking all caps yeah all right guys anyway we're going to catch you guys in the next um where's brian what no don't keep the chat alive but don't keep the live stream alive by donating money where's brian i'm right here what what's going on oh with the eye where's brian p oh do they want a brian p do they like who's the wave three okay let's just do it down under it's time for you to go down under all right so here we go because you guys you guys like brian p you're talking about the are you ready let's go okay this is one good thing about the wave three it's got a it's got a limiter in it right so it'll it'll hard limit your voice so you can't clip so we can do it a little bit loud right you ready for this are you ready oh geez yeah are you ready let's go there we go not bad that is not bad at all so that's that's me yelling see this is the one good thing about the wave three you could yell into this mic and it's gonna not so you said that that did that wasn't bad is that what you're saying yeah oh it really it actually sounded really good at least on my end on skype it sounded really good awesome okay so that was a brilliant there's none of that weird none of that weird artifact or anything you get with some of the software clipping you know oh so it works really well that was the biggest benefit so i watched reviews on the wave 3 i was like man why didn't people just get up close and go hey here's the proximity effect here's how it sounds from here here's how it sounds from here that's what you want to know when you're buying a microphone especially a condenser you want to know that so i didn't really see anyone do a proximity test and i didn't see anyone really take advantage of just yelling into it because they're the two big factors of a micro like this feature right here is really good on the wave three like it's it's huge and that i think if you're live streaming you're not going to give you know you're not going to blow your viewers ear drums out so yeah zero clipping that's what people are saying so it wasn't just you it did sound pretty good yeah i kind of i mean i kind of know what i'm talking about here i'm not an audiophile necessarily but yeah there you go wave three like wave three man they've done a good job like look of course they push out some bad products i'll just say yeah guys should steer away from that one this one's pretty good like that's a good job good stuff yeah i want one of those is it xlr or usb is it usb it's just usb man so yeah oh man that's impressive yeah are you ready let's go that's enough are you ready i'm ready i'm not no i'm not gonna do it again i'm not going to yell so we're going to close off the stream with the accents guys no i don't just brian's doing those today no no

okay what you're doing right dude all right i'm getting into this man i'm gonna get this life he's already got it guys yeah i've got it going on so early in the stream my like headset was like you

uh to look for pc parts online like besides jumping okay okay i was looking on good old gum game tree how do you say it yeah gamtree game tree i was on game tree and uh i was looking around for some

well guys i hope you enjoyed the chat i've gotta hope you enjoyed the live stream hope you guys enjoyed the chat hope you enjoyed uh come having greg on you know this live stream's a bit of a chill it's just time to relax with you guys um and you know have a bit of fun and if we've got you know questions that you guys have to get answered you can answer them here it's all good uh we're all here to do that um in terms of just these live streams they come on randomly right they come on randomly and i just we want to sort of i do want to fix like i wanted to get a live stream that actually works properly that's the biggest thing uh because i'm so rusty with live streaming i think even that came out in today's live stream but hey i got it together with the sound board that you know the scent do you guys honestly like the sound board too let us know i kind of love it because it reminds me of heroes of new earth that was like i used to play that game it holds a place in my heart people one more thing before we get on out here people think that gaming culture is so toxic nowadays are you kidding me go back 10 years ago man that was proper toxicity like if you they did nothing about it if you guys played heroes of new earth 10 years ago oh my god this is why these sound boards exist because the the makers of the game knew how bad the community was and they made these trolling voice packs just to like try and ease things up and um it ended up making for some really good games like i mean look i you know i jump on a game right and i i get owned and then i get people like just pooping all over me and i'm kind of i'm an advocate of it like if i suck i deserve to get called out i don't know anyway i remember the old school like modern warfare lobbies when i was like fifth like not even 15. i was younger than that like bro they were they were they were just destroying kids in there like thankfully i didn't have a microphone because my parents i guess didn't trust me with one but uh oh man it was rough i always had to make sure i muted the lobbies because that's like just craziness coming out of the tv yes that's what i mean you just mute the lobbies like the option was there just to mute your teammates and that's what i mean but people then are muted and then they they whinge about like even there's isn't there even chat lobbies like there's free chat and then there's like auto shutdown initiating oh no okay all right that's that's time for me to get off the stream i'm gonna fix this headset for next time so you guys got the auto shutdown initiated so it's initiated my headset's going to close off soon but i can i can cancel it if i hit the sound board but yeah all right we'll catch you guys in another live stream very soon i think we kind of got it right this time but we got it wrong i don't know whatever yeah that's good man that's good well it's a livestream i i gotta dust off my live stream rust i i don't man i i sometimes i do i just get it so wrong but from here on in i'm using wired everything there's no more wireless in my life yeah okay all right thanks guys thanks for tuning in thanks for the donations too guys am i going to see it am i going to see it peace out for now wait up okay wait up wait up i'm gonna do a peace out for now in american first and we'll go down okay peace out for now bye peace out for now boy
