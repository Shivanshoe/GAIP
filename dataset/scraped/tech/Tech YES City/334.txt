if you are looking for the best Z490
motherboard either in feature set or for your money, than today we have nine
different motherboards which I have thoroughly tested over the last month and I'm happy
to report to you that there's pretty much good news for all these boards. Now
of course when it comes to a comparison between MSI, Asus, ASRock and Gigabyte
who holds the crown when it comes to the Z490 release let's go through the Z490
Taichi, Aorus Master, Plus TUF gaming Wi-Fi, Maximus Formula XII, MEG ACE, Z490-E
Strix ROG Gaming, Aorus Pro AX, PG Velocita Vs. Vision G.
motherboards and first of all the price let's pull this up here because these
are the MSRP in US dollars and from what I can check on you egg this is
roughly what they are indeed coming out over in the USA then when we look at
the price comparison compared to Australia this is important to note and
it's going to be a big theme going out of this video that is there is a pricing
differential compared to PPP terms to the US and that is it looks like
gigabyte is edging out here so in other words if you're in Australia the
gigabyte boards are going to represent the best value automatically based on
better rates that gigabyte of selling their motherboards in Australia for
asrock is following close second here and then a Zeus do need to fix up a
little bit of their pricing in Australia I feel especially the likes of the
formula 12 which is coming almost double that in dollar terms versus the US
dollar 500 versus 980 so with that said let's move over to the VRM the most
important thing with a motherboard especially in the likes of Z 490 where
you're most likely going to go out and buy a 10 900 K or an overclockable CPU
and you want to make sure that it's going to handle it at the very least out
of the box and of course if you want to put some water cooling on there you can
extract some even higher overclock so this is where I was happy to report out
of the box all of these motherboards in today's comparison did very well they
did so with good power efficiency to the Azurill PG velociter did win on both the
overclocked and the stock results with the power efficiency though the pro ax
do a good job here as well where that came in second place some of the other
boards though it wasn't much of a difference we're talking 10 20 watts at
best out-of-the-box and both overclocked though I will point out even though I
felt the formula 12 had slightly ever slightly the best PRM in today's
comparison its power consumption did go up because it's got so many extra
features on board like a massive amount of RGB as well as an oled readout so do
keep in mind if you buy this board you will be using more power even if you
overclock to 5.2 yigit's there's pretty much all the rest of the competitors in
today's graph though another thing I will point out here even though the
temperatures look the lowest on the tough gaming I did test this in lower
ambience and even though I've dealt or adjusted these results I feel like I've
seen this over the last few years where Delta adjusted results I feel aren't
100% accurate in that the cold of the temperatures are I feel that they favor
those that are tested under colder conditions even after the Delta
adjusting if that makes any sense if someone studied thermodynamics and can
tell me and validate what I'm saying here and why I would love to read your
thoughts on that but what it's worth out-of-the-box if you're getting a 10
900k letting it boost a 4.9 gigahertz old core you do not have to worry about
any of these motherboards in the graph and with that said it looks like the z4
90 tough gaming plus Wi-Fi is taking out the best value if you just want to get a
ten nine hundred K put it under some water cooling or a big air cooler and
then enjoy your CPU but what about the overclocked results here's where we're
moving in through that territory where a bed of erm poor some of the best VRMs do
matter and this is where the pro ax did a really good job as well as the
velocity even though the temperatures got hot their power efficiency still
remained very good in that even though they got less phases for instance versus
the Maximus formula 12 they did so with a lower switching rate I feel which is
represented in the temperatures and also the power consumption so both these
boards perform phenomenally well the vision G was still able to take the 10
900 K to 5.2 gigahertz but it did need more power and so it did start to lose a
bit of power efficiency at these levels the Z 490 tough gaming plus wasn't able
to get the CPU to 5.2 gigahertz the vrm just wasn't
good enough but that being said we took it to 5.1 gigahertz and it still did a
good job and considering it's one of the cheapest motherboards in today's
comparison I think the vision Jian is eight for ninety tough gaming are very
well justified even at that all the rest of the board's here in the comparison
that this Trixie the Meg ace the RS Pro X the master and the Tai Chi and the
velociter all do the phenomenal job of handling the 5.2 gigahertz
ten nine hundred K overclock with great power efficiency though now moving on to
onboard audio if you guys want to get a total solution and you want some of the
best onboard audio then I feel like the vision G did a pretty good job here as
well as the velociter and the pro ax for the money
the Z for 180 tough gaming it did have great crosstalk levels and it also had
decent bass roll-off but it did have a slight shake in the frequency response
curve when we tested that so the onboard audio on the TUF was decent though the
rest of the boards in today's comparison were good or very good in the case of
the Maximus formula 12 that was extremely good to the point where you
could even use the mic in for professional recordings versus the other
solutions which did have either noise or noise suppression being used on the mic
import but in terms of the output the Z 490 tough gaming plus Wi-Fi was the only
odd outlier here but even then it was decent enough of course what about
getting a high-speed nvme Drive and then wanting that to be cooled by the
included heat shields that these motherboards offer and this is where all
these boards here did a great job of cooling down um to drive you can see
that versus the no heat shield option which does take the nvme to very high
temperatures which if you're using it for prolonged times could invert some
throttling on that drive so basically they're all fine make sure that if you
want to use more than one m2 at high speeds make sure that the board you're
looking at has two of these m2 heat shields or you may wish to install one
yourself but if you're just using a single nvme driving at n900 k then all
boards are going to do an absolutely fine job there with all those
temperatures and results out of the way it's now time to talk about my
experience with the boards and the feature sets included which I feel if
you're buying boards especially at this price range you want to get a good
feature set that matches what you need so out of the four boards I'm gonna
point out a zoo sand as rock because they've got features that I like and it
depends on who you are Azusa have there AI features which you
got the AI overclocking they've also got the AI cooling which you can control
both of those in the bios then they've got the AI networking so if you're on a
congested network it can handle your packets and prioritize gaming packets I
have tested this out on their routers in the past and it has worked phenomenally
well as rocked on the other hand they do have their RGB control built into the
BIOS and for me personally this is why I would be picking an AZ rock board out of
the Z 490 lineup even though the pro ax is going to win in terms of total value
in today's comparison we'll get onto that later the internet update in the
bias as well is also an extremely handy to have feature so the other three
boards from gigabyte MSI and a Zeus they all have their software based RGB
control but I feel like Azrael definitely do get the nod for having
that RGB control on the bios and it can affect performance if you've got the
software on in Windows as I've been chucked in the past don't terms of the
BIOS itself from all these four companies in the years of use of that
BIOS I feel like all four companies have done a very good job however I did find
a slight problem in the vision Jie it's nothing that you can't work around and
same with the C 490 tough gaming when I did those individual reviews I'll put
the links to those reviews up here and also in the description for all the
boards that I've done dedicated reviews for but for what it's worth none of
these motherboards in today's comparison had any glaringly wrong problems that
would detract me from buying it was just some little problems that you may come
into and they're easily solved in the case of the vision G and the Z for
naughty tough gaming of course the last thing to talk about is how many PWM fan
headers these boards have how many USB ports they have if they have included
Wi-Fi 6 or Bluetooth 5 now you can check this out on the individual websites on
the spec sheets on the boards themselves though generally with Z 490 the more
money you spend the more USB ports you're gonna get on the back you're
gonna get Wi-Fi 6 included Bluetooth 5 and more addressable RGB and PWM fan
headers though with all that out of the way it's finally time to give you guys a
clear-cut recommendation on these boards and as I alluded to in the
intro with the price differences between Australia and the US if you can find any
one of these boards around their price point on sale then I would definitely go
with the one on sale because there really wasn't anything that would
wholeheartedly stop me from buying any one of these bullets in today's
comparison now if the board isn't in today's comparison it means that I
haven't tested it so I cannot give you a recommendation on that board
I have heard some bad things about some of the real entry-level as rock and
gigabyte boards so you may wish to check out individual reviews of those before
it's worth awards for value it's gonna go for the z4 90-plus tough gaming Wi-Fi
this board comes in with Wi-Fi six Bluetooth five you've got a really good
vrm for the $200 price point and if you don't need the Wi-Fi you can save twenty
bucks but the board performed phenomenally well throughout all the
tests and the ten 900k was able to get to 5.1 gigahertz now the onboard audio
was decent but at this price point if you want to get a Z 490 motherboard
that's going to do it all then this is a well justified board for the money so
with that aside the Z 490 tough gaming Wi-Fi definitely gets the award for
value having Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5 and also having a easy to use bios
overclocking quite well and giving you good vrm temperatures I felt like the
board really hit hard for the money and if you don't need the Wi-Fi 6 then you
can get it for $20 cheaper at 180 USD and it can still handle the 10 900k
absolutely fine now in terms of the vision G that board the aesthetics on
that easily wins out I thought it was one of the best-looking boards in
today's comparison even despite it having a typo which dad man pointed out
in the review and he sort of made a little joke about it but other than that
I'd say the $200 Vision G at 5.2 gigahertz it did start to struggle in
power efficiency so out of the box the Z 490 tough gaming Wi-Fi did very well but
the vision G had slightly better onboard audio so if you're going for the onboard
audio option with no Wi-Fi you might want to go with that choice around $200
though is stepping up now to the mid-range $250 around this area I feel
like this is personally where it is if you want to get a ten 900k and you
just want that bit extra because these options all had phenomenal onboard audio
and they also had phenomenal power efficiency and they had that bump up on
the vrm quality the pro ax objectively wins out in today's video i'm gonna call
it the number-one board out of all these nine motherboards I've tested here I
feel like it's a premium board at a mid-range price within the Z 490 realm
where you're getting a phenomenal vrm you're getting that Wi-Fi six Bluetooth
five really good onboard audio and everything worked out in terms of
compatibility and overclocking was a breeze though the velociter PG gaming
even though it had these little fans on board its power efficiency was the best
when overclocked in today's comparison and even out of the box as rock have
done a great job on the switching rates on the vrm to balance the temperatures
and give you really good wattage and power consumption whilst you're
overclocking and of course with those fans on board it's going to keep the vrm
heatsink quite cool so I feel like as rock have done a phenomenal job there
and I would be personally picking this board because of the polychrome RGB
built into the BIOS in the ISA views with internet flash if I need to update
my boss now one more thing though it doesn't come included with Wi-Fi 6 or
Bluetooth 5 so that might be a deal-breaker for you and also with the
onboard audio you want to keep it at a volume level at 90 or below other than
that though both these boards score out in the boards to get in my opinion then
of course going up to the top of the pack we had the e Strix rog gaming which
if you want to go with the Zeus's premium value option then that's going
to offer everything that these other two boards that we just talked about did but
it's going to come at a slight premium over the other two boards then we're
going up to the Meg ace that did a phenomenal job but it didn't really
stand out to me personally because it didn't really offer anything over what
the other options had this is a very similar story with the taichi the Auris
master and also the maximus formula 12 however the maximus formula does have an
integrated 10g Nick which did offer an absolutely gorgeous aesthetic and at the
same time offered the option to insert water cooling into the vrm heatsink as
well as having an OLED display readout but that
does come at a cost of slightly extra power consumption first the other boards
in today's comparison and with all that out of the way I hope you guys enjoyed
today's Z 490 roundup and comparison if you did then be sure to hit that like
button for us and also if you've got any questions or comments about any of the Z
490 boards please leave a comment in the comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can and then with that aside we got the question of the
day which comes from mad cat four-five-six
and they asked wait you can wash Ram with water so they're referring to our
Kenya's fix-it episode which we did up with a link up here where we did wash
some faulty ddr3 memory and it did end up working out in the end
make sure if you wash computer parts with regular tap water please be sure to
clean all the water off before you run any current through it but also at the
same time I like to put some multi-purpose spray or wd-40 on to
protect it and make sure it doesn't corrode over time
hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in another tech video
very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content be sure to
smash that sub button ring that bell on the way out and you'll get the content
as soon as it drops in your sub box peace out for now bye [Music]
