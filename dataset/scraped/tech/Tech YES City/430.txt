are you in the market for an rx 5700 but you want more performance yeah and do you want that performance now nah why not cuz I might max something up and if I do then I can't get my money back we'll have no fear cuz in today's video I'm going to show you how you can flash your rx 5700 into a 5700 XT and gain some easy performance now I got this card right here this is the gaming X I got it on a sale in Australia for 540 Aussie dollars this is pretty much MSI's flagship model with a cooler that's 1.4 kilograms so it's massive and it can definitely handle the heat on a 5,700 X T so when it's dropped down to a 5,700 it really leaves a little bit more to be desired now in order to get this working you'll have to download a program called ATI flash and you can get this from the tech power up website and I'll put all the links in the description below on how you can do this so let's get into flashing this thing and checking out the before and after temperatures and then comparing it to a 5700 XT like the Taichi here and seeing what kind of value for money you can get now before we do show you that a quick message from today's video sponsor if you're in the market for a new Zen to rise and creep down in CPU then a perfect motherboard for this is the x5 70 phantom gaming X from asrock with included Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth and also RGB onboard as well as a 14 phase vrm 2.5 g nic and amazing onboard audio this motherboard has you covered on all things motherboard lives in the description below to find out more so now that you've downloaded ATI flash it's actually a pretty simple process and also on the tech powerup website they have a list of pretty much every V bios available for pretty much any graphics card out there and so when you've got an Rx 5700 you do have to make sure that the cooler we'll handle the extra heat output since the 5700 XT will use a bit more power than the regular 5700 I've calculated in this case for when I flashed this model right here it was using an extra 40 Watts roughly then the 5700 was at its default clocks out of the box though since I said before this cooler is over-engineered for a 5700 it's not a problem and so what you need to do in order to do this is go to the tech power up website find the V bios file that matches the same model of your 5700 for instance we've got our rx 5700 gaming X here and when we look this up on the website it showed the V bios was available and also when I looked up the same model on 5700 XT it also had a V BIOS available and when I checked out the differences between these two V biases they were pretty much identical in every field except the hire clocks and also the power consumption numbers so I knew that this v bias was going to be pretty much perfect for flashing on this job now one thing to be careful of is don't go flashing another manufacturer's V bias on your card for instance I wouldn't flash in a zoo Strix 5700 XT on this MSI gaming X though I have funnily enough flashed an RX 5700 challenger bios to my tai chi here and since it does have a dual bar switch I'm now able to change this from a 5,700 XT taichi to a 5,700 challenger in just a simple flick of a switch so that is one benefit that does work with inboard partners themselves but for all intents and purposes we've got this model right here and we've got the 2 V biases that we need one to back up in case something goes wrong and if something does go wrong I'll show you how you can get your original V BIOS back on your card and get it back to its original condition so now you've downloaded the program and you've got your V biases ready what I like to do personally is I like to copy this whole ATI flash folder into my C Drive root directory and then I'll call the folder flash and so when I go now to the command in the bottom left hand corner type in I just type in CMD you have to right-click this and open as administrator and so this will open pretty much daus within windows and then here you can type in I like to type in CD backslash that'll pretty much take me to the C Drive directory then I type in CD space flash that's the name of the API flash folder and then I've loaded my V bios within this folder so it's important to have your v bosse files within the same folder and then what we need to do now is type in the name of the exe file the executable and that in this case is called AMD VB flash and then I want you to type in space and then - I and then hit enter and what this will do is it will display the adapter port on where your graphics card is at because you have to target the graphics card and make sure that's the one being selected so we can see here that the adapter says it's called zero and after we've found this out we're now ready to flash our card so do make sure that there's no thunderstorm going on there's also no services that it could crash your computer or anything really like in the case of your computer is working a little bit weird make sure your computer's a hundred percent nothing's going to interrupt this process and so here we type in AMD VB flash space and then we type in - P space 0 because that's the adapter as we found out before with that previous command and then we type in space hyphen F and what this is going to do is force flash in other words since these models aren't the exact same models usually it won't flash it in the GUI windows version and so this force command is going to force this 5700 xt bios to flash on our 5700 and then type in the name of our V bus which I believe I called my 5700 MSI dot ROM and now I hit enter and it's pretty quick it'll usually take around 10 to 20 seconds and then it will say flash confirmed it's all done and then we're ready to restart our computer and confirm that everything's ok so now after flashing this new BIOS on to this gaming S card we now have a 57 hundred XT gaming BIOS on our 5700 however it's not exactly a 5700 XT fully in their AMD in a lot of these models I have though heard that some of the earlier models were able to be fully flashed into a hundred percent 57 on txt but what AMD has done at least on this particular model here is they've laser-cut the die in that the max amount of stream processors that we can enable is the same as the 5700 that is 2,304 versus the 5700 X T's 2560 however that being said we do now have access to the higher power limits the higher clock speeds and also the memory throughput speeds I believe have been raised as well so testing this out in benchmarks we can see that this card gets a sizable increase over the original 5700 BIOS that it had on before and so it's to the tune of about 10% and it's free performance that you can get if you've got one of these graphics cards and pretty much every model that I've tested it out on here has pretty much responded positively to this upgrade and so now you've got free performance at your disposal you don't really have to do anything else you've got a really good value for money card that's gonna perform really well at 1080p 1440p and even 4k but one thing to keep in mind is as we spoke about in the intro I did have a massive cooler on this card and so you will get extra heat output roughly to the tune of 40 Watts at least in this model here so you will have to cool down that additional heat and so if your 5700 model has a really sort of cheap and lightweight cooler you may wish to be careful in doing this update but since this 1.4 kilogram cooler is ridiculously heavy and it's geared up to even a 5,700 XT and keeping that really cool we had no problems whatsoever so essentially what we're left with is something that is closer to a 5700 XT it's not quite there in the exact same numbers it does fall a little bit behind but it's still a sizable ink race over the 5,700 and that's about all there is to it with getting that extra performance out of your 5,700 and now for me personally I really like this I think it adds extra value for money to a graphics card that was already one of the best value for money graphics cards that you can get out there in the market and especially when we look at what you can get a 5700 for at the moment the prices are really cheap last time I checked on Amazon you can get one of these things for around 320 USD and that's with a decent cooler and then if we compare that to an Australia 57 hundreds I've seen them go for as low as 450 Aussie dollars there for me personally with this mod I'm super happy as for five hundred and forty Ozzie dollars I've pretty much got a flagship AMD graphics card which is about 370 USD and the cooling and noise is amazing on this particular model though what happens if you come into a bricked BIOS or something goes wrong in this process well that's where you're either going to need a backup graphics card or if you've got something with onboard graphics so for instance a Rison APU or an intel k cpu like a 9700 k with its onboard GPU portion you can then boot up off that GPU portion and after this you then have to boot your computer into safe mode by basically if you try to boot it up with this graphics card in and you fail to boot up your computer a few times it'll automatically give you the option to bring up a screen that says windows isn't burning properly you then go to troubleshoot Advanced Options and then you select four which is safe mode and then once you've booted into Windows in Safe Mode you then go to device manager and then you can disable your RX 5700 and then reboot the system and then once you're in the system again this time around in a normal boot you're then able to load up a TI flash and flash back on with the steps that we showed before your original v bosse that's the original rx 5700 bus but if for whatever reason techpowerup doesn't have your original v bosse enabled you can download from that same website gpu-z and you can then within that program make a backup copy of your V bus so I recommend of course having the original V bus before you attempt to flash to the 5700 XT and if anything goes wrong then you can get back to your original working card by doing this step and so once you've flashed it back to the original card you can then restart the machine and it should be back to its original condition and with all that out of the way I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know your thoughts and opinions on flashing this graphics card and getting that extra free performance love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and with that being said we have the question of the day which comes from the gaming Lance and they asked have you tried an ultrasonic cleaner and I'm actually going to try one very soon I've heard some really good stories about them I'm just thinking of the best one to get for motherboards and graphics cards because the bigger they get they get a lot more expensive quickly and so if you guys have the perfect size for motherboards and graphics cards let us know in the description below because I'm ready to get one and start seeing what they can do for the tech yes loving process anyway guys I'll catch you in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and as always you're enjoying that content and you're not yet subbed then the sub buttons down there ring that bell to get this content as soon as it drops here at check yes City and I'll catch you in and I'll check video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you [Music] [Music]
