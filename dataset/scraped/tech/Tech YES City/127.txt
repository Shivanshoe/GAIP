all of this year and most of last year people 
were out there looking they had 500 saved they   were used to seeing in 2019 2018 budget pcs 
that were available with good performance for   five hundred dollars but now it just doesn't 
happen they can't find that anywhere except   at tech yes city where we've got today a gtx 980 
gaming pc with a ryzen 5 3 616 gigabytes of ddr4   memory it's even got a bit of rgb now you're 
probably thinking brian what happened to this   gtx 980 that looks sick as bro where did you get 
that from and this gtx 980 it wasn't unfortunately   always sick as it was actually nauseous when 
i first picked it up 200 aussie dollars that's   what i paid for it it was dirty i then did what 
i do with used parts going forward and that is   popped it in the ultrasonic cleaner washed its 
dirty mouth out with some detergent and tap water and tap water and then i cleaned all the old paint off and then 
we re-sprayed it black and then of course i gave   it some multi-purpose spray to polish it off and 
protect it from any future rust and this is what   you're left with now a gtx 980 that not only looks 
like brand new but performs like one and some may   even think it looks better than brand new but i'll 
let you guys be the judge in the comments section   below let's pull up a price list of all the parts 
that we have in today's build and what we paid   for them with of course the gpu being one of the 
most important parts but also this ryzen 5 3600   motherboard and cooler combo that we picked up for 
a really good price i was quite happy with that   considering the six cores 12 threads on zen 2 that 
is going to be extremely relevant even if you want   to upgrade the gpu in the future once the rug gets 
pulled out from underneath crypto and gpu prices   on new products return to normal but until then 
we are going to be micromanaging here so let's   whip this build up put it together and see how it 
performs today's video is brought to you by asrock   and their z590 phantom gaming velocity motherboard 
featuring pcie 4.0 m.2 support as well as a three   centimeter personalized moss fan covering the 14 
phase vrm for overclocking and lastly if you're a   gamer you've got dedicated lightning game ports 
which allow you to separate the latency of your   keyboard and mouse on separate controllers 
links in description below to find out more so   and this build is all complete it is looking 
schmick but one really good thing about this   whole process was it was one of the quickest 
pcs i've built all year just there was minimal   cables to use on this power supply the ram 
the x and ps they lock in straight away   with this b450 motherboard that we 
used and for the ryzen 5 3600 we don't   really need to overclock it just whack in your ram 
xmp profiles that's kind of going to be the safest   easiest uplifting performance that you can get 
and then inside we've got only one exhaust fan   so we're going to check the temperatures on 
this build right now to see how it turns out   but since the ryzen 5 3600 especially while 
you're gaming won't use up a whole lot of   power and the gtx 980 definitely isn't as power 
hungry as say the titan x that we tested recently   i'd say this whole build will end up being 
okay even with the side panel glass on but   we won't know until we install windows so let's 
get that installed and start those benchmarks and all the testing is now complete with a build 
like this i am pretty impressed with the price   performance but also the aesthetics now i did 
go to the extra length to clean the motherboard   and also the gpu and that can take a little bit of 
extra time but i do recommend that because in the   case of the actual case itself that is brand new 
and that means that we've kind of got like a build   that presents like a whole new pc now in terms of 
the numbers itself you've got the option here and   this is what i'm gonna start recommending going 
for with pc builds because this pc build came   at a pretty good price considering what's going 
on in the market but i think if you get a build   like this you can at a future date sell this gtx 
980 and then upgrade to something more powerful   because i'd say the gtx 980 especially if we're 
looking in the background here we got cyberpunk   running it wasn't the best fps experience i mean 
we're getting around 48 fps on low settings at   1080p in cyberpunk but when we went to dota 2 
which i've been testing in the heavy team fights   we were getting a pretty similar fps to the other 
two builds that i featured here on the channel   and that is we're getting 134 in those massive 
team fights at 1080p maximum settings and so this   build will do the job for playing all those games 
at 1080p with smooth fps now the ryzen 5 3600   that did a good job on the physics score so we'll 
move over to the fire strike score and this is   one of those benchmarks that anyone can compare 
their numbers to just to see how much not only   price performance they're getting out of their pcs 
but also how powerful their pc is in general and   usually i like to have the gpu score coming over 
the physics score but you'll start seeing a bit   of a trend at least while the gpu prices remain as 
high as they are for the new gpus you're going to   probably see more the physics score being higher 
than the gpu source because typically i like to   have this gpu score around double uh the physics 
score that's always been a good balance for me but   of course we've got here now 13 750 which is below 
that of the 18 500 that we got on the physics side   so the ryzen 5 3600 very capable cpu it boosts 
up to 4 gigahertz in games and the funny thing   about the temperatures was it like to stay around 
60 degrees but this is the first time i've been   benchmarking with a ryzen cpu or any cpu for that 
matter where all the temperatures on the numbers   were exactly the same even though the loads were 
different between the cpu cores i don't know maybe   this is just the weird ryzen sample or maybe the 
afterburner program was bugging out a bit but the   temperature was exactly the same across all those 
cores so that was pretty good to see or maybe i   just mounted that cpu cooler with perfection and 
or maybe the ultrasonic cleaner clean the surface   of that ryzen 5 3600 to perfection whatever the 
deal is we've got a pc now that looks brand new   the temperatures are really good on the cpu the 
noise is really quiet as you can hear i've got the   mic right here pc's right here running cyberpunk 
and it's burning up about 230 watts from the wall   the max i measured was 238 watts so it's going to 
be pretty good on power as well especially while   you're playing games though if i was to critique 
one thing about this build it would be that   cooler on the gtx 980 these older reference card 
coolers they although they remain relatively quiet   they do so at the cost of temperatures where this 
gpu even the 23 degree celsius ambient environment   is still going up around 80 degrees so it still 
likes to remain kind of toasty where i like my   gpus personally in the 60s and max 70s if i can 
get away with it but then again this graphics   card will do perfectly fine considering we only 
paid 200 aussie for it or about 150 us and i think   going forward if you guys are looking to build a 
decent price performance pc you can definitely do   so you've just got to look at the cards that are 
a little bit older and they're a little bit more   inefficient compared to the newer cards because 
the miners won't be targeting something like a   gtx 980 anywhere near the level that they would 
be targeting say an rtx 3060 ti anyhow guys that's   about it for this build do let us know in the 
comments section below what you think of the whole   cleaning process the whole build process here do 
you like the combo of the parts do you like this   new angle i'm going with these price performance 
pcs i think for me it's exciting because i get   to start building again i'm noticing some of the 
prices are coming down especially when i pick up   these gpus on the used market and i pick up things 
like a ryzen 5 3600 combo yes it's not the best   price performance i've built on the channel but it 
does remind me of better times and that's the most   important thing because that's what brings a smile 
to my face and of course hopefully this video   brought a smile to all your faces and if it did 
be sure to hit that like button and let us know   in the comment section below what you like best 
about the build love reading your thoughts and   opinions as always and with that aside i'll catch 
you guys in another tech video very soon and if   you stay this far and you're enjoying that 
tech yes content then be sure to smack that   sub button and ring that bell on the way out 
and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye foreign
