tech yes meta of ready to go gaming pcs and they got this thing ready where you can just order it click and collect the same day you order it meaning there's no down times if you want to get in with games like cyberpunk now i'm adding my personal touch with today's gaming pc whoever wins it is going to also get a free copy of cyberpunk 2077 thrown in so i'll be putting all the necessary links in the description below without further ado let's bring down our special guest and get him to build your next gaming pc hello tech yes citizens i'm going to be building you a gaming pc today have you ever built a gaming pc before no i've never done it but is it difficult or easy because i mean is it anything like i used to do nuclear fusion and rocket science well i'll give it a go well it's nothing like nuclear fusion and rocket science which you've already done many pieces on in the past so this should be a breeze for you and the funny thing is i hope it doesn't go up in a bang so first things first we are going to mount the power supply in the pc and uh which one of these do you think is the power supply i'd go for that one there that one right there that's exactly right and where do you think we mount this just on the side there where the power goes in just there yep perfect let's do it so let's uh i'll let you uh put the power supply in there okay and now the orientation of this the fan has to go down because otherwise it won't be able to suck cool air into the the power supply to cool itself down it goes down like that yeah there it is i know the other way around like that way okay yeah and then you just put that in and we might want to mount the cables in first yeah so what we'll do is we'll yeah so we will actually get the cables on first so i've got the cables you need here yep so we'll just put those on right here and they're modular cables so i have to put down the camera and quickly show you how to do this [Music] okay [Music] step one complete done so we've done the power supply it's now time to install the ddr4 memory here and so what i've done is i've actually lined this up for you so all you have to do is put the boat apply pressure on both ends at the same time and then push the ram into the slot there we go and do that for the second one how easy is that too easy now uh we're working on the motherboard since uh mum's not here can i call it the father board you can yeah so we're gonna just we're gonna install the father board soon so for this next part i'm actually gonna do this because if you mess this up you can potentially brick the whole build or you can have a lot of troubles on your hands and that is installing the cpu and more so not bending any pins now one thing is is when i've uh went to retailers recently they're showing me these motherboards and they're checking me or making sure i check the pins on camera when i buy motherboards and i said i asked them like i've never had this in the past why is this and they said lately so many people been buying motherboards or cpus on the ryzen side and having bent pins bringing them back and saying it's a retailer's fault so it is a little bit sensitive and see here we've got to go careful be really careful and just let the cpu slot into place making sure you don't bend any pins or anything in the process so that's installed like that and do you want to push that clip down so you push it down and then you slot it into underneath now you got to bring it to the right a little bit and then no no no no not the bolt just bring that into the right like that no no no yeah like that oh okay yeah just push it down quickly to make it look like you've done it there you go too easy all right dab man you just installed the cpu all right dad man for this next part do you want to um do you want me to install the motherboard and then you put your hands in the shot and make it look like you've installed the motherboard yeah why not so for this next part we're going to just put the motherboard in like this where you've got to be careful when installing a motherboard to the most important part is to make sure that the anything on the back here doesn't scratch the standoff uh screws where i've had people um build their own pcs locally here and they've they've got a build that doesn't boot up and then i've asked them i said what's going on and i've checked it out and i've seen things busted off the back of the motherboard so uh for this next bit that you can grab the motherboard but be very gentle in putting and lowering it in now so yep just lower it in don't don't scrape anything or scratch anything when you're lowering the motherboard in and then just uh i'll help you here so you just grab the steel plate and just you can grab usually grab the heatsink if it's got one we're just lining it up now with the stance do that stand off we've got we've got a guide one right there and so that's it now all we have to do is now screw these nine holes through with a screw and the motherboard will be in place [Music] mate you are a natural with this actually let's come out that good and put this back on [Music] [Applause] all right so that's the nvme drive wow wow okay so now we're going to put the cpu cooler on so i've pre-installed this cpu cooler here where i took these two fans out that were on this case and i put them at the front here in front of this water cooler so how we're going to do this is i'm going to put some thermal paste down here because i had to take the thermal paste off just so it's shooting i had to do camera work for the video but i'm going to put some thermal paste on here and then all you have to do is put it on and then screw it down you ready for that yeah for sure so like that grab that grab that one so i'll give you this one put it [Music] [Music] so now we're going to install the extra rgb in this computer where we've got three fans going in and an rgb strip so just screw these off here i've just started setting some free menu in the computer industry the computer now has a fan club and here's the final part of the build now dab man you just got to do some cable management so you know how to do this yep i certainly do you just wave your hand in front of it just tie off here tie off there tie off there down there and it's done yep easy [Music] ah now brian all jokes aside this has been a fascinating experience of all that a lot so you've learned how to build a pc yep now take your citizens hit the like button and jump in with a chance to get this giveaway pc though there is one more question what do you want to name this pc in windows 10 uh well i can read their gigabytes call it data bytes and so me and dadman have just built this gaming pc it's time to check out the temperatures and the performance and see how well the data bite gaming pc runs [Music] and we are now at the finish line with the data bytes gaming pc we've tested the temperatures and they are really cool they're really quiet which is what you want for that final end game gaming experience in terms of fps we've got three different resolutions we benchmark these games at 1080p 1440p and 4k and it's going to do all those resolutions absolutely fine depending on the settings you want to play around with cyberpunk being a very demanding game you'll definitely want to keep this on in my opinion medium settings with dlss turned on pretty much at all resolutions because as you're stepping down to 1080p you'll definitely want to get some high refresh rate if you're using a build like this for gaming now some final things to go over giveaway pc thank you guys so much for watching the channel in 2020 and all the support you're giving us it really means a lot to me when you guys just hit that like button you get in on the action you guys are providing suggestions for videos too and i'm checking that out now i do want to apologize too in this video if i've missed a suggestion or if i've missed an email or if i miss replying to someone i do apologize it's just hard keeping up the whole rhythm of doing videos and and everything and also keeping up the energy with 2020 being in such a crap year but it's just hard doing all that and then not yeah like your attention span is just it starts to get burnt out and so i do apologize if i've missed one of those suggestions even if i said i'd get onto it my memory has just been like all over the place just trying to get what's ahead of me one day at a time and that's how i've been working and getting through 2020 it's just been the next day and then the day after and that's pretty much it but this one right here guys this is a big thank you to all you guys that support us and i hope one of you guys out there has a great gaming experience on it once you get this pc now it's going to be an international giveaway and i'm going to pay for the shipping as well doesn't matter where you live in the world you're going to get it now if there are some rules in your country then technically i'm going to be selling this gaming pc to you for a dollar and in terms of what else you can be uh doing with this gaming pc there's also some custom cables that we threw um that will they go into the ple build so if you buy this in australia from ple you're going to get the cable extensions and they're going to be pre-installed you're also going to get this surge protection power board which is actually a nice little touch you do want to have uh surge protection with all the lightning storms going on recently and here's the funny thing about uh lightning storms which is kind of off topic to this video but after a massive lightning storm on the gold coast i'll get a couple of messages the next day like oh man my computer isn't working properly can you help me fix it from people who've bought pcs in the past so it is a real scenario it can mess things up so definitely make sure your pc is on a surge protection point and that aside great pc thanks uh again for intel and ple and also gigabyte for sponsoring this one out and it's gonna be an awesome gaming pc the reason we didn't use the extensions in today's build it's because dab man built it and we just wanted to not confuse him or not confuse you guys and i actually personally prefer the all black cables with the build with just the rgb and the clean components inside as well as the fact that cable extensions will add a lot of extra clutter in the back of the pc which i feel is going to be a very tight fit for cable management if we decide to put them on with the 275r but now for some more specifics about the giveaway links in description below in order to enter there's more entries you can gain by doing some other things but the most important thing is is that you subscribe to the channel you've hit that like button and you've dropped a comment in the comment section below because i'm actually going to be picking the winner from gleam but they're also going to have to make sure that they've commented on the video and so those two have to line up if you haven't commented on the video then unfortunately i'm going to redraw the winner because i want to make sure that people are watching through to the end and they've been supporting the channel and they've been watching the content in order to get a real chance to win this pc because of what happens with giveaways is a lot of people just come in and then they don't watch the content they've never really watched the content and supported the channel but they just want to quickly get in with a chance and move on to the next channel or move on to the next giveaway and i actually want this giveaway to go to someone who's been sticking around tech city over the years which i know a lot of you guys have been or someone who's new and they're loving the content and with all that out of the way the winner will be determined in two weeks time and i'm going to update this video with a top pinned comment and announce the winner on twitter as well as emailing you directly so it's going to be hard for you to miss out on getting this gaming pc if you're the winner so make sure you check your emails make sure if you've got an email that's been closed off or whatever make sure you come back to the video and check because i'm going to redraw the winner if you don't claim it within 48 hours and also do let us know in the comments section below what was your favorite part of 2020 here at tech air city and what do you want to see more of and don't worry there's going to be no disqualifications in the comments section you can double comment that's not how you're actually winning the giveaway this time around and with all that out of the way we have the question of the day here which comes from geo ochoa one and they asked does this need a wi-fi adapter to play wirelessly they're talking about a pc we did a while ago for call of duty put the link up here and most budget pcs are going to need wi-fi adapters you can get the pcie adapters if the motherboard has the m.2 slot you can get an m.2 wi-fi adapter or you can get a usb adapter usually the usb ones are the cheapest and i find if they're a decent brand and they continue to work fine or if you get one that's got a lot of good feedback those are the best to go for and pretty much it's going to cap out at your internet so if you've got 100 megabits per second download getting a 360 megabits per second wi-fi adapter is not going to make a difference to your internet speeds so that's the most important thing most time most people only need the 100 or the 150 megabits per second wi-fi adapters though do make sure you get one that does work because i've gone through a lot of cheap wi-fi adapters that are just absolutely terrible but i've also finally in the last few months found a wi-fi adapter that is cheap and it does work pretty well though also make sure you tune in tomorrow we're going to be doing a live giveaway stream too and that's going to be with some other goodies given away live on the actual live stream so stay tuned for that and also a big thanks to dadman for coming in and making this year's giveaway just that much more special i know you guys love him i love him as well and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
