all right going live going live we should be live live you're back with a tech yes city live stream welcome back all you beautiful people out there and today we'll be doing the pc parts price watch but of course this month is just like every other month in 2021 where gpu prices have been affecting pretty much everything so we're gonna be building on live stream we're going to be building two options if you want actually three options if you want to build a pc so come and get relaxed get in chat and uh come and join on in we're going to be having a bit of fun and hopefully i've fixed my camera issues this time because last time we had some teething issues with the camera but i've changed a few things around i turned off the auto focus for one so we won't be going and then number two was we uh we i set the camera to 24 fps for live streams because we're going to go through a hdmi uh cable so we've got designs by our what's going on guys it's got to bring that energy i've got to bring that into you i can go actually we can just uh we'll try what's going on guys let's fill that energy fill that energy and it's uh if you're in queensland uh we just unfortunately we we're in lockdown again so uh it's probably a perfect time to tune on in we'll talk about all things tech but uh the biggest one here is uh so brian have you done any mods to the stinger oh okay we'll quickly do a bit of questions uh the only mod i've done is i put a little body kit on mine so there's it's not even a body kit it's just like these um i just wanted to make my stinger look a little bit different so it's got a rear flare and it's got some side skirts and a front thingy and uh but we're gonna talk about this first piece of news here because it's pretty big like when you look at it it has the ability again what we've said in the past with ethereum is where all the gpu mining is going everyone who's making money on gpu mining is mining ethereum and so from august 4th they're doing what's called eip1559 aka the london hard fork and so on this essentially they're turning the base fee they're turning gas fees which is what the miners make into base fees which the miners are no longer going to make and so they're going to instead get get incentive tips and so what this means is is that basically no one really knows how this is going to affect mining profitability and so it's actually a pretty scary thing when you look at it all these guys that are buying gpus and a lot of these guys that are buying the gpus there's guys out there doing it as a career right now they're starting up farms of hundreds and even thousands of gpus and no one even knows how this is going to affect the ethereum profitability which as we've established in the past is literally like where all the mining profit is it's where all the volume is and it's where all the uh market cap is in cryptocurrency right now for miners all these other coins that we've spoken about their daily transaction volumes cannot simply handle the amount of miners that there are out there looking for profit so when we look at it we've got someone here this is the tim tim baco so he's uh he's the core ethereum developers he said in an interview that the user base fees now account for somewhere between 25 to 75 gas fees paid to miners so if you're taking away these base fees you could potentially be taking away 75 percent of the fees paid to minus that's a massive drop in profitability but at the same time it's 25 to 25 to 75 percent this is like no one even knows so so that's what i'm saying with all gets fourth what's going to happen again this is the uh this is the element of cryptocurrency that roller coaster element that at any given day the rug could get pulled out whether it's underneath the guys investing in the hard crypto themselves or the guys buying the gpus for mining so um yeah this is the big news that if you're waiting august 4th could potentially be a day of reckoning could potentially be a day of reckoning for gpu prices it's just like as it says here the guys the core ethereum developers he doesn't even know it just says 25 to 75 percent so it could be like usually you go somewhere in between 50 percent but if mining profitability gets cut in half um if my mining property gets cut in half it's going to be better it's going to spell better prices but in the meantime gpu prices right they're still pretty bad like 6700 xt we're tracking that still going for around 700 usd but in the meantime if you want to build a budget and i'm talking real real budget and people are asking in the comments you got a linux build uh brian done any linux build i'm gonna do one someone donated on the last stream they were like dude do a linux build it's gonna be happening i'm gonna get my last time i did linux um i tried it and i was like i can't use this for video editing so i mean me personally i i'm gonna be honest i ragequit linux sorry but uh we'll give it another go especially if you're a budget gamer and you're looking for a different experience and you stick in microsoft which is perf perfectly fine then maybe linux gaming pc might do you well but uh we got here the first up if you are on a strict budget and you just want something decent for gaming and now don't hear me out here hear me out here hear me out here gt 1030 i i never thought i'd see the day where i'd be saying the gt 1030 isn't such a bad buy never thought i'd be saying the day but if you're on a strict budget here we go i5 44 40 8 gigabytes of ram one terabyte hard drive 110 bucks you just slap in a 120 gigabyte ssd go get yourself one of these little guys right here gt 10 32 gigabytes 85 bucks you get yourself a budget gaming pc you'll play cs go play all these easy to play titles dota 2 all that stuff and you you're still on you coming in around 200 bucks not too bad not too shabby now what i've calculated here because the gpu prices are still pretty bad what i've calculated here is we can put together a system for for four hundred dollars with a 2200 g and that's not going to be great right 400 bucks you're probably better off buying a a series s like you see here xbox series s 340 dollars i mean that's not that bad like if you really need a game with good frame rates at 1080p the series s is going to do the job and uh for some of those pop like if you're playing call of duty or whatever this thing should i think it does support mouse and keyboard for a lot of the especially the big games that everyone like fortnight i know mouse and keyboard works on the series s so there's there's options out there if you don't want to get completely ripped off uh from the mining the miners right now or the whole gpu prices that it's associated but if you're looking if you're looking to build a game pc like right i gotta build a gaming pc i have to build one then we'll go through some of the uh rigs that you ca i was kind of surprised i was like okay it's still pretty expensive but this is something that's often overlooked is something like an old hd 7870 it's two gigabytes 75 bucks this thing will do a pretty good job and it's like honestly i know it's not much to look at but it's only 75 dollars if you're desperate and you need something buy it now and you can't look locally for some deals this will do the job even though locally here i'd be trying to pick one of these up for 50 aussie dollars it should be like maybe 38 usd so it is a little bit overpriced but at least you're not going to get completely obliterated that's the whole point uh so you're looking at 7870s one 1gb that's going under the radar not getting focused especially not getting focused by miners so that's the whole name of the name of the game right now and you can buy a h410 motherboard go get yourself a i don't know why i've got an empty tab up there but i put together two builds so i go you get an es gaming for rgb ring fans this is what it's all about uh marco asked how do you install how do you install a xeon on on a series s you can't install the xeon on a series s it's unfortunate it's unfortunate but the zeons they will make their play the zeons will make their comeback attack yes city the xeons will come back once uh we see gpus like readily like like the rx 570 used to be or the rx 470 used to be on aliexpress when you could pick them up for like 90 80 and they were just all in stock on aliexpress they were the good days that's when you're coupling those things with a z uh with a z on and you were getting a really good uh pc even like 350 bucks you could build yourself something much better a year ago of aliexpress than you could now so we got here four ring fans 65 64. not too bad considering from the reviews here the two guys are like wow the rgb lights up brighter than ever and that's a good point if you want to resell your pc in the future and then you got a 500 watt power supply 40 bucks you can't really go wrong at that price and then an ssd 512 gigabyte 480 gig by ssd and they're going for uh 50 dollars which isn't too bad either and then you've got 16 gigabytes of ram 65 3200 megahertz cl 16 now simba i got no idea what a symbol what is what is this brand name uh it's like they call you call it the lion king but uh hey if as long as the as long as the um as long as the ram itself is fine i don't care what heatsink they put on it that thing's 65 bucks it's gonna serve your uh build right now all this tallied up if you buy these you'll get a pc that's around 400 now you can also go with the 2200 g if you want something that's got better upgrade path because the h410 is pretty much an end of the line socket with the 11400 f you're not really going too far with that maybe put in a 10 400 f get 6 cores 12 threads but you're not really going to be an h410 motherboard you're not really going to be banging in the 99 are you so you're not really you don't really have some upgrade parts as opposed to going with the 2200 g option you uh will have a few upgrade paths as well as a b450 which is a little bit cheaper the b450 is coming at 64. so it's actually pretty good value and you that's going to both these builds are going to go for around 400 which honestly when i look at the prices when i look at the prices of the gpus i'm kind of sitting here just disappointed right now because like if 400 for a 2200 g build is just it's bad like it's not that good value right but that's that's kind of what you have to do right now you kind of have to wait it out but then again you're just better off getting a series x and xbox series s which is actually going to perform really well and you just can't build a pc right now off the internet that will beat a series s i mean locally here if you want to find the deals and i always recommend going up oh daniel marison thanks for the new member so sweet i love the styles of videos thanks man i've uh we're good last last month we've sort of been doing the whole uh new camera i've got all this i've got a bit of a new reinvigorated energy here because put it this way used at least for the guys who want to get price performance used is going to be pretty much the only way to go in the next few as long as these gpu prices remain as high as they go the miners are pretty much going to be strangling the rest of the industry and you're going to see it it's going to get worse as long as these gpus the prices still remain high a lot of the guys who are manufacturing motherboards cases you name it ram and all this stuff they're going to be scratching their heads like guys we're struggling out here we need to do something so i mean companies like msi and zeus and gigabyte they're doing pretty well and that's mainly because they're bundling and i know this from all the retailers that i talk to they're bundling a lot of their parts and that way they can get rid of their motherboards and all their other stuff coolers cpu coolers power supplies you name it cases so uh or you could get a steam deck oh man the st isn't this the steam decks months away a month away so who knows when the steam deck's coming out i mean people like you're gonna get a steam deck i mean i'm to wait and see with a steam deck i'm going to judge that once it comes out i mean i've sort of got i've got mixed feelings i mean i like what gabe's done with the hardware on the steam deck i just think we could uh is your hair purple uh kinda yeah it went red and then you mix red with gray and brown and yeah i guess you get purple i mean if anyone's into painting maybe they can mix a bit of brown red and uh yeah gray together and let me know what color you get this is what you end up with so honestly people ask me why did you die why did you dye your hair man why'd you do it i'm just bored like i'm really bored i want to get over japan as soon as possible that's that's like a big thing on my mind right now i've been like every time i apply to get an exempt to see my son i get rejected by the government and you know i'm at the point now i'm just like i'm getting like that's if there's only one thing that i'm sort of frustrated about is the ability that i can't see my son yet you've got these people that can jump on planes to go see tennis matches at their own at their beck and call so like that's what i think a lot of people are getting frustrated with that crap right now it's like you know hey tom cruise where you at man uh yeah yeah just just just casually fly on a plane see wimbledon tennis match you know what i'm saying it's easy hey brian what are you doing ah trying to see my son man oh just getting rejected you guys you gotta stay in lockdown dude you gotta stay down stay put boy it's like what's going on here uh anyway start swimming i think godzilla's got man or i could jump on godzilla's back and he could i could hitch a ride to japan from godzilla so i know you're paying bro i've been going gray since 16 damn cletus 16. i think i was going grey from about 28 or something so it wasn't that bad um but yeah the only thing like i want to go full gray i just can't find great hair dye like i just want my hair to be consistent i got like grays here and everywhere that's the only thing about my hair uh i just want consistency as anything right if you buy a pc you want it to boot up and stay booted up no one likes inconsistencies so the same should go for your appearance too anyway yeah we'll stick with chat a little bit but let us know what do you guys think in terms of uh if you guys got questions as well drop them in the chat and we'll address them uh because we're pretty much like and when it comes to the gpu prices right now we're pretty much addressed everything man like we slugged through all the topics today uh we've also got the channel sponsors as well if you want to get the microphone that we're using for this live stream people just keep asking for it they're like brian what microphone do you use it's like it's just the elgato wave three 150 bucks you don't have to do anything just plug the usb in and if you've got crappy on-board audio another thing is too is that this has got a headphone jack too so you can plug in headphones to this and you'll get better sound than a really cheap motherboard so if you're going with these used pcs especially if they're laptops laptops are renowned for having some of the worst on-board audio in the gig then you can get a wave 3 and it will save you not only when you're talking to people doing live streams whatnot it'll also save your ears if you've got a decent pair of headphones you want to get them powered decently too then we've got of course the windows 10 key you can use it for a windows 11 key just bang that sponsor spot in bftyc and you can watch that price go down to 14 even though we kind of got to like drop it down here because the chat's blocking off there's the 14 so you drop in that bftyc coupon code snag yourself a key right here right now and you get it cheap ladies and gentlemen you get it cheap and look at that change my shipping address to austin now texas because i was having some problems uh checking out prices on parts by having it in beverly hills i think beverly hills is in california so i was having some problems there with uh beverly hills and uh another thing we're gonna talk about too is in the last stream we're having some issues where the camera was cutting out i actually had a friend who uh messaged me recently brian i need to activate my windows you got any codes uh designs by five men links in description uh designs by far links in description brother just use that coupon code bftyc you'll snag that discount single end user license brother uh brian blame your premier as she went to tokyo when no one in your state wanted it to go yeah i mean i would have gladly switched places with her and i would i could have just stayed over there and given you guys some used parts hunts in japan um i could have been an ambassador and i could have got to see my son in the process too that would have been amazing so actually i'm going to call up the queensland government that's my local government here and just complain and be like yo do you want to um do you want an ambassador but another thing on the news was i think jay's two cents made a video on like a pc like what they they're limiting they're limiting certain gaming pcs being shipped to four states in the usa uh like what was what was the go with that like i mean talk about government regulation uh overdrive here like what what is the purpose of this they're limiting power consumption on gaming pcs or they're trying to make things more efficient yet i i think that would be the least like this is with with with governments this is the least of their concerns right now they're worried about implementing stupid restrictions in states in places when they should be worried about addressing people who are sick the homeless all these other things that matter to a society yet people are wasting taxpayer money on stupid restrictions on on a gaming pcs i mean like yeah i mean way to go just pretend that everything's um everything's perfectly fine in the world right now we need to strive this is like the people who have got tunnel vision and they're focused on the issues that don't matter when you should be focused on the issues that do matter so um i know i know it might be overblown but it's like the process in the red tape um the the process and the red tape involved is just why governments uh just right now like nowadays governments are doing is doing a terrible job of everything so oh man so anyway we've got our questions we'll get back to tech because yeah no one really likes politics but sooner or later you got to talk about politics and yeah i mean it comes in because you're paying everyone's paying their tax dollars everyone pays taxes for this crap so soon i think it affects everyone you know like for instance in australia i work i work four months of the year right in australia work three to four months of the year for the government that's free work and everyone when you start thinking about your process of how you work you are working for the government three months of the year four months of the year which is actually a scary thing for nothing and that's how that's how crazy the whole system is so in some ways you do have to talk about it sooner or later stop only reading click bait title video titles oh well thanks man i guess it worked then thank you for the compliment that's that's awesome super upper nerd i guess that worked then brother i got you to join the video you clicked on it man so hey brian is it okay to use a strix b550f wi-fi motherboard with a 5900 x yeah definitely um the 50 the strix motherboards like from what i know every time zeus puts a strix on it it'll be absolutely fine you could you could overclock on the strix b550f2 should be able to overclock absolutely fine for air and water overclocks a lot of the motherboards now i'm finding um i'm finding a lot of the motherboards uh are really sort of getting overkill and they're trying to oversell the motherboards when you know like for instance i just tested the riptide i mean some people like look don't get the riptide get a b450 and if you're looking for pure value yeah b450 is still where it's at on amd's lineup of things but if you're if you're going for an x570 you want to overclock the 5950x 180 that's all you need to spend on a motherboard really just add a little wi-fi chip in it and you get yourself a phenomenal board so i was actually kind of impressed with that you don't you know there's all these boards out there for four five hundred dollars that are really going to give you not a whole lot extra and you're just going to be paying a premium and a lot of times their vrms are just designed to go to the stratosphere which uh a lot of us most overclockers just aren't even going anywhere near the stratosphere especially if you've got to do work on that overclocked rig so um california has a huge issue with too many people two resources think australia's power blackout issues and power costs in the us california cannot keep up with the people yeah see i don't know enough really like when it comes to the usa like i only really just i'm only standing back and reading the news um but if i was living there i'd be commenting a lot more on the situation because as they say the us is pretty much the um the butterfly's body and then when it when the wings flap the rest of the world gets affected by what the us does very true like you can see this with everything u.s stock market crashes everywhere else in the world starts crashing uh someone you know they implement policies in the us and then later on in the rest of the world they start wanna uh they start wanting to implement the same policies so in ways the u.s is like the cork um the core of a lot of policy making and a lot of decisions in the world it's just i don't live there so i can't really comment on it too much you know you're the outsider looking in but yeah us politics affects the rest of the world big time and i guess sooner or are your thoughts about later radeon 6600 xt yeah so i um i i just think like the 6600 xt they need a lot of them out they need a huge amount of them out because it can be a good thing of course the actual price and where a 6600 xt is going right if you look at a 5600 xt that was 299 dollars i think msrp does someone know the msrp actually we'll go check it out the msrp of the xt what was that and there's your ethereum price look at this ethereum price going crazy before this announcement so there's some there's some definite volatility going on here right before this um august the 4th announcement so who knows what could happen i'm hoping that i'll go whoop off a cliff on august 4th they might be you know here's the final the final furlong this might be the final furlong um but uh we got here the 5600 xt msrp what was it 279 okay so we got here the 6600xt 5600 xt was 279. now i i kind of liked i liked the um i like the 5600 xt i thought it was a pretty solid card now we've got the 6600 xt msrp is now it's going to be three you know i i heard it was 349 379 seems to be the go that's a hundred dollar msrp increase on your 600 siri xt card like that's a i mean that's a huge increase for one generation of six like series card from amd that that like that's insane when you think about it right and like when i'm hearing through the grapevine that basically after the 6600 xt you're not going to get a 6500 xt you're not going to get a 6500 you're not going to get any cheaper cards after this they're pretty much just going to say hey guys the apu's are out there the apu's only cost 200. if you want your 200 card go get yourself an apu that's what i think is going to happen uh with the uh upcoming gpus because pretty much like and what this realizes is something that we've you sound like a what's this uh brian what's crack lacking yeah it should apparently are holding back 36 in 30 60 ti stock and dropping them just before the 6600 xt launch okay nvidia could be doing that i mean it depends right it all depends on price so i i know 30 60s can be had for a lot cheaper than the retailers are charging them right now and i know that um so the c600 xt is comparable to a playstation 5. a 6700 xt right it's going to be it's going to be a decent card right it's going to perform well but it's a generational improvement over the 5600 xt that's the way things go if you want to sell a new product you should be giving it a better price than what the previous generation was either you're giving it more performance or you're giving it a better price and performance so with the 5600 xt versus the 6600 xt it's going to be a very crucial comparison to do because you'll see if that hundred dollars is getting you really anything and i don't think it will be and i think it'll prove something that we we've all been suspecting all along but companies like amd and nvidia won't admit it and that is inflation it's running up their underlying prices the proof is in the balance sheets when they report on the margins intel's margins have gone down if we look at amd and nvidia's margins have stayed the same from a year earlier and so what that means is that the price if they're selling all these higher products that are priced higher 30 60 30 70s 30 80s even 30 90s if they're selling all these higher priced graphics cards that they usually make more margins on why are their margins remaining the same and the only answer is inflation in other words their costs have gone up but they're kind of no one wants to admit that this inflation is a bigger problem than it is everyone just seems to sit back and go okay inflation isn't a problem but it is a problem and you're seeing it with a 6600 xt in front of your very eyes 379 amd wouldn't release a card that high if they didn't have to right they know that they know the demands there from the from the so-called gamers gamers isn't like i'd say the gamer's demand isn't really there it's the mining demand but at least the good thing about the 6600 xt is that it's a 128 bit bus versus 192 on the 5700 xt so you can expect the hash rates not to be that high so when we look at a gt 1030 which is still priced really well like this card's actually like not coming too far over its msrp like a gt 1030 is just a cheap card it's in stock miners are definitely not going to buy this thing up whatsoever it's not going to be worth it at all so when you look at the demand of miners versus actual people wanting to buy these things and put them in gaming pcs miners are still outnumbering gamers big time where they've got their price flaws at different levels so amd know this but at least with the 6600 xt your price floor is going to be a bit better for the gamers versus the miners and i think that's one thing you've got to establish now and it's going to take a lot of market research is where are the price floors for both so where's the price floors for the miners where's the price floors for the gamers and so you'll only really get that with the um you're seeing that like if we look at this now i'll show you in front of your very eyes uh 3060 ti rtx 3060 ti you can see here right in front like you'll see in australia right now 360 ti's are coming down in price like if you look at this one this i guarantee you this will be an lhr version even though they don't say it in the title this will be an lhr version uh well i'm waiting for it i'm waiting for it lhr where we at oh he's not saying it he's risking it he's risking it because if this isn't an lhr version someone buys it and they don't know it's an lhr version they could be like essentially you'll see here a lot of people advertising these 360 ti's they'll say if they're lhr or non-lhr so if they're in lhr they're pretty much not going to be selling uh we'll actually go to the completed listings that'll give us more of an idea so you guys can see it in real time completed items and you'll just see just you'll see right in front of your very eyes what is going on so lhr thousand bucks right so that means the miners really that's a gamer buying that and that's like honestly that's coming in at what 250 dollars aussie so you're paying a 33 premium over what that card came out for in msrp in australia terms it's not too bad so that's why it's not too bad right now but then we look at here full hash rate look at this look at the difference just right here right in front of your very eyes full hash rate versus the uh not full hash rate 400 difference so then you're going to see these lhr cards and this guy probably here he's probably this guy probably bought them for mining and then they're like oh these are lhr cards better re-flip them straight away same here you've got an lhr card twelve hundred dollars so your cards that can be used for miners with unlimited hash rates are just going with at least the two hundred dollar premium so there's the miner there's the floors right there's the mining floor of what the miners are prepared to pay versus the gamers still way outnumbering still way way ahead way in front of what they're prepared to pay so that that balance can only really come back once mining profitability goes down and that's what it's all about so we're waiting on uh we're waiting on mining profitability to drop so and you know some guys will be out there and they'll be like yeah just mine like some random x crypto mine some random crypto uh currency and it's like people aren't going to bank on that if you if you're spending serious money which you are like i look at a lot of these miners they're spending 1500 on a card they're not going to be like oh well what can i go mine this no-name currency no they're going to be like okay ethereum's the biggest the biggest sheriff in town he's got the biggest uh knapsack so we're going to go with ethereum and it's all related to the ethereum profitability so keep them just watch out for that always watch if you're looking for a graphics card and you're serious about buying one either two things watch for an lhr card which they're going pretty good like you know whoever picked this up for a thousand dollars they didn't do too bad that's off ebay as well yeah 360 ti i've seen one locally here for 900 it's not too bad s360ti is going to give you a really good gaming gaming performance so right now it's kind of like it's becoming very um i found the nonce just some this time this channel in mind found the all right guys and thanks for the compliment of the dis i don't know if it was which one you're going there for but um i'm just trying to help gamers out here i'm trying to help gamers out who want to make an informed decision that's all gamers who uh want to ai they might save their money you know whoever thought that's a concept save you money and gamers can then buy it so anyway guys that's about uh it for the talking about gravis card prices this month pc parts price watch everything except gravis cards is pretty much decently priced there's no real big changes uh the graphics cards themselves if you're looking to get into pc gaming for a really good price like if you're looking to get into pc gaming and you don't want to mess around if you're looking to get into it just be patient if you want to get a hiring card in terms of lowering cards we can really only help hope that intel comes out with the dg2 that's really the only hope right now intel is like okay we want to increase our market share much like what amd did with ryzen so that's the only thing that gamers on a budget for a 200 card for a 200 graphics card that performs really well new that's the only thing gamers really have going is the intel dg2 right now because nvidia and amd refuse to do it because of the underlying costs but plus they can sell all these higher cards to miners still so when they can still sell the 30 60 ti's they can still sell 30 60 60 700 xds miners don't care they'll just buy up anything as long as they can make profit on it so even if it's an lhr card if the price is right if that 360ti lhr went down to say 800 a miner would just snap it up they don't really care so that's the sad thing right even if there's an lhr implementation the miners are still going to buy the cards if the price is right for them while the profitability is high so in the meantime you can really only just sort of weed your way through now i was talking about one card in particular in the parts hunt yeah this is weird right save us intel like whoever thought intel could save the day but it's just based on what you've seen with companies and how they work in the tech scene right when we look at amd what they did with ryzen they clearly went for a disruptive they even said it in their presentations they went for a disruptive approach everything they did was disruptive they put the six core 12 thread ryzen 5 1600 then they doubled down on the 1600 then they tripled down on the 3600 and everyone was loving what they did with those six core 12 threads they brought it to the mainstream for a really cheap price really competitive and so intel if they want to branch into the gpu market they're going to have to do the same thing and if they're smart enough they're going to say well there's a huge opening here for even 300 gpus 200 gpus and uh don't leave us give us more tech yes loving i'll give you guys more tech yes loving don't worry just stay tuned just keep watching we're live streaming baby just keep watching so basically what happens is is that there's a huge market for intel and that's what i'm saying intel is pretty much one of the only few guys that can save the day of the dg2 so that's what that's where our hopes lie but if you're looking for a decently higher end card right now the 1080 ti isn't too bad this is what i've been seeing locally here the 1080 ti it's still a solid card very good frame rates very i'd still call it a higher end card and so these cards you can you can have them someone went crazy for a strix there i'd say they overpaid a little bit but you get 700 off ebay i mean locally i picked one up for 600 dollars so if you do your homework you can pick up a 1080 ti put together a gaming pc and people like oh man i want to see what you do with that 6 1080 ti yeah i'm going to be putting together a budget gaming pc so at the moment it's all seg the whole market is just segmented it's just a bit of a mess and so if you don't know what you're doing when it comes to building a pc you're going to get probably ripped off but if you know what you're doing watch some tech yeah city live streams there's a lot of other good youtubers out there making videos on sort of what you can expect to pay if you look around and get some parts then look around save some money because the used market is literally the only thing uh keeping price performance going right now because uh the whole new market is just a complete mess and that especially when it comes to buying a gravis card but attorney tia is not too bad 1080 i look at this guy he got 640 bucks he picked up a pretty solid uh deal there with the amp edition so some pretty good deals we had just keep your eyes out keep tuned stay tuned and you'll see what's crack or lacking anyway guys we'll go over to q and a we'll answer some questions before i jump on out of here because i i might actually go um i might actually go pick up that other 1080 ti and i got to start a new build so i will get on to uh doing a 1080 ti build so it's either going to be like you guys let me know do you think it'd be with good with a ryzen 5 1600 1080 ti might be a i mean it might be a tad little bit bottlenecked but i'd say if i can tune the memory properly and overclock the 1600 then it might be a pretty good build um and a 1650 super yeah 1650 super is fine for war zone today yeah 650 super is a really good card it's a solid card actually i was one of the like i was impressed with the 1650 super as well as the 1660 super they did a really good job on those two cards uh 2070 super 2080 super i wasn't too impressed uh 2060 super they weren't really like worth like oh my god this is a better upgrade sort of thing they weren't that great but the uh the lower end supers was where nvidia really nailed it with that super lineup is the 960 worth 50 bucks i found one and i don't know if i should buy them yeah i'd go like a 960 for 50 bucks is pretty good i'd go snap that up personally i think that's a decent uh decent deal just a question what's the best inter cpu right now intel cpu would be the 11400 f or the 10700 f i like both those if you're buying brand new and you can afford that i'd go for the 11400f or the 10700f both really good cpus for the money from intel actually you can check the price we can check the price quickly right now with the um with the 10 700 hold on we can check the price right now with the 10700 f so you can get these for 299 bucks in australia like that's really cheap really cheap for a 10700f and you might even be able to save like see pulled out of the new dell retail computers that's really cheap and the four hundred f because if you guys don't know if you're looking at these numbers as well i'll put it into perspective for you as well um [Music] i'll quickly just change this over uh hold on eleven four uh 299 aud to usd 219 219 dollars for an eight core 16 thread that's like dirt cheap dirt cheap and then you can also get 1100 for 161 that's after tax as well that's taxed i think it's taxed and shipped i think you had twenty five dollars on for shipping like that but i think you might have got a discount on that eleven eleven four hundred f and ten seven hundred f so that's uh definitely the intel cpus to get right now uh late to the party what's on the fourth okay so what's on the fourth is the ethereum as changing over to basically they're nerfing the mining fees so they're changing over elements of their ethereum so they're transitioning to full proof of stake and in the process they're changing the way the gas fee model is changed so you're going to have this new structure that splits the base fees and incentive tips and so no one really knows how this is going to play out for miners it's a big it's a big event but no one's really talking about it because i just think there's these events that are gonna come up and it doesn't matter what happens if there's there's always the excuses i'm looking for the future excuses to explain the massive drops that's what i'm looking for so august the fourth just stay tuned for it keep your radar out in terms of um looking out for cheap and of course when mining profitability drops then that could be a big catalyst to get a cheaper gpu so august 4th is one of the dates to look out for a huge date if you're either a gamer or of course if you're a miner you um just gotta be careful so that's uh one of those things man always tread lightly so uh moving back as the 1260 50 v2 a good cpu ah what is that what exactly is that again i've got to check it out i'll let you know intel intel 12 6050 v2 let me just check out the stats of it and then i'll check out the price on aliexpress and i'll be able to tell you if that's a good cpu so eight core 16 threads it should be like a three possibly a three gigahertz turbo that's not going to be too bad uh it's the ivy bridge so if you can get a cheap motherboard for that coupled with uh ddr3 registered i mean if the price lines up if the price is gonna match what these specs are saying i'll be able to tell you straight away if this will be a good buy oh sorry not v3 v v3 is the haswell one so if you want the new avx2 instructional newer avx insurance for 22 bucks man that's a buy yeah that's an easy buy that's a good recommendation i like i don't know in terms of is it a good cpu yeah it's a good cpu and it's a good buy that's a nice pick i'd give that a hit definitely and you can couple that with cheap gdr3 ecc registered you could really put yourself together a cheap um gaming pc i'm really liking the price of that man i might actually buy one after the live stream because that's it thanks for the recommendation that's actually a really good deal really solid and i mean a lot of the games out there um save the save the kids making come back isn't that that scam cryptocurrency save the kids or something oh let's have a look at save the kids oh man i remember i watched uh there was coffeezilla he made a really good uh series on that oh man save the kids didn't it drop to zero or something oh man this one was up five percent save the kids oh wow there this one so they launched it and it just dropped down i mean look at the volume on this look it's only like 80 000 like there's so many people dumping it look at that there there was [Laughter] scam the kids oh man there's so many people dumping it there was so many people dumping this cryptocurrency that the volume was so low that the price just dropped [Laughter] sorry like this is just i don't know man i'm so skeptical of anything like cr like save the kids like how are you saving the kids by making a cryptocurrency if you're instead of making a cryptocurrency how about you go out in society and i don't know save some kids whoever thought you could just do it by not being on the internet i'm sorry to say but a kid does not need a crypto currency to save them we got a donation here from joshua chandra paul with the hundred uh i forgot that thanks for the hundred i think it's the is it the ruby uh brian uh aliexpress has been banned in my country any alternative website brian oh i don't know yeah i don't know for an alternative in your country um because aliexpress is good like i'm really liking aliexpress i've got the ultrasonic clean and was the recent big purchase i did it wasn't that big where i was 150 bucks wasn't a huge purchase but it was amazing um like i'm really digging aliexpress i got my phone case from aliexpress it was like half the price of ebay so you can really get some good stuff but yeah like what is this man like save the kids like come on how about you just go out in society and save some kids like actually save some kids you know uh so i'll go donate parts but i won't even put a camera like sometimes i put the camera on because i want to promote it but like go build some pcs for some underprivileged kids go help people out locally not rug rug pull the kids exactly let's rug pull the kids that's what someone's saying in chat exactly and then there's yeah there was that logan paul one did the doink coin is it oh doink is it dink donk or something dink donk price and then oh man 31 000 like oh wow what other what other scams are there out there anyone else got some good scams to show the people to stay well and well and truly clear of doing coin went up five percent wow get some doing guys and look at that six followed the exact same trajectory it launched it had a bit more volume going on save the kids but same thing it launched and some people were just dumping it and then it got fully dumped and then the volume i mean to be honest yeah and then the volume just dies off and that's what you call a dying cryptocurrency right there they have the doink coin starts off there's a heap of money changed hands and it's like all right guys we can't make any more money off this let's just let it be and uh leave the doink alone so that's um there's another one so xrp is a solid scam xrp is an interesting one because i i thought banks were actually using xrp or are they just using the ripple actual servers so what's to go with xrp i haven't done enough research on it i just know that banks are using or utilizing their service so with xrp i'm not too straight this is safe okay safe moon safe moon price okay this was another one i saw people going crazy on twitter or twitter about like yeah there's a safe moon there guys so as people dump the coin as the volume goes down it just slowly dies off and so there you have it safe moon people like i mean i i the guys who invested here the guys who have it here and dumped here they're the guys who made money now again what does this protocol do if a cryptocurrency is not producing any services or products then it's pretty much useless it just takes it's just a matter of time that's what i've been saying about a lot of these cryptocurrencies they don't actually do anything if we look at platinum so someone said platinum platinum's not a scammer man platinum is uh platinum's like a beautiful metal it's um one of the most it's basically the metal i call it the metal of the future because i think once they start making hydrogen cell technology and even then they're looking at putting it in lithium batteries to make the lithium batteries stronger so i'm investing in platinum mainly because i believe in it so uh platinum's sort of like my thing right now um you know of course you could be wrong you could be right who knows anything can happen that's the beauty of the future uh but daryl scott he uh invests five dollars at border power thanks for the donation brother i bought a power color 5700 xt four months ago for 600 it died july 4th power color doesn't fix or replace it should i try an independent repair shop wow they they should fix that i mean if you bought it it's on warranty they have to fix it um and that's one thing like one thing i like and one thing i really like about uh the fact that if you buy a graphics card and you buy it locally from a store it's under warranty right and if it's if they refuse to repair it you can really get in their face right you can get angry and you get your warranty you paid for that it's warranted you deserve to get that product repaired that's why you buy it new if you don't want a warranty you go buy used and you get it a lot cheaper you run the gauntlet right as long as you check it out like when i check out used graphics cards i i know they're working i get them validated working i know they're working so if something happens after that i just know it's bad luck if it happens soon but if you're buying a new card the whole reason you buy it is warranty so you deserve that i mean you're buying that that's that's that's a sad thing to hear man it's kind of like you know i i went off on this uh i went on not being able to see my son tanja poor going a little bit bad but you know uh no these 5700 xt is out of warranty well if he bought it four months ago if he bought it new four months ago then it should be um in warranty and in australia it depends where you're from marco if you're in australia and you buy anything i think it's anything over 500 in australia has two years warranty so you can get your warranty two years in australia that's what it should be so if a place refuses to warrant it you should be you know start start practicing um temper stop you know that's when you sort of let those inner inner emotions fly right because it's one thing man if it's one thing i get angry about it's getting hosed i hate getting hosed so i think that's a that would what you what you're describing there constitutes uh hosing in my opinion i still like investing in defense contractors you're betting on human nature that's an interesting 1a basically what you should be looking at too and it's funny always and i mean always if you're looking for an investment if you're looking at investment right we can talk about investments you should be investing in something that people aren't talking about but has inherent value that's the simple formula for investing so right now everyone's telling me to buy real estate and i'm thinking well if everyone's investing in real estate regardless of inflation and regardless of the attributes of real estate right regardless of the attributes of real estate if everyone's buying real estate or everyone wants to buy real estate that in itself is pushing up the price higher than what it would otherwise be had not everyone want to buy real estate so right now in australia there's just this real estate frenzy you know like i mean because dadman because my old man's a builder uh we went and looked at a termite job like there was like a house down the road there was in it was eaten out by termites like this thing was like you wouldn't if a normal person bought this house you wouldn't be able to like fix it up too easily like the potential there's termite damage in the roof i think there was too much damage eating out one whole side of the house and then on the rear there was evidence of termites eating all through it and they're going this house is like before all this covered boom right this house would have easily been worth in its current state maybe 350 thousand dollars max like ma this house went my max 380. this house went for 530 grand let that sink in 530 grand people just went came in and they they're so bullish and they're competing with each other they're jacking the prices up on otherwise like on a house that's termite riddled the place was like the smallest three bedroom home i've ever seen had a kitchen that was purple from the 1980s so it's like i think a lot of people are getting into property not realizing that sooner or later you've got a bubble like you're basically pumping you're blowing up a bubble that needs someone else behind it to pay the higher price so always be careful and if you want to invest inside that's why i'm looking like that's why i'm personally i like i like um i like precious metals right now especially in the in the likes of platinum i think platinum is really undervalued and um yeah so in australia home prices are ridiculous dude that's what i mean they're if you're looking at 350 000 for termite damage yeah so if you want to know uh home prices i think australia and new zealand lead the rest of the world in terms of overpriced prices so that's that's what you've got in australia it's just uh it's it's insane right now so um tip for you by the way home sale closures have been going down as of recent we may be near the end of the real estate craziness well yeah i mean we're probably near the real we're probably near the craziness of everything um sooner or later bubbles come to an end because you need people to keep buying the inflated prices and so when the next person can't pay for the inflated price it doesn't matter what asset it is if it's a stock if it's real estate if it's a overpriced graphics card you always need someone to pay the inflated prices and so even through an inflationary environment which is what we're seeing right now they have to keep them maintaining the level of printing that they've maintained in the last year so are they going to keep maintaining those levels of printing the m3 broad money supply suggests not in australia we're seeing it front of our very eyes we're actually seeing a curbing of the stimulus in australia which is a really good thing so we're seeing it we're seeing that curb off so there are some indicators that are curbing off this massive inflation which is inflating everything cheap money as well price controls and you know when you've got price controls on money itself it's actually ridiculous so that's why um that's why a lot of people are saying like stop stop printing money and i'm all again i'm all for that as well you basically just devaluing the people who work hard in society so daryl scott he he donates 10 bucks thanks for the 10 thanks for the channel i bought it new in march at micro center my pc was randomly restarting at desktop idle for three weeks then it wouldn't boot until i swapped my 50 rx 590 back in um what brand of graphics card was that so yeah if you go if you bought it from microsoft go back in there and say hey this is the card fix it this is the card fix my card you're definitely entitled to a refund my men or entitled to a change of that card they need to fix that for you if you've bought it from microsoft it should be under warranty so yeah go get that thing fixed uh that's you're entitled to that that's why you pay that's why you bought that 5700 xt in the first place i know i know this is the funny thing with the 5700 xt i know someone here locally is actually the guy in the parts hunt yesterday the guy in the parts hunt i picked up the parts of him and he was telling me he had a 5700 xt and that busted after three months i think it was so they can oh and we'll quickly change the battery look at that i did it did does last long um you're gonna have to bear with me okay okay technical difficulties baby technical difficulties this is what we're talking about we are back up and running we should be back up and running we should be good wow did you see that i did a little bit of a matrix bit of a matrix glimp there welcome back guys we should be good okay that was pretty that was painless wasn't it that was painless so basically what happened was i ordered a ac adapter for my camera and the scary thing was i ordered an ac adapter for my camera and it said it got delivered a month ago and when i went to check around for it it never got delivered so i'm kind of stuck here with uh i got to change batteries if i do a live stream so it didn't fail like the camera didn't fail it just uh it just it was just like i don't know it was just relaxing a little bit so at least one technical difficulty check yes difficulties that's it so i was ready for it though i was prepared mentally i was prepared for the battery that was going to become of age i might need a super battery if i'm live streaming but uh okay so back to q a back to q a is narang a nice place to live so yeah it's funny about my local place so where i live is a place called highland park it's it was an extension of narang back 20 years ago narang where i used to live narang was a it was kind of considered a pretty low income area like a dump and um it was kind of considered a dump and then it 20 years later like now narang is considered a decent suburb so like it's funny how suburbs change uh some of the suburbs will change over time for the better some will change for the worst uh the suburb where i'm at narang it is in highland park they've changed for the better like they've really sort of shot up in value i think that's because in the end if you if you're looking at real estate it's always going to be logistics and location and vicinity of that location to things that will dictate the price i mean sooner or later right so narang is close to the highway where i'm at i'm close to the highway and i'm close to a lot of different big hubs on the gold coast so it's actually got a lot of value there and i think a lot of people like oh i want to live in meringue i want to live where the yes man is living so yeah it's not bad but how did you know i lived in iraq that's that's pretty cool man you knew i lived in you know the suburb where i live it's like yeah what's up uh 2060 is 699 aud what's the issue uh the issue is it's a 2060. so it used to be 450 so that's the issue with the 2060. that's 6.99 so that's the issue right there the price but yeah other than that i mean if you're looking for an rtx card the 2060 is okay but you're not going to be doing the thing is with the rtx 2060 is it's not really a rtx card you're not doing much ray trade like dlss the only reason i'd get a 2060 is so you could get dlss and that's it so uh so 20 years ago narang was the tech yes price performance yeah so 20 years ago where i was it was um 20 years ago it was the the price performance hub of the gold coast it's funny and there's actually funny i'll give you another example right where i am locally there's a place called narang right it used to be it used to be called an orangutang if you were lived in a rank so i used to be called an orangutan because that's what the nickname you got and then there was a place called southport when i was young there's a place called southport it's near the water now it's scary because southport used to be a really good suburb it used to be a really nice place to live and then the sad thing was if you go to southport now southport's actually kind of scary like every time i go to southport to pick up some pc parts from the store like there's guys walking on the street that are just like yelling at cars they're yelling at people so there's sort of suburbs that have changed change focus and it's sort of it seems to be like the suburbs that are kind of near the water now in australia or at least in the gold coast the suburbs that are close to the water are sort of slowly but ever more increasingly getting a lot a lot of both a lot of bogans coming along so it's pretty funny it can be anywhere where you are you've just got to watch the trends though but um yeah in terms of in terms of real estate right now i wouldn't be buying any real estate i just think it's it's uh in australia anyway i think it's such a weird time to be buying real estate and i think a lot of people are going really over overboard and getting caught up in the hype and i think the same happened for um some of these cryptocurrencies especially mining profitability too so you're gonna be very careful with how you invest your money my friends so and i mean should we even call the fiat currency money too that's another thing so any thoughts on the msi trident 3 pc we can take a look we can quickly take a look for you guys and see if the msi trident 3 is any good we'll quickly switch over to the small screen the msi trident 3 trident z3 is it tried and three just the trident three so you get a 10 400 f an rtx 30 that's not too bad like i was gonna say okay it sounds like it's gonna be crap but if you can get that on sale if you can get that for under two grand [Music] there's not too bad but i'd i'd like honestly i you could build a pc like this possibly for around if you looked hard enough you could build something for like around 15 1600 but at least you get a three year warranty on the whole thing so three year warranty is not too bad i mean i just think i think it's like it's overpriced but it's not like you know alienware overpriced sort of thing so it's okay it's not too bad but i mean i'd be gone i'd be aiming for around 1700 for this if it's on sale or something like that because yeah it's not it's it does have a small footprint too but i'm not going to go crazy like i'm not going to bash it at the same time i'm not going to praise it so it's sort of like meh um yeah price so seller price won't go down even if it goes down it will be gone real quick that's assuming the money to buy it is there as well so you're assuming the reserves are there to buy the particular thing you're talking about what are your thoughts on fsr versus dlss uh so far fsr um i mean i'm like personally i use dlss in some games and that's about it nfsr i tried it in dota 2 i wasn't like i wasn't that big on it man so i just thought it was a sharpening filter and that's in its essence it's a sharpening filter so i mean there's going to be comparisons out there that say all right it works well in 4k uh are they trying a fork like i've got the 4k oled which is a 55 inch right so you can see all the details on fsr i didn't buy into the hype of ss fsr i just look at it i'm like okay is this providing me a better experience than native 4k and the answer was no but if you're gaming on 4k to begin with why would like and if you can't get the fps why are you gaming at 4k that's what 1080p is for and then that's where fsr kind of struggles with 1080p and 1440p kind of struggles on those revolutions so it just depends like fsr does have it it's new so i'm not going to like i'm not going to bash fsr but at the same time i'm not going to get caught up in the hype and so i think nowadays like every time i turn on youtube and people are telling me like every time i'm on youtube people are telling me about you know like rtx 49 i mean i'm i'm just giving you guys an opinion but every time i pull up youtube now that rtx 49 changes unbelievable it's like guys this this stuff has to come out first you know what i mean this stuff has to come out and so when once the technology's good then we can go on about how good it is right so i just think like that's why dlss 2.0 that kind of came out and especially for me i became a big believer of 2.0 dlss after cyberpunk and so before then everyone was just bashing dlss right you couldn't find a a forum that didn't hate on dlss but then when dlss became good it was like okay guys this is actually really good dlss 2.0 became really good so i think for me i'm always one of a wait and see approach i don't get caught up in hype and i think if you're going to get caught up in hype you're constantly going to be let down because i don't know i'd put a statistic on it i'd say 75 percent of rumors suck um 25 percent of goods so if you if you're getting hyped about things you're probably going to be let down three out of four times you're going to be let down so you get your hopes up you you know and for instance there'll be people like i know some people that um for instance there was people that say for instance the rtx 3000 launch there was a lot of people who sold their 2080 ti's and i actually know someone who sold their 2080i and they were hoping that they'd get a 3000 series card and they just got left out like they took the months of having no gpu they set up their whole studio everything for a 30 80 and they couldn't get one so they eventually ended up paying a scalper price when they could have just kept onto their 2080 ti and just they would have still had a great gpu in their setup so some people get you don't get caught up too much in hype if you can so um so not coming until 2023 uh the the rtx fourth there i mean who knows yeah who knows when the 4000 series and um who knows when the uh the 7900xt is coming you remember one thing that a lot of people aren't talking about in these videos and we'll go we'll talk about we'll talk on this on the big screen uh the one thing that people aren't talking about with amd and nvidia is that they don't want to release a 4090 sooner they want to release it later they don't want to like amd does not want to give you a 7900 xt as soon as possible they want to give it to you as late as possible why because they want to sell what they've currently developed for as long as possible so that's why when we saw the 10 series cars the 10 for instance the 1080 ti was top dog for a long time as long as i could remember and then we had the uh 2000 series the rtx 2000 series that wasn't a huge up in terms of raw performance that was really not much of an increase over 1000 series but in video like okay let's bring dlss and rtx in to try and sell these cards and differentiate them and so they held off on that for a long time so it was really like it was a long time before we got the rtx 3000 series and then the whole crypto mining boom came along but if you're looking at the rtx 4000 series and the performance gains expect to see a 3080 ti which you've already seen but expect to see maybe a 3080 super as well you might even see a super generation after this 3080 ti you may even see like a a rtx 3060 super and you may see a 3070 super before you see an rtx 4090 that's a possibility because a lot of these a lot of these guys they just think that these companies are going to release an rtx 4090 and it's going to come out next month and it's going to completely destroy the 3080. that's not in nvidia is not in the game of doing that nvidia wants to make money same with amd so why would they release these cards when as soon as possible they release them as late as possible so yeah you'd expect to see maybe a 4 000 series card next year not this year so i would i'd give the 4000 series a big delay even though i think the performance numbers are lining up and i think that that would be the solution to uh completely like if you give a massive performance boost and you get it right you can leave a mess behind which i know for a fact that crypto is going to leave a massive mess in the market for gpus when that time comes and i mean at the moment it seems like things aren't you know it looked back in may when you look back in may it seems like well things weren't things were you know things couldn't drop then and then sure enough there was a massive uh drop in may in the following months and now it seems like again that that crypto can uh do no harm crypto can't stop it's an unstoppable train that's if you ask the miners and they think that crypto can't drop but again when something when i feel like something's overpriced and i feel like something's really overpriced i feel like sooner or later the market is going to say this price needs to come down and that happens naturally and the excuse for it could be anything and i think august 4th could be another good excuse so who knows anything can happen just remember that never expect um expect the unexpected that's a age-old sound remember i learned that one when i was a kid expect the unexpected uh so what would be good a pirate master what would be a good upgrade from a 1063 gigabyte a 1080 ti or 2080 super or 3060 ti i mean if you can pick up like if you can pick up a 3060 ti lhr and you're gaming for a thousand aussie like that's not too bad uh the 360 i was really liking it when it came out in australia and you could get one for 750 aussie dollars so i have 1080 ti would be if you can get one for 600 i would go for a 1080 ti at 600 aussie dollars uh 400 usd 400 400 usd for 1080 ti is not too bad so that would be your higher end cards that would be a big upgrade over a 1060 three gigabyte as we also got is it true that linus is your son yes i conceived him when i was one years old one year old yeah one years old that's true i did this is true um truth is coming to light the question is how much do you want to pay they're all an upgrade yeah i mean that's true i would skip the 2000 though the two the rtx 2080 super would be not as sort of desirable as the 30-60 ti or the 10-inch year i expect the unexpected normally said right before someone someone's going to punch you in high school oh man what kind of high school did you go to someone just walks up to you it's like hey man expect the unexpected and just like just straight up hook it's like what i mean that's a real that's that's that's not a expect the unexpected that's just a sucker punch bro and your friends shouldn't be doing that to you i mean hey man my mate just knocked me out today oh bro that's amazing you may just knocked you out bro that's that's it that's a that's awesome it's like what really been playing eft with 2060 super fps is okay fbs is bad should i get a 30 80 30 ati yeah i mean if you if you need more fps i mean i'd i'd just hold out on the 2060 super and i just dropped the i just dropped the settings down for now because i wouldn't be buying a 3080 or a 3080 ti at their current prices i mean we can check the prices but their prices are just so their prices are just really um oh man we got someone just spamming chat like come on bro uh there he goes oh man like what remove okay we gotta remove this damn it's someone yeah someone going crazy someone went crazy in chat with uh symbols that shouldn't be in chat come on man how did like how does youtube allow that crap to even happen in the first place i don't know yeah i i just i was just this is funny it's gt 900 it's a good thermal place yes but we can check the prices right now of the [Music] rtx 3080 and yeah i mean if you're in the us these things are going for like twelve hundred dollars like that's a seven hundred dollar card going for twelve hundred i'd be i just wouldn't be paying that right now that's a rip off um yeah i mean we checked completed listings too completed items see what's going on i made it man this guy again he's got like multiple accounts [Music] yeah so oh man he's probably got another account so some dude in chats just like just like man wow i'm waiting for can you make me a mod i'll clean it up for you ah right on the fly exactly add moderator rocket jump ninja you are now a moderator thanks brother thanks so here we go here we go 3080 ti and we got the prices are just stupid again so it's funny because the 3080ti is actually looking like it's better value than the 38 at the current market prices but i wouldn't be buying either right now and it's just simply because you're not getting you're not getting a good deal by any means and again my my prediction was a few months ago that the prices would come down to about 50 over msrp and they did they did right that's about 50 over msrp but you want to if you're going to pay for a card in an inflationary environment you kind of want to um oh man where's this like what is this crap going on in chat hey i'm just like looking at the chat and it's just starting to get spammed um i might have to actually tune the chat down uh drop chat down just until we like then the next live stream we get it figured out so at the moment with prices and gpu prices you're just not getting a good deal on 3830 ti and i think they have to come down to even consider buying them to around 30 or 20 over msrp that's the level that i feel a lot of people will start buying the cards for instance if you have 30 60 ti's coming in at 900 aussie dollars then i'm pretty sure they'll start to sell pretty well and i think the market will say okay i'm not getting too ripped off but i can game at least and at least things will be going on as normal and the market will get some back somewhat back to some sort of normality but until then and until miners are keeping the prices high there's no point in buying some of these cards they're just they're just too much and stick to the used market brothers but we'll get back to q a that working i just clicked hide user from channel yeah it's working really well thanks thanks i true brother in arms a true brother in arms actually speaking of brother and arms do you wanna uh it's locked down damn so we're in lockdown at the moment i was gonna like i was gonna like we should get some pizza or something but we're so yeah where i am locally we went into lockdown yesterday uh there's someone else going at it now this guy must have so many accounts so like man change the setting to post uh once per minute some other live streams do that okay um i don't know like i'm on live stream so i don't know how to do it exactly i will do that i think it's called slow i think it's called slow chat i will do that i will do that next time sorry guys yeah i've been reminded to turn on slow mode it's just never been a problem until this live stream like i've never really had i've never really had a problem with the chat you guys have always been awesome in the chat and we've always had a really good discussions but uh 360ti upgrade from a 2060 super yeah of course it's an upgrade but i just wouldn't bother at the time being it's not like a worthwhile upgrade that's what i think um so yeah man whoever's got these accounts like damn this is insane wow okay i might actually just while we're live i might actually just try and turn on slow mode in the live stream like um because this is justin this is stupid man like i mean i'll try and turn on the slow mode there we go all right it should be good it should be good i should be able to turn slow mode should be enabled now the live stream should be normal hopefully so that's i think i've turned it on now so yeah so you can send a message every one minute now so there we go that'll stop these yeah so there it is fry sa geptics so now he can only post one message yeah so thanks marco your job will be a lot easier now so i think i've turned it on so now they'll only post one jacksepticeye thing yeah so now they can only post one sector guy is uh rot roddanelle lol uh say so now he can only post one sector guy in chat and then he'll get banned straight away so it's going to be a lot easier so slow mode's on if you've got a question let's just drop it outside we'll be oh man that's stressful like damn ah thanks marco thanks i you guys are you guys are doing god's work so slow motor's on now so you get one question every minute and you get one jack jack septic eye every minute so one turd on the punch bowl ruins the party [Laughter] oh man i love you guys so there we go all right um yeah so i mean you can try i mean it's pretty hard to get what like what that guy's doing is actually pretty hard it takes time it takes effort so i just don't know why you would put the effort into trying to disrupt a live stream like where we're talking about pc parts and i'm trying to help people with uh finding the best value i just don't get some people man like uh anyway yeah anyway jacksepticeye i think he's a big he's a massive youtuber that just does massive youtube videos so uh marco's living in taiwan and um so yeah in terms of okay oh man like that was stressful so what's your favorite food that's actually a good thing we can get onto some happier news my favorite food at the like my favorite food changes right at the moment i'm a bit of a mexican buff so i'm loving burritos i'm loving tacos uh like home-cooked tacos and uh home-cooked burritos like i'm all big on that you know like anything with mints and cheese in it man i'm a big fan hey so uh that's kind of like uh you put yeah guacamole in there sour cream like i'm solved uh so i mean i like after this i might even have to get a burrito uh go make myself a burrito of course pizza is a staple and the sad thing is like the more i think about my favorite foods the more i realize they've all got cheese in them so uh and then we've got intel gpu will come too late for the gpu shortage no i think like if we look at the dg uh if we look at the dg so the dg201 if we look at that let me go over the dg201 the release date on it is a dg2 release date i think this is coming out sooner than people expect like the gg1 it was it was common knowledge in the scene if you guys were in the scene it was common knowledge in the scene that the dg-1 was um so it was common knowledge in the scene that dg1 was meant to be intel's just like literally just like a a crappy gpu that was just meant to for them to make a gpu and sort of seed it out there but the dg2 was always rumored to be the card that actually brings some competition to the market now knowing intel and knowing especially raja kaduri who's working with intel and this is what i said in the last live stream it's very possible this card could be the savior and it's expected late 2021 so it should come before christmas and that's the most important date for intel to hit if they can hit a launch with enough stock on the gg2 before christmas and it comes in with a decent price point they could very well be in a awesome position to really capture the um the gamers because the gamers are struggling out here and this is what i think people are starting to realize now uh george as well and alright thanks for the five dollars bro did you hear yet lockdown in our surrounding areas might be extended again oh man really so we're on a three-day lockdown at the moment and uh you can only go out and get groceries and do a bit of exercise so yeah they might extend it because yeah yeah yeah we'll get we'll get back to some good news get back to some good news here uh so intel coming with the dg2 if they really want to do the disruptive uh practice they could really capture a lot of market share from an amd nvidia now amd and nvidia have just shown and as people like this is all the guys in the past when you know when ryzen 2000 when ryzen 3000 when these were running when these cpus from amd were running so hot when b450 was running so hot um people people were like wow amd they're so good amd just cares about the gamers amd loves us amd is god and then ryzen 5000 came out and then the rx 6000 series came out and then people realized i think people are starting to realize now amd's just another publicly traded company they want to increase their profit margins and they want to take care of the shareholders and so i think that was at the end of the day like if if amd like i mean i mean this is a bad probably a way a bad way to say it to you guys i don't know how else to explain it but if amd's the pimp the customers are the like that's ah taller cram uh twenty dollars uh spammers suck favorite beverage on me thanks brother thanks for the twenty dollar donation that's awesome hey so with amd and nvidia the same it all comes down the end of the day to the um it all comes down at the end of the day so they're making profit and then taking care of profit shells now what the good thing is here the good thing about this is is that companies like what amd with their 2000 series and their 3 000 series cpus what happened here was that they disrupted the market right they said look we've got to get the name out we've got to provide cheap prices and that's what they did now intel is in that same situation they have to get the name out and so they're going to do a disruptive policy i think with the gpus so that's why i think intel the dg2 i've got high hopes for the dg2 and i think it can position intel all that negativity in the past it won't matter because everyone when it comes to buying products everyone always votes uh with their wallets and that's what at the end of the day that's what it always comes down to so i mean it was harder now i i couldn't really think of a better analogy right you know what i mean but there's people that i guess there's people that love getting like you know they love getting taken to town and so you saw that and the biggest comparison right and people were like oh you know the ryzen 5 5600 x people put this comparison up that oh it was only 50 more than the 3600x but the biggest difference that people failed to see was the fact that no it was a hundred dollar difference because you could get a zen 2 6 core for 200 that was the 3600 you didn't have a 5600 amd didn't release a 5600 so your cheapest 6 core on the zen uh zen three the cheapest cpu was the 5600x which is a hundred dollars more and so i think a lot of people failed to see that and that was the biggest price increase in a generation so and that was there like uh thanks ahmed like you just got to be objective about these things and just say hey this is what happened now looking at the 6600 xt look at the same trend and this is what i was saying just before on this in the live stream 6600 msrp it's a hundred dollars more than the 50 in the 6600 xt 100 price increase on your msrps that's huge so you can see here that amd not only need to make more money and so how much of that i mean when we look at the price increase right if you look at the calculator um how much of that is an increase right so if we got uh 379 divide 279 so 35 increase in your baseline model so going from a 5600 xt to a 6600 xd is a 36 price increase now of course that's going to help their margins but how much of that is inflation say for instance if real inflation is um if real inflation is so hold on 1.36 divide say for instance real inflation i'd be conservative i'm going to at least say 10 inflation they're making a 20 price increase a raw price increase of 20 from generation to generation i'd say inflation i'd be saying inflation's probably more i would say inflation's probably 15 so 18 price increase so they've got to make more money right amd's established themselves and they're saying we've got to make more money same with nvidia right if we look at the 30 the 3080ti was meant to be 999 dollars uh b0057 with the 199 donation one up thanks brother we've got one more life on the stream here uh the same thing with the 38 ti this was meant to be 999 dollars and i know that for a fact i know in the in the in the grapevine this was meant to be uh this card was meant to cost a thousand bucks so we got 1200 divide a thousand right there's a 20 increase now that was already on top of a price increase sorry just doing math here a 42 price increase over the 30 80. now oh let's let's just do a bit of math on live stream here a bit of crazy math because we can sort of if we can ascertain how much the traditional percentages were we can sort of see how much the raw nvidia price modeling increase was so did we really have 5.99 to 6.99 okay 599 to 6.99 you you'll get where i'm going here soon so 17 increase was their 1080 ti that was their structure when they had a 1080 versus a 1080 ti that was their raw price increase structure they said look we want about 17 more juice for this ti model as opposed to a forty-two percent increase we'll give it a seventh we'll give it a benefit of the doubt here which ah sorry if we're going a bit stupid here 26 increase like that's basically they're putting 26 more juice on the ti model and that's already without that's already without the 200 increase this is only the 9.99 price so already with the ti and video is already going higher with the profit margins so you can see they they they are doing it because they can there's the demand out there the crypto miners are making the gpus more scarce and so you can you essentially see that the market for buying a higher end gpu the people who are left can afford the higher prices and that's just natural pricing if crypto mining was never here i would say a 3080ti would be struggling to sell at 999 people would only buy the 699 3080 and leave the 380t on the shelves but because of crypto mining uh the situation is much different and people are like oh crypto miners are only buying 25 of the cards i would argue it's much more i would say the crypto miners are actually picking up over 50 percent of the cards all those new cards that are sold 30 60 ti's 30 70s 30 80s um 30 90s whatever i'd say the majority of people picking up those cards are crypto miners believe it or not and that's my that's my assumption because if you can see here if we can see right here that the guys the the core ethereum developers if they don't even know how much the august fourth drop is going to do to mining profitability then they people are just pulling stats like people just pulling stats out of their ass and that's what you can ascertain from a lot of these this is like a core ethereum developer doesn't even know how much this stuff's going to affect the price uh can we get some like who is buying the graphics cards for mining versus gaming we can also get some statistics there and i guarantee you the majority of people buying graphics cards on the new 3000 and 6000 series are probably miners so we got here a ten dollar donation from theobert eight uh ten dollars aussie thanks brother hi brian could you suggest what gpu i should buy the price i should buy it at can't wait forever for msrp and any other upgrades for my current build on pc part picker okay uh okay thanks man yeah sure yeah we can check it out and literally pc part picker okay let's have a look we can have a look at you thanks for the donation we'll have a look at your life we'll have a look at this build uh aussie dollars okay cool so you've got here ram yep 16 gig yeah probably got yeah easy good choice good choice good choice good choice good uh is there any reason why you got a three like dude that thing is a dinosaur uh is that unless you've got that as a backup yeah freeish okay this was salvaged from my old setup um yeah you can buy a two terabyte for 25 bucks you know what i mean like that's on the used market uh but other than that deep cool matrix yeah uh cv 450. so you're going with the 450 watt power supply so you're going with the budget power supply i would stick to it at most i would i'd go for a 3060 ti then a on a 450 watt power supply max would be a 360 ti and even then like and people will be like oh man oh my god 36 eti 450 watt power supply it's like yeah you can under vault it and when you undervolt a 3060 ti you get really good wattage efficiency so i would go for a 360 ti lhr and you can pick one up in australia for a thousand aussie but the problem is is it's a thousand aussie dollars your budget's eight hundred dollars for the pc you're kind of like it seems like you know attended ti for 389 is no way i'd buy that for that price i'd get rid of that straight away that's an insane price for a 1050 ti on the used market you can get you should be able to get a 1070 for that price so that would do the build all right like a 1070 wouldn't be too bad it'd get you through it so that's what i'd recommend and so is 819 an okay deal for a brand new 3070 yeah it's okay like it's again it's like it's it's not good that's all i'm going to say but it's not the worst like basically it's not the worst i've seen a 30-70 price for i'd like to see it under 700 if you were going to say okay i'm gonna buy and forget about what the market does i can enjoy this thing so how do people contact you to make deals this memory i've got you can have it bro for the cause oh thanks man that's that's that's a big deal in my way i just drop a comment man i'll get back to you or just send me a message on twitter and then i can follow you and send you a dm yeah i'll take some free memory i love ddr3 especially with ddr3 memory i always i just keep holding ddr3 memory because i find it sells it helps you sell office pcs really well so i take yes man uh should i get a msi gtx 1066 gigabyte for 240 aussie yeah definitely i really want to get it but i don't know what to do because my bank is being stubborn uh and getting 125 dollars scammed gumtree funds using okay so someone scammed you on gumtree damn sad thing is if you bank deposit that money if you put that money in someone's bank account you're probably not getting it back that's the sad thing but yeah 240 for a 1066 gigabyte make sure since you've already been scammed make sure you can verify the cards at 1060 and it's working before you buy it uh definitely uh the old 5000 series cards yeah if you want to play some starcraft 2 brother play some like play some dota 2 on a 5000 series card if you want to play like the old radeon 5000 series cards will do the job uh like any of these old cards and this is one thing i actually had a big grife and i'm actually going to talk about this in some upcoming reviews there's a lot of like a lot of the companies advertising like say for instance nvidia and amd they advertise these games right they advertise these games out there and they're like oh look at godfall look at a game like some other game that you've never heard of before and no one plays it look at the fps this card can get in it and then they compare it to like a gtx 1060 or they compare it to a card that's really popular on steam and they're like oh the 1060 can't do 60fps in godfall and then it's like well yeah but the 1060 cost 200 when it was released people could afford the 1060 and if we look at the most popular games on steam if we look at the most popular games on steam god falls not even like anywhere near the top 20 games so i'd love to see like a lot of like when i do the comparisons i might put in one of these new aaa titles and then the rest of the games in the comparison will just be popular games like because i mean if you if you're going to buy a new graphics card what games are you playing so like i the only reason i use an rtx 3080 here is for video editing in 4k rtx studio that's the only reason i use an rtx if i did if i wasn't i'd be playing dota 2 like i play dota 2 and starcraft 2. i only play easy to play games i don't need a 3080ti uh you know so that's all i use it for video editing and that's it so george vaspuki nice purple hair grandma thanks brother thanks i mean you're gonna have to do a lot better than that dude come on that's a i need a laugh like sometimes yeah sometimes people in comments are really good they got that originality that was the most boring comment i've read all day uh let's have a look here i have an x58 pc with an i7 96 950 plus 60 gigabytes of ram plus a gt 1030 oc ddr5 suggest games please yeah dota 2 cs go uh valorant uh fortnite gt a gt 1030 will um a gt 1030 will do fortnite as well so don't don't worry about that that'll that'll do it easy so is a 5700 xt worth playing games in 4k or 1440p i'd go for 1440p with the 5700 xt mainly because if you do uh 4k you might run into some games where it's getting hard to get that fps so i'd say the 5700 xt is more geared up towards 1440p so you play dota 2 nice yeah i love dota 2 man i'm waiting for age of empires 4 as well so i'm more of an rts sort of uh top down games kind of guy i can play fps but like fps is a uh chris bart you're looking old brian that's it man everyone why is everyone comment people are so focused on my on my age like guys i'm 35 years old you know in five years time i will be old i will be 40 in five years time like i i'm you know i'm not gonna stay 25 forever you know that's what i i mean 25 is like the perfect age i think if you're 25 right now and you're locked down if you're if you're 20 as well if you're like a teenager and you're locked down at the moment you should be angry you should be really like upset because you're missing out on living the best days of your life that's why i don't care like as i as you know if are we starting the lame heckles uh nice shirt man represent the studio again yeah i mean it's as of age i mean look we're all going to get old someday that's just like that's just human nature uh in terms of me i um i was like man i lived i lived my teens in my 20s hard bro i look back i'm like damn i wouldn't have done it i wouldn't have done it any other way so i mean if you can look back in your 20s and your teens if you can look back and you can say hey man i went so hard like all-nighters you know mad parties uh all the good stuff and you can sort of like you know because it's funny like i see some of these guys like on the news they'll be like oh 18 year old ultrapreneur he's got this mad hustle going mad business and then the poor dude will probably get to 40 right and he'll look back and he's like oh man my whole life i just worked and then i'm 40 and i can't even enjoy all this work that i've i've built up you know because when you're 40 years old you can't exactly go to a nightclub and go yeah i guess i'm mad it's a mad pee you know what i mean um so but yeah but i mean like you know people like say i'm looking i was like yeah i'm getting old too so you know it's like this is this is nature brian i like that you did i like that you dyed your eyebrows i did yeah i just got bored like i am bored right now then i asked you why'd you dye your hair i'm just bored like i'm totally bored right now of um lockdowns and everything in between so i'm just super bored right now with it all and that's the only that's the only emotion to describe it like i want to go see my son in japan i can't uh the government thinks that like i'm some mad risk to society if i go over to japan um yeah so yeah if if 35 is considered old i must be ancient i am 50. [Laughter] 38 years young here yeah i mean i don't know man i don't know like yeah age is one of those things man it doesn't matter i mean everyone like uh are you turning 36 this year i did yeah yeah 20 something's try to dump on us but they sound similar yeah 20 something's trying to dump on us but they said yeah yeah i'm turning 36 later at the end of this year so i don't really care though like i just know like when i up here my memories are there they're really good memories so i wouldn't have lived it any other way in my 20s or my teens man um so yeah i'm happy about that but now in terms of like pc parts i'm happy to do uh all this stuff where i build used pcs i help people out get people into pc gaming whether it's cheap or give people the right decisions help people make the right decisions when it comes to all things pc gaming as well as help people uh start businesses and whatnot check yes city is going to be the hub for just raw pc tech enthusiast hardware uh love the gray hair brian i'm bald but no gray hair i mean i can go bald like maybe that'll make me look young if you guys want me to look younger i can try uh what is your perspective about gpu market in the future uh yeah so intel g2 potential savior intel gg2 uh potential savior we got that that's the one that i'm looking forward to also august 4th and crypto rug pools big potential saviors too so it all happened it all happened when things dry up that's all i'll say sooner or later there's a dry up period and it can come quickly it can come fast it can come slowly but sooner or later there's going to be a dry up period this all dates back i mean all this printing money and stuff it's all done throughout history you know they did it as early as the roman the romans were printing money essentially so if printing money and inflation and demand and supply it all it all ends up in in boom and bust cycles so high quality cameras age us he looks younger in person just saying oh thanks rocket jump yeah maybe the canon like i'm on like dude i turn the like this thing this lens is so sharp it's probably the lens this lens is so sharp that it sharpens everything that's the canon that's the canon formula uh do you mess around with emulators at all i love them yeah like i gotta get a ps vita and then i can emulate that uh ryan wright five dollars aussie hey brian i love your content i got an e3 12 30 v3 based system with a 1050 ti how much do you think i'd fetch cleaned up on the secondhand market if that's aussie dollars yeah you donated aussie dollars you should be getting that um i would say you'd get around depends on what case if you've got a full rgb case with that thing you can get around 599 to 6.99 if you've got uh 699 with 16 gigabytes of ram and an ssd 256 gigabyte ssd 500 gig one one terabyte hard drive even a 120 gigabyte ssd you go for around 700 aussie like that's what that would sell for um if you present if the whole pc is just perfect and it runs really fine and you can show people like the reason i sell my pcs really well is because i clean like i really go attention to detail when i'm selling pc like i sell a pc as if i was using it myself so if it's a cheap pc it's still going to do the job if it's a gaming pc then it's going to look good and it's going to play hard like even at its price point whatever so yeah you can get good money for that thing that's pretty i just the hard thing is is you've got to you've got it in the ad you've got to tell people what the 12 30 v3 xeon's about like the average person who's buying a pc doesn't know what a xeon is if you tell them look it's the equivalent of an i7 4770 you should be able to sell that thing pretty easy so uh i'm 45. you're still a kid not yet i'm not i'm i'm like i'm i'm in that phase man i'm going from kid to a kid to man sort of thing you know the world humbles you man doesn't matter how aggressive you are how much of a raging bull you are the world will humble you sooner or later tips for building a pc business uh how much margin should i put on a one thousand dollar build for example not sure what i can get away with it's what the market determines man so you've gotta like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you paid a thousand dollars for the bill what matters is what's in that build and what people want if i was building a pc for a thousand dollars say for instance that titan pc that titan x pc i put that together i think for under uh the titan xpc i put that around a thousand dollars i sold that for 1500. so that was a 50 profit margin right so it all depends on the price what parts you've got in there i9 titan x the build just sold itself mind you i did clean it up and spend a bit of time on it but it all depends if you're talking about a thousand dollar build you've got to talk about what components if you've got like a rtx 2060 in there it might be a bit more difficult right or if you've gone out and bought a um say for instance an rx 580 for 500 bucks and you in your build top like i don't know anyone is going to buy a pc here a gaming pc with an rx 580 for a thousand bucks people don't want that they want an nvidia card maybe at that price or they want something that's higher performance say a 5600 xt so that's what i'd be um so we've got darren davis 20 pound donation thanks brother brian you're a legend in the game you help a lot of people don't let anyone tell you different thanks brother thanks yeah i mean like you know the other day you guys out there the guys who like actually support the channel and love the content you guys always um your comments and your your good will always outweighs the the negativity you know and even if some of the dudes are sort of having a joke i know they haven't i know they're having a crack you know so uh i'll be the um i'll be the oldest 35 year old in the tech scene and so bit i also 50 year old this uh the guys that told me to stop playing football were right my knees and hips need surgery oh yeah so i stopped running on pavement because of i could feel the pain in my knees even when i was like 28 or something i started running on pavement and i realized pavement running was bad for me i don't know people might say oh pavement running is good what not i stopped doing pavement running because i could feel the pain flowing through and i knew sooner or later your body if if your body's getting pains from things that's your body telling you something needs to change so whatever you're doing so again pain is a good thing if it's if it's giving you a warning of to change things up for your body because yeah you know you can't be 18 forever i remember i was invincible when i was 18 dude like two all-nighters in a row work three days straight you couldn't do that now prices in eu are 25 higher including used market uh you reckon picking up a 1080 rog strix for 520 dollars here in denmark is worth it upgrading from a gtx 1016 660 not at 520 us man no i wouldn't go for a 1080 at 520 us that's all i just wait like i just go for it you know go on go on ebay and go on your local ebay site and just look for some bids like uh you can look for buy it nows try and snap up a good buy now on a gpu like even a 1070 for say 300 would be a lot better it'd be a massive upgrade from a 660 but you can wait for those deals to come up a gtx 1070 in your in your local currency 300 usd 350 usd maybe max that's what you should be targeting um max so what's happening on august 4th august 4th is the ethereum the day of reckoning for miners so hopefully that is the day of reckoning i'm hoping that's the catalyst there's gonna be i just feel like there's going to be a catalyst soon that's going to start things start it's going to get the buck rolling uh brian there's an rx 588 gigabyte for about 270 aussie dollars on umar do you think it would be worth it if it goes in stock oh yeah so you might basically i'll show you guys that you might will leave essentially what um will do is they'll leave older prices you might will leave older prices on their site so if you go rx 588 gig they'll probably leave that's just like a leg yeah these are all legacy prices man um and that's sort of like an indication of what pricing used to be are you gonna get back to that pricing i don't think so so that's sort of one thing to consider um i mean if it comes back in stock yeah i mean people are gonna buy that thing at 239 aussie dollars any day all day but got to remember the components going into an rx 580 the pcb costs the components the solder all that stuff all these components are going up because of inflation and it doesn't matter what someone doesn't matter what the governments are telling you there's only one percent like in australia oh we've only got two percent inflation it's absolute garbage those inflation numbers that they're giving us are absolute garbage prices are going up and it's going to cause uncertainty and uncertainty can come in many ways you can have you can have a graphics card going one day for seven hundred dollars the next day for fourteen hundred dollars it all depends that's how hard inflation hits it creates uncertainty it strangles not just supply but here's the most important thing it strangles demand as well never never forget that when we go through bouts of high inflation you essentially have that's why the word stagflation comes into play because both like you just got this massive uh mess in the market and so what happens there is volatility picks up price stability becomes a thing of the past so never forget that never forget that so if you're waiting for a gpu and you sort of if you're waiting and you're patient you wait for that little lull you wait for that low the low period so yeah as a jerry on marriott exactly that's what they're saying in australia it's like two or three like oh guys we've worked three percent two percent inflation it's like what have you seen rent rent the price of rent's gone up at least 10 percent in the last year where's that where's that in the inflation numbers so like the way they're doing the inflation numbers is just absolutely insane and they don't even you know it was funny i was in the bottle though because it was my old man's 70th birthday the other day and so i was buying him a heap of grog for his birthday and we're in the bottle oh and i noticed buying in the whiskey i noticed they had dropped the standard 750 ml bottles now they're now 700 mil so you know you go to buy some whiskey now you're getting 50 mil less and this is one thing and now they're probably they'll probably put that into like i was just down the the i was just down the the bottler right and i'm like wow okay no one's talked about the fact that the whiskey bottle has gone from 750 mil to 700 mil there's there's a drop in in um in the amount of alcohol you're actually getting for the price you're paying but of course if they kept the price the same they'd be like oh there's no inflation here on alcohol yet there is because you're getting less for the money that you're paying and that they call that shrink flation uh my man i know i just know this man listens to people i love peter schiff man you should you should listen to a lot of guys out there that just um tell you some real like what's happening and not like uh there's other there's a few george gammon's really good as well mike mahone there's a heap of good guys out there that give you real good information on how the world is really working versus how people want you to think the world is working because you can see it at the end of the day you turn around you get on the supermarket you can see the things that you can see the things unfolding right in front of your very eyes again my quick story under warranty i got an upgrade from a 1080 ti to a 2080 ti to a 3070 should i sell it and get the 3080 ti if you get the price like if you get if you can get the 37 if you get good money for it sell it and then wait for a decent like wait for a little long i mean it depends on how long you can sort of um pace out your your uh time period for because i've seen i've seen good prices i saw a 30 60 ti go locally for 900 so that's aussie so that would be about 700 us i've seen people sell 30 70s for 1600 aussie so you can see there there's massive differences between the prices from week to week so depending on if you get lucky you can get a good deal and that's what it's all about like this is what the environment that's what i've noticed with the used parts hunts you just got to be lucky so if you're patient and you go hard enough you'll be able to do it so the problem is and that's the thing and you've got the regular pc hustlers like if there's regular pc hustlers locally here the uncertainty means they're going to slow down sales so if they're doing it as a as a full-time job they're going to have slower sales slower turnover so they're probably going to look for more work and then they're going to drop out of the market that's just a natural thing for that said person to do so remember inflation isn't a good thing despite what they tell you inflation's not good at all so if you've got shrink flesh and go see your doctor or the economy well then that case the economy needs to see the doctor we've got to get the guys on the reserve bank and all the um all the guys in government to go see the doctor then because that's a huge case of it uh bro my local hsp is now 14 it used to be 1350 what a scam exactly man my price of salmon sushi dude prices salmon sushi went from 3.50 to 4 dollars that is a scam a 360 600 i feel ripped off buying a 37 ti for the win at 800 msrp when i could have got a 38 instead if it was in stock yeah i mean don't don't feel too bad about i mean the other day though if you can if you can hustle in the scene and you can and you can make like this is why i show people i love showing people how to turn trash into treasure because if you can put together a pc that's worth 400 for 200 you can make your 200 profit and then you can use that profit to go buy the things that you like and so that's one of the things that i love about what i do here i mean i'm not gonna like bloat but one thing i love that i do here is that i like to show people how they can get the things that they like and i know like locally here i know like 16 year old kids that are really just like they're killing it man they've got like a rtx 3080 in their main rig they've got ultra wide screens because they know how to hustle like they know they've switched on i mean when i was 16 i was just still figuring out how to overclock an intel on a crappy intel cooler and the thing would overheat and shut off and i'd be scratching my head like there wasn't really back when i was 16 there wasn't really the used uh hustle market as there is now um and there's opportunities now there's a lot i guess there's a lot more people in the market for pc gaming than there was uh 19 years ago so there's a whole healthier market now which means you can pick up better deals and you can put together magic in 2008 i worked at a shop smith's chips kept the same size bag in the same price but they lowered the grams no one noticed exactly and that's what's been happening that's what's been happening baby i'll switched on to that like also at the start of the year like my friend's a baker and he was telling me too one thing to be careful of as well this is another thing is they'll use cheaper ingredients so they'll keep the price of they'll keep the grams the same they'll keep the bun price the same they'll give you six bonds in a pack a six pack but then what they'll do is they'll the ingredients they're using to make those buns they're cheaper now they're cheaper ingredients so that it might taste a little bit different and so you've seen this in all sorts of markets chickens chickens is a perfect example over decades of what's happened with chickens chickens used to taste completely different uh chickens are now like a lot of people will say the taste of a chicken now is is way different to what it was in the 1920s or 1930s or whatever so that's that's a funny thing i'd love to try an old school chicken because the only chicken i've ever known is the hormone inflated chickens that are selectively done to reproduce big chickens anyway ahmed anesian uh he's oh he's donated mad he's mad 50. what's a mad 50. that's an interesting currency thanks for the mad bro that's a mad donation yo brian love your channel what do you think of the msi eight a 850 gf we will check that out for you brother um i have to check it out and i'll let you know the a850 msi msi a850 gf okay there is one here i can oh is that a power supply okay it's a power supply um looks like a lot of people have bought it i mean the 750 gf's got some really good reviews i mean i would look for a bad review let's see if someone's i just one thing i always look for if i don't really know what the power supply is i always look for the negative and see what someone didn't like about it see all these five star reviews just like yeah i got it man it works i switched it on it's beautiful but let's have a look what someone's critiquing it about um this is the jet so i'll give you a quick opinion so after i really wanted to light this power supply module flat cables 10-year guarantee from a reputable band however there was one very annoying problem as soon as the power supply was plugged into wall socket it emitted a constant ah so yeah so someone got a fault that's a faulty power supply just that must have passed through the tests and that's unfortunate so um yeah if you get yeah you got warranty on it though that's just one of that like that's not msi's bad if you that's in i'd go i'd go on msi or something right but that's not like you buy any new product you still run the risk of it being faulty that's just like i've bought tons of new parts and there is a failure rate on new parts as well so you can't hate them for that uh i may have gotten a bad apple but yeah straight up i would not recommend unicorn spa unit cause sparks on my motherboard man this guy's like okay so i'd say like look this i've read reviews like this i mean the sparks one's very worrisome like damn okay i mean look i just okay after reading that honestly just go for a see sonic uh a call i'd just go for a seat if you've got that money for a power supply just go for a c sonic and antec a you know uh yeah super flower they're really good i just go for more of the traditional power supplies then after sort of man the sparks one really did it for me it's like for a for a 10-year warranty on a power supply to even spark up to begin with that that's a that's a bit of a a weird one okay so uh richard angeline uh five dollars five bucks from richie from phillip pa usa thanks brother thanks for the donation so we have the sparks there on the power supply shout out that's it uh bitcoin is 40 000 again really damn okay this is the final furlong before could this be bitcoin's final furlong before the rug pull yeah so this is the funnel that's institutional money and i guarantee you i guarantee you even the um what happens is since things are i guarantee let's check out theta my favorite overpriced bubble in crypto let's check out theta i guarantee you that is moving in a similar notion yep so there it is there that's institutional money can't wait oh wow okay perhaps not okay theta was moving kind of on the seventh day it was moving up okay my favorite overpriced crypto has had the has had the movement went down a three 3.60 my favorite overpriced uh crypto has gone up 6.50 that hasn't sort of followed that sweet okay so there's consolidation perhaps in bitcoin okay people are putting their faith in bitcoin that is consolidation that's institutional money going into bitcoin and bitcoin alone okay that's what there you can read some you can read the numbers so uh if you look at the numbers you can read always these supply and demand curves will show you that there's perhaps raw demand going into bitcoin so just be careful though be careful out there investing in anything so always be careful look at that seventy thousand dollars aussie in ten days yikes that's some that's some real big money moving around sloshing around guys like you and me you know if you bought a bitcoin you know how much you would check you'd know how much you would move the market if you bought one bitcoin you probably wouldn't even move this a dollar so the fact that someone moved this seventeen thousand dollars means that someone has invested a lot of money into bitcoin in the last uh four days now that same person if they've got relatively low fees or if they've got no fees they could just as easily pull it out so always be very careful with crypto so it was a short squeeze okay yeah it could be that as well it could be a short a short squeeze because yeah that was that was whatever this price reaction was here in the last few days was mainly on bitcoin that was really on bitcoin i mean ethereum whoa therian's moved as well pretty much intense so institutions like ethereum and like bitcoin so that's some that's institution that's like big big money in single bets that's what that means this is big money in single bets going into ethereum and bitcoin that right there is price control they're the people who control the price of ethereum and bitcoin so just keep that in mind when you look at this price movement that's not the mom and dad sending this up 700 that's someone with big big pockets sending the prices of ethereum and bitcoin up so and again i don't i don't remember with rich people do you think someone with that much money wants the average person to get rich no the average person they want to take money off the average person and send them broke so if you buy into this crypto after the fact that some big and rich investor has pumped the price up i just think statistically you're going to lose money you should have bought it when it was down here but anyway i wouldn't have bought it i'd like i'd buy it when it's back down to 600 and 600 again so that's what that's when if you were going to buy ethereum look at this massive institutional wave of money just pushing through here so damn and i mean a lot of it a lot of it has to do with the bitcoin structure and that bitcoin's still the main coin on a lot of these exchanges a lot of money that gets changed hands into crypto goes through bitcoin creating in ways it kind of creates artificial demand for bitcoin so i got to live people who think crypto will be the new fiat 700 change in one week yeah that's yeah it's like that's insane right that that that kind of price action is just monstrous and look at that look at that too so that's why you gotta fear as well so be very very careful if you're buying this stuff uh send brian some bitcoin no don't send me bitcoin send me um if you're gonna send me anything send me a coin like zen cash send me some zen cash that's completely private and there's the thing about bitcoin why is no one talking about bitcoin like the bitcoin itself right is like okay so with bitcoin the governments can see it's everything's on a public ledger so how's it giving you privacy i thought crypt one of the biggest things about crypto was meant to be complete privacy you didn't want the governments knowing how much money you had or what you're spending it on bitcoin literally just shows the government everything so i think there's like i think this i know zen cash for example has the zero it's called the zk snarks zero knowledge protocol so if yeah if you wanted to send me crypto send me some zen cash don't send me bitcoin um anyway i got a nine hci you reckon they stopped the drive sport uh not heid like 900 series they probably won't stop that for another year and a half i just look at the look at the trajectory of when they release the seven series and then when they release the nine series that'll give you a rough idea of their they just they make cards legacy as time goes on six and seven series getting legacied means that you know they're old now right they're like eight years old so kepler came out was it 2 000 when did kepler come out so seven gtx 670 launch date when was that kepler came out in 2012 yeah okay so 2012 so nine years later that's not too bad the card had a good run so when did the gtx 960 launch date was just something like that gtx 960 came out 2015 so we've got another two years maybe another two years left in the 900 series um why is everyone shunning silver uh no one's shunning it like what's going on with silver price no one's shunning silver no one's shunning silver at all i don't think people are shunning silver yeah that's just again that's just someone trying to drop the price down that's just institutional money trying to drop the price down uh these like again when it comes to silver when you've got precious metals precious metals the good thing about them is sooner or later uh precious metals are the good thing about them is that they they you can't print them they yeah sure you can you can manipulate the price in the short term but sooner or later let's have a look at silver price actually just to just to just to give you guys a little bit you can probably see a trend if you look at the silver price in the long term let's see if we can pull i mean this is weird like who knows where takeout city live stream goes but i want to pull up a graph of a 30 year if you were to draw like look at this look at this line here right so this was the massive in the 1980s people lost faith in the currency that's what the they say it was the hunt brothers but that that's that's a load of crap because the price of gold platinum all the precious metals followed the exact same trend so how could the hunt brothers manipulate silver price that bad when uh all the other metals saw a similar trend but anyway if you look at this general trend here if you were to put a line if you were to put a line through silver right can you see the trend if you were to put a line through that can you see that like from the 1990s right when silver wasn't being talked about much can you see this trend that's happening here if you were to put a line through this it's going in an exponentially greater curve right what's happening here is exponential curve is on its way up so silver price is only going to go one way it's just a matter of how much time that exponential curve is going to hit that point of no return i actually see it happening in the next few years you see here the biggest trend if you look at that massive trend coming through it's on its way up same with all precious metals so that should give you a scary indicator of what's to come like that's what i'm seeing when i look at these numbers right now i just see files to put in my head a massive line through it actually you guys probably can't see it too well i'll just because the chat's in the way okay here we go here if we look at this line you can just see this exponential curve that's starting to come through if we look at here here it was in the 1990s it was reached its bottom and then it's just starting to take off and so you could see a silver potentially at 50 dollars by maybe 2025 and again like you're if you're going from month to month if you're going from month to month going oh why is the price of silver like gone down two dollars you're getting way too emotional just realize look at this trend right here and just see what's actually happening there's a new base being formed at nine dollars in 2008 a new base being formed at fifteen dollars in 2020 so when's the new base gonna hit 25 dollars probably by 2025 but then again you could go up after that as well so silver's just it's distort precious metals has to store your wealth if you don't like and they store wealth that's what they do precious metals are fantastic so never never um never shun off precious metals so the sooner or later the truth comes out so uh you guys can say like um it doesn't matter if they're manipulated or not if they're manipulated it's a good thing go buy more because you're getting a discount that's that's the best thing about it sooner or later once once um once once like again all these things it's just a matter of time sooner or later the truth comes out that's an age-old saying you can you know it was bernie madoff the bernie madoff dude he had the world fooled when was bernie madoff i mean how long did his ponzi scheme last for bernie madoff ponzi scheme how long did it like wasn't it like 16 years or something this guy had like so many years he had a ponzi scheme going on uh we got another mad donation here thanks ahmed even thermal paste is scalped in morocco damn okay so bernie madoff this is a tech live stream and we're talking about good old bernie madoff but he managed to run a ponzi scheme for just ages like a long time and that's what i mean no one knew no one knew until the truth came to light so you can see here like this is this is what happens but just look at look at the inherent value of an asset never never shun the inherent value of an asset sooner or later that asset will reach its true potential now your investment with bernie madoff that reached its true potential right and that was zero dollars so the truth will always come out so if you buy silver and you know silver's a precious metal and it's got its industrial uses and you think it's undervalued right now then sooner or later it's going to go to its true value and it doesn't matter what happens same with gold same with platinum and so that's why i like platinum platinum's my favorite of the metals because i think it's got a lot of future front-running capabilities that are being ignored by the market um i think it's you know i think it's a fantastic medal but anyway that's just that i'm probably obviously applying bias there but that bernie madoff would have made a great ambassador for some of these crypto currencies too so especially save the kids let's drop that one on live stream right here so here we go guys hey guys come and invest in our cryptocurrency save the kids it's like yeah we're gonna we're gonna save the kids right now so bernie madoff would have made a great like i wonder i mean i wonder if i mean at least people would have known in advance so we need car or cooking vids cooking vids sure maybe one time anyway guys we better round out the live stream because it's uh we've been live streaming for quite a while now i think we went live nearly two hours live stream man this is huge you guys have been you guys been loving the live guys joining our chat i think slow mo does work really well thanks for the suggestions we're going to keep slow mode on that way i can read chat and answer questions a lot easier and uh thanks for tuning in so much uh ahmed he says he's another mad 20 paid 77 plus the power supplies msrp welcome to morocco oh damn what's happened with morocco morocco inflation i'm just going to check morocco inflation morocco inflation uh okay morocco is not too bad could be worse welcome to morocco but things could be worse than in in morocco you know what i mean things could be worse in morocco so at least the mad isn't going as crazy as venezuela so i know for a fact if you're in venezuela you're doing it tough but morocco doesn't seem too bad um rest in peace save the kids so any possibility of ether proof of stake still in 2021 well august 4th august 4th guys stay tuned so we're going to wrap up the stream we're going to say august 4th stay tuned for august 4th because that is when uh the big mining sort of um they're changing the hard fork to the london they call it the london hard fork so that's when some fireworks will happen potentially some fireworks will happen i just i got a feeling in the next week some big fireworks could happen but again if i'm wrong then we will just sit back to i'm just going to go completely stick to used parts and whatever we've got this ryzen apu as well that's coming up but uh in the next week i'm expecting some fireworks if they don't happen then whatever we'll just we'll sit here and we'll all be like all right guys the drought continues the drought continues and we'll just stick to some used bangers and having a bit of fun because yeah um i like the brian does crypto and finance streams i mean it always ends up there right like at the start we start off we start off enthusiastic about tech we talk about the prices and then it just gets to me just rambling on about i mean you guys want it you guys talk about the crypto prices and stuff i i'm i'm just the reciprocator i'm just the reciprocator here you know people talk about people hey which chat wants to talk about it chat wants to go down that alley someone wanted to know about the price of silver so i like silver i love silver i love platinum they're my two favorites uh gold golds are gold's just just standard gold like that's um that's not going anywhere uh gold's gold's good too but uh i tuned in to take your city for good investment gpu voices smart guy thanks guys i just it's it's real world investment i mean there's going to be like trust me when i say this there's a lot of people that are going to go gung-ho in the last year there's a lot of people i know some people who have went super gung-ho and they're going to be very disappointed when they can't um see their chickens hatch that's all i'm gonna say and because i've seen it before this is nothing new like 2021 and bubbles are nothing new happened in 2000 happened in 2008 and you should be able to see there's another trend that's coming up there and that is if you had a bubble in 2000 and you had a bubble in 2008 then there's something very wrong with the system so sooner or later another bubble is going to pop and when that bubble pops it's not going to be pretty so john taylor new member thanks dude thanks for joining members we got two new members this stream awesome i i mean i don't i you get an icon next to your name uh also i do post up a patreon actually i'm gonna do the patreon live uh the vlog soon as well so that's coming that's coming very soon so stay tuned but yeah in the meantime if you are scared about inflation uh precious metals like especially silver precious metals always a good way for a person to store their wealth and that's period and that's what i've said to people in the past with um i've said to people in the past with precious metals the one thing i love about precious metals versus cash and this is one thing that you'll never never be able to say that there's not a bias in favor of precious metals is that if inflation happens really like we're talking some serious inflation like if this inflation that's happening now continues year over year the price of silver and the price of gold and platinum they're all going to be higher because the new base prices to mine those metals goes up it doesn't go down and i'd say peak efficiency on mining gear as well it's not getting a whole lot better despite the promises they make labor shipping costs container costs melting the metal down these are all prices that go up with inflation so that's why metals are hedged against inflation because they're a real asset they have industrial uses they don't tarnish well silver does but platinum and gold don't tarnish and the thing is about them right is that they're hedged against inflation due to the fact that it costs a certain amount of money to make those but when we have uh when we go over to inflation on currencies especially fiat currencies there's no guarantee right if inflation happens on a fiat currency you're not getting back the difference that's gone forever if you ask a guy from the 1950s who had a dollar in his in his closet and he pulled that dollar out now the world doesn't care the world's moved on poor johnny from the 1950s his dollar is essentially worth a lot less than it was in the 1950s in 2021 his dollar can buy maybe a a chomp if you guys know that the chomp chocolate bar i'll show you you know a dollar could buy johnny a chomp chocolate bar this is what you know johnny can get a chiquito he could get a chomp this is what johnny could get in 2021 for his dollar as opposed in the 1950s johnny could probably get five meals off you know five full-fledged meals off that dollar but if johnny bought some silver in 1950 he could still buy those same five meals so there's the difference right um i i i'm ending the stream soon but i'm just telling i'm just trying to like someone's like yeah i thought you're i am ending it very soon but i'm just i'm trying to tell people that uh metals will always be hedged against inflation and metals guarantee you the difference in your purchasing power the governments never guarantee what they say about inflation it doesn't matter because they don't guarantee the difference if inflation happens they're not giving you a refund even if deflation happens well then your your silver that you bought is going to be worth more money it's that simple like the silver's still going to buy the same purchasing power that it had beforehand so there's the difference right the negative the negative is on the side of it's still same you're not losing purchasing power if you buy silver now but if inflation happens if you got silver you're getting back that purchasing power you still get your purchasing power so there it has there there you have it that's the difference if inflation happens on a fiat currency you're not getting any money back you lost it it's gone gonski's kiss your purchasing power goodbye so there's the there's the argument for uh precious metals now in terms of crypto currencies anything that has leveraged purchases on it when people purchase a certain asset whether it's a cryptocurrency a stock a house they're borrowing money and that's essentially leverage so when you're borrowing money on a leveraged item it has the potential to lose a lot more money faster and its value faster than the value of inflation so that's the difference there as opposed to precious metals they'll just lose their value in according to uh what the purchasing power of the currency is at the time so there's a big difference anyway uh that broman five dollar donation thanks before i get out of here i need help do i buy a 30 or 38 ti now wait a month please help yeah wait wait wait two weeks just wait two weeks just wait two weeks wait two weeks that's all i'll say just wait a little bit you've already waited this long wait a little bit more and you shall be i believe you shall be rewarded if not just buy a 1080 ti for the used market and forget about the new gpus just protest that's it chomp yeah we got a picture there's that's what he gets that's what the guy from the 1950s he got five or six meals out of his dollar now he gets a chomp that's what he gets and the government don't care about him the world has left him behind johnny from the 1950s he can now buy a chomp unfortunate so there's your difference guys precious metals gives you one thing inflation and currencies gives you another thing so don't forget that don't forget that timing will the price of silver go up inevitably as long as there's as long as money supply goes up yes so you said before you said before you can't see your son but that's just an excuse qrd law says you can visit someone vulnerable and vulnerable is not defined so you could say he's
