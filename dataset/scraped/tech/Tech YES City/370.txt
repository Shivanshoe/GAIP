you're not gonna believe this guys I just pulled out a 3100 rise and three CPU out of a packet of M&Ms it looks like there's something else in here hold on no way I just pulled out another CPU an AMD rise in five 1600 af out of this packet of M&Ms so you probably sitting there going Brian that is just not possible come on there's no way M&Ms would sell to rise in CPUs in a $2.00 packet of chocolate that they put on supermarket shelves and you'd be right but speaking of what's possible and what's not what if I told you that it's possible that a fork or a threaded rise in CPU could be a 6 quart 12 threaded rise in CPU and they cost around the same money you probably think in no way well there's only one way to find out in today's review of the Rison 330 130 300x both these CPUs are coming in at $99 and 120 dollars respectively if you're down on during a stray it's gonna set you back a hundred and sixty nine dollars and 205 Aussie dollars for that 3,300 X without a side let's roll the intro and then get straight in to those juicy benchmarks [Music] [Applause] [Music] so coming out of those gaming benchmarks and we're gonna talk about gaming a lot here in today's video because it's the main focus I feel for a lot of people at this price point especially looking for this many cause and threats and on the test bench we had on the AMD side of things the x5 70 phantom gaming X from asrock and that was coupled with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 Corsair platinum Pro RGB memory now on most these CPUs here pretty much all the CPUs but the horizon 5 1600 AF I could clock that to 3600 mega that's no problems using those X and P profiles the risin 5 1600 AF I add here only went up to 3000 66 megahertz which in ways would be limiting its results a little bit versus the other ddr4 contenders here but that being said 3300 X in the games when we moved on with the titles here we can see on average it was roughly about 10% faster than the 3100 and this mainly had to do with the clock speeds out of the box this thing went over 4.2 gigahertz in games on all those 4 cores 8 threads even in the single core threads and things like Cinebench it was going over 4.3 gigahertz on the other side of the fence however the 3100 that's limited to 3.9 gigahertz at least from my tests here on both the single core and the multi-core so if you keen on manually overclocking this thing which we'll do a video on very soon then you can get more performance especially out of the 3100 versus the 3300 X but the good thing about both these CPUs and even the risin 5 1600 AF is when we look at the power consumption figures they come in with very low power consumption even whilst maximum stress tests are being run and so this allows these three CPUs to be coupled with a very cheap a320 motherboard and you can use the included stock race still cooler absolutely fine to extract the most value for money but back to the gaming benchmarks we're using for the graphs card the 5700 XT Taichi from Azeroth there's things overclocked out of the box it's an absolute beast and so the differences in performance here would be even less if you're dropping it down to a 1660 super 1650 super or saying rx 580 or a 5,600 XT but on that note I decided not to test it with a 20 atti because I feel like that's an unrealistic scenario where someone's gonna go out and buy a 100 dollar CPU and cobble it with a $1000 GPU however coupling a 100 dollar cpu with say a $400 GPU is quite a realistic scenario and what we saw here with the 3,300 X in particular was that it was running extremely well even verse the 3950 X and the 9900 KS in a lot of games it wasn't that far behind and all we had to do to get this performance out of this thing was lock-in XMP profiles so if overclocking is one of those things that you don't want to do and honestly from all my experiences with PC gamers I'd say about 95% of people don't overclock their gaming PC's so if you're one of those people then the 3300 X I feel for an extra 20 bucks over the 3100 is going to be money well spent especially in the grand scheme of things that is you're buying a motherboard Ram SSD case power supply GPU and you're putting it all together that extra $20 spent is definitely gonna net you your money's worth in terms of the total build costs now what about the Rison 5 1600 AF very popular pick however one thing I've said about this before in the past is that it's not available everywhere a lot of people tell me they can't get access to this CPU and even sometimes when it's on sale for 85 bucks it sells out very quickly where it quickly goes up to $100 again however as we saw in these benchmarks here the 3100 is going to do a bit better of a job at gaming than the 1600 AF which is pretty much identical to the 2600 out of the box which is what we're showing in today's graphs so basically if all you're doing is gaming then these two new full cores from AMD are going to do a great job however there is that anomaly in the graphs you're probably looking at that I 74770 and scratching your head saying why is this included in the graphs and the main reason I've included this is because it's such a popular CP on the used market it so much more popular in fact that people would buy this CPU when they see that i7 and they'd rather buy it over the likes of an i-5 90 400 F and that's what's left me scratching my head when I resell PCs if it has an i7 in the title people go bananas for and this is a true story a lot of people who sell pcs will tell you the same thing so I'm a little bit worried for the new i3 that's gonna hit the market but don't tell Intel that but when I sat down and looked at those 47 so many numbers I was actually quite surprised the fact that I coupled this with an OEM Lenovo board which I know a lot of people are doing out there they're either doing ace of Veritas or HP's fourth gen om boards using an adapter using some budget 1600 megahertz ddr3 a CL 11 memory in dual channel this was actually performing quite well and this is why I guess these older I sevens are still popular they still carry that avx2 instruction set and they still do a really good job especially if you can pick up the motherboard the cooler the CPU and the RAM all in one for a hundred bucks you're still absolutely laughing for value for money and that's nothing to laugh about so when it comes to use price performance that's extremely relevant still when it comes to 4 cores 8 threads extremely relevant but of course you can go out there and cherry-pick a game like maybe ashes of the singularity or some game that nobody plays and use it as a basis to argue more cause more threads as needed but when it comes down to testing games that people actually play the 3300 X definitely surprised me the myriad of productivity numbers this is the second side of today's video the second story to tell we can see that moving through v-ray Cinebench Geekbench 5.1 7-zip and also the name that i'm not gonna mention because i don't want to get D monetized it's easy to see that more cores more threads is definitely gonna pack more of a punch here than it did in the gaming side of things so this is where the Rison 5 1600 AF becomes more of a viable solution though in my experience the answer to this one is very simple and that is you as the individual what are you spending most your time on the computer doing if you're doing productivity work and you're on a budget then you may wish to go out and get the rise of 1,600 over these four cores but if you're on your computer most the time playing games you're gonna benefit more on the gaming side by getting a Verizon three so there's the balance you've just got to choose which side you want to linger on you may have noticed in these productivity benchmarks that I didn't include video editing that's because there is a CPU out there at the moment if you are serious about video editing on a budget and you'll definitely want to check out the VIII's Aeons going on I'll Express in the moment there's 12 cores 24 threads going for a little over a hundred bucks that's some extremely good value for money especially with the fact that you can get very cheap ddr3 ECC regice memory they'll just put the link to that video up here if you want to go down that alley the one that all comes down to it just like this packet of M&Ms right here value for money on the lower end side of things is getting extremely good and you probably think in what's a pack of of M&Ms got to do with value for money well when I went down the supermarket before the pack of M&Ms was on special so that's what it's all about in 2020 getting a bargain getting a deal these CPUs coming in at $100 u.s. and then 120 dollars for the Rison three 3300 X you are getting a really good value for money CPU even if you buy it at these retail prices now I imagine on sales whether it's on eBay or Amazon you'll even be able to get these four cores cheaper and of course couple them with a budget a 320 motherboard get some cheap 3200 megahertz or even three thousand megabytes memory and you're gonna have a really good time with the likes of a budget GPU but also when we look at other CPUs at this price point it's just bringing so many good choices to the CPU scene at $100 in 2020 and that will tell you one thing and that is there's a massive demand for a CPU for a hundred bucks and when there's a lot of demand there there's going to be a lot of supply so it is awesome to see new additions like this but I will tell you one thing before I get on out of here I do miss the Rison 530 500 X if that was still available for a hundred and ten bucks that would still be my number one pick for gamers in 2020 and with that aside let us know in the comments section below what you think of these new four core eight threaded CPUs are you in the market for one of these for cause if so why if not why not love rating your thoughts and opinions as always and we've got the question of the day here which comes from Okayama and they asked can you make a video of 228 Ichi is versus a single r-tx Titan no hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content be sure to hit that like button and if you want to see the videos the moment they drop be sure to hear that sub button running that Bell and I'll catch it in another tech video very soon peace out for now but [Music] you [Music] so coming out of those benchmarks what we could see straight away was that the rumors were true AMD is indeed doing a different thing to the 3300 ex than they're doing to the 3100 and that is that the 3300 ex has four cores on a single CCX module as opposed to the 3100 which has two core spread across
