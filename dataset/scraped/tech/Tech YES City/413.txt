before we get into today's juicy Xeon content I will put out a precursor and say depending where you live at the moment due to a particular virus your shipping times could be delayed massively for instance me getting something from China delivered at the moment I'm looking at around 70 days in total from when I ordered that stuff to get it into Australia now I know some people in other countries they've just flat-out stopped shipments coming in from China and then other countries for instance I'm getting reports from the UK where it's not a problem at all shipments are still coming in as normal so I'm not sure your mileage may vary but I'm just putting that out there before you buy something off Aliexpress for example there may be a massive delay but honestly I don't think that's enough to stop the Zeon crew [Music] if you want eight core 16 threads but you don't want to spend a whole lot of money then today's video may just be for you in the past we have covered eight core 16 threaded Zeon's mainly from the Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge era however they did have their limitations in that the motherboards that supported them most likely didn't support ddr4 memory or PCI MDOT to nvme on board or had things like native USB 3 missing however these Zeon's that we're covering here today are from a different breed in that they support even the latest instruction sets like avx2 and they don't break the bank where there's three eight cores in particular that can be modded to get there max turbo multipliers and these ones at the moment on the market are the 26 30 lv3 the 26 30 v3 which I'm holding in my hand and also the 2640 v3 now I'm only featuring two of the three in today's comparison as that's all I've got on hand I unfortunately didn't order the L version but the big difference between these three is their max turbo multiplier and with that their max all-call boost speeds so we're looking at for the L 2.9 gigahertz max and then for the one I'm holding here the 26:30 v3 3.2 gigahertz max and then for the 40 variant that's going to go to 3.4 gigahertz max making it the highest clocked xeon that we're featuring here this month on the channel so at either 48 or 71 dollars shipped worldwide are these eight cores Aeons a good buy especially when it comes to gamers or desktop enthusiasts let's do what we do best and talk benchmarks with you guys even comparing it to two popular CPUs out there at the moment the Rison 5 2600 which can be had for around $100 shipped and also the risin 5 3600 which is one of the best latest and greatest CPUs to get so going through the 1080p numbers here for you guys the first title is Assassin's Creed syndicate where the 8 cores eons did very well in this benchmark and this is a game that does like single core IPC and clock speeds as much as it likes a couple of extra threads these 8 cores are sitting comfortably between the Rison 5 2600 the risin 5 3,600 but at their price points as you'll see with the next benchmark here fire cry new dawn they are providing pretty good performance this is a single core beast of a game this is pretty much the worst case scenario for these Zeon's especially compared to the other CPUs here that have higher clock speeds and better IPC and we can see here we're still getting 87 FPS on the 3.2 gigahertz 2630 b3 and then on the 2640 v3 we're getting a bit more average FPS making that 200 megahertz a little bit better especially if you are a gamer the movie go to f1 2019 the Zeon's yet again delivered with decent fps and I do remind you guys we are again testing with an RT x 2080 TI which is pretty much above and beyond what i'm guessing someone would be coupling with these CPUs though what about escape from tarkov and I got to be honest with you guys I'll probably stop benchmarking this game after this month as it's just so random in its nature you guys said in the comments you can just get these random dips out of nowhere and that is true for pretty much all the CPUs I tested here and that I had to go through the numbers quite a few times to get the average FPS a stable and what we saw here was the haswell's eons are still doing fine you're getting over a hundred average FPS on both these CPUs and it's also a pretty good experience considering they have a lot of level three cache at their disposal then what about the last benchmark shadow of the Tomb Raider this is where the Zeon's did score out another victory in my opinion especially when we compare it to the risin 5 2600 which arguably needs more expensive memory and now here's the kicker I did use pretty much budget memory in this system the cheapest memory I could find I put it in quad-channel and just left it on auto out of the box though that being a benefit in that you can save money on ddr4 memory can also be a limitation on these motherboards especially with the Zeon's since once you do this modification and I'll put the link to the video up here if you guys haven't seen it's basically the tutorial on how to get the most out of these Zeon's and boost them essentially to the max core speeds there is a limitation in that the RAM speeds will only go up to the official supported speed of the CPU that being said the biggest benefit of these Zeon's right here is simply their price performance pulling up the Cinebench are 20 numbers show you that they're comfortable running avx2 instruction sets and of course they do so with pretty decent power consumption even by 2020 standards so for something that was made way back in like 2014 these Zeon's are now especially with this unlock v3 turbo hack mod and the budget motherboards coming out on aliexpress where today we tested with the machinist which comes in at 70 dollars shipped they're showing just how much potential you can get now out of the older hardware where I personally see the v3 variants putting to rest the v1 that's the Sandy Bridge and also the v2 the Ivy Bridge Zeon's but for me personally there's always still gonna be a place in my heart for x58 don't worry about that though when it comes down to it the 26:30 v3 and also the 2640 v3 I like both these CPUs if you're happy with 3.2 gigahertz across eight cores 16 threads then the 26:30 is going to be fine especially at its price point of 48 bucks though if you want to spend a little bit more and get those extra clock speeds which as we saw a far cry new dawn is important for some particular titles out there mainly admittedly the unoptimized ones then that extra money spent especially when you couple it in with the whole build may just be worth it where it's getting that extra 200 megahertz and of course that will mean extra frames in some games though the biggest benefits to these CPUs right here is I feel the 8 cores 16 threads when we look at those Cinebench numbers that's pretty much going to span across to a lot of other things that you may wish to do like a video editing for example especially if you can get something like a1 and motherboard which supports ddr3 registered and then you can get 32 gigabytes in an eight-core 16 threaded machine happening on very low money though there's going to be the big elephant in the room which we're going to talk about preemptively and that is the risin 5 1600 AF I haven't got my hands on one of these I did reach out and try to get one sent to me but the person who was going to send it to me they pulled out and they couldn't actually get a sample themselves so that's CPU especially you can get it for 85 bucks it's looking like it will be a really good buy especially when you compare it even to the horizon 526 hundred which is virtually the same thing in terms of the Verizon five 3600 as you guys could see in those numbers it's a great balance CPU if you want to get on the latest and greatest and you don't mind spending a bit more money then that CPU is going to be really good too but essentially what these Zeon's offer when it comes down to at all is something that you can get anywhere in the world readily available for pretty good prices and that's what impresses me most with the budget six cores eight cores and we've also got the twelve core coming as well which is going to be the granddaddy I'm going to do a lot more tests for that one because that is the one that I'm looking forward to the most though all that out of the way I asked you guys on discord what you wanted to see me test some of these CPUs with some of you said 5700 XT some of you said 20 atti but I will say it again if you're going to be getting a mid-range GPU even the six core 12 threaded CPU that we took a look at in this video right here coupled with a $200 GPU is going to give you absolutely amazing performance even in 2020 and without a side I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below what you think of the v3 Zeon's love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day where we've got this from a nen learnis who asks I don't suppose this will work for the xeon e5 2687 wv2 so this is a question that's related to of course these eons and I did answer a similar question previously but I do want to make this it's an important thing to know that this turbo multiplier hack the all core boost is pretty much only for the v3 quality sample or retail samples in that it was the only known Xeon for this exploit to exist on and so with that aside I'm grateful that it does exist on these CPUs because they're getting now dumped for so cheap and the motherboards are coming in at really good prices making it just really good price performance in 2020 as opposed to the v1 and v2 Zeon's maybe there are some exploits out there that haven't been found yet who knows but Intel tend to do some real funny things with these Zeon's for instance they made an eight-course 16 threaded overclockable Xeon but they didn't make an 8 it's called mainstream CPU on X 79 and then also they made a 14 core 28 threaded ring boss cpu that was overclockable on the Xeon line back in 2014 which was essentially what was known as the xeon unicorn but no one has seen one of these CPUs out in the wild to this day I'm actually very curious to see one I'd love to see one even in 2020 so if you know someone who has one then let us know in the comments - anyway I've rambled on enough I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now BAE [Music] you [Music]
