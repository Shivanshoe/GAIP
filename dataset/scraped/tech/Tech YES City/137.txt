hold on says it looks like you're ready to go live okay go live let's see let's do it okay let's see if we've got this it says i'm ready yeah there we go so what's going on now it's it's working now okay welcome to a tech yes city live stream this is the first time i've actually in a long time since i've scheduled out a stream so i'm starting to get a little bit organized in that we got notification of the stream 10 minutes ahead so in terms of my life here's the bar and i'm two steps behind and the problem is that i want to be right on the bar and that's life but the bar just keeps moving away from me so yeah anyway welcome to the live stream today we're going to talk about windows 11 and the system requirements so hopefully everything's working hopefully you guys can hear us all well and uh how you doing out there and chat as well come in and join and say hello we'll be answering some chat and uh throughout the stream as well throughout the stream we'll be answering some chat and whatnot and uh yeah it should be good so it's all good all good to go welcome welcome i missed all of you guys too did you know that um okay so oh marco marco's joined in too how you doing marco welcome so we're gonna just uh just just relax a little bit here i just gotta just gotta change over man i've just gotta shake off my uh streaming cobwebs here we've got here windows 11 requirements this is a big one because i don't know how i feel about this because windows 11 like i tried it out and i thought the tpm 2.0 requirement was just because of the dev copy and they kind of had it locked down in some weird way i didn't realize that dev copy was going to be actually way more accurate of what microsoft was going to do so what we've got right here on the screen for you guys is the hardware requirements for windows 11 and you can see here the biggest ones that we're looking at is directx 12. like you're gonna have to have a graphics card that officially supports directx 12. if you don't it's not going to work you're also going to need um four gigabytes of ram that's fair enough like if you don't have four gigabytes of ram you just nowadays your computer just won't even run on windows 10 properly i think four gigabytes is a requirement for windows 10 but there's also a uefi as well and the big one is tpm 2.0 this is the trusted uh platform module you're going to need this and this was something that i spoke about when i originally tried to install the windows 11 dev copy and that is that a lot of motherboards just don't support this i believe it's like from haswell and up so that's your fourth generation intel cpus and also first gen ryzen and upwards so that means fx cpus are going to be uh obsolete if you want to run it with windows 11 and also your older xeons as well and there's a thing some of those zeons especially if we look at something like the x79a core xeons they are still very very um relevant in that the specs on those they go hard man i was using an eight core z on third gen as my main video editing rig for 4k content here and it's something that a lot of systems struggle with is 4k so i'm like i'm upset like i was here i was hyping up windows 11 getting so excited before the release and now i'm kind of seeing the the requirements that are getting locked in and the hype's dying off a little bit so look you know kind of like look i knew the windows 11 thing was legit and people like it's not going to be legit but then like i don't know it's kind of like it's a bit of a trade-off right now so you know and then chats like microsoft is turning into an apple and that's kind of like what it feels like there uh but we've got five dollar donation here from skilled rebuilds thanks so much brother r9 390 here does fsr can you test unsupported hd 7000 or r9 series please uh yeah i mean i can run a test for you guys and just drop that on twitter uh quickly with an older card i believe it like i believe sfr at least in dota 2 should work on pretty much any card that boots the game up and that's because it works on the nvidia cards like i don't think amd is going to lock out the fsr so much but in my recent video i just uploaded a couple of hours ago i was talking about the uh the fact that they're doing things like fsr to help people on lower end cards but then they're not providing driver support for these older cards like the r9 390 which is a perfectly capable card of playing video games still and like for instance an example of where this could um essentially be a real uh crap situation would be if age of empires 4 comes out i'm really waiting for age of empires for i'm sure a lot of people want to get their hands on age of empires four and if age of empires four comes out and it needs a new you know essentially a driver update it needs the drivers to support the game they've got some new fancy effects in there and whatnot it might not work with an r9 390 period but usually in that case in in the case of nvidia and amd usually they provide bare bones support for the new games on the older cards even if they are legacy that's what i've found with some of these titles anyway that being said the the drug them dropping the driver support is kind of like it's like i don't know it just sucks at the moment with the gpu pricing thing i'd say until the gpu pricing situation gets a lot better then it would have been a lot better for them to drop that driver's support considering the fact that amd is in a very healthy position now as a company from a monetary standpoint like you look at their financials they're doing very well there's no need for them to drop that driver support so that's that's something that kind of like sucked but the fsr technology look it's it's one of those things as i said in that video it's it's an option it's great that there's more options for gamers um and in terms of it in terms of it me what i think of it i'm going to play a few more games like boulder's gate 3 i'm going to test fsr on that and i'm also going to test it on uh far cry 6. i think after i play those two games i can check out fsr and see what the goal is but hopefully you guys enjoyed that comparison where we tested it against what nvidia had in that's in that situation which was their sharpening thing so um anyway that's that so system requirements they kind of suck this is the one thing i don't like about windows 11 but you know this is what i mean i've got this dev copy i mean people are like bro brian you're using this developer's copy and that's because it works really well like the dev copy if you i recently did the install on how you don't even need the tpm and the secure boot you just get the original windows 10 os and just put that that wim the windows installation module thing off the off the original windows 11 iso and you drop it on the windows 10 usb stick and you can boot up and you can then install and you're good to go but of course until this gets like this time now that between now windows 11 gets released and waiting is that you've you've got these sort of you know the writings on the wall kind of thing so if you want to get on windows 11 they're essentially saying hey you better upgrade your pc and it's like well in that case you know what i'll just stick with windows 10 and the bloatware i mean that's always that's always a choice so um and i mean hey windows 11 is probably going to have like the official release is probably just going to be as bloated as number 10 make no mistake about that but one like one good thing that they have done is they got this uh intel uh core the intel bridge technology and they're gonna use that in windows 11. so one thing i've noticed is that intel's really getting in bed with microsoft for windows 11 right there people are saying that the laptops with the uh tile architecture from intel is working really well on windows 11 as well as the fact that they're now sort of um they're now sort of doing this where they they're allowing android apps to natively run on the windows os with x86 processors which is this is really good because especially someone like me like if you're if you make content and you kind of got a photo and you edit it on your pc and you're just like look i'd love to just quickly open instagram or whatever on my pc use instagram without having to you know go through a smartphone and uh you know i'm not really a smartphone kind of guy but so you know it does sort of save that time there so uh nate cerrani with the five dollar donut too thanks so much mid-stream putting in the clutch donation there i'm sticking to windows 10 for now beer a hundred percent he's like look he's just like look i'm not going anywhere windows 10 yeah it's another thing is too windows 10 is until 2025. so look we got a lot of time anyway fellas if you're on if you're on a if you're repping those first second or third gen xeons you've still got a few more years yet and even then you might even be able to get some sort of tpm 2.0 workaround or so i'm sure there'll be some kind of work around out there i mean i'm hoping that if microsoft does release windows 11 and it is like really good the final copy then they will sort of leave the enthusiast community alone in sort of getting around this crap and uh tpm 2.0 i was like man tpm 2.0 i've never really bothered to like i haven't even talked about it on my channel like ever so now all of a sudden there's like tpm tpm tpm it's just everywhere i think like actually that's what we think this is why we joined in a live stream we can sort of check google trends and we'll try we'll just check like tpm and we'll see the trends for that we've got two dollar donation here from yeats two dollars online account requirements are a no-go oh yeah is that another requirement oh you can do off yeah the developer copy had offline so that's what i thought the developer copy had offline so um yeah the agent 48 he's going out he's spamming like that's enough spam dude just one message is enough agent 48 i'm using it now it's so good yeah the developer copy was like once you got around all the quirks of trying to install it the developer copy for windows 11 was really good so let's do this tpm let's just have a look this search term let's see what we've got here worldwide okay man apparently people like it's at the highest it's ever been but people have been solidly searching for tpm quite a lot what about tpm 2.0 it needs to needs two point there's a two point there we are there we go that's what we're waiting for that's what we're waiting for okay google trends you've shown me that yes that's what i'm saying before this like i didn't even like talk about on my channel i've really never talked about tpm then all of a sudden windows 11's out it's like what is this tpm 2.0 bang that is actually a massive difference in the search term there so there it is there it is um tube is okay in enterprise we use it yeah so robert cook says you know people who know people are in the know with the sort of the more sort of serious nature of pcs uh going to be using uh tpm and the that that tech for sure but a gamer like you know me and the guys who go out you know hustle a couple of pcs you're not even going to care about tpm you're like yo i don't even leave a password on my pc let alone tpl what do i need that for it's like hey someone wants to come and check out my bank account balance is probably overdrawn you're like yeah you're welcome to you know so that's a tpm a two dollar donation here from uh shampoo time thanks man uh hi just hi and bye got to be up for a ah 4 30 a.m for the work oh that's bro that's early man but you know what apparently waking up really early and going to bed really early is good for your kidneys i think it's good for your kidneys i think your body's like nine till midnight actually it's gonna be nine o'clock soon my kidneys need to rest but apparently nine till twelve midnight so nine pm twelve is your kidney time that's when your body needs to rest on kidneys so we've got a skilled written you guys are enough don't don't don't flood the donuts still going to get on the contest skill rebuilds two dollar donation here can we use dx12 ultimate features on windows 10 i hope so like i mean yeah i guess like i don't think they if they're saying it's supported until 2025 that give you all the bells and whistles until 2025. one of the direct uh tx 12 ultimate features i don't know i don't look into it okay dx i don't know too much i haven't my dxr knowledge dx12 knowledge is so rusty man i haven't looked it up until dx12 was like because the originally windows 10 didn't have dx12 supported from the get-go so that was the last time i researched i'm like how do i get dx12 to work and i had an older install of windows i'm like oh you just gotta update your windows uh so now with the 7.99 donation clutch coming in clutch here would you consider doing some apple content yeah i i people have wanted me to make a hackintosh that's the bit big one one of these days i'll do a hackintosh video very soon again once i get on the bar i'm very close very close to catching up to the bar but i'm always two steps behind the bar right now um but raj connie says are you kidding me yeah i'm kidding you bro i don't know i could be kidding you uh can you do a windows 11 d bloat video yeah so once it's okay to do that kind of content i'm gonna go all in on de-bloating it getting rid of the cat crap pulling up all the big change logs for you guys so stay tuned for that i'll try and do it sooner than later with the windows 11. so we've got two more windows 11 videos coming and uh then we'll be good to go on that so there's that search term tpm it absolutely exploded hey try ftp f oh that's the amd isn't it uh amd yeah ftpm amd had the ftpm that hasn't really done much i mean it's different well people just read tpm 2.0 and they're like okay what's tpm 2.0 uh next up big news is that this one's from a german site we translated it to english because uh you know like look i speak german i speak a bit of german i speak esprechen deutsch but uh you know i can't i still you know a bit of rust now i don't speak german at all but all right german uh german website has promoted um not probably not promoted i'm gonna talk about posted uh the rx 6000 nvidia geforce 30 series uh rtx 3000 series retail price trends and this is really good i mean even though it's uh just segregated to the german market it still gives us an idea of how the pretty much these gpu prices over msrp have pretty much moved in ten with crypto you can see that to a not like to a t if we were to pull up the bitcoin price it would pretty much follow this to a t like or ethereum price because that's what people are mining of course the ethereum profitability does go up and down depending on how many people trade it if there's a lot of trading activity that money can go up and down but generally the price of ethereum is correlated to the mining profitability and hence the price of gpus too on these newer cards because they're the most efficient so that is that is that so if you guys are looking for a gpu hopefully they can get back down to this 127 percent again i said look don't even think about buying a new gpu until they get under this 150 percent here that's like look if you want to get ripped off at least you like you can tolerate that rip off you know if i was going to the store to buy a 6700 xt or a 3060 ti there would be my two picks but not at their prices where the 360ti is like 300 retail um yeah but when they get down say for instance a 399 card coming in at 600 that's 150 percent okay you know i i wouldn't lose too much sleep okay i have to work you know a few more days or whatever like to save that money up but at least i could sleep i'd be getting the enjoyment out of the new cards so both the amd and the thing so i think the uh 6700 xt is coming down at least in australia the c700 xt is coming into stock aggressively and so i think with that the prices should start to go down at least under a thousand aussie dollars for a 6700 xt which would be about seven hundred dollars around that price you are getting close to that one fifty percent ms rp um any news on sorry chat you guys i've i lost a little bit of chat here so uh will windows 11 have 32 bit i know it's old business but business still uh using all that applications it'll have 32-bit support for applications of course but i don't think it'll support 32-bit just if you've just got a 32-bit cpu there's no i think there won't be the option to do a 32-bit install i think that's i think it's 64-bit and up now with windows 11. i think basically what windows wants to do for the i guess on behalf of amd and intel is like hey stop using older hardware go pay and go spend some more money that's like i i mean maybe i'm just being a little bit too cynical here but that's kind of how i see these new requirements and whatnot but did you watch ltt riley star citizen review not yet oh that's a pretty specific request i'll go check that out and give it a watch any news on ddr5 that are relevant and not yet i mean because at ddr5 we know it's it's coming out they're actually manufacturing it now but we don't know like what motherboard and cpu is going to come out with for desktop enthusiasts so that's when that's that when we start getting more wind of that i'll start talking about ddr5 a little bit more but yeah i mean of course better power efficiency better speeds that's that's the two good things but of course you're going to have high latency on those uh sticks of memory that's one thing not to like about that so yeah there's there's that kind of news right there but um we just we'll quickly just quickly do a quick sponsor plug here for the wave three elgato corsair and elgato they're beautiful microphone this is what we're using here we're using a little bit hot as well we turned up the volume a little bit so you get a little bit more crisp for your ears that's a kind of i guess that's the best way to sort of deliver the audio on a live stream but yeah this mic is good it's got up a little bit in price this month but it's a top microphone for people who just want to get into making content whether it's doing voice overs or live streams or whatever you want to do very easy to use microphone great sort of new protection skills built into it with the clip filter as well as the pop filter built in super good microphone and then of course if you want to cop yourself a windows 10 key speaking of windows 11 you can use the windows 10 key for windows 11 and of course if you want to get windows 10 activated you can use the windows 7 and 8 keys for windows 10. so that means windows 7 8 and 10 all work to activate windows 11 so you can cop yourself a windows 11 key right now for 13.50 you can uh get in with the early bird there the early bird special but now we've got some big news in the title uh we put here the room at rdna three so we're getting the last piece of news then we'll go to chat with you guys and um uh anthony weston i did see your comment quickly uh someone delivered it it's like uh windows lite and windows 11 light yeah i said before and early in the stream when i when we get around to sort of allowing to share the windows 11 iso that's when i'll hopefully do the windows 11 light but we will look at it behind the scenes as well you know you've got to get yourself go cop that copy of the dev go cop yourself a dev copy brothers um uh will you make an nt light windows 11 i'll make a windows 11 light i don't know about nt but you know i'll just make a windows 11 light that's what we do you know it's what we do around tech your city we love making windows lean mean and a performance enhancing machine for your gear did i just ryman on live stream this is what you get when you tune into the live you get a bit of a rhyme going on so i dna3 so chiplet gpu designs so this is what they're rumored to go with the next generation now if you're looking at this right if you're if you're looking at the 6900 xt i usually wouldn't like hype up amd in terms of their graphics cards they've had a history before rdna 2 of sort of like you know look at vega radeon 7. they've had a history then of under performing with their hype but then rdna 2 came out and this article here i completely agree with it it's like our dna 2 delivered like it gave us the performance increases i was impressed with how amd pretty much caught up with nvidia in this generation now nvidia of course also on top of that offered a big performance increase on their 3080 and 3090. so it was kind of great it was really good to see actually like amd just catch up of course the stock is another situation and the pricing i mean it's just like one of those we got the good side on one hand and the bad side on the other hand the good side is they caught up and then the bad side is it's all messed up for gamers so you've got that situation but i think with rdna 3 this is the first time i think you'll see in a long time where amd could surpass nvidia in the graphics card generation because of the chiplet design now we've seen that with ryzen they snuck up they snuck up on intel with their chiplet design and out of nowhere they just overtook intel it was just like bang in a couple of years like intel was left scratching the head there now they're now they're in panic mode and uh this could very well happen with uh nvidia as well if nvidia doesn't do something and uh i mean now you're seeing intel sort of if you look at the cpu line of things intel is taking that approach where they're tiling the cpus and sort of you know in ways not using a chiplet design they're using a stacking design where they're going to sort of essentially use multiple cpus like apu i mean like amd's doing but essentially what you've got with the chip light design multiple gpus and now in ways i kind of like it's not a chiplet design on the 6700 xt and 6900 xt but they are connected with infinity cache in the middle here like this was one of the things i noticed with uh the 6900 xt was it's kind of is like 260 700 xt's if you look at that it's kind of like 260 700 xt stuck together that makes the 6900 xt so that's where that's why the 6900xt performs so well and the benefits of doing this of course is the heat you know if you make a silicon die too big with all these clusters and they go out to here they'll just overheat themselves before they can dissipate heat so hence the chiplet design solves that solution by giving you more processing power in one package but still taking advantage of heat dissipation so that's how that's how i see it i might be wrong uh you know i don't claim to be the the beetle and know all of tech but in terms of um in terms of rdna 3 if they've got you know especially coupled with a five a drop to five nanometer amd could be on top next generation that's a very like now this time i usually don't talk about hype with gpus but this time around it's a very very big possibility so amd could be the top dog on the gpu soon very possible as opposed to previous generations i was like well wait and see it because you know amd didn't have that track record but with rd a2 they pretty much caught up to it and video so that was good to see so i really like what they've done here so five nanometer coupled in with an ipc improvement coupled in with you now if you imagine four of these instead of just having two on the 6900 xt you now have two of these stacked you've got four 6700 xt's potentially you know you have a lot of performance that's possible and all of a sudden it's like you know nvidia left scratching their heads very possible but speaking of video we've got these so do let us know in chat what do you guys think what do you guys think of our dna 3 do you think that's going to be the one i mean we'll talk about the pricing very soon but let's get we get onto rtx 4000 where nvidia is rumored to go to 5 nanometer as well so nvidia wants a pius uh piece of this five nanometer action of course there's no uh good i've muted the side like it's like moving stuff and sound everywhere and i have like i hope there's no sound coming through on the stream but uh we got here so five nanometer uh fabrication process but the amount of cuda cores are gonna be jamming into the rtx 4000 will make it a massive boost on its own so you could just see like if i do the math correctly it'd be like 18 000 cuda cores or something like that on their rtx 4090 or something so you could just see a massive amount of um cuda cores with nvidia's next generation so whether that'll be enough like if if all these rumors pan out which i think they're both like pretty i gotta admit these these both these rumors that i'm reading here are kind of very well like like just straight to the point like they're very logical very sort of calculated in the way that they're talking about the rumors they're not promising you know pie in the sky like this is going to be like 10 times faster than the previous generation uh you know like it's none of these you're not seeing any of that you're just seeing straight up just realistic guessing of what is coming out with these next generation architectures which i'm really looking forward to both the next generations and hopefully by then we've got at least some alleviation on the gpu pricing and crypto mining hopefully crypto mining has gone completely bus dollar and that would mean that we've got gpu pricing returning to normal which means that we could you know as enthusiasts you could say okay i want to get an rtx 4080 i want to get a a 7900 xt or i mean look and one thing for amd one message to amd if amd is going to release a 7000 series card they better and i mean they better as person who used to play final fantasy vii they better release the rx7777 if they don't then i'm going to get very angry that's what i'm going to say we need the rx we need the rx lucky sevens that's what we need so hopefully amd can do it hopefully i can do it we can see it'd be good to see him on top like it'd be good to see him on top because that would make even more for innovation and we only win when competition is really good the end user only wins out of this so do let us know what you guys think about in chat lucky sevens and our dna but with that aside guys we're going to move over now to chat and just chat with you guys and we'll chill out and we'll end out the stream and uh move along so drop in your questions and let's see what's cracker lacking and uh yeah we'll hang out a little bit earl grey tea of course what would you need and the arch so we need the rtx 9999 that'd be pretty cool but they need to get like that kind of cheesy naming i miss it man that's kind of that cheesy stuff man i really miss that sort of naming convention uh that's this is it's like it's been too it's been too long so got an rx for uh 470 for a hundred aussie dollars was that a good deal uh yeah i mean that's really good in australia so if you get yourself any of these cards like rx 570s even a 560 for 100 aussie dollars is a good deal in this market so that's a really good uh it depends as well like when you buy used gpus one thing you do want to be careful of is um one thing you do want to be careful of is if the cooler has a lot of like rust on it and it's really rusty because i've had a few of those cards come in in the past where they're just the coolers are just completely oxidized and they just honestly they probably last like two months and then they just a lot of them just drop off so yeah that's it so cheesy naming desync welcome to the chat so cheesy naming nothing compared to my 9800 gtx ultra yeah that's i don't yeah that was back in the that was back in the old days olden days with the 8800 yeah gt the 8800 gt was like the that was the the card back in the day uh jason woods is linus really your son yeah bro yeah i'll just get i got him on speed dial you know just call him up yo linus what's crackin dude how you doing son uh now i mean do i look that old do i do i look that old if i'm that old i just yeah maybe i should just hang up the boots and retire maybe i'm done with uh maybe it's time for me to hang up the youtube boots so hang up the cape rusty gpus i've never i've alright i never buy oh you never buy amd i see i mean amd cards are fine like uh lately they've gotten a lot better they've got a lot better amd graphics cards back in the day like back in the yeah like for me back when they um back when they had the r9 200 series coming out their drivers had a lot of problems that was for me personally and i just couldn't use them but they have improved a lot since then to their credit and now they're proving a lot with their price performance as well i mean all things considered outside of the uh crypto binding boom so brisbane it tech what's cracking brett what's going on dude also windows 11 home is the only addition needing to have an online account to complete installation oh okay that's good that's back to the windows 11 discussion that's some good news okay so basically windows 11 pro is going to be the one to get over windows 11 home how old are you actually i am 35 years old uh why was it really that cold there yeah i mean in australia it's winter at the moment i mean it's not that cold like i'm not freezing i think it's like 15 degrees or something but that that for me is cold uh graemer we got the grama uh habital do you have a girlfriend uh no comment no comment uh it's kind of it's a little bit patchy my uh my love life i'm gonna just say it's a bit patchy that's that's the way to put it my love life is a bit patchy brothers i'm not gonna really talk about too much the one that's i talk about really anything on the channel but i won't talk about my love life at the moment that's all um i want to make separate spaces for programming office work gaming what do you suggest multiple os's multiple user accounts multiple desktops just multiple user accounts yeah that's just if you want to just make two user accounts or three user accounts on your windows and then you'll be good to go one for with all your games and stuff installed then the other with all your office stuff so that's easy uh nextgen ryzen please is it worth waiting no um i mean actually yeah i'm gonna be pretty blunt with the cpus now you your gpus like everything's moving towards higher resolution gaming i mean for me personally you don't need a really like your your ryzen 5 uh 3600 and your 11400f they're to be absolutely fine especially if you want to step up to 4k gaming like i think at 1080p you know the 11400f in the 3600 is going to give you a really good gaming experience um you know so oh man that chat those last two sentences are brutal uh oh man that's a lovely name there too you got there oh how are you even allowed a name like that on youtube you know oh man i love this chat sometimes oh man you gotta can you please i don't to list like look at that did you just ban that name i'm gonna get it off my screen like jesus man oh crap well i lost train of thought man i lost train of thought like like how do you do you got to change your name like come on man they could be like uh people with children or whatever stop on by and they see that kind of username like there's gotta be no i'm pretty again i'm pretty loose with stuff so uh anyway so we got questions here uh what uh so do you have a discord server yeah we got a discord server and again i've just been like with life i've been so behind on a lot of things so i've just been sort of um i've just been sort of i haven't been on i've been active on discord for a little while so i've got to get on and be more active so there's a few things i got to do personally and they they're coming really soon so uh how long do you think it will be before someone mods windows 11 to not need tpm 2.0 i mean the dev copies like i've already gotten past the tpm 2.0 you just get the windows installation wim file and chuck it on a usb windows 10 installed a usb key and you don't need tpm2 enabled uh because oh yeah we got some couple people asked us what was the name of the video where we did that because a couple people asked about that oh how to install windows 11 usb key i'm like holding up the usb key on the thumbnail that's weird yeah a lot of my videos just aren't showing like people saying i don't get the notifications or anything i just i guess guys the best thing i can say is just youtube.com slash tech yes city and then uh just peg it in your home page as a favorite and then just check on it every couple of days and then you can get up to date with the content i'm now with the 799 donation 15 degrees i'm here on camera at six degrees right now with a low of minus two oh yeah canberra can get pretty cold same as yeah you go down to melbourne and then tasmania it can get really cold uh i'm in the gold coast brother and gold coast is just like party all year round um it's pretty good so there's the benefit of being on the gold on the coast uh hugo stroller 200 yen hey arigatou this is only uefi my old i5 isn't compatible i mean yeah like for now it's not compatible i mean if you get the dev copy and just follow that windows 11 install then you can get it work i got it working on an i5 2400 so and that was on some random acer motherboard i mean it might have had tpm on it it might have but i got it working on that so i know it wasn't tpm 2.0 though so that's that's for sure uh so yeah basically i'm so grizzly you've tagged me man you're saying i'm basically on windows 10 1709 with my 8700k and gtx 1080 it seems windows 11 wants me to forego my input latency tweaks yeah we'll get on to latency as well with windows 11. that's one video i will promise to you guys windows 10 versus windows 11 latency we'll check that out um from my like from my initial reactions the latency is okay there's no like there's nothing to worry about in fact i would say your tv making sure your tv or like for instance i'm using these ogl leds oh gee oh gee i called emoji og olet ogl leds that's it ogles make sure they're on game mode and then um that's about like you know make sure your gear is set up to be in the lowest input state before you start looking at the os first uh mike with the 2 canadian donation my old youtube name was hey which yeah i'm not reading that one out man i've uh you didn't get me there you didn't get me there you know hey heywood haywood you didn't get me there i love these jokes i mean i mean it's good to die like i encourage that but like if you're gonna have a name like black you know bang like just put some ash tricks in it or something so people just can't read it you know it's not like sitting me in the face staring at me in the face you know like yeah uh do non-uefi blasts still common these days i mean not not like everything's uefi nowadays um i missed the donation which did i ryan the burger i did too sorry i missed the donation thanks for the five euro brother uh your videos inspired me to get into building resale game here in ireland have a pint on me thanks brother yeah so the reselling game at the moment i'm gonna be honest with the reselling game it's like it's picked up like in the last week i've like i've sold out of all my stuff like so the the parts hunt coming out is gonna be really good but that's only because of fine end of financial year so like everyone who bought a pc off me in the last week's like yo i need a tax invoice need a tax invoice so like there's going to be the end of financial year because in australia our financial year ends at in five days in america and japan and stuff like that i think you guys end at december 31st or whatever and so it ends for us on june 30th so that's our end of financial year so people want to spend if they've got extra cash they want to start buying stuff for the business and writing their tax down so they need those invoices spend spend spend and so the last week in australia has been pretty good like i've sold out of a lot of stuff and i'm sure a lot of businesses would be doing pretty well but then early next week oh sorry next month i'm going to find out you know is it back to normal like it's been a slow period we'll find out about that very soon we've got some tags here uh what do you think about older lake i7 having eight plus four so 12 cores versus amd r7 only having eight big calls i like i think cpus now um the more the focus for me is more on gpus and getting 4k streamline now because i i think 4k is finally becoming affordable for the masses like you know you're getting there right all you need is a real good budget 4k monitor now as well as like because the cpus i mean it's getting to the stage now where i'm doing some of these fps comparisons and i'm getting like five 600 fps and i'm just thinking to myself like you know you don't need any more than 240 like even 360 hertz monitors for me just did not really make a difference so for me personally i'm like i'm focusing on 240 hertz and i think a lot of the newer cpus like even the i5 11400 f will do that so if you're talking about a plus 4 for gaming versus amd i think a lot of the newer cpus are going to be absolutely fine but that being said i always like want to see the big single core gains on this i want that ipc i want that clock speed so i want to be able to run anything and uh single core performance still is pretty important for me and amd is currently on top with the 5800 x for that konichiwa hi my ver vicarious life okay you're living vicariously through yourself that's pretty good and do you think the rtx 4000 will be better jump from rtx 2000 to 3000 gut says yes my gut says yes and the reason being is because amd's coming up with something big and you know like isn't it ironic that we got like just when you think about the irony of the rtx 3000 right rtx 2000 was a lackluster increase over the 10 series then all of a sudden we got this massive gain with the 30 90 over the 2080 ti like and the 3080 was big too there was a reason for that and isn't it ironic that it just comes out pretty much like a smidgen above amd's offerings like that's on average and 6900 xt will clock the 3090 in some games but majority of the games the 39 will edge it out like one or two percent like isn't it just ironic that it's just coming in higher than the competitor so i think you know 4000 series judging by what amd's got brewing with their next generation i think you're going to see a massive gain actually with a 4 000 series that's just how i'm reading the book right now if you guys are coming for just a straight up what i sort of like foresee so ogl leds for life neo voodoo tech thanks that's it i i saw a pre-built on bpc build a pc is that the reddit subreddit forum with a 30-60 360 gigabytes of ram for sixteen hundred and seventy dollars uh you think it's worth the upgrade on the zeus strix 1060 laptop i mean the fact that you're asking the question sort of like i think you don't need the upgrade you want the upgrade and in that case it's like okay have you got sixteen hundred and seventy dollars to blow uh i would honestly i just like i said to people i just buy some silver and save for a better day um i'd kind of save your money in precious metals that's sort of what i that's if you're asking me for a recommendation uh um yeah your 1060 laptop is going to play games i mean what games do you play as well if you're just playing valor ant uh maybe a bit of call of duty and stuff your 1060 laptop is going to be fine i wouldn't really upgrade for now um you know the 3060 is not like out of all the new rtx 3000 series cards i wasn't that keen on the 3060 as opposed to the 3060 ti so if there's a 360 ti in there i'd be like okay we've got a kind of a big upgrade there but 3060 was kind of didn't do too much for me except having a massive vram buffer bigger than that of all the three cards above it so that was kind of funny to see so bro can i fire 4690k with a gtx 77 sorry gtx 770 4 gigabyte run windows 11. is that dx12 gtx 770 i think so maybe i think it i think you're fine i think yeah i think that setup the 4th gen haswell on a 770 will just cut the mark i think don't quote like don't quote me on that but i think it will yeah so it does yeah 770 will support dx12 so yeah you'll be fine officially and then unofficially you'll be fine too uh windows 11 without tpm possible yeah we've already done that so i keep getting asked this question already done it guys video i'll link that in the description below uh mad donations coming in i'm seeing like the top of that i'm trying to read through the questions and it's just like flight donation flight okay so brandonville eldon zar35 uh that's south african rond i think thank you running windows 11 on both the i5 34 7700k thanks to you you're welcome brother thanks for the donation too man i got to do the carry trade on some south african iran too i am on my day off you know and just get a bit of that rand and long it up against the us dollar you know you might even win you know uh tim wordley 499 donation thanks brother i got myself gigabytes gtx rtx 3070 ti eagle edition and also the uh 27g g-sync monitor as well okay sounds like you you're ballin there dude uh congrats on that i mean yeah that's just awesome thanks for the donation too i mean if you have you're gonna be happy with that uh i'm sort of i'm i'm in oled heaven right now but i mean i've gone on my channel like you've gone down the oled tangent we've already talked about you know hype i've already hyped up oleds in the past i'm not going to hype it up for a round two uh you got another uh george andari thanks man for the five dollar dono how do you stop coil wine when your pc is turned off do i need to replace my power supply yes yes dude you do need to replace that power supply so if you got coil one when the pc is turned off i forgot which component it exactly is but yeah your power supplied like it's not good to have that thing it powering computer components at the moment it means it's been heavily used uh to be producing coil wine when your pc is not even turned on so yeah definitely change that over soon that's actually i'm glad i read that comment man so do get something decent as well uh so yeah i think i mean yeah if you need it if you need money for the power supply to do just send us a dm after i can refund you the fiverr dude it's fine um you know but thanks for the donate i mean yeah if you wanted that's all good uh billy idol uh what is a cheap a goodish cheap ish i've uh 4400 hertz 4k monitor a 144 hertz 444 hertz what's wrong with me tonight man it was just like speech is going all over the place all right you know what it is i'm gonna say like all this speech is because of this like this is what's happening yeah like just pull it out matrix reload it there we go look at that get some of that [Music] best matrix movie and then tell me i'm wrong but that is the best matrix movie to come out yet matrix reloaded best matrix movie in the series number two baby i absolutely loved it i remember seeing number one and i loved number one and the number two was just like i was in my chair just gob smacked at how good reloaded was anyway billy idol i'd so uh one for how did we yeah it was the speech thing the matrix was making me uh sort of uh jitter up my speech there so a goodish 144 hertz 4k model i don't think they exist like cheapish a good one i think the only one i can think of is zeus but if you're going for 4k get the 120 hertz oleds that's what i got right now oled if you go on 4k just go for oled sacrifice as much as you can for the oled 4k and then maddie how you doing man maybe with the five dollar donation when is a windows 11 coming out i don't think they've given us an official date yet but what we do have is late 2021. so that's like five four months five months so four or five months um yeah so that's that's uh probably expect about four months i'd say october gearing up towards christmas uh shipmate gonna make a video about possible gpu prices after china bans 90 of crypto mining uh what i'm waiting for is i'm still waiting for the gpu profitability to come down actually we can check that right now with you guys so we'll do a live little update on gpu affordability here and uh quickly trying to build a 50 euro 50 pound pc any really cheap graphics card struggling a bit man 50 pounds that's really hard to do dude you're gonna have to yeah look for the gpu first maybe go with a gtx 5 series you should be able to snipe one 560 ti i know it's a little bit on a budget but 560 ti for 50 pounds should be doable that hopefully that answers that question that's what i'd go for around 50 pound budget don't ask me how i know all this but yeah it's just been watching all the market and that's probably your best pick right now for a real budget anyway uh we got here uh reloaded yeah dude the matrix series reloaded was the best man reloaded just had all the characters the depth the story was it was just the excitement then three to me like the third series like the third one was just like first and like first and second look first and second you could debate which one's better but you can't say thirds better than second or first okay you cannot say that that's just not going on for me i'm not having it not in this not here matrix four yeah matrix four i can't wait to see matrix four two hopefully they have a midnight session i'm gonna be doing a midnight session and you know kiara reeves man i gotta see that asap i'm gonna try and dress up as keanu reeves i never do cosplay but i'd make an exception for matrix four you know what i mean sean murtagh thanks brother for the five dollar donation here you need a tpm module or does enabling ftpm and bios for mobile that support it enough to use windows without no tpm worker yes so you can use the ftpm to get around it i tested that out as well in a previous video sorry i got double chat here that's going to be confusing for you guys uh where would you want to check yeah what to mine let's have a look we're going to do a little update um what to mine.com let's have a look here 360ti is the main it's like the main chin dig i guess we got this actually remembered it from the last time i looked up at 3060 ti so uh we got to sort of like show you guys the profitability uh see there's i got to turn off snapping this is another thing i got to turn off in windows so i can show you guys the profitability so here's 30 60 ti it's still earning three dollars a day and it's going down like that profitability is heading down it's but it's staying at around this level it's staying at around you know 360ti this is the problem it needs to go down to like a dollar a day realistically as long as it's profitable even at two dollars people are still going to hold out and they will still buy 30 60 ti's for 650 dollars at two dollars a day right still 300 day roi and that's the problem as long as these rois are still under a year they're going to buy up the cards and that's just plain and simple i know because i talk to these guys like you know they like you know i don't i and that's the thing like if i talk to a guy like on youtube there's i got a friend called son of a tech he's he's a crypto miner and like yeah i don't like i'm not a crypto miner i don't agree with crypto mining on gpus but i don't like you know i don't care like it's it's just a thing right it's like leave like if they want to do crypto mining that's their business you know because i at the end of the day there's so many good people out there who are crypto miners and they've got different whatever beliefs i don't care uh but yeah so i've got a lot of friends who are crypto miners and so they you know they tell me about all this stuff and yeah you're gonna have to wait for about like realistically once it starts getting over 450 days roi then you're starting to look at gpu prices coming down so that would be you know you'd have to see for a g for a 30 60 ti to come in and around msrp you're gonna have to see this go down to a dollar a day so f would need a sink down just based on calculations f would need to go down to around 800 a day i mean so 800 a coin so we can look at what the price of f is right now uh ethereum price ah look at that we got a little drop like oh this is like getting excited we should just turn this into the kryptos crashing party i mean they like this is australian dollars let's get into usd pricing uh so yeah if this drops another thousand bucks i mean people might say it's impossible but if this drops all we need now is a thousand dollar drop on this goes down to under a thousand bucks then we're close like we're getting there we're getting there all right we're getting there by alls we need this price to go down to around a thousand dollars and we are there so that's it and uh we got oh we've got a donation coming in here brother we got jordan chopin 14.99 thank you very interesting donation with the 99 cents coming in there we go we've got these questions so many people tagged us here um windows dev have updates or doesn't worth it for now so i've said in the past windows 11 developers version my personal opinion is it's worth it right now i absolutely love the dev version because it feels like it's it hasn't got all the baked in crap and that's why i think the person who leaked it wanted to leak it just to give the enthusiasts something like back if you guys remember xp days and uh windows 7 days before windows 7 was released this crap was happening they were leaking windows 7 and it was so good like it reminds me of those days someone released the windows 11 league copy and just everyone on the streets like you know like i remember when i saw my friend who gave it to me he was like yo windows 11 dude i saw his his eyes light up and his excitement he's like i've installed on all my pcs this is before i even gave me the copy and i knew that and there i'm like yeah this is good this is going to be good so the windows 11 dev copy yeah i just go for it man that's my opinion uh you know if you're an old school sort of pc enthusiast you don't care about all the like i don't care about this meltdown and spectre and oh my god my pc is going to get hacked uh i just don't care it's like you know come hack me it's just you know you might you know i might find my broke overdrawn bank account while you're out so good luck with that one but uh do you um okay uh what do we got here more questions uh mate do you think uh what do you think about the future of x86 will arm invade the gaming pc market yeah i mean if you look at tablets dude they're already invading the gaming market i mean in terms of the pc gaming market nvidia wants to get arm for a reason they want to dominate they want to dominate so yeah x86 days could very well be numbered if nvidia and that merger goes ahead that's all i'm going to say very sort of possible reality with you know arm and the acquisition from nvidia in terms of gaming and the future of pc gaming so and you remember you got you got things like um you know the the smart access memory you know what's the official name for it again night time memories has gone kapoof you know this is the direct bypass the cpu sort of thing that you know so you won't need as much processing power because the gpu is going to be doing most of uh pretty much everything in terms of when it comes to gaming so that's like the future of gaming because the gpu is so much more powerful than the cpu at least on the you know with x86 architecture uh will you update the techies city windows iso yes we're gonna be doing a windows 11 one so stay tuned for that when we got that so look we window this dev copy man this windows 11 dead copy legit dude i you know me guys i don't like sort of i don't mess around and um you know i just give it to you straight always going to give it to you straight you know what i mean so bitcoin price usd what's happening we got a little oh we've got a little bit of a little bit of a drop here today so this is the crypto crash party you know it's like funny because i go on twitter and everyone's like sad when crypto's crashing it's all these doggy coins and oh you know the doge army and all this and they're all like come on guys we can get the price up we can get the price up and then there's baby doge or something that was the latest thing promoted to me on twitter i'm just thinking i am face palming the whole way reading this i'm like what are you guys investing in you know i mean like what what are you investing in with these doggy coins like i really need to know um you know investing in madness like hey investing in matters i'm all for it just just be honest uh with a 35-70 k 1650 super build with no spectre boot and tpm support be able to run windows 11. i mean the official version i don't know and so in terms of the official version not sure but in terms of the dev version with the workaround yeah it works right now uh dogecoin or bitcoin neither i'm all about no i'm not like like when it comes to crypto i like honestly when i look at it if you were to ask me what crypto i would in like if you had to invest in a crypto for me it's xrp because banks are actually utilizing this right now it's actually a cryptocurrency being utilized and um that like and then look at the market right now like if you want to invest in this kind of market right now it's madness like i don't think anyone sort of takes you back and tells you that your investment is going up 20 in a day down 20 percent in a couple of days this is madness like absolute madness for an investment man like imagine if you had a majority of your savings in this crap imagine if you had the majority of your savings every day you'd be waking up just checking this in there like oh is it down is it up is you know you'd be like you'd be getting stressed out of your brain investing in crypto like this is for the average person don't do it to yourself like this is just like look at this price action here down two percent in a day i mean this is complete madness i wouldn't invest in any cryptocurrency right now it's just complete it's like this is i don't think people stress how much volatility is in cryptocurrency right now and if you guys are willing to like ride the like i mean if you're willing to go yolo if you're like 19 20 years old and you've got some yolo cash and you want to have a bit of fun go for it but like for anyone who wants to sort of invest for the future investing in this right now is just complete like i think it's complete madness until price stabilizes until you get you know like i mean look okay three months absolutely insane everything's easy look at all the charts it's all insane like until you get to this level here right until crypto gets to this level right where it goes from 24 cents to 25 cents in that's when you invest in something when it's most like this right now you're in for you're in for a massive headache if you invest in this and think you know it could could go up could go down but like last time we saw dogecoin on the stream and we talked about it was up to like 70 cents or something that was dogecoin 70 cents or 69 cents or something people going crazy over it but um anyway sorry hey what happened oh okay so the the i'm still all the audio's still okay this is running yeah battery that's why yeah yeah oh it was running off battery okay just a sec guys we've got a bit of a camera problem at least the audio is okay hey things could be worse so lacy like it could be worse you know we'll be right back up this will be a live technical this will be live right this is on a live we're going to fix our technical problems right here live for you guys now you got to turn that hdmi there we go oh this man is on his game oh and then get me in focus too that's it now this is a podcast that's right this is how you do it hey you know what i was told as long as the audio's okay you can get away with anything and so even with us now we've got like we've gone to a slow frame rate that's that's pretty cool oh yeah that might work that's a good idea there it is i'm gone now now i'm back double tap yeah then go deactivate i'll deact but if we do that okay then once you reactivate it should be fine okay oh this man cis man is on his game we're back to 30 fps yeah look i couldn't do like two like come on 10 fps was always bothering me you know like it was one of the quickest fixes uh did that just drop another percent while we'll wait yeah like this is like here we are talking about volatility and it literally just drops while we're talking about it like oh man come on come on hey that's that's with crypto okay guys if you if you like you know if you want to this is the definition of stress right here this is one reason i won't touch crypto right so i'll just stick to some you know like these defensive slow-moving assets because the end of the day is sleeping like a baby and i think a lot of people underestimate the quality of sleep and if you ain't sleeping right man you gotta fix that you know you gotta try and fix that any way possible i think one way of fixing your stress is to not invest in crypto uh that's that's that's one pro tip for you guys while we're doing the live stream uh can we do 120 fps from marco uh dude this is 120 fps human eye can't see more than 30 so how do you know if it's 120 fps or not it's it's late night it's getting late night now guys late night i'm losing it so uh we got here from ryan malek how you doing dude i've i noticed you in the comments a lot man thanks for your comment a lot dude thanks uh thanks it uh is i3 10 100 f for 100 usd a good buy right now 400 us yeah sounds good man like i mean if you if all the other cpus are like 200 bucks that's that's pretty solid uh h 410 motherboard try and pick one up cheap you got yourself a solid little combo there that's definitely in the go um whatever the big screen is i don't want to stress like if there's some guys like if some guy's out there watching his crypto drop right now like don't worry i i i've been there before like that's why and i know from experience i've been there before watching volatile investments crash in one day i've been there done that you know that's why you don't want to get the volatile investments because it can make or break you know it's like dating when do you go when do you go uh hunting pc parts uh very soon very soon so uh very soon uh parts hunt is coming it always comes around the end of the month i just i wake up in the morning and man like i was talking about this in a previous live stream chaotic that's that's what tech yes you come to tech yesterday chaos right i mean it's chaotic good right if you were to play a dungeons and dragons character it's it's a chaotic good right you do good by the people but your lifestyle is just like hey wake up all right let's do a parts hunt today that's kind of like how it is and um yeah so the part time will probably come tomorrow could come the next day could come the day after but it will come before the end of the month that's been a that's been going on four years now yeah it's been a four year thing going now every month we've got that used pc part time of the month but this month's going to be a little bit different this month is going to be a very different um going to be very different in that i'm going to be doing i'm going to be changing things up this month that's for sure because there's a few market trends that are changing i definitely got to say if you want to sell pc now like rgb is like an absolute must um you know i was doing those uh pre-built bangers from les i have to start picking out the ones that i can piece out now with rgb so uh there's you know there's that so a few of you guys actually might have heard the uh finance party he's like tell me okay i'm watching 14 doge gain against bitcoin all day okay uh you got here clickbait uh clickbait asks i5 11 600 and b 560 worth it if you pick up the 11600 for a decent price sure but the 11600 does carry a premium over the 11400f that i don't think is justified but we can check that out for you guys on the live stream just the prices and um yeah just see what's cracking there rather than check like look your prices of your cpus hopefully won't change like crypto that's for sure but uh they back up half a percent now you see that as 11 600 sorry you were saying 11 600 not this is b560 if you said not a 10 600 make sure it's 11 600 um wow what's wrong with the pricing in the us do not pay 400 for this processor dude do not pay that like this piece this chip is that that's ridic do not buy an eleven six hundred for four hundred dollars i'm just telling you do not buy oh man and then what's this they've got an i5 1040f not even a 10-400 look at this we've got a 1040f i mean i love live streaming hey look at this you had a 1040f can i can i buy this cpu and you get it and it's like someone's just given you like a tenth of the cpu core and they're like hey i did say it was a 1040f didn't say it would work so but yeah don't pay like these cpus are ridiculously overpriced right now um i mean maybe new eggs got them bit they're having an end of year wow how did you find semi-annual clearance like get get in you got to get in right now that's a bit better but i mean these cpus were going like 160 i think it was 170 bucks now they're 242 they've gone up a lot so i definitely i would personally hold off until just a little bit i mean if you see the government's printing out more money just get one straight away like the government's like hey we've got another trillion trillion trillion dollar stimulus coming everyone's got free money then yeah just as soon as you hear that go to the store and buy some stuff straight away because you know it's like okay there's a problem at the moment and it's cheap money and they're just compounding the problem by doing that so um that's that's what's going on there so uh that's what's yeah cpus just hold out for now my man just hold out if you're if you're in if you're in australia it's the pricing is a little bit better on the 11400 f i think you can pick it up for under 300 dollars it'll be around 200 us i think in australia um but we'll continue on uh what is the best fsr setting for dota 2 okay so we did the fsr testing dota 2 would be 75 if you want to get more fps the native resolution and still get a good picture that would be the best fsr setting but even then i would argue just going with native resolution and dropping down the settings and keeping the screen resolution at 100 percent that's how i would play dota 2 personally so fsr i i like it it's doing some i'd say even 99 fsr and dropping the settings down too would be better as well so i mean yeah fsr was one of those things for dota 2 where i i noticed it was much more of a sharpening effect than it was in terms of um filling in pixel detail by a like you know temporal like anti-aliasing or anything like that or dlss upscaling with ai so it was a different kind of it was a different kind of um sort of upscale it was more i just thought the dota 2 implementation like it was okay it wasn't like it didn't blow me away so aren't those aussie dollars no they they shouldn't be they're they're us dollars usually it'll say a in front of it so uh when we've got aussie dollars like we'll check i'll check the aussie pricing for you guys quickly on the cpus what are you guys asking about the pricing a lot of you guys talking about the inflation and we can talk yeah inflate man we can talk about the inflation all day you know i love talking about inflation because it's good that people learn about inflation because inflation is a hidden tax it's a tax on the average person that's what it is uh nico's constantino thank you brother for the euro the two euro if you want to ask a question go ahead but we're going to quickly check the aussie pricing here for the so this is another website if you're in australia you can check static ice dot com dot a u it'll just give you like it'll check it'll scan all the stores so 11 400 f is that in stock let's check big drum roll let's see if we're getting it better we are where's this out of stock oh that one that one hit the fields next i was hoping it's inside um limit one per household stock availability come on man notify me i think it's out of stock whoa where did this creep they just suddenly creeped up on me someone's buying up all the 1100 400 f's pre-order what dude someone's buying up all the 11 400 f's if you find that who's buying we're going up we're going up here we're going 269 in stock okay in stock we got oz delivery in stock 249 aussie let's check out that let's convert that for you guys let's see how much 11400f costs in australia that's with tax as well that that those prices are with tax so we got 489 usd and that's with tax so that's not bad like that is you know that's a fair price uh yeah so you guys in the us with those 300 price points on the 11400 f don't buy it's just a ripoff you know like because you your usd as you can see here is stronger than the aussie dollar so like you know naturally if there was that much of a shortage i would start like this is what people do they start buying up 11 400 f's locally and start shipping them to guys in the us and still making a profit that's called arbitrage and that will happen soon actually now i might start up a quick arbitrage youtube channel like tech arbitrage you know what i mean start buying from one market and supplying another um and that way you're alleviating a supply uh rut in that particular country and you're also saving people money that's it this is it new business idea we a new business idea on a live stream baby so i'm talking about baby oh give it to me baby no you know they got that that voice over uh you hear it on those rap songs sometimes you got that dude with the full croaky voice oh baby give it to me baby so i'm going to give it to you on a live stream and we got here one usd is 100 1.32 so you have a hundred 132 dollars bang easy done just like that let's get back to questions moment of silence please for the pricing in the us just a moment of silence please 10 600k for 170 us if you're in the usa yes just based on what i saw with that based on what i saw um 10 600k for 170 us is a good deal unfortunately like i would say you know 11 400 for 170 would be a bit better but yeah there you go you poor guys in the us man you're getting hit hard right now you're getting hit hard that's just like you know sooner or later yeah it's going to be a bit of an arbitrage yeah i mean at least the like look this is more stable right if we look at the stability here in the us dollar versus the aussie dollar that's not moving like crypto i mean it is still pretty volatile but it's not moving like crypto you know what i mean like if you look at the us dollar still like that's more of a stability so if crypto gets to this level then you can think about investing in it but yeah that's a don't do it to yourself right now anyway anyway is an i9 7900x for 350 an okay deal usd no from my from my memory of 7900x is that a 10 core 10 core ring boss and it's you've got to get the x299 board and see that's the problem the x299 boards you're going to want to get a decent x299 board and they are expensive so just be careful with that that's all yeah anyway you guys just slow down i think it's my time to duck on out that's what happens chat's like going crazy everyone's like coming in it's like we're going crazy then no one's got any questions so how can i i'm just a reciprocator here you guys ask the questions i answer them did you get any rain today actually that's funny you asked that i think we did like it was like early in the morning like six six a.m yeah like i woke up that's right and it was like quick rain and then i opened my door i opened my door and there was a little wallaby like right outside my door and he looked at me i looked at him and we're both like there's nothing to be scared of here and he's like it was kind of like that for a wallaby like they get scared pretty easy and he's like looking at me and he's like she you're not a bad bloke you know i mean i said you're not a bad fella too so i just like quietly closed the door and he went back to eating his grass you know what i mean so that was my morning experience hey brian since windows 11 is here do i need to buy new curtains perhaps man if you if you're theming your house to windows 10 then i don't know if you should go i don't know if you need to go see go to go like get some you know like some you know talk to someone man if you're theming your house around windows 10 you know so or maybe i took it like maybe you need to get some new curtains to cover up the windows well maybe there's an eleventh window our favorite alcoholic drink man this is a good one because it changes like some like with with uh with the with the beverages like sometimes i'll feel like a gin and tonic and then other times i'll feel like a bourbon and coke and then other times i'll feel like a beer so like i kind of like all types like there's a lot of alcohol i like a lot out like you know some nights i'll just drink all of them together wake up with a horrible hangover you've seen that before yeah it's like hey especially if it's free drink man it's like you know it's free drinking in australia especially if you're in queensland where i'm from someone's serving up free drinks he ain't going to be serving them up for that long [Laughter] so like you know they say yeah in terms of alcohol man it all depends on um what i what you know what you feel like uh but in terms of uh tim tams that's a good question okay it's the salted murray caramel if you're asking for tim tams actually funny because uh ian cuttress dr cutrus asked this on he asked this and it's the tim tams it's the murray river salted caramel if you guys can get a hold of these tim tams here it is here this one here the murray river salted caramel that's the one you want to get that's my favorite tim tam so have you tried it no no legit these ones yeah yeah this is the supermarket so you just get them they're just there they exist are they a limited edition thing they were but i think this one was so good that people kept yeah they kept by like kept buying it so that was meant to be a limited edition but like i as soon as i tried i was like wow this is a tim tam this is this is a proper suite so that's in australia we've got tim tams you know they're like in japan they sell them in japan i think they sell them in the uk they sell them all over the world now but they do cost a little bit more overseas i think than they do cost in australia like in australia they're like a dollar fifty us a pack um do you drink those bags of wine been told it's a popular drink and straight oh you're talking about goon yeah goon man yeah goons like goons for like like when i was a teenager i used to drink goon because you you and your mates would like go out and you would you know get hammered for like four dollars each or three dollars you'd buy a casket goon i mean i think a gas gagoon cost like 12 now so you go out and you'd be like six dollars each and you get plastered like absolutely hammered off a cast gagoon if you just shared it with a mate because that's two i think they're four liters and you get two liters of wine into you each that's a lot of wine man like you just get hammered like so you get hammered for like four or five bucks and so that's a night out you know it's a night out on the town so you see like i don't know like that's the thing i i haven't seen kids nowadays going out you know holding casts of wine is it a thing oh man everyone used to do a million you walk around you had a cask of wine and that was you know everyone had everyone was walking around with goon that was you know that was that was how it was and then there was the fire exits you know and all the shopping centers yeah the fire you just go into the fire exit because there was no bell on the fire exit and that's where you partied you know because you were right close to the town so you went to the fire he's had a party in the fire exit and then you just you know walk out walk into the fire exit like completely normal walked out smashed like that's like that was the queen that was the gold coast way of doing things so um that was the gold coast way of doing things when you're you know younger uh man it would have been cool to live stream all that stuff hey like damn i mean hey if i go to japan i might do some of that over there you know just live stream like because the internet's good over there so you can live stream anywhere right in australia i can't live stream much because the internet will just chop out it'll be like totally unreliable stream um even at this house here where i'm where i'm at i get like 11 megabits per second up so it's it's very tough to uh to live stream so yeah anyway uh yo bryan i think it's worth buying a tpm 2.0 module to get free upgrade to windows 11. yeah i mean how much are these tpm modules we speak i mean a free upgrade i mean yeah let's check it out tpm 2.0 module like you might want to buy one now too because if like if you're thinking about that right like look i definitely want official win oh whoa what uh how do we get one of these tpm 2.0 like what is it whoa that's expensive man 190 bucks whoa ouch and it's not worth i'll just stay on windows 10. if you can get like that's the thing some of the motherboards like that's why it's probably a good thing to go rise in them because they got the ftpm which is from the cpu i think don't quote me on that 100 but i think the amd horizons are all okay like all of them are okay so that's a good thing for ryzen in terms of intel i can confirm that it does depend on the motherboard we got it working on the z490 asrock but the z590 zeus i was having problems with there was no options in the bios to even enable um the tpm i don't think it had a tpm module support i had trusted computing but didn't have a gpm module so i don't know maybe someone in chat's like yo link it up then maybe but yeah that that at 190 bucks man that's going to be ouchies what i mean what does amazon go like is there some kind of thing going on now i mean hey if windows 11 the good thing is about that is windows 11 will probably make an aliexpress banger that'll people will buy up for 10 bucks or i don't know like there might be some kind of work around or something so apparently different motherboards have different pens i'm sorry okay yeah so we're looking at tpm modules right now uh hbm 2.0 module kit okay hewlett packard but i don't know if that's just for hewlett packard if it is like that's gonna suck super micro but i don't know if these ones especially coming from these oem guys i don't know if that's going to be just for their motherboards advantech that'll definitely be generic uh you know so you got your generic ones you're 80 90 and then you got your what i would say is oh asrock had got the asrock rack wow there you go coming in with a clutch but there no pricing on that one temporary out of stock so this tpm stuff man i don't know i can't really give you a much of a an idea of like yeah the pricing is all over the place for these little things i mean you get one here for 30 36 bucks but again i just don't know if that's gonna work with hp gear only because it looks like people are buying it with a server power supply hp printer it's like someone out there whoever's buying these tpm modules they're like look hp i just i love your atmosphere i love what you're about take all my money lock me in for life so that that's it hp ecosystem man so that's uh that's with tpm take it or leave it that's what's happening so uh turn on virtual super resolution and see what happens so what's okay uh yeah you'll get low fps um how about software emulated tpm i just come back from a bios adventure and i did actually find the ptt setting in mind okay i mean i yeah i don't know like there's gonna be it's gonna be pretty crazy to see what unfolds with this whole tpm 2.0 on windows 11. i'm just hoping there's just be like workarounds and microsoft won't really care that's all so the person who's not into enthusiast tech and hasn't even got the time of the day to do a quick google search we'll go out and pay 200 bucks that's fine you know if you don't have that if you've got time though you're going to research okay is there a way i can get around this and you go down a few you know forums and stuff and a few videos in youtube and you see you can get around it i hope they allow that so that's what i'm hoping for so anyway so i have on live online i'm so happy to see you live online thanks man thanks i've actually got to tune it down soon unfortunately we just we're approaching the the end of the stream but uh yeah you know i've got one more stream come at the end of the month so after we do the used parts hunt though do stay tuned i will announce this live stream ahead of time i promise you this time i'll be like look it'll be a day after the used parts hunt so we're going to do the use parts hunt then we're going to do a pc price watch and we're just going to look at the deals we're going to talk about sort of after chat about the whole used market what's changed this month and that'll be the second live stream of the month and then we go i do have a hp fetish why would i have a hp fetish do you see any there's nothing hp here bro there's a actually i like look i'm gonna be honest i did get a new um the chord's not long enough yeah i did get a new sculpt that's fine there we go i did get a new sculpt keyboard like i indulged myself a little bit i saw it at the shops and i was like i've got to have that sculpt you know what i mean like that sculpt is um i gotta have this keyboard and actually like the keys even though they're membranes they've done something with these membranes man like it's a different i always type it this is like you know this is a different kind of membrane like you can just hear it like let's have a look get the mic there it's it's quiet it's got the feedback though it's like wow you know like like that might be something right there like that's the new like you know if anything i'm looking like a bit of a got a bit of a microsoft fetish but i just at the start of the video we called out microsoft we said hey microsoft what are you doing with windows 11 you should just allow it to run freely and run like windows 10 at the very least there's no need to release a similar os that looks a bit better look i like the look of windows 11 over windows 10 not gonna lie but uh yeah just release it on all hardware there's no reason for these tpm 2.0 there's no reason to confuse people well see most people don't get windows like they don't download it themselves they get it with a laptop or with a pc and a lot of the wording on the microsoft websites actually like targeted towards oems okay so it's just saying hey if you're an end user just use windows 10. um yeah see marco is onto something i want to i want an ergo keyboard with blue switches as well but this will be the this is like dude this keyboard is so comfortable okay like it is comfortable that's that i just i love it you know what i mean so it's actually an improvement over the previous ergo this is a legit upgrade this ergonomic keyboard like i i i love it and now some people try that people try the ergo and they're like oh i don't like typing like that that's not for me and it's like okay come back in 10 years when you got carpal tunnel and we'll talk again you know maybe then you'll like it i don't know it's just just a bit of food for thought there you know what i mean so i you know i've been on computers like since i was a kid and i've never had carpal tunnel and ever since i laid hands on an ergo i realized you need that in your life like it's just a gut reaction kind of thing uh do you have a foot fetish dude where are these like this like ben on a potato is projecting on this live stream you've got the hp fetish you've got the foot fetish not me that's like i haven't even given out clues like i haven't even given out hints that i've got a hp or a foot fetish where is this coming like i got a zeon finish we're going to the next finisher i got a microsoft ergonomic fetish i've got a xeon fetish and you know lately i've been developing an oled fetish they're my three sort of main fetishes i can think of um if you want to go down clean pc fetish not real like you know as long as it's like as long as there's not mold in your pc like a bit of dust in your pc i'm kind of okay i'm indifferent about the pc sort of cleanliness like as long as like if it's really dusty yeah go clean it out but yeah mold's a big no-no of course but yeah yeah like this one here is he's chilling he's a bit messy so um yeah and actually yeah come to think of it you know you know i i'm trying to think what else would i have a fetish for a tea yeah tea so green green tea or gray tea that's another thing i'm a tea i've got a tea fetish too uh so a bill gates fetish come on man that's no that's a low blow nick girl that is dude  that's that's a low blow brother a bill gates fetish come on man don't go there brother please this is just wait a way to dislike i was like i was kind of i was like i was on a i was on a good note here and then he just went on the bill gates fetish man i was just this brought me down i didn't even know how to react respond to that um an fsr fetish that's amd fsr i'm actually i'm probably one of the few dudes who was like just neutral on it everywhere i go like man i was like i typed in amd fsr just to see what the uh what the general reaction was to fsr and it's like uh man you'd think something like fsr is like changing people's lives like some of the the forums you're reading you would think fsr has literally taken someone off the streets and home and given them a home clothed them given them put breakfast on the table for him like i was like what like some of these like some of these reactions i'm seeing to fsr is just like man where's this guy you know like at least for dota 2 at least for dota 2 is like i'm just seeing a sharpening filter you know what i mean like the internet's just going crazy over fsr i mean it's okay but like from what i was doing with dota 2 i could do that with the the nvidia sharpening filter too like go watch the video guys with an open mind because i i was just testing it out it's good to see amd's done what they've done with fsr but like fsr is just like at least with dota 2. that's the one game i'm going to test out boulder's gate 3 i'm going to test out far cry 6 but yeah man like some of the reactions i'm seeing with the hype yeah like callisto's right like it's just ridiculous this fsr hype is just where is it coming from like yeah man you want to talk about a fetish like that is a fair some people have fsr f fsr fetish that's what some people have like legit and i'm just like looking up the forums actually we can go on like right now we'll just go on to the good old amd subreddit i reckon like if we go onto reddit and we go to amd we'll just see like it'll just be like guys just like losing losing their crap over like here it is here actually no this is well okay the top thread okay maybe hey maybe the amd subreddit's cleaned up wow okay um it's not like okay oh here we go i mean there's someone here i've reached over 120 fps in dota 2 on a nine year old gtx 7650 with fsr unbelievable did he try turning on sharpening let's see if he tried turning on sharpening um ready to hear you're able to get okay he hasn't talked he's just like showing that he's getting fps i mean i i think he can enable the game filter on his gtx 650 i don't know anyway okay but okay so i did see on twitter like people were going crazy i mean i saw these these reactions that were just going nuts like there's got to be some like you know like uh i i did see amd fsr let's just i did see some titles out here it's already super promising i mean do you need this it's already promising i'd say that's a better way to say it's super promising it's like with and it works flawlessly here we go okay i mean yeah it's like it's okay so yeah they understand what it is it's sharpening okay so from what i'm seeing with dota 2 fsr is sharpening like it's a big emphasis on sharpening um so what i'm seeing with dota 2 is is a sharpening filter but hey if yeah if you the bottom line is though with fsr i'm indifferent at the moment i want to test a few more games out with it uh and i want to really give my verdict down with dota 2 it's it's sharpening it for me it was mainly sharpening that's what i'm seeing but you know if it makes you happy if you guys are if you guys turn on fsr and um if you guys turn it on and you are happy with the picture and you're getting better fps and that's that's a good thing that's all like you know so um but yeah like you know at the moment i've just saw so much hype like i i even saw these posts i can't pull i don't know where to pull them up i just saw these titles like nvidia like dls is finished like amd's taking over nvidia's market share with like the the fsr technology and no one's like talked about nvidia's game filter like that's what i just find a little bit like where's this where's the objectivity in comparing apples to apples so that was just like you know it was just like the fsr thing was like man it was like crazy so yeah when you're looking at hype i mean i think you know and the thing is with the with the hype i don't really get hyped up about much the last time i got hyped was uh oled 4k 120 hertz and that was six months ago that was when i went on a hype train and um that was because hdmi 2.1 amd and nvidia both supported that and amd and nvidia both supported that so that was really good to see so um what's your favorite command prompt code a actually what's my most used command prompt code would be ati flash yeah or this part yeah but probably ati flash would be the most common command prompt so it'd be my favorite then because reflashing um rx 470s and 570s mainly uh i don't even like sharpened image i love amd yeah that's it man like look if you love amd just say it like just be like look i love amd i want to like have babies with amd i want them you know like you know we need to set up like this is the thing i'm surprised no one in the amd subreddit or anything like that or amd has set up the amd church where you can just give all your savings on your earnings so every time you get a paycheck you can just give it to amd just like donate it don't even buy any products like just donate it to amd like get that fanboyism to a next level and then start posting on the subreddits hey guys i just went to the amd church and i gave away all my money and like look that's fair enough you know like i like i don't get to care like dude you do you you know what i mean you do you i'll do me um so but yeah like in terms of the yeah the amd fetish and the amd fanboys man it's real it's real i'm just i'm indifferent i don't care about nvidia amd yeah it's all the same crap it's like companies that want to take your money and that's all it is like 5000 series for amd and their cpus that proved it right 5600x it was like okay where's the 5600 non-x for the cheaper price uh newsflash it's not coming because amd wants to make more money pretty simple uh when's the um you know rtx 3080s coming back in stock newsflash they're not coming back in stock because aimed because nvidia wants to sell some 3080 ti's so it's like i just like i see all this stuff um i i see all this stuff and it's like you know whatever so i'm just gonna keep reporting just from like a dude's perspective and just be okay what's this tech do who's it for how's it gonna uh how's it gonna benefit you or why so you always get that independent opinion at tech yes city don't worry about that um you heard about john mcafee yeah i heard about mcafee man i was sad hey like man talk about talk about just like i don't know poor guy like he's just not even met i wouldn't even hear about it on the news here at all like it's just weird because he sort of he knew what was going to happen to him and it did happen and that's really sad man with john mcafee like you know the guy was whacked that's all i even had a tattoo so yeah poor dude he's like i think he may i think he got out a tweet he was like yeah prison's good in spanish they treat me good like whatever he's like yeah i'm all good it's like what yeah yeah like yeah like come on it's like yeah so anyway yeah but that's just like i don't know man that whole thing like what is going on there so yeah it's just like what is going on man what is going on with this world dude so what is going on with this world brothers what is going on in this world speaking of that i gotta get some rest and then we'll wake up to the matrix reloaded brothers let's just one more time before we get on out of here let this sink in you know i a you got an amd cpu or an nvidia gpu or an intel cpu or whatever bro i got a matrix reloaded poster brother that's right i'm swallowing the red pill do you want to swallow the red pill yeah i want to swallow the red pill that's it there we go you can have what i've got my matrix reloaded post all right so you guys you peace on out for now and i can put on a bit of an american accent before we get on out of here so speaking of airfare uh speaking of fsr do you think amd will run okay on nvidia's 16 series graphics cards no one talks about them only about 10 series uh yeah dude so to answer radu's question uh they'll they'll run like in dota 2 it runs on pretty much all the graphics cards you just got to update the game because it's actually in the game engine itself so yeah just swallow the red pill and uh go watch the matrix one and two and then don't watch number three that's just my personal preference will fsr support old amd gpus like the 7850 and dota 2 it should just go boot it up should be all there ready to go anyway tpm so you guys anyway that's it i've been working on this special fella all day long i'm just getting my aussie accent up to scratch this is my aussie and uh i'm getting up to scratch right now so i've been really working on it people have been like damn brian that's not too bad what you got going on there and i was like cool man i'm gonna keep it up i think i'm on point now so next time i talk to greg salazar over on his youtube channel i'm just gonna tell him straight up like dude i'm on your level now dude you know pc deep clean i'm gonna do pc speed clean and we're gonna meet again and i'm gonna show you up with my aussie accent yeah that's right anyway guys i'll peace out for now thanks for tuning in thanks for all the donations everything brothers thanks for seeing my matrix reloaded poster is like so much better than all your fanboy stuff like you know you can go get fsr turn it on or you can just play dota 2 and have a matrix reloaded poster next to the monitor and you're going to be on top so yeah go cop yourself one of those matrix reloadeds and uh tune in to the next stream and i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out for now
