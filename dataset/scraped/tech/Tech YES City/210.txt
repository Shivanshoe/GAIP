for a long time here at tech yes city you guys have been asking me about these budget aliexpress x58 motherboards now this one here is a pretty much bottom of the barrel it's cheap as chips 53 shipped this is how much you can get this thing for now traditionally this takes away some of the features that you would get on a higher end older x58 board say from a zeus i use a rampage here at the studio it's got six ram slots and of course with that you get to unlock triple channel memory but since this is only 53 dollars i am going to go pretty easy on this board and in fact i'm going to be recommending it to a lot of people out there on a budget because there was a lot of things that actually did impress me about this board however we'll go over all the negatives and all the positives in today's video so let's get on with it if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code bftyc you can get yourself a legit single end user windows 10 license today links in description below so straight away getting into this motherboard right here you're probably thinking why is there only two slots of memory available and i think that they've done this of course to reduce the cost of the board now it is a micro atx board so will fit in pretty much all cases out there except of course if you're going with mini itx but one thing that i do like about these two slots of memory is that although you're losing the triple channel which is the negative you're still getting dual channel but it supports ecc registered memory so i'm using two eight gigabyte sticks and the numbers that i'm going to put out for you guys today were tested on these cheaper and i'm saying very cheap ecc registered sticks now one thing about the ecc registered it goes hand in hand with the low cost of the board as well as the cheap cost of these xeons making a total combo that you can pick up here going for as little as 80 dollars if you can get the ram cheap enough which i've picked up around i think i picked up around 380 something gigabytes of this stuff for a hundred aussie dollars that's how cheap ecc registered memory can go especially on the ddr3 side but we've still now got 16 gigabytes in it with a 6 core 12 thread now the xeon i'm going to use in today's comparison is the x5670 this can be had for around i think it's 15 ship worldwide now on this board it will go to around 3.06 gigahertz on all six course 12 threads and you can go into the bios and now the bios is a little bit outdated so that is a negative in relation to this board but you still get ironically the option to overclock now i'm going to go against overclocking on this board simply because when i did the temperature test here in cinebench r20 i found that the six core 12 thread was really heating up this board to the point where it got to 95 degrees on the heatsink temp on the north bridge side and then the vrm reached 100 degrees and also the heatsink on the vrm reached 59 degrees however there is some good news to that and that is if you put a fan over this northbridge heatsink and your vrm heatsink you can drop temperatures drastically down 74 degrees it then became and then it also uh 57 degrees and 49 degrees respectively over vrm and then vrm heatsink so this board if you do get it with the six core don't overclock it and put a fan over that vrm area this is going to give you longevity and it's going to make sure that the board works absolutely fine now another thing that did surprise me is that they've included a usb 3 front header on a board that never had the usb 3 front header on it so it's good that they've added in sort of these newer touches and they've got native usb 3 on board the input output at the back here however when i tested the usb 3 speeds they were kind of like usb 2.2 2.3 in that they went to around 135 megabytes per second solid transfers where usb 3 i thought went a lot higher than that traditionally even the first generation of usb 3. so you will get faster speeds than the 50 megabytes per second cap on usb 2 but it still will be around 130 megabytes per second transfer so do keep that in mind another negative of the board itself is the sata ports here and that if you've got a bigger than a two slot graphics card then you will need low profile sata connectors in order to use these side of ports otherwise your graphics card will just hang and block out those starter ports from being used as you may be able to tell with the b roll in question another thing is too the 8 pin power connector for the cpu that's a little bit out of place so you will have an pin uh power connector going sort of down to the board in a weird fashion where it's most people are used to having it at the top but i'm guessing it's going in a cheaper case anywhere where cable management isn't too much of a priority and of course if you're on a budget you might not even use a case at all now the seller i bought this off also didn't include a cmos battery so you will have to buy one of those yourself i generally source them for around 20 cents a pop and then i get five of them for a dollar so that shouldn't be a problem the front panel audio out is also angled at 90 degrees which was an odd thing too and then you've got one usb front out 2.0 header as well as the usb 3 and then two fans one of those being a pwm four pin one of those being a three pin however all up i cannot complain about the board a whole lot especially at 50 the uh one gigabits per second nick speeds they tested out absolutely fine so they were full speed you get a six layer pcb too so it's not that flimsy and the final thing is this one surprised me the most was the onboard audio actually tested out to be a minus 8.5 decibel roll off so of course it's a uh a bit worse than the high-end motherboards but it wasn't terrible by any means you could use this on-board audio with a cheap pair of speakers or a cheap pair of decent headphones like the ks uh cos ks c75s they're a really good pair of headphones i recommend on a budget but you could use that and still not being doing damage to your ears i have seen motherboards in the past that have come through here on budgets and the onboard audio has been absolutely horrible this one here actually is not too bad which was surprising for that price point having a minus 78 decibels crosstalk so this board so far was doing okay but what about the gaming numbers and this is where i decided to test out the x58 with the x5670 overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz and of course at these levels we were seeing numbers both with an rx 570 in certain titles and a gtx 3060 ti so i will pull up the numbers here for you guys where csgo was getting 335 fps versus 238 on the jingxia motherboard with one less uh channel of memory available fortnite was doing 192 fps versus 142 and then uh doom eternal was doing 166 versus on the x58 rampage 223 and then f1 was 133 versus 197 and that was on a 360 ti which i just wanted to show you guys sort of like maybe this is the best case scenario you're going to want to pair on say an x 58 rampage when it comes to budget i'm sure a lot of you guys are going to be iron off this motherboard and saying rx470rx570 so i did some tests with the rx 570 as well and here's where we got on cs go 313 versus 223 and then moving on to fortnite this is where one of those weird things happened that is on the rx 570 on both the jinsha motherboard and the rampage we got more fps we got 199 versus 167 but both those numbers were higher than the 192 and the 142 that we got on the 30 60 ti so it's doing something funny here with the cpu that is giving us more fps from the cpu directly on the rx 570. let me go to do maternal we got 118 versus 116. so we're getting very similar fps here on an overclocked memory and cpu on the x58 rampage versus the jinxer and then the final game f1 2020 we got 139 versus 152 on the rampage so there wasn't a whole lot of differences to be had when we're using an rx 570. in fact cs go showed us the biggest difference and then fortnite actually worked better on the rx 570 which does give way to the fact that this here and this is where we're going to move into conclusion time it's time to tell you guys if this board is worth the 50 or not i think that's the most important question that it all comes down to if you're on a budget are you going to be getting your money's worth and what we saw there with the gaming numbers they pretty much really go hand in hand with a budget graphics card and that's what i like about this combo in 2021 anywhere in the world you can get yourself one of these boards for close to 50 bucks a 15 xeon cheap memory if you can find the ecc registered stuff and pull it out of old servers even better and then you can get a snowman cooler and you're going to be seeing some very good performance for the dollar all this combo with 16 gigabytes of ram is going to cost you less than a new i3 and will you get any more performance out of that i3 with a budget graphics card i think that's the most important question and i think the answer is pretty much no we're not going to see a whole lot of performance on an rx470 rx 570 as we saw uh the differences when we started overclocking on the ram page it wasn't a whole lot to be gained there with the rx-570 the 360 ti of course there were some big differences and that's when we're going with the higher end graphics card but then there's the board itself the build quality is decent the bios of course is dated but all biases on x58 are going to be dated but they do include a low profile sata connector for one drive if you want to hook up more than two drives you will definitely need to get especially if you're using a dual slot or bigger graphics card you'll definitely need to get another low profile starter connector you get the input output shield and then out of the box it comes all pre-configured so you'll support those xeons and you support the ecc memory without you having to do anything but install your cpu however one thing i will say the biggest uh thing to get under control with this board is those uh vrm and also the northbridge heatsink temperatures from what i saw here definitely want a 12 centimeter fan or even an eight centimeter fan you'll definitely want that actively cooling this motherboard in order just to for me it's peace of mind i don't want my temperatures going anywhere over 90 degrees for longevity and the fact that the heat heatsink was going to 95 and then also the vrm we saw 100 degrees there in cinebench r20 was and once we put the fan on those temperatures went down a lot that was for me uh the point that i want to stress if you're going to get this board because everything else kind of checked out the usb 3 speeds were fine the next speeds were fine the onboard audio surprisingly was even fine too so jinxa they've done a pretty good job on this board i can recommend it just know that i can recommend it with the bot there and another thing is too i did quickly test out the x567 if you don't want to put a 12 centimeter fan on this then you can get the x 5677 which is four cores eight threads so i did manage to do some temperature tests for you guys in 26 degree ambience by the way all these temperatures are done in 26 ambient here today and we got 58 on the heatsink and then 85 on the northbridge heatsink so it would be as long as your case is half decent you can get away with no fan over that um motherboard with a four core eight threaded z on the x567 and then if you put the fan on there you'll get as low as 47 degrees on the vrm heatsink but if you're lazy and you don't want to put a fan on there then you might want to opt just for the 4k or 8 thread where i'll show you guys the results in tomorrow's video where we've tested out the x5677 as well and we're going to talk about whether these zeons are still relevant in 2021 and who they're relevant for so i think there's a lot of sort of like you should be done with the used stuff but i think of course there's always a place when the price is right and i think right now when i look at those xeons on aliexpress the price is definitely looking right 15 for a cpu 15 bucks and you got cheap motherboards like this that are brand new i think there's going to be a place for that even if the new cpus are 100 because people are always after a good deal and it depends where you live in the world some people don't make as much money as people like us like in australia for instance we've got a pretty high minimum wage here it's pretty easy to get that 100 cpu but in other countries say the minimum wage is only three bucks that might be the difference that might and especially if they just want to play some games here where we saw the fps numbers at 1080p 152 fps in f1 or 118 they're all above 100 so the fbs numbers are absolutely fine here whichever way you look at it so if you want to go with those fine fps numbers and you want to save money then these are still offering a really good play in 2020 but anyway we're getting too off topic here i'll leave that for tomorrow's video for you guys in the meantime this board right here it's good to go i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comment section below would you buy a board like this in 2021 and if you did would you buy it with the iconic snowman love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from my face and they ask i've had my board for about a month and every now and then i experience random freezes because this is an issue people are commonly having and they're talking about the x99 aliexpress motherboards that we took a look at where you can unlock the turbo multipliers now these boards will occasionally freeze if your voltage is too low so when i did test this thing out i did do these are the x99 xeons by the way which are also pretty good value when i tested them out there's different profiles that you can lock in and typically a lot of people lock in the minus 20 millivolt profile the thing about that is it's still minus 20 millivolts so say for instance you've got a pretty or really cheap power supply that's not that's got pretty high ripple and you're supplying that board and the voltage is dipping sometimes that could be the reason why it's crashing out and so with that you might want to use say just a zero millivolt file where there's no difference to the voltage hasn't changed or you might want to use one where it bumps it up 20 millivolt of course with that power consumption does go up but that is one thing you can try or of course you can try getting a new power supply but i'm guessing if you're on a budget you might not want to do that so in terms of getting that profile with the higher millivolts for the cpu programmed in there you can try some of those different millivolt profiles they are out there on the web hope that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye and also if you stayed this far and you're enjoying
