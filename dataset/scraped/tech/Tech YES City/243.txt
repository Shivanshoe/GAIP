okay we should be live we should be live are you live i am live i think okay well it's saying saying i've been live for eight seconds okay we got a black friday's pre-black friday's deals video starting for you guys so this is what's gonna happen we're gonna talk about just waiting for people to come in yeah but we're gonna talk about the deals first so we're gonna talk about situation this this year is a lot different to other years with black friday and of course we've seen the stock stuff where um like we've seen the stock problems with uh all this stuff that's been going down with uh rtx 3080s rtx 3070s 6800 xt is now the new victim and dude do you want to just go easy on the typing yeah cool i got i got he's he's got a new video around here he's he's doing his stuff he's good he's helping me out and it's just been such a busy month but um we've seen these stock problems right playstation 5 xbox series s's series x's all this stuff is selling out and the reason being is that 2020 has been the year of just gamers staying at home and i guess there's so much more pent up demand now for gaming pc gaming console gaming everything and so what we're seeing now is this year with black friday when that actual black friday hits this year it's going to be i think the worst in history for actual really good deals and we'll show you why like with the precursor we've got like i just went on amazon i'm like ryzen 5 3600 no it's going to be it's always been like the go-to same with the 2600 too but then now the 5000 series is out you kind of look at the generation before and we've got here the 3600 is costing now 273 dollars i even sent my address to beverly hills because i thought okay maybe it's just like i'm in australia maybe um maybe it's just like a problem with my end that it just doesn't want to ship to australia but no one left in stock 273 that's not a deal for a 3 600 no one's getting a deal here and so what i've seen now is kind of like this year around you might want to just get in early with your black friday deals and then set and forget and sort of don't worry about the action that unfolds on the actual weekend because i've seen another thing too we'll talk about graphics cards that's even worse now i'm seeing what i'm seeing you guys in the us you guys are like looking like it's really hard to find an actual deal on a gpu in australia it's kind of okay we're kind of you just look around we'll get on to that a little bit later but let's start off with some actual deals that i'm finding here first of all what's that yeah what's up what's going on with the chat oh hey guys whoa you guys are acting i didn't think you'd be oh okay chat's going crazy what's going on it's like active really active people are coming in you guys want the deals you guys want the deals let's pull it up to here we've got the first of all this is the if you're gonna get a high-end gaming pc this is what you want an oled 55-inch 120 hertz i i've got one of these things and i can tell you it is hard i like i had to uninstall games and i've said this because it would just stop me from doing my actual job i got addicted to baldur's gate 3 and i did my first all-nighter just playing video games and i realized wow this and but this tv is like the the gateway it's providing you that experience and now the bx is 1200 usd which this thing is going to sell out like it says it's in stock now but i tell you now if this bx was for sale in australia at this price it would sell out in a few hours because that is really good value for a 55-inch oled 120hz 4k it's basically end game and now for the people out there like okay what about cx cx is dollars you're not getting three hundred dollars worth of panel for that price like you know 300 usd you're spending extra there you've got a better image processor but here's the thing when you hook that up from your pc you've suddenly got um all the image processing a lot of it turned off and this is the same 10-bit oled panel right so you want 10-bit hdr on you've got that with the oled uh bx 55-inch now some other differences i think the cx might be a little bit brighter ever so brighter but you don't want to run your oled at 100 brightness anyway so anyhow next up here we've got some graphics cards i did manage to like find something that was in stock and something that was half decent value this one was hard because i was like looking around for 1660 super 1650 supers you don't want to get the the gtx 1650 you kind of don't want to get that because it's like it performs so much worse than a 1650 super so og 1650 if you're desperate sure but this right right here we got 5500 xt 200 bucks 8 gigabyte version that's not a bad deal like it's going to be okay considering gpus are like everybody wants to get a graphics card so yeah there's that one so if you want to get a gpu there's that but what we're going to do too is we're going to be putting together a pc kind of in america theoretically and so 512 gigabyte ssd for 43 bucks i would be snapping that up decent deal here uh team group make good ddr4 memory they also make pretty good uh ssds so you can get in quick if you want to of course you can just say no i don't want to get a deal ah did i just i clicked the link i don't want to become an amazon finance member look at that so i was going to click on the price here as 280 for a 5600 xt this is kind of like your mid-range because i don't think and what we're seeing right 6800 xt 6800 if amd releases a 6700 xt i'm pretty sure that thing's going to be sold out too well for whatever stock comes back in this is in stock now 280 bucks and you're gonna get a really good 1080p gaming experience out of this thing it's actually a really fast card uh especially for 280 bucks pretty good deal now for power supply if you're putting together a new pc you don't have to go out and buy like a 750 watt a 450 watt will do a 5600 xt absolutely fine or a 1660 super anything like that and at 40 dollars 40 smackaroonies you don't have a whole lot to lose so this one's the gigabyte power supply i've actually tried one of these before gigabyte have sent over a couple actually a couple of their power supplies and i've used them in the past and they've they've been absolutely fine i mean they're probably not the best i mean i'm sure there'd be some ripple in there um but hey for 40 bucks you're gonna be getting a pretty good deal now we've got here nzxt h510 i'm telling you now with these cases every time i do a gaming pc in an nzxt case it sells you know here's the funny thing is like this morning and this is no bs this morning i sold the i was going to do the flip up challenge so i sold the 3080 pc and the nzxt case now i sold another one and i and the only reason i sold the 3080 pc the second time is because i forgot to take the listing down and someone was messaging me like so hungry for this 3080 pc and it's all because of these these nzxt h510s they just sit there and people go crazy over them me personally i'd like it's a case it looks pretty good but for some reason when you're flipping pcs people go crazy over these nzxt h510s and at 70 bucks us that's a really good deal like in australia these things cost 150 aussie and even at 140 aussie dollars these things just sell out so quickly so yeah if i was in the us i'd be getting one of these cases because you're gonna have some pretty good resale value on your pc now they've also got the black and red they've all got they've got the all black one but i think like these two colors especially with the black and red you add red leds up the top here whoo yeah there's your pc gone it's just gone like you put it up for sale one hour later the thing's sold or of course you've built yourself your own pc got a bit of a red and black theme going on sith lord the master of the sith and now here's the funny thing right we were looking at that ryzen 5 3600 earlier and isn't this the ironic thing this is the ironic thing right here is that it feels like this is what i've been seeing in the last couple of months and maybe even have to make a dedicated video for this yeah we're getting on chats like any aussie deals we've got the aussie deals coming up very soon don't worry i just we have to us does come first us is like the biggest uh audience base for youtubes youtube's is like majority is u.s and not as i've said this in the past if i just had us as a subscriber base i could actually survive off youtube still any other country if i just had that subscriber base i wouldn't be able to eat so us is huge so i've got a you know natural everyday hey hey guys us first this is the way it is anyway 10-400 this is the funny thing this is a trend i'm seeing in australia as well seeing it in the u.s seeing it in australia haven't quite seen it in the uk mate but we'll get on to the uk soon mate um we've got 178 dollars here for the 10 400 this is even this isn't even the f version this is the the normal version with the igpu on board so you can use that for other tasks as 178 bucks free shipping you get the cooler included grab yourself this and an h410 and we've got the 16 gigabytes of ram coming up soon and you're going to be having a great gaming experience so it's almost 100 cheaper than the ryzen 5 3600 at the moment so that's how like the tables are turning here where intel's becoming like the the older amd where they're slower now in performance but amd's like more expensive now but they're offering the better performance it's just like sitting here scratching my head what's going on here pretty crazy scenario so anyway next up ddr4 memory 3200 megahertz 50 bucks this is from xpg xpg uh i believe there are subsidiary of a data or a data depends on hey man the us accent's rubbing off on me a little bit a data we got here 3200 megahertz 50 that's cheap i'd be buying that up that's cheap memory man cheap memory whack that in with the 10 400 and the upcoming motherboard that i'm about to show you you're gonna have some uh really good plays here especially if you're flipping pcs too don't be afraid to buy the nzxt h510 because the the deals that i'm showing you here uh okay so we'll pull it up right we'll go through the us first and we'll pull up the big screen 60 bucks for the h410m c csm so this is a business grade motherboard and so with that it's going to have more stability than a regular h410 so this thing is i think it says it's got a 36 month warranty maybe it's like this is right here i appreciate the look of this thing right you look at this this is like for me i wish they made more motherboards like this it's a blast to the past every time i look at a motherboard now i see like you know it's got the fancy aesthetics and it's got all this i just sometimes i appreciate a bit of plain green smack on the motherboard and also the you got the yellow boards as well they were really cool they were a bit more rarer than the green and they also had the red pcbs i kind of missed that old school stuff so this one right here 60 bucks ah see nate what are you doing there mate no green pcb see this is where we got differing opinions i can appreciate beauty is in the eye of the beholder let us know in chat what you think do you think the green pcb is beautiful i'm absolutely loving it i'm i mean more so i'm loving the um the fact that it's it'd be more solid than a regular entry run-of-the-mill h410 so that's the main point jokes aside but let's step it up if you guys want some budget peripherals 28 uh mechanical keyboard from red dragon i've tried some red dragon mechanical keyboards before we've got the red switches 28 bucks you cannot go wrong and even if you were on um you're driving down wrong avenue you'd still be doing it right and that i think that's the verdict there now nothing i'm going to talk about right this is a scary thing that came to me the other day so yeah we're going for the us first so we're going for us first which is in usd so these are all usd prices at the moment i've got all the links in the description below too if you want to check this stuff out but we'll just go through the the reasoning as to why you would want to get some of this stuff now here's a true story right i sold this dude a 2080 super rig and this was like this was like really scary hold on i sold this dude at 2080 super rig and he i saw his pc he messaged me the other day i saw his pc up for sale and he's selling like all his stuff he went out and bought three 240 hertz monitors he went and got all the fancy streaming mics and fancy gear and all that and i'm like why are you selling stuff he's like ah bro five minutes later i'm not not interested in streaming anymore it's like well you know so you just spent like all that money you know like down the toilet all this money just wasted on wanted to be a streamer and it's like ten thousand dollars worth of gear there and it's like well you could have started small like this you could have started small on the budget on the 28 mic on sale for a pre-black friday deal and you could have seen if streaming was for you first because your viewers are going to like if you've got good content your viewers are going to tune in right and you can do that on budget stuff if you're starting out this mic will give you half decent audio quality it's not like it's just going to be a guy banging on tin it's gonna be half decent for 28 bucks it's going to be real good value so if you want to get into streaming and just giving your viewers some kind of experience this webcam as well 21 bucks for you know under 50 you've got yourself the cam and the mic and you don't need any capture cards or anything like that um you can just use your gpus encoder you can get into streaming on a budget and then you can see go from there see if you want to get some acquired taste now the next one gamers if you want a decent mouse if you want the staple i call this the staple because this mouse would be the mouse i would be using if my little friend rocket jump ninja didn't gift me an ultra light too people like oh dude where'd you get the final mouse uh ultra light 2 from and i got it from rocket jump my boy he's my homeboy he lives about um i think he loses he's about 25 minutes down the road and he's really good friends and i was like i tried this at his house the ultralight 2 and i absolutely loved it it's a really good mouse but if i wasn't using the ultra light 2 i'd be using the g203 and at 15 like this thing here this thing that this ultra light 2 is not good value for money it's not a value for money play i mean in my case it was because zai gifted it to me so i'm lucky but um at 15 bucks g203 absolutely phenomenal so if you're looking for a gaming mouse and you want to know what kind of gaming mouse i like this is it really good input lag as well logitech have like on average like one millisecond delay on their mice even from going way back like 14 years this is um yeah 15 bucks gamers rejoice you save 25 bucks i've not seen a g203 this cheap and it doesn't matter what they put on the mice if they put like for all i care they could put like auto aim technology on it if you can't get good on a game on on this mouse right here then pro gaming's probably not your thing now so i'm just going to spoil the news here for sorry to spoil the news mid-stream here for you but if you can't get good on a g203 then i can't help you okay anyway we're not going to go to the uk yet we're going to go to international deals so we're going to plug our sponsor here this is a windows 10 pro keys use the bf tyc coupon and you get 30 off that windows 10 pro key that's also in the description below look at that uh sdks we did a dedicated video talk towards them people like trash talk and scd keys are like man those keys are volume license keys we checked them our retail keys and then we called up microsoft and microsoft would like yell microsoft were like yo we really don't care that's probably that was like the answer that we got it's like we don't care this is got a digital license it's activated it's all good it's like okay okay anyhow scdk's hooking up with that big fat tyc discount 30 that's in the description now we're going to aliexpress before we get on to aussie i know the aussies are like we are where's the aussie deals at we've got here um the viper mini i was talking about mice before but this one's a new release 61 grams uh rocket jump also said this was one of his best mice he's tried and at 30 bucks this is on like a flash sale i think that is really cheap for this mouse don't get me wrong but for the viper mini at thirty dollars i think that's really good deal and i think if you're signing up to aliexpress you get a two dollars or something two dollars off on the coupon code so that's a flash deal i found for you guys next up here we've got the uh water coolers from igo uh 45 bucks if it locks it in so 45 bucks delivered international for a 120 mil rgb bling i actually used one i didn't use this exact one but in the recent flip that i did this morning i'll show it on the flip up challenge video when that comes out but we had um this this was actually in the rig this right here like one of these and it looked gorgeous like i'm not gonna lie like 45 bucks man performance isn't that much at 45 the performance of a water cooler shouldn't be your top priority more so the looks and the bling and saying hey i've got water cooling let's be honest i'm not gonna i'm not gonna beat around the bush and go okay guys we've got to get a 45 like because you just get a snowman right if you're looking for price performance cooling grab yourself a snowman for 20 bucks that's like a staple and this here is just like that bling play right you're going to chuck this in the pc and you'll be like hey guys look at my fancy lights and trust me when i say this people love this stuff like this guy who came this morning his eyes just lit up like i could see he's like whoa he saw the rgb and he was i mean look he was young so he's got the metabolism and all that but if he was older he probably would have just you know passed out or something just at the rgb so they've got the 240 mil 61 they got the 240 mil version here that's also another play you might want to wait make wake wake you want to wake up on a 240 mil rgb liquid cooler you just wake up on one for 61 usd that's delivered so not bad i go as well the brand i go i've tried igo before and they are very solid so let's have a look now i've got the same link now we're going to go over two now we're going to go over to the beautiful land down under let's uh let's get aussies [Music] beautiful land down under there are some deals out there but it's kind of like on ebay some of the prices i'm gonna like say this in advance some of the prices are jacked up right so like what they do on ebay is they put all the prices up they give you 20 off so you're actually not kind of getting a good deal on some of the stuff i checked cpus i checked gpus all that stuff and i'd say like i'm keeping my eye on some of the retailers in australia for the good deals that come up but i found i got sniffed through some of the ebay deals and i'm gonna say as well do keep a lookout for used stuff like use stuff in these times when you've got all these black friday sales going on people overlook used stuff we got some 860 pros 512 gigabyte ssds that's the mlc stuff really high quality we're going to be doing a video later on looking at that versus the newer stuff but we got four of these for 290 aussie delivered so that's like 75 roughly 75 bucks aussie so that's like 50 us for a 512 gigabyte mlc ssd so you can get some bargains on um what's up oh okay okay yeah okay you want me slow do you want me to chat but oh we're going to get through the deals first and then we're going to go on to the beautiful chat i'm chill man chill ass chill i'm chilly he's like he's like yo but i like to get through the deals right because i'm a bit of a deals guy so but if you guys want me to slow down i can slow down it's just i mean you always got to go at a million miles an hour let's be honest i don't know if you guys are out there like in chat like me and you're like your brain races all the time you're like i'm gonna get this not gonna do that and then you like eat in the car that's my um it's one of my that's one of my worst uh things i i always eat in the car like even in the stinger i got this thing eating it burrito let's do that one hand on the wheel one hand and the burrito on the mouth it's just like yo let's save some time here yeah burrito as i wonder if anyone's got any videos on that like burrito while you're driving how like who can who's got the best style of eating a burrito while they're um while they're driving so anyway let's get on to them deals we've got aussie deals right here 164 aussie delivered for 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3200 megahertz so you got to use this coupon right here you see it on the screen it's plus bf20 you lock that in and you are going to get a phenomenal deal on some ddr4 memory if you want to get 64 gigabytes think about that you're going to get 64 gigabytes of relatively fast ddr4 memory cl 16 at 328 delivered to your door that is pretty good you're not going to go wrong with that there might be some cheaper memory out there but i'm pretty sure the timings are going to be garbage 3200 megahertz cl 16 is kind of like the value play it's kind of like the staple the balance between performance and not getting like that 2400 megahertz garbage stuff that you see so that's a really cool deal i pulled that one up first next one is the same it's like the 10 400 in america was the go the way to go if you guys are putting together a rig with like say for instance you want to get an rtx 3070 or a 6800 when they get back in stock this cpu is going to couple with those gpus perfectly especially if you're doing 1440p gaming or 4k gaming you get one of these 215 bucks delivered to your door plus uh bf20 so in usd terms that's like maybe like 160 usd so it's coming in cheaper than those guys in the us there you go winning absolutely winning now we got here xiaomi mi curved you guys have been telling me like i've got guys emailing me about this they're like brian you've got to check out the 34-inch 144 hertz monitor and i would but i want to like i've got to get a heap of stuff done first and then um so oh we've got some super chats coming in dan sorry if i if i'm missing a bit of the chat i do apologize like you know i'm going to be honest with you guys sometimes i'm a little bit greetings from la you're the reason for me getting a 5800x and i was wondering why the chips runs hot when i run c20 it goes up to 90 degrees help okay so what cooler are you running you've got to let me know what cool you're running let the chat know what cool you're running that comes down to your cpu cooler i was getting i think around 80 degrees on that cpu with h115i rgb platinum very good cpu cooler one of the best in the biz and that's what i've been saying if you're running a crap cooler you're going to be having problems so let's get back to the deals though this one i want to get on to chat you guys have got some really good questions um you see you want to open that door a little bit too we got some like we we're up on the mountain a little bit and so like the door um it'll start whistling a little bit so yeah hopefully um oh really okay easy you go okay there we go well we got this monitor 537 aussie dollars after the coupon now this is delivered to your door i think other retailers might have this ever so slightly cheaper but you still got to pay 25 shipping and stuff this is just at ease of access to your door and um i gotta say with this one so many people have messaged me saying they love this monitor so even though i haven't reviewed it yet i am gonna say that all the feedback i've heard from this has been very positive so i'm not going to put my name down on and say it's amazing go get it but everyone's been telling me this monitor is really good so at 530 bucks for an ultra wide 1440p 144hz you can't go wrong so that's that one anyway next one is one that i have tested and i can vouch for i do love this monitor if you are on a budget but you still want good image quality still want that uh 144 hertz still want the freesync it does hook up with g-sync as well this one is the budget play 255 and that includes shipping plus bf20 that's a deal that's a pretty good deal i'd like this monitor usually hangs around the 300 price point so for it to come in at 250 bucks is a very good deal if you want to get into high refresh rate gaming or get into the world of it and you don't want to spend too much money this is going to give you that option so bang maybe if you're on console as well maybe if you go with those new consoles and just set it to 120 hertz that might be a play as well so once the consoles get the updates to and the games to properly support the high refresh rate but next one here is 240 hertz if you want to be a 240 hertz mega mad gamer if you want to be the guy who's the 240 hertz king of the scene because i had the i like i'd say everyone who picks up a high-end gaming pc office they always like yo dude you gotta does this run 240hz and like they go i went and bought the alienware i went and bought the azus 240hz monitor but this one here you can get into the world of 240hz for 367 bucks so there you go and it's g-sync as well and it's curved though the curve i will say one thing about the curve monitor some people hate curved monitors i'm one of those guys that i don't care flat curved it's all good to me and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna segue into another conversation there on a live stream because i know some guys in chat will be like yo is that how you like uh yeah no i'm not going there so all right let's go let's continue on with the deals i'm going to order two of these 1080ps like actually i was going to order two of them for myself um these are 1080p webcams i've actually i think i've tried one of these in japan but then i i actually dropped it down a flight of stairs and i busted it like i was like i used this as my travel uh 1080p camera and then i dropped it down a flight of stairs and it busted the lens and i was so sad but if you guys need a 1080p high quality webcam in australia for 60 bucks this one's gonna do the job and some people even say it it like looks better than the c920 when i had this in the c920 i thought they were pretty similar so there you go 60 bucks i could actually get it i got to snap them up for myself too next up here is the cx-55 i have a lot of people messaging me about the oleds in australia and this is what i was telling you guys before in the us you guys are lucky for 1200 usd you get the bx 55 inch delivered this is this is the cheapest you will find a cx 55 inch in australia is 266 delivered and i think that's because the rate you know the shipping channels getting these oleds to australia is actually very expensive for lg then we've got 10 tax but i paid i got mine a little bit cheaper earlier in the year so i'm using the cx this is the exact tv i'm using and i'm not using it for tv anymore i'm using it for gaming video editing everything this monitor is absolutely amazing oled is so good for your eyes and we will talk about it in another video but oled is just where it's at right now you definitely want to be getting on oled it is the way to go you definitely want that in your life if you can afford of course it's an expensive expensive ask but hey if we look at all the used price performance stuff and you get into the pc flipping game man you can pick yourself up a few bucks buy yourself something nice you can buy yourself something nice real nice so next up here this is another one like i should have ordered these deals before i showed you guys this i'm like all right i'm going through the aussie deals on live stream here i should have ordered myself a couple of these boards uh here we go 167 bucks for the z490 pro 4s this is the ones i've been using in the flip up challenge it's uh z490 i think people are going to like i know people in the stream is like z490 z490 i i don't know why i say z490 again maybe it's just rubbed off of me like the 10 years that i lived in this is a true story 10 years i lived in japan um a lot of my friends there were canadian so like they were like i think i know there's a difference between the canadians and the americans but like you got the similar in in intonations or whatever and so you guys speak similar and so you guys would both say z right z490 so i think that might have rubbed off on me so now you got a z490 motherboard 167 bucks and that's delivered aussie and that's actually a beautiful deal now reason i didn't show some of this other so this was the other thing i was going to point to right in australia right 10 700 f's 10 700 f's of 459 a 3700 x is now 499 and this is exactly what i was talking about before the tables have turned suddenly intel is now what amd used to be around first and second gen ryzen versus intel and amd's now intel like when we look at it right and just in the i mean they're not of course they're different companies and they're doing different things but i'm talking about the whole pricing war now and is it not a bad idea like for me i don't care if it's amd or intel i just want to build whatever's the cheapest whatever's going to give the best price performance so there's something to think about this is the trend this is the trend that's going down right now is it this is out of stock as well i guess hey i guess a lot of you guys agree with us in australia hey picking up yourself a 10-700 f for this price and a bad play that's eight core 16 threats if you were to convert that to usd maybe 330 usd or something like that and then we do we do pay tax on that this here is not really a deal 500 bucks when this exists so there it is and then the 10900f i was going to say this is very interesting this one here if you're in australia this one's very interesting i want to make a play on this try and flip one of these and see how crazy people go for i9 they're like i9 dude isn't that like the best and not anymore um kind of got dethroned by the 5800x but uh hey if some people don't do their google searches properly they might never know and if they just see the the they just see the intel marketing which does get spammed intel are like they spam social channels with marketing so all right anyway uh last of all some corsair memory as well if you want the bling ram in your pc this is going to bling it out so that's not a bad deal too and so now finally we're going to have a little bit of a break here we'll just we'll get on with some questions quickly because then we'll go to the uk there's not many deals in the uk but you guys i see a few heaps a heap of questions coming in so um ebay return process from matthew lu ebay return process is i've never had a problem with an ebay return process and in fact if it's too tedious for the seller and they've sent for instance i bought these wallpaper things i was going to do a little like studio setup and the wallpaper was terrible like it was it was garbage it was like they showed this high quality print and then when you got it was like this low res garbage and i'm like why did i pay a hundred bucks for this wallpaper i put in a complaint just said like this is low-res garbage and so i got my money back they just said look keep the wallpaper it's like okay but i want to send you i don't want your wallpaper i cannot use it so like send your wallpaper back so the return process was very easy every time i've done it on ebay it's been it's been fine if you've had a problem of course if you don't have a problem and you just don't change your mind if you if you're one of those buyers who just changes their mind try not to throw that back on the seller it's the most annoying thing if someone buys something they're committed to it and they're like i changed my mind as a seller it's one of the worst things you could do so yeah anyhow and yeah we've got that question out of the way let's move on i have a problem with my x58 mobile first two ram slots don't work okay so you gotta either clean the pins clean the ram slots and usually i found it's cleaning the pins i did a whole video on that and that can bring the ram slots back to life it's usually micro bends on the cpu pins themselves of course the motherboard just could be that old and the traces are actually damaged themselves uh next up here we got do you think a 2600 and 5700 xt combo is a bottleneck uh if the 2600 is not tuned man yeah like i've seen ryzen 5 2600 this is the thing i've seen 2600s come through here and they just don't work with a lot of xmp profiles like you can only get these things up to like 29 33 megahertz memory and so even though you see all these tests where they're like running 3200 megahertz 3600 megahertz sometimes that 2600 struggles man and it's even on the official notes from amd they're only guaranteeing i think is two eight gigabyte single ranks at 29.33 megahertz so yeah if you've got that can be a bit of a bottleneck if you can't get the memory speeds high if you can it shouldn't be much of a problem especially if you go to the higher resolutions we've got next yeah love your work have you heard of any issues with the 3080 just failing a monitor loses signal but fine after a hard reboot i have not had that problem i am having one issue where it's on two monitors and i turn the monitors off and then i turn it back and the scaling goes from 175 because i'm at 4k down to 100 but that's easily fixed when the other monitor comes back on so that's the only problem i wouldn't even call it really a problem it doesn't do anything um other than that the 3080 has been absolutely smooth in terms of at day one it had problems with the lg but they fixed that pretty quickly lg is offered the updates 6800xt has got a few teething issues too they should all be fixed like there should be any problems in a couple of months um what b550 do i recommend oh i'd say like for me the steel legend the full sized one b550 full-size steel legend overall it's a good budget it's a good board it's a solid mid-round like price looks um and performance i like that uh will the 10 400 f be okay be compatible with z490 and motherboard yeah of course yeah easy and that's where you want to get the z490 because you want to get the higher memory speeds and if you're reselling it people look for the z490 h410 should just be if you're putting together a cookie cutter for yourself save a few bucks z490s for like okay i want to re-flip this with a higher end gpu but in that case i'd recommend getting the i7 because i7 versus 10 400 f huge difference in resale potential there massive difference i've found this is just speaking from experience of course you know hey what would i know right is trading an rtx 2060 for an rx 5700 xt then selling that card on ebay a viable strategy anything's a viable strategy man if it makes money like go for it um i mean the time wasted on that i personally wouldn't do it uh the time wasted on that i personally wouldn't do it uh what mic am i using wave three i've gotten used to this thing right initially i was like okay maybe the the ugly mic that i was using is not that good but i don't know like i grew this thing grew on me at first i was like okay i gotta get used to the sound but then once i tweaked it change the settings i'm really starting to love this microphone especially because it's just like it's a safe mic you're not gonna um i guess it's like you're not gonna pop the mic or anything like that your viewers are gonna love the audio coming out of this thing because it's just consistent uh anyway i'm thinking of buying an rx 5700 xt is it good anything's good at the right price that's a solid gpu but make sure you get the good price on it i will say the 1060 ti will be out pretty soon that'll be 399 us i think according to rumors i'd wait and see what that's got to offer because yeah you might kind of be in a bad situation maybe anyway he has a razor mic no i don't have a razor mic should i upgrade from a 9400f to a 10400 f right now if you can find a buyer for that 9400f yeah go for it if it's only like a you know 30 40 upgrade i would jump on that quick smart because yeah you're getting um you're getting hyper threading with that i5 so all right let's finish off the uk deals then we'll get back to um there's heaps of questions coming in then we'll get back to chat for you guys so and okay yeah 1060 ti question mark 10 cc is coming but let's get back to some uh uk deals mate quickly because i got to take care of that every time i do a deals video people from the uk they complain they're like dude you forget the uk and we love you from the uk so i'm like every time i think of the uk it's like i'm a slave on a minimum wage song is it who said that is that the one who said i love that song such a good song okay uk you guys it looks like your prices are not good in the uk if you would convert a pound to a usd you're not really getting a good deal on stuff but you can sift through that market and say okay well here's the baseline price let's see what we can get 288 quid for a 5600 xt i'd be banging that because of what the other prices of the other gpus are what i've seen so 5600 xt again if everyone's buying a 5700 xt you shouldn't be buying a 5700 xt because that means the demand for it's really high the prices are going to be high you kind of want to cycle through it so this is probably my contrarian nature when i do deals hunting is that when you go down this alley right that's why 10 400 f's like look at that stuff right it's cheap now because everyone wants to go out and buy a ryzen cpu but are you going to pay 270 bucks for a ryzen 5 3600 when you get pretty much the same performance out of something 100 cheaper at current market rates rates as like no i wouldn't do it anyway 288 quid there we go mates next up here 3700x this is where the amd play is making a lot of sense it's cheaper than the 10700f you get the raised prism i love this cpu it's one of my favorites if it comes around these price points right 3700x was always a good price performance cpu and at this price it is amazing 285 quid at least from what i'm seeing compared to the other stuff out there in the uk i'd be hitting this up and yeah i like where this is at next up here if you want a higher speed ssd mp600 this is pcie gen4 i'm like well okay that's 100 quid that's not too bad this thing does perform pretty well i've got one of these at the studio here pretty quick drive i think they've i know that's four okay so the 4 000 should be on the second line so yeah it does go over 4 000 megabytes i have tested this thing it is quick and then we've got here for a motherboard to uh go with that 3700 x 70 pounds b450 honestly the difference between pcie gen 3 and gen 4 you i mean if we're looking at a b550 motherboard you're paying an extra maybe in the uk you'd be paying an extra 40 pounds and you're not going to be getting 40 pounds worth of extra performance out of that motherboard now 3700x is one of those cpus you just pop it in the motherboard set your xmp profiles up use the wraith prism set and forget you're gonna have an amazing gaming experience and you're gonna be getting really good value too easy next up in the uk look at this focus g i love this case it's a really nice case it looks decent looks really clean but another thing is too at 43 pounds i'd be buying these up because this is about i don't know the going rate in the uk for these but it looks like compared to the other cases out there this thing is bringing some good value definitely go with this if you're building a new pc or even if you're a pc flipper over in the uk this thing looks pretty good if you can get the right angle of the shot see that shot there with the front white leds blinging out the front i absolutely love it so that's beautiful nice case especially at 43 quid delivered then we've got the last deal of the day if you're into budget storage you're like look i don't want the mp600 because i'm just going to be flipping this pc or i'm just going to be using it for gaming i don't need that extra storage or speeds just go with the sn550 500 gigabytes um 46 pounds and you know here's a funny thing i'm going to tell you guys on live stream because it doesn't matter right um i did i think i did the sm 550 for uh western digital i think i did a video on this uh sponsored video for him and i was like guys the gaming performance is pretty good and they're like don't talk about the gaming performance and i'm like why not why can't i talk about the gaming performance of an sm550 it's a solid drive the speeds are good the games were loading up absolutely fine because they wanted to target the um the black version the wd black version of this to gamers and i'm like well this is absolutely fine for gamers there's actually this is a match made in heaven for gamers cheap price good performance why wouldn't you want this for gamers anyway sponsored video that's the problem with sponsored videos you sometimes you you get forced to do things that we forced to cut out a bit that i thought was really good i'm like okay there it is there so you'll notice if you go back to that video the sponsored one by wd they um yeah they made me cut out the gaming part and i'm like so you just want other people to go buy other ssds at this price point because the black's more expensive this is like i don't know anyway let's move over to chat let's move over to chat now they are the deals all the links are in the description below and thank you guys so much for tuning in so far we're hitting like we're hitting some good live viewers here you guys hit the questions up and i'll answer as best as i can we're having a great day here you know i've been sipping on you know what i've been sipping on lately i've been sipping on some green tea i'm becoming like one of them new age trendies minus all the political jargon you know so a green tea for breakfast green tea for lunch you just keep sipping green tea and apparently it lowers your blood pressure that's a good thing right so you want to lower your blood pressure in a day and age of all this other stuff you kind of yeah green tea for the win all right so let's let's roll them questions in let's see what we can answer for you guys it's not over no no it's not over the deal i mean the deals are over that's all i could like i'm gonna tell you now the deals in terms of the deals there is just uh it's crazy with the deals because i think black friday the actual when you when you get into black friday we're not going to be able to live stream deals because the deals the actual good deals on black friday they're gone in like two seconds i remember last year i got like a forty dollar aussie i could be about thirty dollars u.s nvme man.2 one terabyte and it was some freak sale that shouldn't have happened like ebay had a bug on their site which allowed me to get 140 off the ssd and i showed it in the video but that's the kind of deals that i can't live stream that because it's gone before you even refresh the browser but these are like right what you've got here on today's video is just solid deals that you're not going to have to fight with sites crashing and all this stuff that's it's just going to be panic mode where like we saw with the rtx 3080s and all that that's what's gonna happen five percent of people not even five percent of people are going to get the loot so five percent of people are going to get loot 95 percent of people are going to miss out but this stream right here 100 of people are going to get them deals that's what techia city is all about and that's why we're going to do this video that's why we're doing the video today because i don't i did kind of like the black friday stuff i just i'd probably be playing some video games not even no i just don't want to compete with that stuff so i mean it's the thing the hustle like yeah people love the hustle and the hustle it's just like you do the hustle you make a bit of profit you can buy yourself some nice things anyhow when you go over down so my windows is broken brian can you explain how to fix it you got to be a little bit more specific like what's broken about it if it's broken just put the usb install in and reinstall windows simple um if i've had to run even on some of my benchmark rigs i've had to reinstall windows because you're overclocking and the whole system just craps out and when it cracks out it's corrupted something and i've had this happen a couple of times and then the windows install's bricked and i'm like damn thank actually if marco is in the chat thanks marco the nas the zeus tour nasa's i copy the games over the nas i can reinstall windows copy the games back saves a lot of time so man these questions are coming in so quick like okay so i got a legit deal yep i mean okay you got a legit deal that's awesome if you guys are getting legit deals that's amazing but if you've got a pressing question drop it down below uh in the next one can you add some laptops oh laptops this is the thing like on the channel here i don't generally do laptops that much like i'll take a look at them sometimes and i just like i would rather a desktop pc under all circumstances if you can get a desktop pc always use it over a laptop because you're not getting laptops you're never really going to get good value i guess compared to a desktop pc plus when something goes wrong on a laptop man is it a pain it is so painful that sometimes they embed the gpus on the motherboard they'll embed all the stuff on the motherboard so you can't change anything you gotta buy the whole new motherboard so it's like your sol like sol with laptops and that's kind of like why i don't believe in them that much but i mean hey if you guys want if you guys want some recommendations on laptops i can find the cookie cutter stuff but even then when you start going cheaper on laptops you're like do you really want to go cheaper because the durability might not be there anymore so it's kind of like the catch 22 there is different to the desktop game where kind of like on the desktop game you can get all the good value stuff something bust down it's pretty cheap to fix it's an easy quick fix so anyhow let's get back let's get back any chance the ryzen 9 3900x will drop in price during black friday cyber monday greetings from europe low chance that's what i'm saying low chance all the ryzen stuff is in pen top demand at the moment i showed you guys before uh the ryzen deal in the uk that was the 3800x i'd be going for that 3800k in the uk 3800 uk wait 3700x what am i saying on livestream 3700 uk processor that's what i'd be getting for at the moment it's the deal in the uk for the cpu that's your best bet right now eight core 16 threads save yourself some money 3900x i'd honestly be looking at um the used market for one of them someone who wants to update for the 5900x which i know there's a few people doing they're doing it locally here i'm guessing that's a trend that will follow through if you're really looking for a 3900x jump on your local used market and just keep refreshing the browser every couple of hours and you'll probably find a good deal on something so okay anyhow what are the odds to get a ryzen 5000 cp on black friday wait or no yeah like ryzen 5000 cpus man i don't think you're going to be getting any deals on them for black friday that's just my opinion um this year around like from what i'm seeing with like i was saying this early in the stream from what i'm seeing with this so far is just like there's no indication that like demand's too high basically demand is way too high for tech products in the latter half of 2020 and what that means is when the demand is high where's the incentive for these retailers to give you a discount absolutely none and that's just being real with you guys so sure like there will be some i'm guessing there'll be some places that will team up with people and offer good discounts um like for instance scd keys that came to me they're like brian give your viewers a 30 discount like sweethearts let's do it let's take care of people but other than that outside of like those deals i would be going for the early deals like we've done in today's video and just trying to find stuff now or going on the used market while all this chaos is going on because this is going to be chaos when you get to black friday because there's going to be so many just like normal trendies out there they're going to be going for um you know just mainstream stream deals and they're going to think they're getting a deal and half the time they're not getting a deal but that all that extra demand is going in there so yeah just be careful of that anyhow uh question is there anything you can do for dead pixels or will warranty cover i have a review sonic oh if you got 165 hertz 1440p and you've got dead pixels on it what you can do is try them like how i do it is it's hard right get like a cloth or something like a microfiber cloth that doesn't scratch the monitor use your thumb like this is how i i've unstuck there's different like a dead pixel usually isn't coming back but if it's a stuck pixel you can sometimes massage that with your knuckle and bring it back to life though if that doesn't work i'd message view sonic and try and get them to replace them on because man there's nothing more annoying than staring at a dead pixel like it triggers me dude like when i'm when i'm sitting there like my eyes just gravitate towards the dead pixel like you just sit there staring at it and that's wasted time that's wasted productivity it's not how it's meant to be so yeah get that dead pixel fixed but in terms of yeah fixing it it's kind of low chance stuck pixel yep dead pixel no um okay let's go back to chat here we got uh hello from uk i7 2600k and gtx 1080 ti okay together yes big okay you're from the uk dude i mean okay sounded like usually that's like a second language i mean don't mean to be rude but like hello from the uk okay live i mean hey maybe it's just 2020. i mean my grammar is getting terrible too maybe that's just it um what do you think of the 30 50 ti coming out in january oh this is news to me if there's a 3050 ti coming out in january yeah that's going to be amazing um and if you're see there's a thing with waiting for right this is the things waiting for stuff people are like should i wait and the bottom line is is is that weighted time right say it's coming out in january let's talk about 30 50 ti is that weighted time worth it for you because this is the thing right time is the most important thing on this earth man without time we've got nothing so is that two months of potentially getting maybe fifty dollars in value is that fifty dollars worth it for two months of gaming if you can't game at the moment if you're in a terrible gaming situation you want to game for christmas try and find a good deal on the used market for a 1660 subaru try and do it but if you can wait and you've got to say for instance you've got like a 270x or something like that or a 7970 that's still going a-okay yeah i'd wait out so the question with the waiting are you okay for now is your gaming experience comfortable if your gaming experience is comfortable i do recommend holding out um when will we see a ryzen 5000 ready motherboard i just did a review yesterday man maybe youtube didn't notify you kyle damn youtube youtube man youtube like so weird lately the youtubes is like look it recommends the live streams the live stream doing very healthy the windows 10 video doing very healthy and then yesterday's motherboard video just gets like kicked in like youtube just grabbed it pretend pretend yesterday's motherboard video is a football they just grabbed that uh youtube video kicked it into the curb and said hey we're not showing anyone this video that's it's a weirdest thing with youtube man it does frustrate um because this is this is my this is my main job right no i'm not going to lie to you guys i do i do synergize a lot with my channel but probably i'm like mr synergy in terms of any other youtuber out there i'd be definitely synergizing so hard with everything else i do but in terms of like you know this is it's your main job it's like all of a sudden it's like yeah your boss grabbed a football which is your head kicked it into the curb and then said hey have some fun bro and it's like well this isn't fun but that's what youtube does sometimes anyway um okay live streams i never get notifications on i just happen to stumble into this chat definitely not hungover okay damn marco okay so we're even struggling on okay so we're even struggling on live streams now look kids if you want to be a youtuber i think i i don't just don't uh it's like it looks like it's such an uphill battle to to be a youtuber nowadays you gotta like you gotta try your best to pull like i don't know man like i kind of i wish they would explain like if youtube if you if anyone out there is watching you should explain more with your creators as to why viewers aren't getting notified when they're hitting the bell because i know marco man marco hits the bell like marco's like he refreshes the browser sometimes to see when a video is uploaded because he's like spamming the comments so quickly and yeah so what's what's up with youtube hey that's it's like you know yeah weird never heard of a career where your boss is just not transparent with you at all right youtube's the first career this is the this is the that side of youtube man anyway let's jump back to chat we'll get you we'll get your questions answered juicy little questions is wall mounting your monitor worth it oh yeah yes you want to warm out your monitor it looks clean it just over time you appreciate it much more because the stair the problem with the with not wall mounting a monitor is if you buy different monitors they've got different stands and it's it just looks weird uh especially if you if you've got different stands it kind of doesn't match so i guess that's why a lot of people do the same monitor but even then wall mount looks so much cleaner than a stand that's just my opinion and the wall mounts don't cost much and in fact you can pick them up on um on deals what's the lowest latency cpu gpu pair you have used oh damn okay it been cs go so csgo and it's coming down to like the 10 900k wouldn't be the lowest latency technically but in terms of the fastest thing i've noticed in cs go would be the 10900k overclocked with some really fast um 4000 megahertz memory i think the 4400 megahertz even but that was just like snap fest like absolute snap fest the gpu was the uh what did i use it with 2080 super 28 super was kraken that thing was fast um nowadays like i haven't tried but when i was playing cs go on the 10900k overclocked with a 2080 super on this uh memory it was huge it was like quick but then again all the stuff like very subjective stuff with input latency but i do notice input latency because this uh b7 that i'm using as a backup monitor that had input lag on and i noticed that by just moving the mouse around so maybe i'm sensitive to the input lag so yeah anyway keep moving on on amazon if you need to save money try to buy everything from amazon warehouse it's open box there's a good tip thanks john like that's a good tip buy some open box stuff save yourself some money and amd lied about 6 800 prices why uh what's going on with amd's 6800 prices is there something yusuf what's what's going on there what's going on with him what's going on with them 6800 prices because i have seen it like from what i can tell the prices in australia are just bad um prices of 6800s and 3080s and stuff we're not getting anywhere near those us msrps so the prices are kind of out of control in australia but that being said you can weasel your way around and like i've been buying up colorful gpus from a guy up in um up in brisbane actually he's been really good he's uh i pre-ordered one then when i went to pre-order it he's a really cool really cool dude for some reason he doesn't want me to plug his business i was like dude like i can give you a quick plug if you want he's like no i don't need a plug because he's just flat out right now and um yeah so the 30 80 and 6800 800 prices in australia are just crap anyway but i don't know what's what's going on with the prices is there ah [Music] 1.1 k 6800 xt or x i'm not that's not bad in australia so in australia the prices are fine for 6800 xt um uh what did so they're saying okay they said they're saying amd pulled an nvidia their non-reference cards are a significant price jump correct are they talking about the non-reference cards oh okay and so what they're getting at is there was low stock on the 6800 xt reference card so here you go by the go by yeah go buy the board partners and they're more expensive okay that would if that's happening i'd need to look into that for you guys um i didn't get sent any aftermarket cards for the 6800 xt or 6800 um i yeah so i wouldn't yeah again i'm oblivious to that so i do apologize but if there's a video to be made out of that i can check that out for you guys but in terms of like the stock guys like i think amd were on twitter and this was the one thing i think a lot of people already pointed this out amd were on twitter like yeah we're not gonna do it in video we're not we're gonna have stock for you guys on day one it's like no like the demand like nvidia i think nvidia hyped the rtx 2030 like gent look jensen is really good at hyping he's like the master hyper and what he did with the 3080 was he made so much demand for it that when it rolled around it was just suddenly on like everybody one of the 30 80 and even to this day everybody wants a 30 80 like they're sold out they they're hard to get and so i think with that became a trend right people like oh i missed out on the 3080 i've got to go now get a 30 6800 xt that's like the competing product and so i think amd didn't account for how much hype jensen pulled into the market and they just didn't realize how bad it would be because from what i'm told the new 3000 series gpus are selling more than the previous turing cards like they've already sold more cards in the same time frame like nvidia's shipping these cards out from what i'm told and they're shipping them out as best as they can but there's just so much more demand this year that that's that's the situation and so amd should have said okay this is the situation guys we're probably going to be sold out on day one just like nvidia was but instead they're on twitter like we're not going to have this problem at all they're going to be no stock problems and i think um frank from he used to be at alienware and then he transferred over to amd change jobs and he's like i bet you're 10 bucks i'm gonna take you ten dollars it's like no you better pay that guy off his 10 bucks on twitter you better pay him his ten dollars that's what i think has come out of this he's gonna pay his ten dollars to that guy up on twitter he owes him so that's it yeah people know that tweet yeah the ten dollar tweet uh the ten dollar tweet so that was the one there so if we go back to any more comments before we you guys are loving this chat like i'm watching the stats man you guys are loving the chat let's keep chatting um what chair do i use uh any recommendations for deals on chairs right now okay i use the virta gears but they're not a deal and they sent them over i did a review for them it was like it's they're good chairs but they're not good value that's what i'm gonna say like sorry vertigo but um in terms of what i use i use the vertigo chairs and the corsair chair as well they've got a gaming one here too that's really nice so they're all three chairs are pretty nice but they're not value chests i'd say for value chairs you might want to um i don't see i haven't checked that out like i remember i did an ebay chair before that was pretty good but that was years ago yeah yeah wherever you like go around check your local like um furniture store and like the big furniture store not the little like little guys sometimes got the boutique stuff the boutique stuff's not gonna be good value either i'd get like grab the the value like the big manufacturer and they've just got these new chairs in because when i was in japan there was these massive chains and they had some of the most comfiest chairs for about 150 bucks and dare i'd say more comfy than this chair i'm using right now you know so um yeah so i'd go for your big furniture manufacturer where you where you are locally see what they've got and um yeah that'd be a deal for a chair i wouldn't kind of like if you're going on amazon for a chair that's kind of like playing uh you're playing a bit of a lottery there man you don't know what you're going to get because like when some guy says they've reviewed a chair and it's amazing how big is the dude like how tall are they like there's so many things that come into a chair and picking out a chair properly so uh hey brian your channel got me into man i can't even read how do i pause the chat okay okay hey your channel got me into pcs about two years ago i've built so many since then my little brother is on his way over right now so i can help him build up his 10 850 case system that's awesome i love reading that stuff thanks for commenting okay and what do i think of the 99 kmart gaming chair i haven't tried it i actually when i'm when i mean it's not good it's not good okay you can feel the metal bars around the edge it's like hollow inside okay so uh the young guy here he just says it's horrible don't it's not worth the 99 box there you go um the 5600 x 3070 combo is it good for streaming like go for the yeah man like 5600 x 37 combo yeah like it's gonna be fine for streaming but like 5600 x isn't a value cpu that's my that was my my graph with it so we got a super chat here too it's filling up it's like spamming my screen lg 85 49-inch nano people should buy that if they can afford an oled is the nano an oled it's not an oled oh if you can't okay sorry okay so okay so it has 4k 120. fair enough all right there's a good recommendation um if you can't afford it thanks on the fence tech nice good recommendation if you guys want 120 hertz 4k um so we're back to the 5600 x right it's six scores 12 threads it's quick like it's quick but if you want to stream like you can stream on again as we're talking about before go grab yourself a cheap mic cheap webcam you can stream on a go buy a used 5600 xt if it's 700xt you'll be able to stream on that use the gpu encoder it's actually funny because the 5700xt as you guys pointed out in the video you liked the encoder coming out of that not so much the new 6800xt when we did the encoder comparison in the review you guys said that the 5700 xt looked really good and i agree i i was watching the back and i liked the 5000 series encoder and nvidia's encoded the best so maybe the driver updates help the 6800 xt we'll take a look at that a bit later but yeah i'd go grab something a bit cheaper for streaming at the moment i'd go grab a even a 10 400 that we saw before you can use that gpu encoder for streaming and you're going to save yourself like 200 almost in the whole setup because you might have to go out and buy more expensive motherboard so yeah there are some good options for streaming but uh to answer the question directly yeah it'll be good for straight it'll be oh it'll be a good combo for streaming just not the best maybe not the best value for streaming anyway uh what do you reckon ryzen 5 3400g rtx 2070 is there a reason for getting the 3400 g i'd much rather you get a 3 600 or 3500 x for that matter 3400 g is zen plus weaker imc than the uh ryzen true ryzen third gen or yeah zen two and uh it's a zen plus so if there's any reason to get 3400g let us know but other than that i would try and get zen two if you can or a 2600 right just go grab a ryzen 5 2600 because if you don't need that onboarding gpu especially on in this case it's not like we're looking at a 10 400 f versus a 10 400 where they're pretty much the same cpu just the gpus tacked on you're getting a big difference between 3400 g and even a 3300 x or something like that so there's that hopefully that answers that question uh does ergo chair or gaming chair matter or is all hype if you're sitting in front of a chair if you're sitting in front of a screen all day you do want some comfort and comfy armchair better than cheap i mean yeah anything with gaming on it anything with gaming just tacked onto it be very weary try it first try it before you buy it because usually gaming is the most over-hyped word in the industry i mean i'm guilty of using this word every time i sell a pc it's not a pc it's a gaming pc you want to you want the best gaming experience you're gonna be a gamer and um yeah that word is just abused now and it's expanded over to chairs because really what what like what is a gaming chair like what does it do for you your gaming experience other than a comfortable chair see comfortable chair doesn't sell gaming chair men out the door fellas ship them out why are these chairs selling all the sudden ah we changed the title from our comfortable chair to gaming chair oh why didn't i think of that so why didn't i get that that's the that's the tip right there tip of the day i should have called this gaming black friday live deals hunting that's i see i messed up i should have taken my own advice viewers would have been double if we called it the gaming stream um [Laughter] we would have messed up yeah we messed up sorry guys i messed up with the title so um okay the amount of fights i've lost because the opponent had a better gaming chair yeah that's right have you ever had fan mail damage been about two weeks since i shipped my package and kind of concerned oh sorry with the packaging guys like when you guys send over stuff with can yes fix it in the episodes i i do get it and i just put it in a pile for when i'm ready to shoot um when i'm ready to shoot the video i just put that stuff in a pile and then i read all the messages out and sorry if i don't get back to you in the emails or the dms like you should see my email box it just gets flooded every day and so you got to go through all this stuff and it's hard because you got to learn to balance life with going through emails and business and at the moment i don't really have a life but there's yeah you kind of at least got to sleep properly and and exercise and and do all that so you can't i can't be spending all day like damning and going you know messaging which is why you know i'm on live chat now just chat with you guys and you know if you got a question just drop it here but if you've sent the package and it says delivered to us then i'm i'm pretty sure i've got it and thank you so much for the for sending that stuff over it's really cool appreciate you guys a lot appreciate you yeah i should have called myself techy as gaming see adrian's right on the money should have not taken city tech he hasn't gaming so that's what i mean i wasn't on my game years ago i wasn't on my game like literally years ago and um yeah rgb adds fps this is legit uh what do i think about the gtx 1070 uh 10 series is kind of phasing out now like you'll notice like i've noticed the the 10 series has been sort of like people know that the 1650 super exists now the 1660 subaru's had time as well to flow through the market so like you're not getting as much pent up demand now for the 1070 as you once were so 1070 is kind of losing its appeal a little bit that's what i feel personally where i've kind of actually been avoiding a little bit too because people on the used market are kind of like i want 300 aussies for my 1070s like dude this isn't you know in 2019 anymore it's kind of like you've got to go with the times um so troll mick trollington i've seen you hey you're going to call it techie's gaming if you went weren't on your game yeah that's it hey it's been a long time mr troll how are you going mr troll i enjoy reading your comments yeah random gaming and hd and gamers nexus exactly see that's what i've been doing it wrong i've been doing it wrong all this time line is game tips if he did that he would have been 20 million subs already linus game tips um which which amd cpu would recommend that's under 150 usd uh at the moment under 150 usd this is what i mean the 3600 is out of the question i'd go with the 3100 can you pull that up yusuf is the 3100 under 150 usd yeah does it have to be amd and that's the question i raised at the start of this video does it have to be amd now because your value like the intel cpus are getting cheap and what's the 3100 is that 3100 170 usd wait did you change the shipping location to 170 usd you that can't be right man i'm going to double check this i've got because i've got beverly well i've got the beverly hills locked in hold on i got beverly hills locked in hang on i'm from beverly hills guys let's do this ryzen really really is a 3 100 170 bucks wow it's so it's sold out yeah you're right 3100 yeah new from 170 bucks which amd cpu should i get dude i would be getting it i wouldn't be getting a 3100 for 170 bucks like does it have to be amd now because at those prices yeah that's that's i think that's why i was getting those questions recently people like oh man what's the difference between 10 100 and the 3100 and now i'm starting to see why those questions are coming in 115 yeah does it have to be amd really does it did you okay do you have to pay amd tax is the question you should be uh brian rephrase can we get the question in the chat again brian do i have to pay amd tax let's ask that question come on let's go i'm waiting for it do i have to pay amd tax question mark there you go okay have we got the question yep brian do i need a do i need md tax no you don't you don't have to pay amd tax at the moment that's what's going on right now that's what's going on so yeah ryzen 5 ryzen 5 3600 at around that 160 price point which i've traditionally seen it at go get that but i can't believe a 3100 too i can't believe the 3100 is now 170 us like if i'm telling you guys after seeing this you might not want to wait for black friday because this is like this is out of stock that's what it means it's out of stock it retails at stock at msrp that's what that means there's a trend so if you want to build a gaming pc on a budget you might want to get your 10 100 now before that sells out because you might see that sell out too i don't know that's yeah yeah okay ten four hundreds yeah you get six course 12 threads so so what a weird market man wow put slow mode on chat okay ah i'm a noob yeah oh so does it roll it out see i'm still live streaming noob that's what i'm saying so yeah i'll do it next time i'll put slow mode on chat so that's is that where people can only ask one slow question okay cool all right so b h has them for 120 bucks just bought one last week okay cool there's the advice guys don't go on amazon anymore go to b h photos so yeah definitely like at the same price it's still a toss up like they're both good cpus and that's what i said in my review 10 400 f ryzen 5 3600 10 100 f 3100 they're good cpus at those 110 price points you're really not losing out it's like you haven't made a life-changing decision that's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life and trust me i have made some life-changing decisions that have haunted me for the rest of my life but it hasn't been between picking two cpus at a hundred bucks so or two hundred dollars anyhow i'd like to point out that you can get new for like 99 yeah and james thanks for the donation if you could if you know where to get these uh cpus from drop them in chat b h photo there's another one there go buy that up if you want to get the ryzen rejo sato x79 build for 200 please please please just like spamming chat i've got to get the x79 uh motherboard first which is the most important thing x79 is okay 9700k is what i have now yeah x79 is still okay um i've heard a rumor actually someone was telling me i've got to install an older version of windows 10 like 2016 version no updates and go check the performance even with spectre and meltdown disabled that's yeah that's a that's crazy right they reckon they've embedded nerfs into the of os you can't get rid of these nerfs basically windows 10 versus windows 10 guys what's the comparison oh your old x79 xeon's got nerfed there's the comparison i don't know like that's kind of like the conspiracy theory stuff that i want to test i really like that i want to test that stuff out and see if there's a difference if you guys want that in a video let us know because i'll like that's actually curiosity for me um because yeah like let's be honest what incentive basically what incentive would they have uh to essentially keep updates rolling out for the older stuff that's not for sale anymore i'll tell you zero incentive so there it is there is the i510 400 good with the 3070 yeah great combo man gonna be a great combo um 1440p 4k even man if you don't mind lowering the settings you can have a great experience dude so easy easy easy easy you're doing it wrong buy gold capitals buy gold should you buy a gold what do you reckon buy gold i mean the entire economy is a little bit tops tell you now that might like actually might be a good idea with all the money there they're pumping money through these economies man like it's not just australia dude the u.s i think is getting the worst they're just like yo where's the printer here's the money rolling through yeah just max the dial over it's like buzzing over and yeah so like gold's sort of like an anti-inflation play has always been an anti-inflation play and uh might be a good idea right now with the amount of money that they're printing so they're the caps on buy gold again i don't give financial advice on tech live streams but that's a pretty s that's a pretty sound device uh xbox series x controller s ps5 controller oh look i'm gonna say i've tried both the series x and the ps5 i like the actual console of the series x better but i do like the ps5 controller better that's just my and i'm a pc guy i've got no there's no fanboy stuff here so if they could get the ps5 controller on the xbox series x that would be yeah that would be that would be it for me i'm giving the controller the edge to the ps5 given the actual console unit and the design to the series x i love what they've done with series x it's like this doit unit it's high it feels high quality the ps5 kind of feels like they're just like yeah here's the unit guys let's just make something works attack some plastic sides onto it here's your ps4 look better than the ps5 that's what i thought so that was that anyway i just want to ask does the 8758 you're talking about laptop cpu and 1070 max q still worth it i'd rather wait for ryzen on premium laptops i mean anything's okay if it's a decent deal you got to get the price so if you're asking is it like you basically if you're asking a question you're probably asking is that you know is a good deal so i need to know the price um yeah if the price is right yeah it's going to be all right uh 3080 5800x combos are good for streaming yeah it's good for gaming it's it's like the gaming king one of the gaming king combos right now uh streaming yeah you tack off the gpu encoder on that you're streaming streaming's not much of a big deal so i think people place way too much heat on streaming and it's like it's going to tax i'm streaming now let me tell you my cpu usage oh no i don't want to risk like bugging out the stream i'm not risking anything um yeah last time i was on live stream with uh like over a couple of months ago i my cpu usage was like two percent or something like that and that was with the gpu encoder i'm using the gpu encoder now absolutely fine never a problem um is eight hundred dollars a good price for a 2080 ti aussie it's okay now with the 3070 out and the 3070 is coming into stock and you can get 30 70s for around 950 that's what i picked up two of them for so wait for that flip up challenge video but i'd kind of try and barter him lower if you can get it for 700 aussies you're laughing that's actually a good deal there james harwood thanks for the donation man uh we got i got it chat stop scroll okay just because you're an awesome man i do the same releases resales as you in the usa too market is everywhere right now i got my personal rtx 20 ti for 500 bucks okay yeah that's about right on with that 700 aussie is it 750 but yeah but the same price as the 30 70. so if you get a 30 70 for 500 i definitely get the 37 of the 2080 ti um just because you know you've got the latest latest and greatest on there plus you got better power consumption and you can undervolt so well on the 3000 series under vaulting is what really brings the 3000 series sort of like if you know if you're into like look power's pretty expensive in australia i convert a lot of the solar energy into crypto don't hate me but i'm not using gpus to do it so don't hate me i'm not using gpus to do it i'm using these these asic miners i've got two of them and they're bringing me in zen cash and i sold some zen cash the other day because it went up i was like wow people are buying crypto again time for me to sell my little stack off patience always be patience uh there's some like z cut there's some z master or something from a company um yeah i have a supplier uh stocking 3070s for 900 new three fans no rgb i can give you the connect i'm from perth but he can ship it to you i've got a guy like i've got a guy here uh 900 is actually really good though yeah send us send us an email his name's yusuf same as you bro yeah give us the connect dude 900 aussie for a 30 70 is pretty good i've heard the you know if it's you know 3d though this is a this is a sad thing i'm going to tell you guys on live stream because i don't care um i've heard inno 3d are the worst on the 3000 lineup of cards even though they might look fancy apparently they're going like thermal throttling like the my voice i gotta drink some more green tea they're thermal throttling apparently they're thermal throttling you know three okay pmy okay send us an email brother we'll check that out because yeah we'll be getting into some flipping before christmas it's going to be flipping crazy and the borders are opening too so where we are in australia it's all opening up for business again so there's going to be some more used content yeah i'm going through puberty that's exactly right oh man which uh with amd having auto overclock and auto undervolt is there any reason to manually overclock anymore yes because um this is actually a big one i guess there's a good question we'll come out in the live stream is it so basically with the auto overclocking and auto under vaulting algorithms i don't know because i haven't checked them that in depth but from what i gather they still have their buffers in place right so if you go out and buy a really good motherboard really good power supply you're already ahead of the bunch you've already got extremely low ripple and what when you got low ripple on that feeding that cpu feeding that gpu you can then extract manually the best undervolts and the best overclocks and that's what these algorithms can't account for with what they're locking into their stuff now they can do it off temperature they are doing it very well precision boost is doing it off temperature very well but i don't know if they're not accounting for the ripple just yet i'm not too sure i haven't checked that out but if they are then yeah there probably won't be any point in overclocking but i found like when i tested the 5000 series out i was getting better manual numbers than i was on the auto stuff but the auto stuff was good don't get me wrong if you're like if you don't want to overclock but you still want to get some extra performance the auto stuff's going to be great and it's coming a long way so uh do you know really any good gpu deals no there's just like gpu deals are hard right now man it's hard it's to the point where i'm like looking around for old potatoes too like i'm that desperate for gpus it's hard to get some gpu deals um so what would be a good pair a gpu to pair with my 3900x as a gpu uh i'd say yeah 6800 or 3070 if you can get one of them so they're coming into stock 3070 especially is looking like it's coming into stock and if you're not too fussed and you you can get one for a good price i'd go with a 30 70. because the used market still hasn't really adjusted around that price point so no point um okay yeah msi g65 with rtx 20 60 around 1500 on local store is it a deal is that yeah that's the laptop um it's okay i mean for 1500 bucks you can build yourself something better like i built i built an rtx 2060 pc for about what 800 maybe with 2600 800 aussie and i'm flipping it for around 1200 so yeah there's it you know easy clap 3300 x for 121 or 3600 for 200. oh 3300x if you're just gaming man 3600x is where it's at 3300x is a good little cpu it's a good little cpu damn man questions there's so many questions you guys have flooded me this time it's like sometimes i'll be begging for questions and there won't be any coming in and now i'm like yo got some questions there's a chat just spamming it out here which processor would you recommend for buying all productivity ryzen 7 3700x or 5600x thanks the difference here is we're looking into productivity right now we've got some interesting numbers that will be coming out i'd say in the next month and what's going on with productivity is that i'm finding it's got a lot to do with storage and so your 3700x and your 5600x will be about equal when it comes to productivity because they're about i think the 5600x if you overclock it match this is the 3700x but if you're not overclocking 3700x is going to be really good for productivity imc this is the funny thing about the imc people will like i said in the video where i tested memory single rank versus dual rank off the top of my head i said in that video the imc improvements not the actual ipc people like mistook that for ipc improvements yes 5000 series has a huge ipc gain over 3000 but the imc improvements on 5000 series over 3000 series wasn't as big as the imc improvements from zen 2 over zen plus and i was actually right on that i was right on the money if you pull up amd's official specs on those cpus and the memory supported on the imc's there's virtually no difference between the zen 2 and the zen 3 on the imc side of things so your memory is almost going to lock in the same speeds on the 3700x as it is on the 5600x so do keep that in mind anyhow um debaura kinda answered that question okay to bauer answered your question thanks uh is is an ex money mining gpu worth it to buy oh dude look at the mining gpus if they're all rusted out avoid them like rusted out gpus usually the fan will go if the gpu doesn't go your fan will go beforehand something will go on a rusted out gpu but if it's been in a good environment like if the person has taken care of it in the mining environment and then for instance they've undervolted it uh raised the fan speeds to 80 or something like that and they and they say that in the ad they're like look these are mining gpus but they've been taken care of i'd take the gamble on that so that's just my experience with mining gpus uh thoughts on rocket lake as of now will it be worth the wait um thoughts on any gaming cpu right now right if you're talking about this in the gaming uh from a gaming standpoint if you're looking at gaming on rocket lake do you need the fps because what we saw with the 360 hertz monitor when i did a review on that it was only like five games that supported 360 hertz so do you need like at 4k right i'm at 4k now i'm at 4k 120 hertz i don't really care about the cpu i use for gaming too much so i wouldn't i wouldn't wait for rocket lake i just wouldn't really care so what are you doing where you need that extra performance out of the cpu now because we're kind of like the market is shifting the gpus are hammering the cpus at 1080p where the games and the cpus can't keep up with the gpus anymore so there's all the gpu manufacture amd and in video like yo let's just go to 4k we got to go to 4k because there's no other choice if we want to sell gpus we got to jump up step up the resolution step up the vram keep selling you guys gpus so is it worth it waiting for rocket lake i'd say it depends on what you do do you want to get a thousand fps and no 2000 fps and cs go consistently then maybe for me it's not worth the wait now um i think even the 5000 series is proving kind of how the limits have been now taken to a point where it's like okay we need game manufacturers to step this up and i'm like look i'm super happy for amd right they're on top now they're like the premium guys but i think it's raised that question of okay how much do i want to spend on a cpu now because the 3600 even when the 5600x came out all the 3600s are getting sold up they're getting snapped up still because people would rather value than maximum performance and that was always ryzen's play on the market ryzen originally was always that super good value for money play so is it worth waiting for rocket lake i don't know cpus cpus man and intel is now dropping their prices intel's dropping their prices too and it's getting very competitive so i would honestly build now like right now like before black friday hits before christmas demand just sucks everything out before the intel cpus on amazon start going up to 250 bucks because the ram the ramp's really cheap man ddr4 memory is cheap ssds are cheap everything's cheap right now so it's actually a good time to build uh what's to go with undervolting ryzen 5000 uh what do you mean wants to go like it's just you just undervolt it get better uh watts per clock speed so that's i mean is it worth it to undervolt yeah anything like undervolting gpus is the big one cpu is not so much you're not going to go like you're not going to go from say for instance out of the box a lot of the ryzen cpus the new ones we'll use 120 watts i think that's what the 5900x was pulling and if you undervolt it you might be able to get it down to maybe 100 watts or something like that at the same speeds so is is 20 watts worth all that time and then even then you might even crash every one once in a while so as opposed to a 30 80 and a 30 90 in the 6800 xt we would drop in the power consumption from the wall by like 90 watts and getting very similar performance so gpus is where the under vaulting is definitely worth it guys that's just my opinion there oh man i didn't realize i was slow rolling chat and there's like there's a bar now any advice for vrm1 our coil wind yeah so the height this is another thing this is why you should switch to 4k or keep your fps sort of capped because 360 hertz here's the thing about 360hz and i should have mentioned this in the review of the 360 hertz monitor but because we're just looking at the monitor i didn't even think about it but then after i did the review i'm like yeah if you're going to be playing at 360 hertz one thing you've got to remember is you might be getting some coil wine now that might trigger you while you're playing at 360 hertz so maybe get some close back headphones there's your solution for coil wine otherwise replace the part or drop the fps because what happens when gpus get really high fps the coils just start like whining so hard because the frequencies that they're pushing the frames at is causing the wine amy winehouse do you ever look at trade me new zealand i don't no i'm in awesome man i look at gumtree and facebook mainly uh how do we get okay so i just skipped me down the bottom uh we got any juicy juicy questions uh what would be the best gbp to pair with an i7 6700k off the top of my head used 2060 super or 5600 xt man that'd be what i'd be pairing with that maybe uh yeah is the sith or scythe foomer 2 okay with a 1080 50k at stock i don't plan on overclocking at all haven't tried it i rarely use scythe uh cpu coolers so i'm not sure uh where can you get the 3070 right now in oz uh i can't say the dude's name he didn't want a shout out man sorry gotta respect his privacy i he said he was just busy as right now so he just didn't have any time to deal with new like customers coming in until he figures out what to do but because i've known him for a few years he's sort of like been yo like um i put my pre-order with him with the 3080 and then he's he messaged me the other day saying he had some 3070s in stock and he knows like he knows what techies is about you send him the text give me the time and the date i'm rocking up bro that's it hassle free man so he knows what i'm about um and that's what a lot of people do like when you're dealing right they don't want any hassles hassle-free transactions always remember that if you're going to buy something on the used market don't sit there asking the seller 20 questions he's probably just not going to reply to you and he's gonna wait till that that fella rocks in with the fat stack and takes it off his hands uh what gpu would you pair uh with a 5800 x best of the best man um if you get the 5800x you don't care about price performance you care about performance so i'd be getting the best gpu you can with that thing 3080 or 6800 xt 3090 is like i mean look 3090 is a it's a ridiculous play so i need help with mobile zeus tough gaming b550 plus is it good with a raisin a raisin seven 3700 x uk yeah b550 plus it'll be fine man absolutely fine uh 37 here flitzer online on ebay whew is that is there a sale on it you want to check 30 70 on ebay in australia you can actually get them in stock there you go if that's a that's a recommendation we can do that yeah 37's are out at scorptex that's what i was telling you guys 3070s were coming into stock and i said that people like you know it's funny when i make these predictions people just laugh at me and i'm the only guy who does predictions really like in terms of realistic predictions a lot of people won't touch that they'll be like ooh i'm not touching that i'll just tell you guys how i think it i said i think 3070s will come into stock at the end end of november november maybe i did say october 2 which october was wrong but look we're in november now and 37 is a common in stock if you're really hungry for one go get one so 30 80s they're in really high demand so don't hold me to that everybody wants a 30 80. but because everyone wants the 3080 you can still pick up a 30 70. so yeah there marco's saying 3080s are on shelves in taiwan there you go tech yes am i your messiah tech predictions all right let's uh let's finish it off check them super chats oh see i'm not i'm that bad i think i missed out on super chat oh what happened with the super sorry if i missed the suit i mean i'm so i feel so bad now a bit of an off topic is zcash a good investment long term i hope that answers that i would look i i sold my cryptocurrency yesterday so if that there's your investment advice man if you got some crypto just sell it now it probably might crash and like yeah might be we might be like this is the thing we might be on the verge of a massive crash like a massive one ones are the likes you've never seen people are like so bullish and it's like what are you bullish about like i look out the window here all the restaurants are still struggling the average person is still struggling you call that greens what do they call it green shoots i'm not seeing the green shoots anyway anyway that's uh that's my investment there's my investment advice for you can i put a ryzen 5000 on a x570 motherboard out of the box yeah depends on the x570 and most of them have flashback too don't forget that x570 most of them have flashback most of them i'm not sure without the cpu yes yes most of the x570s do i think some of them might not don't get me wrong but if it has flashback you can just get the usb you can just look at the instruction manual for that motherboard put the usb in the back flash back it with the method that motherboard manufacturer requires and uh you'll be good to go so j apple you said send me i send you a super chat okay just drop your question here again brother and i'll answer it sorry i just been flooded flooded you guys you guys love me too much today you guys are loving me too much on this live stream today sending the tech yes love i'm getting the techies love back that's what's happening uh 4790 is it's still a good secondhand buy not at 150 aussie dollars and that's why i've been avoiding a lot of 47 70s and 37 70s people want too much from 10 100 exists 3100 exists even though everyone's buying up 3100s those two cpus existing make it a very crap play to try and re-flip a 47 night i think look i think people are starting to wake up too i think people are starting to wake up like the average consumer is like okay just because it's an i7 ninety should i just do a bit more research here and yeah they're finding out that 10 100 f is a better buy yeah so 83 usd in taiwan yeah they're cheap man so uh take a city scalper ps5 for me i'm not touching consoles man i'm not touching the console market it's rabid ah okay shopping express australia currently have msi 3070 gamemode 3 on stock there we go guys 3070s are everywhere which cpu cooler under 60 would you recommend for the zen 35800x okay 60 us oh 60 us that's a hard call honestly man i reckon that i go water cooler that we link for 45 bucks would do the job on a 5800x like i'm telling you now these aliexpress brands are getting so competitive so and i know this because like the guys that um some of the 3d printer guys were like yeah i just said to him i'm linking the aliexpress and they're like don't read the aliexpress i'm like why it's cheaper and then they're like uh they're too competitive on aliexpress how's that is that a bad thing like is that a bad thing that it's too competitive on aliexpress oh man so okay did can you see if jay apple sends his question i'm not gonna think jay apple i'm not forgetting you dude not forgetting you let's see i'm giving a real since 1995 exactly that's right oh where'd he say the next three to five years eight calls is a sweet spot yeah and that'll be fine for three years at least i mean past three years yeah 1440p will be fine with eight cores now depending on the eight core if you're using like an old fx bulldozer eight core that's a potato no that thing's already a potato but if you're talking about yes next three years after three years you don't know man like there could be some revolution in three years so i'm not giving you the five year but i'll give you the three year eight cores will be fine jay apple for three years a good eight core 16 thread that'll be fine um how much can a 2070 super venter second hand sell for you think it depends on where you are i mean if you're in the us you probably get 300 maybe if you if you got 300 us for that maybe 350. i don't know that's what i would pay i would pay around 300 us for a 2070 super right now on the used market i'd try and get it for that even though even though it's not like that's not that's sort of like a lower price but when you look at i mean that's why the used market's bad because we've got a 1060 ti coming out and mark my words the 1060 gi will be faster than 2070 super and that's 3.99 now there's all this demand this gaming pc demand is just making the usual you know it's bringing a lot of outside influence into us real tech enthusiasts the guys that subscribe to tech yes city for years we're the real tech enthusiasts we've been around here we're entitled to our 399 1060 ti but we're not getting it now because the masses are coming in and it's good like i'm not complaining i'm not complaining i mean you hit that sub button ring that bell no i'm not complaining but we got all this extra demand and we're not we're not seeing the fact and this is the thing right this is what i'm going to come in a little bit in defense of nvidia and amd right there's there's one thing and i don't know why they don't talk about this it's a big topic right all this demands come in and they can't like for them to go make a whole new factory and start making gpus or say to tsmc or whatever spin up another seven nanometer fab you just can't do that because they don't know what demands going to be like in six months or a year's time if all the flight routes open up again and they've made this new factory they might be sol so it's better to have the situation that they've got now from a business point than to have the other situation where they've gone and invested even billions of dollars in factories and then suddenly demand's not there so you can see the trade-off and so it's not like in defense i don't know why i aimed in a video does just say that like hey guys there's just this is the way it is i mean i understand um but you know you got the you got some of the guys there they just they're not drinking green tea see they're not having a green tea they're out there and they got the pitchforks out and they um they want it man they just like they want vengeance because they couldn't get their 499 3070 on launch day anyway 199 revli thanks for the super chat man 2700 x a good buy in 2020 for a budget editing rig yeah definitely always depends on the price always depends on the price um but yeah 2700x is gonna be good for a budget editing rig definitely it'll do 4k editing too what we're finding now and we're gonna is like make sure you get some good storage too uh it's dangerous to cue flash a motherboard q flash ah like uh it's not dangerous to flash your motherboard here's the thing about flashing your motherboard as long as you're not putting fault like don't put some faulty ram in the motherboard or don't put something faulty in the motherboard make sure it's got the usual cooling solution and you should always keep around that ram stick that you know works if you're flashing motherboards regularly keep around that ram stick that you know works and um have that so every time you flash a bios you use that ram stick and then yeah make sure you like i've never had a bios update flash when i've just stuck to simple protocol everything works on the pc everything's fine update the bios power doesn't switch off what not i've never had a problem with uh flashing in that regard i have in the past this is a true story have had a faulty part faulty ram flash the bios and the whole thing's froze midway boards gonski that was that was back when i was young tech yes learning my stuff learning learning you know learning the ways back when i was flipping piece uh car parts learning the ways of the flipping master mastery i was still like an amateur had the pick out then i then i found the cue it all started with the q9550 that's where it all started q95 it opened the treasure chest that's where it all started so all right chat's just going in their own way will a taichi x570 work with a 2700x yeah it should but just check the bios support list you want to pull that up yusuf x570 taichi cpu support i think it will like but i just i don't know why you'd couple an x570 with a 2700x unless you wanted to upgrade like to the best later yeah two thousand yeah supports yet rather than two there 2700 has to work with the tai chi um okay we've got some super chats coming in too they should have known the demand because of the pandemic everybody's staying at home demand is higher than ever and they should have prepared but that's the thing trevor you can't prepare you can't prepare you can't just make a factory out of nowhere that takes a long time to make the factories it's a massive investment over years like they can't just say okay we're going to spin up another seven magnitude factory they can't do it and so that's what i mean the sudden onset of the pandemic the sudden onset of coven has caused this situation and so let's say for instance if covert is going to go for another three years now then tsmc and all these fab factors might say all right it's worth our time now because we're going to have sustained long-term demand short-term demand versus sustained long-term demand is two different things and so what i'm trying to say is amd and nvidia's defense is that they it's not where like if this demand finishes like what we're seeing is reports of at least international travel starting from next year that all starts everything's back to normal suddenly you go okay don't need my gaming pc anymore gonna go travel and then you've got all this extra like supply they'll probably sell their gaming pcs get a laptop what not and then you've got the reverse you've got a 2018 crypto bust happening all over again so there's a company they can't risk that so that's the sort of that's the frustrating situation you're in there and look i understand the frustration man i tried to buy a um i tried to buy a 3080 on day one like tried tried that was the that's the key word there tried so got a samsung one terabyte 980 pro nvme so fast um is that three bit tlc it might be fast on the benchmarks but is it really fast roll the x-files music that's that's what we're looking into anyway what is the maximum price you would pay for an rtx 2060 super or a 5700 aussie uh 450 usd convert that into usd 450 aussie in the usd what would that be takes longer than eight months okay i'm losing my mind with chat now it's going all over the place we're talking from d litting to pc parts um okay is it 1080 50k worth to buy or buy ryzen 5950x or maybe wait for rocket lake and ddr5 i want to build the best pc for gaming and streaming thanks hassa if you want to stream you got to like you've got to get good at streaming that's the thing so it doesn't matter what you want for strength this is what i was telling you earlier in the stream if you don't believe me you can go backtrack the stream i was talking about the dude who spent ten thousand dollars on streaming five months later he's packing up shop and he doesn't enjoy streaming anymore so do you really want to stream if you want to stream man start off on a budget don't invest don't waste all your money on this stuff you're just wasting money you know like for even me like i'm using a wave three this is like 150 mic i could go out and buy a newman but i don't like i don't stream that much so i'm like nah man i'd rather keep my thousand bucks so yeah yeah yeah stream first equipment later beautiful advice that would be me so like i'm not even gonna directly answer that because i just don't like i think you shouldn't be spending that much money on streaming that's all it is like that's all that's my opinion on it and i i think you know and you might be better off in the future with that like right save some money invest it maybe yeah take look bro take think of the family members around you think of your best friends take them out to dinner spend some money on your friends man that's what you should be doing instead of buying that 5950x because all you're doing look all you're doing is lining up um who's the ceo of intel this one this one's going to be funny wait for it bob swann and who we got lisa sue yeah okay so we've got bob swan lisa sue here we go here's the thing right take your friends and your family with that money go buy a budget streaming rig six course 12 threads 1660 super start streaming take take your mom out to dinner man tell her you love her rocket jump ninja gives a heart luck instead you're going out there and you're like look i want to get a 59.50 i want to line lisa's pockets with that hard-earned money i want to line bob swans pockets with that hard-earned money [Music] let's just take a second back let's take a step back here look i'm always on the side of the consumer now that's how you realize stream first yeah performance later that's all saying let's do this [Music] so that's it you line it up like look i look i know the thing is i like lisa sue i've met her before i like it but i'm just saying in your situation where you are in

here guys 6800 that's gonna be absolutely no shortage right now boom and then then amd are like oh god guys we got a problem here uh now we know how nvidia's like uh feeling now oh damn then like yeah the pitchfork come out on twitter so that was that was this there this tweet man i'm gonna frame this one eh i think i'm gonna frame this one yeah oh man i love that one so oh we got troll troll mcdonald uh this is so you can pay off the loch ness monster oh man when did we we joked about the loch ness back in 2016 that was ages ago man we joked about the loch ness monster like ages i forgot even the context of the joke i think that was back when i was streaming with your boy jp yeah before before he started jumping in the comment section under different aliases and trolling the hell out of me anyway 2016 was a cool year it was a it was a cool year it was packed full of excitement prices on 1660 super any good uh yeah they're okay like 1660 super is like okay in australia it's like 320 i think 330 yeah it's okay like six things i didn't include it in today's deals it's just an okay buy like i've seen 1660 supers in australia as low as 290 aussie which is a really good deal seen them in the us i think they've gone down to like 210 us for a 1660 super so they are a good deal like if you go out and buy a 1660 server you're not going to be disappointed that's all appreciated okay 315 with free shipping that's okay that's on you mark yeah so that's um in australia 315 aussie so 66 you're not going to be disappointed yeah so christopher thanks man you remember too love the tech yes symbol and uh besides your name love you brian need a break but i need a break yep catch you later and if you're not on great stream peace peace thanks peace thanks for tuning in thoughts on the m1 chip that's the apple so you're using apple's os using the ecosystem um i'd like guys i never used an apple product since i threw my iphone 3 in the bin i remember that i bought an iphone 3 and i saved up money i was like this was young tech yes running around in 2009 was it 2009 is that when the i3 was released let's have a look iphone 3 release date 2009 yeah let's see if my memory is good there you go i remember i remember being one of them kids like what this is a revolution right i bought into it i was like this is gonna be so good got the phone no the three whatever the three with the internet yeah they had it in japan wasn't it i got one thing started slowing down after a few months like to the point where i couldn't even answer a call it was it was guy threw it in the bin i vowed since that day never to buy an apple product again i went back to a flip phone that's how much i had 3g phobia our iphone 3 phobia and i went back to a flip phone i mean of course the iphone 4 i think they nailed it um but the three like damn that thing had some problems and that's the problem with being an early adopter so ever since then like m1 i don't know it's apple so don't ask me about apple products i mean it looks good i've been hearing some pretty good things about it uh apple definitely have a good niche on in terms of what is it final cut is it the one that you use okay so they use final cut and it's optimized on apple and they do get their optimizations right with video editing that's something they've always done well so but yeah the three like i bought an iphone 3 i was like you know saving my money up hard bought an iphone 3 and i got destroyed destroyed hey brian zeb here just wanted to tell you your channel's amazing i want to tell you thanks so much for everything when it comes to the used deals thanks for tuning in brother thanks for the donation too i love doing this stuff and don't worry we've got some more like we're just getting through a heap of new stuff right now there's so much new stuff coming in and look it's work a lot of it is work i'm not going to turn it down um but we're getting through that and december is going to be packed we're going on a road trip too that's what it that's what it's looking like we're on a road trip deals hunting on the road in australia stay tuned for that you guys are going to love it because that's going to be coming in december so that's what's going to be happening don't worry we did the use parts hunt recently we're re-syncing to the used market look demand demand for used pcs right now is kind of tough like if you're doing especially if you're doing that mid-range stuff because i notice a lot of guys want to do the 500 to a thousand dollar flips that's a tight market that's a tough market dude um it's a tough market at the moment demands just tough um so we got a 1660 super 2060 or 2070. it all depends on the price bro i just get the 1660 super hold out is the amd ryzen 5 1600 af good for gaming yeah it's good enough it's decent make sure you get some 3200 megahertz memory 16 gigabytes do it in so uh black friday deals are track yeah they're going to be trash that's why i'm pulling up the um that's why i'm pulling up the pre deals where i think you can get some good deals so that's that's my opinion and i've sifted through some of these deals are really good like g203 15 bucks us like that's a really good deal on a mouse like that 30 bucks for a viper mini i'm pretty sure that's a good deal so there are some good deals there and the bx 55 inch if you're in the us oh man i wish i had that deal in australia i would have snapped that up instantly instagib if rocket jumped ninja is out there instagib i'm trying to use my pc as a heater what game do you recommend oh fur mark dude an r23 yeah load up fermark or even put a tweet out fur mark uh cinebench r23 at the same time if you're lucky you might even short your power supply out yeah ah seven we got up to almost 800 watts but we'll show it in the video and that's with a single gpu single cpu oh it's a hard g gibb ah rocket jumps corrected he is out there instagib that's it yeah okay i like jib like okay guys tell us in chat instagib or instagib what does it sound better what sounds better was i wrong or was i right let us know and let us know there's no one chat man my voice is gone too much live stream i don't know how guys live stream for like 10 hours straight i see some guys like they live stream like 10 hours straight how do they do it without their voice just going clearly not okay so people are just saying it doesn't yeah jib better but people said gib okay yeah okay rocket jump wins you win this one yeah gear for jiff what do you say jiff yeah i'm a jif guy yeah so you get for jeff i'm a jif guy instagib yeah gibson yeah people here james makes a good point you know gibson is a name right it's a last name gibson or is it a first name too i don't know gibson yeah gib fair enough yeah okay fair enough like look i can see this one you can see this one it's pronounced okay everyone's yeah jib will get uh there are some hey look for the guys out there representing the j i love you guys you represent me yeah yeah okay so the main director of quake champion says jib okay there it is yeah it's just a personal preference i mean it's one of those things like it's one of those things where i just don't like care enough you know what i mean like some people have a go at me like for saying some words and it's like yeah do i do i care enough to care and the answer is no so um yeah thank you spending your time streaming yeah it's been a while like actually it's been a while i've been meaning to just actually instead of just doing like videos and live streams talking about topics just hang out with you guys in chat that's one thing i wanted to do more because like i think you guys got a lot of good questions there's a lot of good topics and there's things that i feel like other tech channels don't even talk about like they don't even go there because they don't want to go there and it's like no these are kind of important topics right we've got stock levels prices flipping pcs resale value longevity all this stuff is relevant right and so if you guys have it in the comments i want to talk about because it's like it goes through my head man it goes through my head too and i want to talk about that stuff so uh would you consider buying a used original threadripper instead of a zeon ragey you're not going to like my answer no the old threadripper stuff meant i did not i wasn't a big fan of it like personally i know there's some other guys out there that love the old threadripper stuff but i would much rather go for lower core counts on the uh lower latency ryzen stuff then go for the higher end thread ripper and i feel like that's the biggest thing right are you doing a lot of actions per minute if you're finding yourself constantly clicking your mouse hitting keys this is the basic test we all bring it back down to basics if you find yourself hitting a lot of keys and clicking a lot of buttons on your mouse you're going to want to go for a lower latency setup as opposed to going with the thread ripper max core 64 cores you're going to want to sell go for something to slower latency so like that's where the ring bus like for instance the 10900k shouldn't be overlooked for that one factor now of course the new ryzen 5000 series stepped it up big time huge that stuff's snappy man 5800x is a beast uh 5900x beast 5950x that'd be my place because if you're going with those cpus you want to save time your productivity kind of guy so you want to save some time go for the like it's good so anyway should i skip a 1440p monitor or go straight to 4k yeah go straight to 4k tv gaming bro that's like that is the most biased answer i'll give you ever but because i'm using you you're asking it like you put it this way he's asking the guy who's using the 4k oled whether he should skip 1440p hey what answer did you think i was going to give you no it doesn't just get the 4k oled just get yeah doesn't even matter oled oled oled that's it doesn't even matter just get the 4k 120 hertz brother if you can other than that just go with the 144hz 1080p um and just save your money man because yeah like this is the problem and this is like i said this man i i want to play some games on this thing like it's so gorgeous um cyberpunk is gonna be hard when that drops man i'm gonna have some hard times like making content i think this is gonna be hard yeah uh will we ever see and this is a good question i love this one so will we ever see 27 inches as good as the lg oleds like we've got to see oled to be as good as oled oled is the tech that's giving you the pure colors like they're emitting pure color at that light source what you're seeing on these leds i just keep you guys watching me for a while you're like um here he goes again on the blue leds blue leds are garbage your eyes weren't meant to look at blue leds all day long stop looking at them you know i haven't worn my glasses in about oh ever since i got these outlet that's like my eyes thank me every day now for these oleds white leds well they're blue leds at the core white leds are just garbage now in terms of the burn-in lg have the screen shift they've also got the it'll if you're on the same image it'll lower the brightness down so what burn in is on an oled and i did a heap of research into this and it checks out essentially the pixels are getting to the oleds themselves the little organic light emitting diodes are getting too hot and they're burning in so what lg have done with their panels i don't know about other panels like other manufacturers but they're putting the tech to say okay here's the temperature limits as so if you if you put the tech on if you if you turn off the oled tech that saves your oled from burning then i don't know do you like burning that's the question but they've put in the tech that keeps the temperatures and if the temperatures hit a certain level it drops the brightness because it's all temperature related it literally is burning the oled's getting too hot and then it's burning into the the screen so or burning into itself and that's where you get the burn-in factor so what they've done to counteract that is to keep the brightness down by then controlling the brightness and the screen shift so um okay so i'm seeing some stuff from samsung that qled alleviates burning compared to oled so qled is uh they've got active qled which is i researched this ages ago active qled won't have burn-in because it's going to be not organic whether or not samsung's going to get active qled to the market i've got no idea i think what are they calling it the mini micro led or mini led okay but it was called when it was being developed active qled the ones you're getting is passive qled passive qled is okay it's sort of like it's yeah it's a little extra it's a little bonus on top of your white leds but it's still white leds are the core um active qled is the one that if it came out would be the one to get but in the meantime again when are these people releasing this stuff when are we going to get active q led i've got no idea because we've been waiting now for a a normal 24 inch oled gaming monitor that's never hit the market people have just abandoned it completely they're like no we don't want to go there and my guess is this is if i had a hazardous guess as to why 24-inch and 27-inch oleds aren't hitting the market is because of the pixel density this would just be hazarding a guess they're too closed up they're too cramped up those pixels so they're going to suffer burn in quicker than your 4k counterpart your beautiful amazing gorgeous 55 inch oleds that are out there dude i like i don't even me like i'm oh man i feel like i'm a chill now for lg yeah i'm a fan i'm an oled fanboy look if i'm guilty of being a fanboy of something it's oled and that's it only thing you're going to hold me to on the channel yeah not afraid to admit it either i'm an oled fanboy that's it so the thing is the pixel density i think is why you'll never see oled that for for the future for the short term future medium turn is to say can't control the pixels the brightness minus the density that's what i think if i had to look at it from okay what i'm seeing why is it out on 4k pixel density is a lot you know it's got a lot more room to breathe so essentially the bigger oled is the better like in terms of burning maybe that's it okay um we got some questions man you guys are just chatting away people are loving this chat we'll just chat away is ryzen 5 3600 better priced than ryzen 7 3700x yeah it should be okay all right there it is what do you think the best way to get a 30-70 will be this year hey you see you want to go grab the two 370s they're right near the door um yeah we'll show you guys i got some 37's i picked them up just bought them um and i think the best way to get a 30 70 is to not be a brand snob and i said that in the i didn't say it i put text over the the footage don't be a brand snob like everyone that messages me i've got guys messaging me personally like bro can you get a 30 80 tough or a 30 70 tough for me man you've got to get me one of these tough series and so like here it is here so this is the 30 70s there it is there then we got 70 30 70. i i'm buying these i'm not like i'm not some dude you know no you look at flex in my review samples or anything like that no they just bought them man and um i'm not a brand stump you notice they're colorful right colorful's in low demand in australia people want a zeus tough people want yeah people want evga that's what they want and if you're a brand snob if that's all you want you're probably going to be joining the queue of tens of thousands of other people who want the same card and are you going to notice the difference no like it's it's a 37 it's a gpu as long as they cool as long as it's not you know 3d that's what i've heard and i feel sorry like that's just what i've heard right i relay information but these guys are creditable people who tell me this information they've never been wrong and when they're saying look these are the temperatures i'm getting etc so i feel sorry for no 3d if they've hampered their cooler designs but they got to get on that man but uh colorful they're just they're a mid-range like they're they're gonna do the job out of the box especially if you undervolt it and a rocket jump asks how's the colorful 3070 it's um it's i haven't tried it yet can't tell you yet uh if it's like the 3080 it's gonna be absolutely fine the 3080 colorful eye game is like it's hovering in the 70s and this is in queensland ambient temperature and it's doing a great job so if that's anything to go by you should be good is it the one with the red ring yeah yeah that was the one yeah that was the one we flipped yeah bang out she goes in she comes out she goes that's uh there we go fellas and that's what i mean like if i was my if i was in chat i'd be donating to myself right now because that's what you do when you when you hustle when you hustle man you got to donate to yourself so all right um is club 3d and inno 3d brand i heard they were i heard they were the amd counterbar counterpart to inno3d on nvidia's side can't confirm though i cannot confirm i just heard that it's 2700x for 180 pound good that took me a while the euro's got the two lines through it i think um 3600 is better [Music] yeah i mean some of you guys are answering your own questions okay gigabyte 3080 yeah i meant should be fine i heard the giga i heard the gigabyte the eagles some people were i've tried the eagle actually because i got i got a loan sample and i got to do a video later it's backlogged i heard i tried all the gigabyte cards none of them cut out i did stress test them for quite a while i think if people having um graphics cards cut out the first thing they're gonna look at actually is their power supply and the reason being is if they've got a real shoddy mediocre power supply that's got some real high ripple that can be your gpu could be struggling by default so i would look at that first if you've got a like see the thing is a lot of tech reviewers have good power supplies they've all got like platinum whatever like 1000 watt pla these power supplies all the tech reviews myself included right these have extremely low ripple and that's really good for overclocking your gear so it's good for just testing stuff as well the stuff's gonna work as it's intended it's not going to miss a beat so do keep that in mind it all depends as well power supply is a big play when especially when you go into the high end stuff like a lot of the lower end stuff is meant to work on high ripple because they know the intended market and so yeah but do keep in mind your power supply is pretty important and so even though i use bangers around here on the channel from time to time i do check those bangers out don't worry i'm not just like i'm not just whacking in any random like okay this power supply is cutting out let's put it in a pc i'm not doing that but yeah you've got to check your power supply it is important um a3 a520 yeah i haven't really gotten into the a520 because they didn't introduce pcie 4.0 um i haven't really got into it rodney asked where is the tech yes sister grub video [Music] my memory is bad maybe is there something like check your sister she comes on videos sometimes in the parts hunts um discounted ryzen 3 000 or full price ryzen 5000 discounted ryzen that's my play at the moment discounted ryzen 3000 if you're just gaming um because yeah like again when we're looking at ryzen 5000 we're looking at high-end performance so you probably got the money to not care to ask the question a pc submerged in mineral oil good idea nope um hey i have a i5 10 400 with a 962 gigabyte what gpu should i get for 500 or less 30 70 or a 68 oh wait 6800 is over 500 isn't it yeah when do you think rx 6000 series will come back and stop oh that's a good one the rx 6000 let's talk about the star i've heard rumors i've heard big rumors that's it get the hands rubbing the hands i've heard the ongoing supply of rx 6000 is going to be bad at least until february next year that's what i've heard that's not too bad that's another three months okay so but the bottom line is is that you'll get your chances of getting a video card are going to be much better than getting chances of you getting one of them new amd cards and that's um that's harsh oh greg how you doing greg yeah i just went solo man i just went solo on this stream because we got we just got the deals the black friday deals and uh i mean my voice is soap oh how many do i get the testy blowout uh counter on this stream it's it's the worst it's ever been and i don't know why yeah ding ding ding it's terrible this stream i haven't done it like i usually know what's going it must have been um was i yelling in the last few days okay okay if i'm yelling then i do apologize but yeah i know to the guys here in the studio you know apologize i'm yelling at get back to work yo get the video done like just yelling at him like there's my voice that's why my voice is blowing out yeah yell at the young guy he's new he's gonna get some work done for me so yeah so it's um yeah greg uh greg's in chat and we got rocket jump ninja in chat too my two homeboys isn't that funny my two good friends they're in the chat but yeah in terms of uh content let's go back and we're gonna actually we'll close out the stream pretty soon because i do have to get back to doing some stuff there is a lot to do i've actually got to build up a 37 pc so do stay um do stay tuned we're going to have the flip up challenge that video is coming very soon i know you guys love that stuff so we're going to have the flip up challenge starting again and hopefully i can give away a 3080 pc due to that series due to that series i can give away a 3080 pc before christmas that's what i'm hoping don't hold me to it though i don't know guarantees there i'm going to guarantee that one because i've got to get another 30 80. that's the thing um but i want to give away a pc to you guys 30 80 pc out of my own pocket too hundred dollars and did you know what i mean like just because like people like oh man this series is so full of crap you're so full of crap brian's like yeah i wish you could just see it all happening locally i wish you could just i wish someone had a behind-the-scenes camera too they could just film some of the flip but it would be invasive right the people buying the stuff and like even if it's just like a photo yeah it's just it's awkward filming the subjects that's all i'm fine i'm fine being on camera like yeah i'm fine being on cam i'm absolutely fine being on camera like that's fine but like yeah kind of like there is that privacy thing there but um i think if we're flipping if we're flipping pcs the you start we started from 100 bucks and now we're at a 30 80 and we're not going to stop we're not going to stop because this is the thing when i get into value arguments with people it's like what are you guys are like i see guys arguing over 10 400 f's and 36 hundreds and they'll be spending days and i mean days arguing about two freaking cpus with a potential gap of 10 20 bucks and it's like why why not waste that time but not even no because you're wasting that time sorry why not spend that time flipping a pc making the making up the difference and then you don't even have to care and so that's what we're doing with the 100 flip up challenge we're showing people not to care so much about the little things but i know in this tech game so many people care about the little things and that's why when you looked at my 6800 xt recently when i did that against the 3080. i just said straight at the end of that video if you go and buy a 3080 or a 6800 xt at these prices either way you go you're not making a bad decision and so that's what the true essence of the hundred dollar flip up challenge is just that that's where it comes into play stop caring so much about the little things save that money from the hustling take your friends out look rocket jump ninja if you're out there head over tonight we'll go out to dinner i'll shout you bro how does that sound because look rocket jump this is my mouse that i'm using someone asked me in the chat again what mouse are you using ultralight 2. that was a gift from rocket jump my man i was so happy when he like this mouse is legit good this mouse is so good it's the best mouse i've used for the for the time being until something better comes out okay bring that over this is like i haven't even talked about this deal look at this i haven't even talked about this deal we got this i picked this up you know grab the keyboard too it's wireless yeah clean some dude out i cleaned [Music] i cleaned some dude out when um i didn't mention it in the flip up challenge but i cleaned some dude out when he because he messaged me after i got the deal he's like dude you want a k60 is this a k-63 bluetooth yeah wireless and i got this for 100 aussie two wireless bluetooth mic a mouse and a keyboard for 100 aussie bucks and i was like this is over the dog okay so it's wireless yeah so yeah i got two wi-fi i've got a mouse and keyboard together 100 bucks aussie so that'd be that 70 us yeah yeah man clean him up bro that's again he just said to me look he's like run you got cash bro yeah cash right now and he's like how much do you want for it 100 bucks i'm there bro that's just i'm there bro bro so that's that's what people look for are you going to do rtx 2060 builds for the flip up challenge i'm doing um i've tasted i i'm not gonna lie to you guys i've tasted a lot of success with the 30 80s the 30 80 people were like laughing at me when i said i'd sell the 3080 build for what i was intending to sell it for here's a kicker i've sold two for the price that i've intended to sell it for i saw one off the back of the other ad which i forgot to take down i was just lucky that i had a 3080 on hand so that's where my focus is going right now big time because on the lower end i sold the other two builds on the lower end but that's what i mean we've pulled all the funds together here for the next episode but on the lower end you know you're lucky to make a hundred bucks man flipping the pcs like you're lucky to do it it's hard right now it's a tough game and then on the higher end you're flipping these 37 p 30 70 30 80 pcs it was like christmas like every day christmas people just hungry ask for it man and so you got to go where the hunger is you've got to go where the hunger is don't forget that and you've got to be the shark so they're all the fish they're all the piranhas they're hungry for the 30s 70s and the 30 80s and then you're the shark coming boom big fish always eats little fish who said that was that qui-gon jinn or obi-wan that said that in episode one here's a question for chat was it obi-wan or is it qui-gon jinn that said sometimes the the bigger fish eats the little fish i'm gonna go i'm gonna go with cotton now i'm gonna go with qui-gon i'm gonna go qui-gon [Music] what do you reckon just google it episode one i'm going with qui-gon was it obi this is some this is emoji stuff for you guys this is emoji stuff there's always a bigger fish yeah i i was like because they were in the pod they'll they're only underwater thing and they're going through and i know one of them said i forgot which one it wasn't jar jar um so we got super chat okay i play in 12k uh you know what you're playing he's actually not being i thought he was joking at first but then he's like no 2160 would the rtx 3070 work good i have the rtx 2070 non-super it's 90 gpu low do suck ah truck gym truck sim driving uh that came out weird uh yeah the 30 70 worked good for the truck simulator i think it's a pretty easy to play game truck simulator is pretty easy the 30 70 should smash it if you're already doing pretty well on a 2070 that's a that's the easy answer there truck simulator is easy to run oh we've got power gpu in chat how you doing dude man power gpu we chat on uh twitter sometimes he's a cool dude man congrats he sells uh pc builds in the us really cool guy he's got some 3090s i see him flexing on twitter like yo i got the rtx 3090 it's like yeah the strix too that that is actually that's a pretty yeah that is a big flex um i'm still waiting for darth jarda to make dude darth right here this is what remains of him [Laughter] he got ripped apart because i wanted to use him in the studio because he was just taking up a desk and now this is what remains a darth jar jar so he's like scuffed you know he's chained from darth jar jar to scuffed jar jar now that's his that's what he is right now he's changed yeah all right anyway guys we're gonna close down the stream i am my energy i need to eat soon like stomach is the levels it's like critical mission critical when you and when i'm hungry i got no energy man like that's a little fun fact about tech yes i think well i think any humans not too energetic when they're hungry right it's like oh yeah i'm starving mad let's do this video no but i'm getting um i'm pretty um i'm pretty hungry right now so the mac has run on kfc run no dude no this is the thing like i said dude i i've been drinking green tea throughout this stream i'm on this new age tech yes stuff you know some people might think it's a bit hit it's eyes he's suggesting i go so to counteract that to get back to that crap state that i was in just so the green tea is doing so much more now the green tea is amazing i
