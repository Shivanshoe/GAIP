amd's fidelity fx super resolution aka fsr has 
been launched and today's video is going to be   on fsr in relation to dota 2. because dota 2 is 
a game if you guys didn't know i've been playing   dota 2 for a long time it's one of my favorite 
games in the list of games that i commonly   play on pc so when i saw this technology was 
available for it i just knew i had to test it out   with uh not just amd graphics 
cards but also against nvidia's   gravis cards as well where amd in their 
presentation made a big point that this technology   won't just give more fps to amd graphics cards but 
also in video graphics cards as well so what we're   gonna do now is show you guys some benchmark 
numbers straight away with an rx 570 at 1080p   as well as 1440p and also 4k now this is 
on max settings and in order to enable fsr   you have to lower the screen resolution 
under that of a hundred so it won't enable   if you've got your screen resolution set at 100 
but moving over now to the gtx 1660 ti this was   another car that we decided to throw into the 
mix here at 1080p and 1440p with this graphics   card we do get cpu bound at these resolutions 
pretty much like the rx 570 at 1080p and then   at 4k we do start to see a difference here but 
you'll notice that i've shown a few different   interesting outliers here and we'll point to the 
1440p graphs in particular where we decided to   throw in a 99 resolution scaling benchmark with 
nvidia's sharpen filter from their freestyle   game filter which you can enable in dota 2 and 
also the fsr which amd says it's an upscaling pass   as well as a sharpening pass and so how it 
exactly works at least from what i gather and   the information i've been told is it upscales in 
a linear and non-linear way so in other words if   i was to interpret it right it's perhaps dynamic 
resolution on amd's side which then depends on the   game developer to do their best implementation to 
get it to work however with those benchmarks aside   let's get on to the most important thing in my 
opinion that is the image quality comparison where   i'm going to pull up initially a 4k image for 
you guys and we're going to show the difference   between 50 screen resolution which is in the 
middle that one should be obvious but i'm actually   going to let you guys decide on which is left and 
which one is right so what i've done here is one   of these is fsr and one of these is sharpen from 
nvidia with 70 intensities and you guys can just   check this out and tell me in the comments which 
one you think is which and i'm not actually even   going to say the answer in this video because i 
did a poll on twitter and people were pretty much   undecided between the left and the right 
that's what the overall majority of the numbers   were saying so throughout this video i'm 
just going to throw up a heap of different   comparisons here for you guys not just at 
4k but also at 1080p towards the end of the   video but before we get on to that let's get 
a quick word in from today's video sponsor   if you're looking for a feature-packed 
motherboard that won't break the bank   then today's video sponsor asrock has you covered 
with the b550 riptide you get access to pcie 4.0   smart access memory lightning game ports which 
separate the keyboard and mouse on their own   controllers for no jitters and an asrock graphics 
card holder links in description below to find   out more and with all the benchmarks aside it's 
time to get on to the image quality comparison   in more depth now i'm going to be mainly focusing 
on 4k where we're going to go with two different   resolutions besides 100 and that is first of all 
50 percent where we're going to be looking at   the fsr turned on versus then fsr turned off at 
the same resolution and then on the nvidia card   turning on the sharpen filter with their game 
filter which is a part of their freestyle pack   which you can do all these different effects on 
but for what it's worth i've never really used   sharpening on any of my games and sharpening is 
one of those tools that you mainly use to fix   up an initially blurry image that's what the 
sharpening filter has always been intended for   if we look at traditionally what a sharpening 
mask does you grab a subject and essentially   it'll find the edges and it'll make them contrast 
more between the different pixels between them   hence making the illusion that the image is 
sharper so there's two ways essentially to get   a sharper image and that is either via more pixels 
which is straight up objective the more pixels you   have the more detail you're going to have it's 
a non-subjective thing it's a pure objective   end of story then you've got the second factor 
which actually is subjective and that's acutence   and when we talk about acuteness that involves 
essentially you can do different techniques   and so the most popular traditional technique 
of sharpening has been with what we know as   an unsharp mask this is the original where 
it'll essentially blur an image and then keep   the original image and then it will find the edges 
between the two and then it will sharpen up those   edges and so you can do this with different 
radiance points and you can also do it with   intensity of sharpening so essentially in this 
game what we're showing you here in my opinion   the fsr solution from amd is sharpening the image 
just like the game filter will sharpen the image   from a lower resolution and so when i was 
actually turning it on for the first time   i noticed the sharpening straight away because i 
play games on a 4k 55 inch oled so for me i think   it would be easier to discern differences between 
say a smaller 1080p monitor or whatnot and so when   i was looking at these i was like wow you could 
straight away notice the sharpening being applied   at 4k and so if you guys have a 4k tv i implore 
you guys to turn this up and put it on max detail   and see if you can spot the differences or 
see if you can notice the sharpening too so   when i started playing around the game filter 
settings i noticed that they've also got different   settings that you can use to try and tweak the 
sharpened image so then what i tried to do on   the nvidia side of things was make an image that 
looked pretty similar to the amd one and one thing   that is good about both these technologies is 
that it will look better in this game on dota 2   over the default resolution scale at that 
particular percentage for instance fifty percent   does look really blurry on the native fifty 
percent upscaled but then if we go to the fsr   or the nvidia sharpening uh tools we can notice 
that they both enhance the image especially at 50   if we move up to 75 percent then they also enhance 
the image and but you can notice especially versus   a hundred percent that we do get a little bit of 
over sharpening in my opinion on both sides of the   fence though some people might like this look it's 
up to you really and that's where the acuteness   part of image sharpness and what you like and the 
subjectivity really depends on the end user those   who saw those fps numbers earlier in the video 
you do lose performance on both fsr and the nvidia   game filter when you turn these settings on at 
the same percentage resolution upscale setting   so in other words 75 percent native versus 75 
fsr and also 75 uh game filter sharpen on you are   going to get a little bit less fps than that same 
unsharpened image however of course the sharpened   images are going to look better but what is worth 
with all the hype surrounding the fidelity fx   super resolution i would have to try more games 
before i can say okay it's a groundbreaking   technology because what i saw with dota 2 
and what i'm seeing here with this comparison   is it's really just a sharpening filter being 
applied as we can see when we apply the filter on   the nvidia side of things and we're getting in my 
opinion what looks like a pretty similar image and   we're also getting a very similar fps drop versus 
that native upscale percentage but i think when   it all comes down to it there's no magic bottle 
with a genie in it that's going to unlock you   incredible amounts of fps without taking a hit 
to image quality because what i saw with dota 2   was of course for me personally a hundred percent 
screen resolution pixel for pixel is the preferred   resolution and settings that i like to game on and 
so with that if i want to get more fps i'll just   lower the settings rather than turning on fsr 
or the game filters for sharpening that's just   my personal way when i play dota 2 but in terms of 
the other games that amd have released so far with   fsr i have no desire to play any of these games 
the upcoming games though far cry 6 and boulder's   gate 3 i think they're especially boulder's gate 
3 i'm waiting for them to release the other three   chapters over the first chapter because i 
absolutely love the beta and so when that   comes out if you guys want to see a comparison for 
boulder's gate 3 i can make that happen as well as   far cry 6. but if you guys enjoyed today's video 
then be sure to hit that like button for us and   also let us know in the comment section below most 
importantly what do you guys think of that earlier   comparison i did well i didn't show the name of 
which was the left and which was the right i'd   love to see if you guys can discern the difference 
of course youtube compression is going to affect   the images a little bit but it is at 4k you are 
going to get 40 megabits per second so it will   be reasonably good quality if you uh sample it at 
4k and watch it back and hopefully you'll at least   at the very least be able to tell the difference 
between the native unsharpened image versus the   other two sharpened up scaled images hopefully 
you'll be able to discern that difference and of   course drop it in the comments section below but 
when it comes down to fsr and what i think of it   i'm going to wait for a couple more of those 
games that i play personally i'm going to see   how fsr is implemented into them before i can make 
my final verdict but from what i'm seeing so far   is that at least in dota 2 which is played by a 
lot of people it's a very popular game i'm just   saying that more or less it's a sharpening filter 
and of course it's always a good thing when gamers   have more choice especially when it comes to 
settings and different fps numbers that they   can get but in terms of being a complete nvidia 
dlss killer i just think it's not that because   the game filter itself for me personally was 
producing similar results with similar fps   the one more thing that i will touch on that did 
worry me was fsr came out at the exact same time   that amd quietly dropped driver support for their 
r 200 and 300 and also their old 7000 series gcn   graphics cards and i feel like it's a little 
bit ironic that amd's releasing a technology   that's helping out lowering graphics cards and 
helping out people on older tech get more fps   but then they're dropping the support for older 
cards for newer titles that are going to be   released especially when cards like their rx 400 
and rx 500 series as well as their vega cards are   still gcn based and they also dropped the support 
for the fury cards as well and i know a few of you   guys are still gaming on the fury cards and i know 
personally that they can still game with very good   fps so it's a little bit worrisome to see that 
amd's dropped that driver support quietly and   then they've enabled things like fsr especially 
when one action contradicts the other and the gpu   pricing at the moment makes it so a lot of people 
on older cards just want to keep those older cards   and wait until prices come down and this whole 
crypto mining thing blows over so they can get   a newer upgrade without getting completely ripped 
off anyway guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed   this one do let us know your thoughts and 
opinions love reading them as always just   like this question of the day here which comes 
from mathisa patharana gd and they ask how can i   download windows 11 iso and you can download it by 
getting a link from someone sharing it and i said   this in a previous windows 11 video that i've been 
doing on the channel here i can't provide that   link otherwise the link will get taken down and 
then possibly the whole video that i've made on   windows 11 will get taken down too unfortunately 
but that being said i'm not going to intervene if   lovely folks in the comments section want to help 
you out hope that answers that question i'll catch   you guys in another tech video very soon if you've 
stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes   content be sure to hit that sub button ring that 
bell and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye yes
