the last week has been a roller coaster ride for me personally where i was filming the last video last month and as i was filming that video i started coming down with an illness and that illness unfortunately ended up being covert 19 where it put me out for a few days but then after that i also couldn't go out anywhere because i was still coming up as positive and today marks the day where i'm now covered 19 negative and i want nothing more than to go find some used pc parts so let's go jump in the tech yes mobile and go see what deals we can snag but also talk about the market and see how that's going in terms of prices where looks like gpu deals are starting to come up again so let's go hit them up are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 links in description below [Music] so the first deal we've picked up here is a gtx 1650 and they wanted 265 i think it was and i offered him 250 cash pickup they said sure i'll put up the usd pricing as well for you guys so the fact that these cards are coming now around msrp at least compared to what they were is a good thing because you're able to build a normal reasonably decent gaming pc for a decent price with the mark of this and this was just sitting up on marketplace it i asked them if anyone else had messaged them and i think someone else had offered like 200 so they were hoping for 250 so we came in at the right price and got the deal and so this marks the first deal of the month and i mean it's a it's not a great price for a 1650 but at the same time i need graphics cards and of course you guys know the nvidia graphics cards in gaming pcs they do sell really well so what we're going to do right now though is there's another deal that i did put an offer in for it was a gtx 970 where they wanted a hundred dollars and they said when it loads up games really heavily it starts having a few little problems so i offered him 80 dollars and they said yes so i'm gonna go pick up that right now where i honestly think like i can change the pace around maybe do some magic with it and try and get a full working gtx 970 for 80 aussie dollars so let's go get that right now [Music] and now our next deal is a gtx 970 and we got this for 80 aussie dollars and they took me in and they showed me it all up and running and i even ran a heaven benchmark quickly just to make sure there's nothing drastically wrong so what i do is when i get back i'm going to clean this all up give it some new thermal paste check the pads are all right and then obviously try and run it for a lot longer than a minute so i mean overall 80 aussie dollars for a 970 that's really good value so i'm really happy about this deal right here but what we're going to do right now is i've actually got to go to brisbane i have finally got my visa application ready for japan so i might be out of finally after over two it's been about two and a half years i'm gonna put in this visa application hopefully i get approved then i can go finally see my son so we're gonna go drop that visa application off right now then while we're in brisbane we're gonna go see les because even though he's kind of retired he is still doing use pc parts apparently he said he has some things for me so who knows let's continue on with this use pc part [Music] so we just finished up at leisure's and he still does have a few pc parts available this time around we picked up a heap of hard drives where we just did a lot bundle deal i think i got 10 two terabyte hard drives and also two one terabytes as well as three 500 gigabyte hard drives for 250 aussie dollars so that ended up being pretty good and then we had four monitors one of those being a 20 inch and three of those 22 inch and we got the 22 inches for 35 a pop and we got the 20 inch for 20 so 20 for 20. so ends up being probably 20 inches the better of the values but you always need monitors if you're doing budget gaming setup builds that you need to flip and then also the final deal he had was a lenovo second generation had an i3 2100 i wasn't really looking at the cpu at all but the motherboard and of course the power supply you can re-case those lenovo's really easy and so he's just said make an offer i said would you take 30 bucks for it so he said yes so we ended up scoring that for 30 aussie dollar redos and that means now we're free agent status where we've got to find some more deals but i have put down a heap of feelers on a few different parts i'm still waiting on responses from there was a gtx 1060 six gigabyte that's 250 aussie dollars i put down an offer of just 250 straight up on that because they go in gaming pcs i mean i recently sold a 1060 60 gigabyte gaming pc for around i think it was like 900 aussie dollars so they do command on the used market 10 66 gigabytes still a good price when they put them in gaming pcs so 250 for a 1060 is right about on my threshold then if it's a 1070 it's around about 350. so those two cards of course they're still very popular if you can find a 1060 or a 1070 on the used market it looks like it's a good deal then always snatch it up but what we're going to do right now is just i'm going to quickly just browse some deals on my phone see if anything extra pops up and also hopefully some people get back to me if not i'll just drive back to the coast and we'll check out what we've got so far [Music] so quickly browsing we found three potential deals two of which haven't gotten back to us yet one of those was a motherboard an a320 that wanted 48 but enough for a 30. then there was a 1060 they won 300 putting off of 250 then the last one this is looking like it's the best and they're just messaging me now the address they got two 1050s one a 1050 ti 4 gig the other a 10 52 gig and then they they had a price on a hundred on the 1050 and then on tv they had 200 and i just said to them look what's the best price you can do come pick it up right now cash for the both of them they said 200 and i'm like okay i'll come get two cup two gtx 1050s for 200 so that's an absolute snipe job let's go pick these up right now and that is the power of a quick mid driving session stop off on the side of the road hustle job [Music] [Music] and now we're back at the tech yes studio it's getting a little bit dark and we're bringing that energy for this month's parts hunt well last month's parts on i'm still going to do another parts hunt later this month but we ended up getting some really good deals especially that last gtx 1050 and ti combo that ended up working out really well what i'm going to do now though is just quickly test out those two graphics cards make sure they work and in terms of other deals the person with the a320 they did get back to us said they would accept 30 but they got back to me when i got back to the gold coast and they're back up at brisbane near les's place so that's you know i'm not going to drive all that way just to go get one budget motherboard because it's just not even going to be worth the gas and so what we've got now is a total here that ended up being really healthy this month around i mean we spent about four hundred dollars at leisure's place couple with the 250 for the 16 50 200 for the other graphics cards and then 80 for the gtx 970 so that leaves us with about 920 dollars total for the month of february so this month has been really good so far i'm actually going to call it a one day parts hunt just because i've got to get through a lot i've had a bit of a backlog and this sickness has pushed me back a little bit in terms of my timeline but there's also some other really good news and that is i do have contact now with less supplier so i am gonna see if i can source out some parts from him and i ask les is it okay and he's like yeah because les is really only doing a few things here and there he sort of dropped his uh rhythm down a lot in the last few months so last parts hunt i i thought he was you know he said he was going to quit the game but i knew he wouldn't quit the game he'd keep doing sort of he'd reduce his schedule down to what he knows is best and he's sort of left a lot of the desktop stuff which i absolutely love the gaming pc industry in terms of the desktop so i'm going to keep finding the best deals i can and hopefully we'll build up some really good budget price performance pcs with these uh deals that we got on the table here so that is the list of the parts that we have picked up this month do let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite deal of this month me personally it's looking like those two 1050 and ti that we snagged up in that combo definitely representing good value for money especially if you want to build out a budget gaming pc but going forward you guys might want to know okay what is the direction of pc parts prices a graphics card price is going to come down more and what we're seeing now is just a really uncertain situation there's the situation ukraine that's developing and that is unfortunately one that you kind of like as a youtuber and tech i kind of feel i don't know maybe guilty talking about just prices in this stuff when people over there are just having a really tough time and so it kind of sucks to see that news and what's going on there and and just the madness that it's unfolding it seems like ever since 2020 the world's just gone from one madness level to another and it just keeps getting worse and so what good are prices of anything if you can't even enjoy anything because of just the madness going on and but then again if we're looking at just the prices of pc parts generally when you have uncertainties uncertainties lead to higher prices because central banks then jump back on the printers they start printing more money and so we could see for instance the us the federal reserve and then biden says okay we're going to step in and then after that we start seeing the federal reserve start funding that and that then equals more inflation because money's again the printers are rolling back up so that's uh one outlook at the moment where it's just about and i've said this over the last year it's my motto and that is just i'm rolling with the punches day by day i'm just looking for good deals if good deals come up i'll snatch them up but what constitutes a good deal and that's just mainly looking at the price of something brand new on the shelves and looking at the performance you're getting there then looking at the used market and how much you can pick a particular card up for off the use market and then of course it's looking like these used cards especially the ones that i picked up today if you can get graphics cards for these prices you're going to be doing really well in my opinion so that's sort of my outlook is that i'm just it can go either way prices could come down even more but prices could definitely go up if there's more catalysts that cause the printers to roll back up again but as the current trajectory stands if interest rates go up and then the money becomes goes from easy to tight then you'll see uh graphics card prices come down even more so that's one of the things to look out for just be on your toes and of course if you really need a gaming pc right now and you really can't live without one then you might want to think about getting your stuff now because it is not a bad time some of the builds that i've been putting together some of the deals i've been getting in the last month have been actually pretty good and it's sort of starting to remind me of pre-covered sort of deals it's sort of that vibe is starting to come back even though it's a much different vibe so it's just again crazy crazy times but one thing i'm going to do is i'm going to stick to doing what i do best and that is getting the deals giving you guys the best content i can and i think that's all i really can do is try and maybe put a smile on some of you guys faces out there so basically if you guys can get a good deal on some of these gpus then go get yourself a good deal especially if you can't live without it but anyways with that aside i hope you enjoyed this month's parts hunt and with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from f and they ask are they limiting the number of pcie lanes because of the semiconductor shortage they're referring to amd and the 6500 xt where we did in a recent video where we looked at pci gen 2 versus 3 versus 4. and the 6500 xt it was in a league of bad compared to the other cards in that video and in the case of amd it wasn't really a semiconductor shortage so much as it was them using a laptop gpu and cutting costs as much as possible and then they didn't reconfigure that card at all for the desktop market and so you were left with four lanes and they decided for whatever reason that that would be good for most gamers especially ones who are on the entry level and it ended up just being a card that only really works with pci gen 4. if you've got a gen 4 platform which you're going to be paying more money for then you can utilize the budget card from amd but most people want to get that budget card and go with a budget setup and that's where they're going to come into some problems so hope that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye you
