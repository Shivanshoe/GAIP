today's video is going to outline a scary reality of what could happen if you purchase a large item internationally and some of the risks involved because this I'll express printer right here it's called the Sapphire probe from a company called to trees and is available for 320 USD shipped worldwide however the one we had here did have a few problems but the biggest thing that got me was the aftercare and the initial response I got which makes all the difference if you're buying an item like this and you come into potential problems however before we do go into this unit and all the things wrong with it or at least the problems I experienced I will roll the original intro and you guys can see just how excited I was because the items included in the build quality did appear first to be quite decent but after that of course we'll get into the nitty gritty right here on the desk we have a 3d printer from Aliexpress this is the sapphire pro 1 and this is coming from a seller that has two models they've got the sapphire pro 2 which has the glass side panels then they've got this one which is just open and so it'll 3d print right before your eyes and the seller actually contacted me and said would you like to take a look at this and I said to myself definitely yes is I've actually been in the market for a 3d printer and I was considering getting one from Audi but they sold out of them quite a while ago so what we're left with here is something that'll come in the mail and it's disassembled and it'll take about two hours at least to set up or at least that's what it took me and I had to use a guide from another youtuber called Rui Raptor and I'll put the link video in the description below because the instruction manuals were a little bit vague and they did leave out some crucial points in putting this thing together which after I watched the guide everything made sense and then things went a bit smoother though I will say getting this cable in the included plastic that they put here was extremely difficult and took quite a while so be prepared to have some patience went this thing together though what we got now here is the finished product and I'm going to try and print out some things that I would use when I'm building a PC as well as some things that I could use on my desk like maybe a headphone stand or a mouse bungee and see if this thing can really help you and what critiques I have for it at its current price point because it's coming in at a really solid price point as we said before 320 shipped internationally for a 3d printer with included filament is quite impressive though let's go through this review stop printing with it and see what the final verdict is [Music] so coming back now to the Sapphire Pro and spending it over a week with this thing I am severely frustrated and now I got two of my friends around who have their own 3d printers they've got quite some experience in dealing with them and they basically helped me or did most of work when it came to setting this thing up and also trying to diagnose the problems in the end it ended up being a role of bearing inside the unit itself that just gave out and it started chewing the filament as it was feeding it to the head and actually the funny thing was with this head the original filament here blocked up inside and that caused this a really bad problem initially where the error codes weren't translated to English we had to find a guy from Russia who had spent a lot of time with this thing and then he translated the codes into Russian and then from there we kind of got an idea what was going on so the first thing first with this unit the instruction manual is poorly written and it's actually wrong in some places for instance they don't even tell you to put the pad down underneath the flat panel here which is just completely missing so my friends who have built 3d printers before know that that was something that needed to be done and then after that there was ambiguity and how you set things up controllers and the ports on where those plugs should go we're all mislabeled and some instances though just completely wrong so basically you'll left to figure things out yourself and thankfully there were some guides on this printers where people have got them and figured things out and they've posted tutorials after we set everything up this is where we came into problems because the included filament that they included was absolute garbage and I mean Ida usually don't use words that sort of trash and bash things but this stuff here was so brittle and already blocked up the 3d printer to the point where it lasted a whole two minutes into the print and then it just crapped out and then we tried fixing this thing up and we came into a mammoth of problems where we had to undo everything completely and then clean everything out and then start again and then when we used a different filament one a decent quality we did manage to get a print out of this thing where it was satisfactory we got some cable homes because I wanted to show you guys some cool products you could 3d print for tech however we only got through one print and then the head again crapped out and so after that where when you will earn for a world of trouble we'll have to replace parts and also the head did manage to slightly leak at times even after we cleaned everything out and change the filament which my friends have now taken home because we've completely abandoned this 3d printer now however this is where things get even worse for this thing and that's when I message the customer support outlying all the issues which we're going to go over besides the faulty parts and their response was pretty much just to the likes of please deal with it yourself now this is a review unit that I'm doing for these guys as a review sample of art express I didn't pay for this they sent me in saying look check out our 3d printer and since I am a big fan of Aliexpress and buying parts off that I said sure thing this could be a really good solution for a lot of people in the world however them not responding in a positive way and saying hey do it yourself fix it yourself is really terrible if someone gets a 3d printer and they've paid three hundred and twenty US dollars for it and they get it and it's broken and this is how they deal with it they're saying hey we're not going to help you and our products faulty that to me is not good customer service and so it's at this point right here and this is pretty much the main reason why I wouldn't be recommending this unit is that simple aftercare if you're on a budget and you want to get a decent 3d printer and you bought this and it didn't work as intended you essentially got hosed and now I get it there's parts that come through and they're faulty sometimes I sell a PC in a week later it might have a problem but it's how you deal with it afterwards that makes all the difference the fact that this company's not like okay this parts of faulty will replace them for you really bothers me especially if someone's paying 320 USD and they're on a budget and they want to get a decent 3d printer and they get it and it doesn't work as intended though that aside we're going to run through the list of other critiquing points and that is the auto level system it only checks the left-hand side front to back and it should be checking the left right front back and center of the bed the touchscreen we go through the Z plus and Z minus --is don't work unless you unplug the Z limits which cable then there's the Z limit switch itself and had a crack in it so it couldn't tighten it at all and then there's the filament as we said before it's brittle it keeps snapping mid print it gums up right before we get to the hot end though the only other issue besides that and it wasn't a problem so much it was just rather a noise of the tray here moving up and down where it was letting off an ear piercing noise and we fix that by just simply grazing up the rod there with all those critiquing points out of the way and my negative experience with this 3d printer I will say that the build quality on it and most the parts feel of really good quality does feel well-made once you assemble it though I would describe it quite simply as a gamble and are you willing to take that gamble say for instance if a 3d printer is similar I guess class is available in your area if the double the price is that worth it that gamble because if I got one of these things in the future and I knew more about 3d printers and I knew for example how to change a metal figure which I don't and I also knew how to completely make this head work a hundred percent even after its episode with this bad filament then I might give it a shot so basically what I'm gonna be doing now with this 3d printer is sidelining it and then when someone who I know comes along who knows how to fix all these things I'll just pay him a little bit of money and we'll get this printer running a hundred percent there was it stands with this unit especially if you are new to the world of 3d printing then I would quite simply avoid this unit I don't think it's intended for your first 3d printer and I feel like it needs to be handled by someone who knows how to mod them and knows a little bit more about 3d printing where they can get everything perfect from the get-go because what we got here is a unit that I feel needs to be fixed up and repaired and I don't know how to repair 3d printers so I'm gonna sideline this thing until I know someone locally who can fix it up for me and then maybe I'll have a functioning 3d printer here in the tech yes studio so basically in a nutshell if you are a beginner I would advise against this thing if you're an expert and you feel like it's got value even after all the faults and if you've got it it had potential fault and you're still willing to take the gamble then by all means be my guest though without aside we're gonna move on to the question of the day now which comes from miss Patek Bert Hole and they asked is spraying the equivalent of wd-40 all over the computer a good thing and the thing about the wd-40 is I just call it that I use a multi-purpose spray from super cheap auto costs around $4 a can and it's really good stuff it gives the computer a new-look shine but also it does the double job of cleaning parts a lot of the time for instance when I spray this on the socket and LGA socket I was able to clean off a bit of thermal paste in the process and then even after I bent the pins back because what happened with this motherboard I got in is it wasn't booting properly it was having problems and then I've been a pin back I'm still having problems but then I sprayed the multi-purpose spray on there and clean the pins up put the CPU in and the board was working again so that's what that can do not only can it make your price look better but it can also bring products back from the brink and make them usable again so I love this stuff don't terms are spraying it on live electronics the formulas I've used in the past both in Japan and Australia haven't presented any problems that's the CRC 556 and also wd-40 and AHS and also a multipurpose spray in AHS though that being said I would advise against spraying it on live electronics but for me personally I've only ever had win after win after win there are no negatives at all with this multigo spray except of course the $4 a can which one can last me a lot of different builds anyway guys that's it for today's video of the Aliexpress 3d printer if you enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button for us if you have any questions or
