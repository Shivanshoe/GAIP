live we should be live just push it out there push out the live then we're live and it's the wild west welcome back to attack yes city live stream hope you're all doing well whichever corner of the world you're at today we've got a big one we're talking about the 6700 xt it's launched out into the wild we've got amd's official statement before it came out so we're going to analyze this on the live for you guys so make sure you hit and let us know in chat then you're feeling me hopefully the just got to let everything go normal so like i turned on slow mo this time so you guys are requesting that we do slow-mo and uh that way it stops people spamming mushrooms in chat so hopefully we don't have a continuance of mushrooms and hearts in chat getting spammed i mean the hearts is okay you guys can spam the hearts in chat but uh just keep it's once every three seconds now so is it a premiere no this is a live stream i can chat with you guys ask questions i'm seeing them i'm chatting don't worry this isn't a premiere premiere is where i've made the video and just like i don't know it's fun to interact especially like on a 6700 xt launch usually on uh i think from here on in on the channel i'm gonna be doing uh like product launches with premieres like cpu and gpu launches we'll do that with premiere that way we can discuss what's going on while we're watching that video but this is a live stream this is a live stream so join in chat have a bit of fun relax and uh we'll answer this first question quickly before we get on to the video and that is a is a 30 60 for 800 a good deal is that 800 us or 800 aussie at the moment in australia 800 aussie isn't that bad for a 30-60 i mean judging from all the other pricing i'm seeing out here fifteen hundred dollars for a 30-70 it's not too bad but the problem is is that we'll talk about this a bit later with that 30-60 pricing and uh what happened right this is this is what happened but we'll get onto the 6700 xt first where we'll read out what amd said here this is what this is the official statement i got before it launched so amd here they hear and understand the frustration from gamers right now due to the unexpectedly strong global demand for graphics cards let's be honest we can just take this first sentence and say due to crypto miners a graphics card supply is completely messed up right now or demand demand for graphics card supplies completely messed up right now and the supply is of course uh one of those pretty consistent thing and with the amd uh radeon 6700 xt launch we are on track now we gotta like these words here like we're going to point out some of these words typical marketing stuff like we are on track to have significantly more gpus available for sale at launch so you can just say look we're gonna address as much as we can the supply issue we're just gonna keep pumping out cards but uh we continue to take additional steps to address the demand we see from the community we're all then there's this next sentence here like how are you doing that we continue to take additional steps like what steps that that's the thing right there what steps are we taking here because at the moment it's it's like literally and as people pointed out the thumbnail is the wild west out here for graphics cards literally the wild west and uh we are also refreshing stock of both amd radeon rx 6000 series graphics cards and amd ryzen 5000 series processors on amd.com on a weekly basis giving gamers enthusiasts a direct option to purchase the latest ryzen cpus and radon gpus at the suggested detail and retail price so i will admit this this last thing here what they're doing is good right they got their own website and they're saying look these are our uh msrps or now they're calling them suggested retail prices we're giving the public these prices that we promised on our website so there's one good thing that's come out of this statement but they should at least give us some realistic stock levels because what i heard with australian we'll go look at the realism like the wild west of this situation right we'll pull down this statement right here and we'll straight away we got an image i pulled this from the forum right pulled this image straight from the forum i was on a facebook forum and someone just went to micro center and took a picture of the graphics card prices and you see there like if we zoom in there 480 usd for the the reference models now my reply to the dude was go get those 480s asap bro they're gonna be gone like before i'm sure straight after he put the phone down after taking the picture someone else was already ordering those two reference models because they would have been gone because immediately next to it is the overpriced mecca mech it's not even the mecco c from what i can see here it's just the mech and it's going for 756 dollars as advertised and then immediately above that we've got the top going for 800 us that's right a 6700 xt is more than an rtx 3080 so they should also just put a picture of a horse on the the top left here and just say welcome to the wild west folks here is your graphics card and then we got the mech over here another mech i'm guessing this is the mecco c yeah oc edition 775 bucks so as if the uh so as if the 755 wasn't enough cop off another 20 bucks for the oc on an already uh 300 over the msrp so that is what's going on right here all these custom models are coming in at just straight if we go to the top shelf it's now 800 plus power color 830 bucks as advertised a zeus rog 820 dollars for a 6700 xt something that performs a little bit better than a 3060 ti and also a zip zoolander thanks for the three dollar dono we're we are on track don't worry guys i hear you guys with this gpu stuff so what i really want we're going to go back to this statement right here we'll look at the aussie pricing too because that's that shows it an even more interesting picture but we'll go back to this statement here what i want amd to do is to address this right here this in one picture address this right here what is going on why is it 480 dollars for a reference model which is fairly priced it's good but then you've got this right beside it three hundred dollars more please addre like this is the answer we need not not uh we are on track [Music] yeah i mean i i can see you guys are on track but what about the partners that you sell in these cars these these uh these nodes too like the gpu die what about those guys are they on track to rip people off that's what that's what i think we all want to know are they on track to fleece to fleece the public that's what we've got to know that's what i just want to know address this what is going on here because i'm pretty sure i've got a good understanding of what is going on and that is that there's there's supplied the distribution the distributors and whatever networks and how they run things they've just decided to jack up all the prices and from what i can tell like a lot of these guys are in on it not gonna make any names but so there it is on track fellas on track but let's move over to newegg now here we can see the reality of this out of stock out of stock out of stock even the overpriced stuff is out of stock 800 bucks a zeus tough 6700 xt out of stock xfx wow hey xfx didn't like blatantly rip people off that's actually pretty cool good stuff xfx they're like the only brand that didn't pull a a quick one and asrock too good stuff asrock there's a challenger there but it's out of stock it's got doesn't it does these prices even mean anything when they're all out of stock i mean yeah i like i like confirmed sk's comment there so the aibs are drinking champagne right now they cannot hear you guys they cannot hear you so uh there's the out of stock situation so the reference cards are coming in and i gotta say the reference card i'm doing the review tomorrow like that'll be dropping on the channel tomorrow but i wanted to wait before i did one of these 6 700 xt's just to get the real picture out here and what's going on but uh yeah the reference card for what it's worth it's a at 480 usd in this current in climate if you can get one go get one asap it's a good buy at that price um but yeah 800 no way i wouldn't pay 800 usd for a 6700 xt it's like that's coming in more expensive than a 2080 super it shouldn't the rules of tech i mean shouldn't the rules state that as time goes on we get more price performance not less but anyway i mean and then it's supposedly supposedly inflation's not that bad but we'll move on to the aussie pricing but we'll get a quick word from our sponsors here we've got the elgato wave 3 now become amazon's choice that's right amazon has decided this microsoft microsoft microphone because you're probably using it on windows 10 is the choice so 146 bucks great greater condenser mic and i really like this one and then we got std keys and here's the thing i was going to tell you guys about these cd keys these are getting cheaper by the day these cd keys right here like you're looking at the pressure like brian the price is staying the same but not if you think about the inflation if the inflation keeps going up these keys are getting cheaper by the day and you can use a bf tyc code there and you can lock that in and get it for 12 bucks so 12 u.s get your windows 10 activated none of these keys get deactivated and uh they're good to go so i'll put the links for both these sponsors in the description below let's get back here to the pricing right now and what's unfolded in australia so this isn't a retailer called umart they're one of the biggest in australia they just got out of stock across the board who knows if they even got any in because i spoke to some retailers locally here on the 6700 xt's and they were telling me yeah we don't even know the price like they couldn't even get a pricing list meaning that there was no stock for the 6700 xt's in australia except for pc case gear and they're at like low and behold they're out of stock for all the reference cards at 709 aussie dollars if someone actually got one of those for that price that's really good so that's that's good but sold out i went on last night on launch these things were instantly sold out except this right here lo and behold there's the mech there's our little friend the msi mecco c coming up for a thousand and eighty aussie dollars and that's still in stock this one right here another msi one eleven hundred and thirty aussie dollars as a sapphire pulse a thousand bucks so i mean i'm just waiting for one of these guys what i really want to see is one of these ah there's the one i reviewed man twelve hundred and fifty dollars aussie oh man don't buy it at this price don't do not buy this car to 1249 aussie dollars sorry yeah i mean just jump in the video and jump in with a chance on the giveaway but we got here michael shelby a two dollar donut thanks brother i was the first loser at micro center today oh man that would like so you got in there you saw someone else taking out a graphics card and they got a reference card for 480 that would sting a little bit my man i do feel for you there then we got a mexi man and cheese i was able to grab a 30-60 ti at msrp on launch day i feel like a ja for being disappointed i could not get the 30 80. anyway i love your channel you shouldn't be disappointed at all brother you got a uh getting any 3060 ti 3070 or 3080 at msrp is an absolute victory even getting the 3090 at uh msrp was a victory believe it or not the overpriced 3090. now that's even more overpriced so there there we go and designs by ifr my man is in chat what's going on corey how you doing brother he's uh he built up synthetic sewer that was a custom build that we did and my man is bringing the custom pcs to you guys and he does some great work but i mean even he's probably starting to feel the sting he's like oh wouldn't mind getting a gpu for doing a custom no actually guys today we're just going to do a how to how you can build up a water cooling build [Laughter] anyway you can go down here like last thing i got to say about pc case gear is this looks actually pretty good i checked the website the gamers bundle here actually looks decent you can get the motherboard a 5600 x the b550 aorus pro and the reference 6700xt for 40 14 45 at night so if you're building a new pc this isn't too bad and that's in stock but i mean obviously they're probably reserving these graphics cards because they want to sell motherboards and cpus which does point towards the demand for the other products in the tech scene being much less in demand than graphics cards so graphics cards i'm guessing graphics cards are getting to the point where they're starting to distort the actual demand for things like cpus ddr4 memory and ssds so there it is right there that's what's going on with this graphics card pricing situation now and uh yeah check back later it's out of stock you guys are saying it in the comments so uh pierre plays hello check your city it's gear seekers oh drunk how you doing dude welcome to the live stream next part of news is we're going to talk about this dude like this is going to segue into the rt the rtx 3060 right what we saw and now don't make no mistake we'll go to the big screen here make no mistake this demand is all coming from crypto all of it like pretty much all this extra demand that you're seeing is coming from crypto and it's coming in a big way and don't let anyone tell you otherwise like yes initially there was that massive demand for 30 80s but that was because that was a hot product giving big gains over the previous generation it was what people were really waiting for but then as time went on we saw the 30 60 ti 37 it just snapped up and it was ridiculous right as miners started to call catch on that hey i could make money by just buying a card putting into my computer and clicking play they started to do that that's what they started to do so miners started to buy these cards up in droves and started to really distort the pricing of graphics cards now we saw this at least in australia i saw this as soon as that hashrate limiter got unlocked with that accidental driver from nvidia accident um with that driver we saw the 3060s the under 800 aussie dollar 3060s all got sold out across the board that happened within a day and the reason that happened was now the crypto miners could mine for more money that was worth their money at 700 at 770 dollars for the i think was the plry pl why is it pny pny 3060 pny yeah pny 3060. so we saw that in stock it's been in stock for a couple of weeks and then sure enough the mining limiter gets removed it's out of stock what more proof do we need that this is just a crypto bubble that's affecting the gpu prices but speaking of what this one's i don't even know like what what to look at this one here so uh this one here is a bit of a funny one so nvidia is releasing the cmp lineup this is their graphics cards that miners want to get their hands on right apparently so i i think and guys thanks for the questions too we will get on to uh questions we'll just get through these um we'll get on to these questions uh after we get these there's just two articles pretty easy and i'll give you guys a cool solution coming up as well but nvidia's released they're cmp 30hx mining gpus now apparently they're just pretty much a 1660 super so like honestly who is going to want to buy this this is why my gut reaction is who's going to want to buy this card at 723 bucks now i know it's in dubai i think dubai have higher prices on graphics cards than a lot of other people but who on in their right mind is going to want to buy a 38 exit around these prices and even then why would you buy it over a 1660 super because when crypto goes bossed you can then sell the 1660 super to gamers you can't sell you can't sell these 38 x's to anyone after crypto goes bust this isn't a this isn't gonna like i'm sorry nvidia you've got to offer much better value on these cmp cards if this is what they're bringing this is really not bringing any value to miners at least from what i can see the miners are just going to keep snapping up even the 30 60s and uh you just even the 6700 xt's they'll snap them up over this because it's 700 us you can get uh 40 something mega hashes on the 6700 xt as opposed to this which apparently gets around 25 but i think it gets around 28 once you tune it so the 30 hx the cmp lineup it looks like it's totally useless right now yeah that's what i mean you guys in the comments people like people you guys understand that the the mining hash rates on this thing it's gonna be totally useless to miners and they're gonna keep on buying up the gaming graphics cards so i mean maybe maybe the best thing nvidia can do is sort of just sell refurbs to the mining community where like hey guys here's a card that's sort of like it it's not really fit for gaming but we've lowered the clock speeds and the memory speeds and uh and we're going to give it to you at a big discount and then they'll buy it up because miners really only care about one thing and that's profit make no mistake so yeah i don't think any miner is going to be buying this thing up at these prices and especially since the last time too i think this is another catalyst going on and the problem with these cmp launches in the lineup here is that yeah like mark smith exactly it's a cm cmd or cmp a30x is future landfill material exactly i mean maybe someone will melt it down for the uh for the metals on it but that's about it and after that they'll just throw the pcb in the land and it'll become landfill that's about it so anyway what they learned from the last um the last crypto bubble which this has happened before right 2017 2018 all over again but what happened then was nvidia released a p106 now i think from last time a lot of those guys that got stuck in the mining craze i was stuck in the last mining craze this is probably why you guys might be wondering damn how does brian know about mining like how are you kind of well-versed for a guy that uh is a gamer how are you well-versed in the land of mining i did like it's on my channel i made videos where in 2017 2018 i was partaking in the whole mining thing i was going into that boom but unbeknownst to me i got into it and i didn't realize how much damage it was doing to the market in general it was it was just crazy like i at the end of the day i just don't really believe in the gpu mining side like the crypto sure there's great arguments for cryptocurrencies but in terms of mining cryptocurrencies on a gpu i just think there's better solutions out there and i've said those in the past as well there's much better solutions out there and i think now especially being that we're going through a global pandemic this is the thing we're going through this global pandemic i think it's just i i honestly think it's a it's pretty just terrible thing that we did people just can't get a gaming graphics card because they can't go outside anyway they've got to stay inside and they can't game because they can't get a graphics card or at least they can't afford one because the prices are too high so this is uh one of those things where it's just um yeah i only just got here what are we doing uh joe blogs yeah pretty much man that's exactly what we're doing joe blogs pretty much but uh we're just i'm sort of explaining the history of how i got into mining and then why i sort of quit after 2018 and i haven't really been a big advocate of mining this time around even though uh this time around like you know and that's how i understand all the mining stuff and i'm able to basically compute all that into what's going to happen here with things like this and i'm telling you now like this i'm not really gonna complain about the pricing the pricing is good actually on this card right here if miners can go get ripped off for 723 bucks that's actually an amazing thing joe blogs so i'd love to see that happen um yeah so and then they can sort of leave the uh leave the other cards alone but i will say like when nvidia did that hash rating limiter that was working like that was the solution right there that was starting to work so nvidia like there was your solution so if you do really care about the gaming community do what you're doing with that thing that was working and there was stock for gamers so in stock 3060 because the gamer only need one's gravis guard a lot of miners are going to buy out five plus ten twenty it's not even unusual to see even guys um with their houses buy up forty so that's a lot of gravis guys that's forty people who can't play games anymore so the scale of it is that even though there's only say a percentage of the population there's only five percent of miners those five percent can literally you times them by 20 if the average miner has 20 cards that's they're pretty much doubling the demand for graphics cards so that's how it kind of like how you see it at the moment and if we go to aliexpress aliexpress is crazy too but in the meantime there is a little solution here like there's another little solution that popped up actually the uh use he's video edit around here he sort of suggested this one to us this is the 2200g and like look this is something that'll get you through a hundred bucks and you don't need to go out and buy a graphics card at them at the meantime so this is a great little solution 2200g i mean it's 100 bucks i'll actually put the link after the live streams done this is actually good right now like in all fairness so it's something that people aren't really focused on but if you're building a new pc just grab yourself an a320 get yourself one of these for 100 bucks and two eight gigabyte sticks of ddr4 memory and you'll be having a decent time you'll be able to play some games with your friends and you won't send you broke so that's probably one of the best solutions right now considering what's going on in the us if we look at this price right here for a hundred dollars and then we move over say to uh a 2200 g on amazon the pricing is 185 dollars so you can kind of see people are just like amazon amazon please i need to get it from amazon and i mean sure it's going to take a little while to get it in shipping but um it's you're saving like 85 bucks there that's a pretty good saving so usually amazon comes in cheaper than aliexpress but it looks like aliexpress has been uh going a little bit good on some of the prices so again the pandemics here but you can look through and sort of find some ways to circumvent it because miners aren't going to be buying up apus that's the bottom line i mean if they do then the profitability has really gone stupid but i think what we're seeing now is actually a drop in profitability especially after linus did a dedicated video on his channel towards nice hash i think that will reduce the um the mining profitability where he literally advertised to the world hey go mine cryptocurrency so all the people currently mining would have probably seen a drop in their profitability but i think honestly the end of hopefully they bring in some of the more acidic miners to ethereum and apparently there's this big change i'm being told there's a big change coming for ethereum that could send profits down so make no mistake if miners start getting nervous about their future profits and even if they take a big hit for that where say for instance there i know like say for instance in australia maybe some parts of the us if miners start feeling like their profitability is not so much anymore you could start to see the graphics cards getting preemptively sold on the market at little cheaper cheaper and cheaper prices so i do think we're at the peak of it right now i do think right now as i'm talking on this live stream we're seeing the worst of this graphics card demand crisis because i don't think it's really like people are saying it's a shortage i don't think it's really a shortage as opposed to it being um i don't think it's a shortage as opposed to it being so much a demand problem so that's what's going on now of course we've got at the center of that uh the world government's printing off ridiculous amounts of money but let's go to uh we'll brighten up your day a little bit guys with some i kind of i guess it's better news maybe as the 11th gen products are coming out i mean not that it's great news i mean you guys like have learned recently i learned the hard way yet again that none of these companies care about you let's not forget that uh intel nvidia and amd they don't care about you they just care about your money that's like i i got i got the reality shock when for me it was a reality shock when that was the the mining algorithm the accidental driver release you know and i i told the local reps here i said look guys i was disappointed like i went to bat for you guys with that video right i thought hey this is a good thing it can help out gamers the other day my loyalty is towards the gamer it's towards you guys the viewers but i told him video i said to the local rep yeah i was like yeah man i'm disappointed like i just i made a video i thought this was a good idea and then it pretty much just you know i'm left with a knife hanging out on my back uh but anyway yeah we got here joshua hall two dollars hey brian from wisconsin in the usa we'll try a u.s accent thanks for the two dollars brother we'll try a us accent later on in the stream so make sure you stay tuned for that but we got here intel's 11th gen lineup and what they're promising here is um the fcpus this is the biggest thing and i asked intel about this i also asked intel a few um i also asked intel a few other things as well so it was about sort of like early ndas but we'll keep that off the stream but they said to me look that the f-series cpus this time around are being launched on day one and you can see here the memory support will be up to 3200 megahertz now i'm being told that the 3200 megahertz is on a six layer pcb so it can still be on if they release a h510 i think they have released h510 like i gotta check the motherboard thing anyway but the the six layer pcbs will support 3200 megahertz and then four layer pcbs will support 29.33 so that's why you see those two differences there in the memory to clear that up but the f cpus will be released on day one which i'm looking forward to the most actually being someone who you know if you guys see the 100 flip up challenge you'll know that i am kind of a big advocate of the f series cpus right now because of the value they're bringing i mean even if we go on amazon here if you can somehow magically pick up a graphics card 270 bucks i think honestly though if you look at 278 this is that sort of level where i would pay an extra 8.70 for 75 cents i'd pay that for the igpu that's kind of to me the igpu maxes out at around 15 to 20 dollars premium so being at eight dollars i would actually pick a uh pick up the 10700 f at both these prices here i mean sorry the 10700 not the f over the 10 700 f but make no mistake both these prices are extremely good even with the 11700 f around the corner uh now the archangel two dollars uh 6800 gigabyte for 1109 aud worth it uh that's it's right on that level man like it's right on that level i'd say flip a coin and it depends on how bad you want a game like if you've got a save for instance you've got like an rtx 2060 or something or you've got a um say for instance you've got a gtx 1080 right now i'd actually just hold out uh that'd be my that'd be my advice but for 1200 if you like if you're desperate to play games you're not getting ripped off as much as uh other cards that i'm seeing out there being priced so i mean right now if we look at a 30 70 right now fourteen hundred dollars that's the cheapest you can get them for fourteen hundred aussie dollars so uh 11.99 is not too bad the six the six uh 6800 should beat it a little bit so there you go but that's what i mean right now the whole graphics card lineup is all out of control because uh of all this just craziness happening with crypto so anyway we'll get back quickly to here so 11th gen now they're releasing also the 11900f and also the um 11700f those are the two that i'm looking at but you're probably wondering straight away like you're like oh brian eight core 16 threats what is going on here now i actually asked intel directly about this what's going on this just looks like one of the dumbest things i've seen but then they said there was a big difference in there so uh 20 ganga din thanks for the donation brother you didn't ask any questions but thank you so much for the donut really helps out the tech yes man doing these live streams and also keeping the content coming towards you and we got here the biggest difference that uh is the gear ratio so this here the 10 the 11 900k and also well the i9s in general the i9s are going to have a one-to-one gear ratio meaning if you put your memory up to 3200 megahertz then the uh the clock is going to be 3200 megahertz as well uh the 11700 has a gear ratio of one to two so if you have your uh memory speed of 3200 megahertz then the i think it's the ring is it the ring is that then 1600 megahertz so it's half so it's half the gear on the um memory as opposed to the controller so that's the difference between the i7 and the i9 this time around but whether that's worth a 100 like even if we look at the f's here whether that's worth a 120 dollar premium is yet to be seen i honestly think the um like when you if you ask me straight up looking at these before we even get into it uh i've got the 11 900k but i don't have any other cpu and i actually asked himself if i could get the f cpus in because i think they're going to be the value champions that i'd love to review even that over that over the 11 900k but i think this by looking at this the 11400f is going to be the great the best value for money easily for the game 157 us and i think intel will hit around those msrps and that's what we saw with the uh 10 400 f like that came out and that was kind of really good value uh gunga din another 20 thanks brother thanks so much for another 20 donation man there's no question or no text this time around again um yeah if you've got a question brother be sure to ask it but we got the 10 400 f was coming now it's coming under that price as opposed to us looking at the ryzen 5 3600 or even yeah i mean the 3600 was its main competitor that's coming in it's at 245 so i think there was that i mean you're paying a tax here an amd tax of like pretty much a hundred dollars because they're virtually the same cpus in terms of gaming performance i mean if you want to go down to uh say the avenue of saying all right well one's a little bit better productivity sure one's got a better upgrade sure like the upgrade path kind of gets a little bit uh sort of pushed out into the fray when these cpus are much more expensive to begin with so especially the 5900x i heard they're like 5900x and 5950x they're in pretty short supply so i mean if you want the upgrade path just understand that you may have to pay another um another like six hundred dollars uh ganga has a question under his q ah okay he's got a question sorry man yeah andre is done okay so what would you do with an i5 8500 got one free from work uh i mean what would i do i would uh i'd put it in a motherboard and uh make a pc and then flip it that's what i do so and how much could you flip an i5 8500 for i mean depends right in australia you could probably get around like 800 900 for it with a decent gpu say for instance like a 1660 super you probably get a thousand bucks for that so it's just of course finding the gpu that's the problem but that's a good cpu to chuck in a um sub 1000 aussie dollar pc but if you're in the us maybe i don't see now with all this crypto stuff going on i have no idea about the us market and i won't know about the us market until i take a trip there and i can gauge what's gone um what's happened since i was last there in 2019. when i was there in 2019 it was pretty much the demand and the pricing on the pcs was pretty much relational to the uh purchasing power parity of the dollar so like if i when i was lastly in the states you know one aud to one aussie dollar right we've got about a 30 mark up on our pcs like that was around i think the aussie dollar was even around the same time price when i was there in the us back in 2019 for ces that was my guide i don't think that's the case anymore because i'm seeing rtx 3000 cards for instance going if we look at a 3070 that's going for 1500 usd in australia they're going for 1400 from the retailer so the pricing is completely messed up right now in the us so i can't give you an idea of how the u.s pricing in the in the the market there is because i just don't know and that's what i was saying in the previous review i'd love to know some of the guys out there some of the boys like danny from um nerd on a budget zach's tech chef some of those guys what they what sort of they can make a market update that's a request for me if these guys can make a market update video telling us about the us and how it's changed over the last couple of years just from a street perspective buying and selling uh but we've got e dot e dot r dot o thanks for the ten dollars enjoying the content thank you brother i hope you are i've been uh i came off my high uh hiatus would it be i i had a break i had a break mentally i was relaxing but now it's time to get back to it you guys need the yes man to tell you what's going on well maybe you of course probably don't but i'm hoping that you do so that we can get to the real story the real news we're not going to live in fairyland here we're not living in fairy tale land we're giving you guys the street view what can you do and that's why we're trying to point to some options even in this live stream here today but we've got j von rowe thanks for the 5 donation how do i send you this rampage to extreme mobo and others that i cannot get to post but they all show signs of life i also want to send you ddr3 i'll put my po box uh in the description below even yusuf can uh hook you up that pr um po box fire 546 narang it's a queensland we'll chuck that in the in the description for you brother but yeah cheers for that we can put that on can yes fix it episode we've actually got another kenya's fixit episode uh brewing up right now and we got salty doctor a hundred i don't know what is that the currency symbol is that i don't know the currency symbol on that one uh i can just check that okay to usd is it indian ruby oh it's india ruby thanks for the one dollar brother thanks for the 1.38 donut i joined vodafone and nbn support and i was hoping that i would get a chance to speak with you love all your videos oh thanks man is that like you joined the did you because you're donating an indian rupee did you join our nbn support from india that's that'd be pretty cool yeah i mean look i'll give the nbn a call and hopefully i can get to you on a support line just for a bit of a lull uh we've got joe bloggs here i'll answer joe bogg's question because what does the second hand market for pcs look like in australia at the moment it's a two-speed economy a two-speed economy yeah i'd say it's a two-speed economy as well two-speed market right here at the moment and um it's kind of the market is like i've had a lot of friends tell me that they're slowing down in pc sales my pc sales i've just remained consistently like mediocre even mediocre at best mind you when i put together an rtx 3000 series pc that just goes off the shelves like i didn't even get a chance to list my 30-70 pc because someone already teed it up and then sold it for me and i'm like okay fair enough i've got my profit i'm happy with that but yeah the second-hand market i'd say for around mid-range pcs is very tough right now i did answer this question directly in more depth on the 100 flip up challenge the latest episode so go check that out i do talk about this in direct pretty much what's going on with the market right now but excalibur brian not a single one of these corpse care about you or the average consumer neither are one of them are ideally high value economical uh option yeah so none of them do man none of them do i know that i just had some faith in nvidia i thought nvidia would want to adopt the model and i think some of these companies should start adopting the model of stop getting the short-term gains for the long-term profits if they did the reverse they would actually gain a lot of loyalty and in time people would be like you know what the say for instance in a future scenario oh the intel or whatever say for instance intel wins over your brand loyalty and they do the right thing by you consistently you're going to say well i'm going to pay 10 more for the intel cpu because i can trust them but none of these companies have my trust like especially i was kind of starting to develop a little bit of trust for a video i won't lie but after that driver mishap i was kind of like disappointed yeah i did have some faith i did have like look i had some faith in video like i was like as a personal standpoint i've used nvidia in a lot of my rigs uh for a long time now and i've never had issues it's sort of like the driver stability was really good um the dlss 2.0 i was liking that especially when i played cyberpunk 2.0 but then you know it's kind of like okay maybe they've got this with the mining thing because surely they can't really foresee surely they can't foresee that the crypto boom and bust cycle they can't foresee that i mean if anyone could foresee that they they'd be like one of the richest people on the planet if you could predict these bubbles and when they're gonna come and when they're not gonna come but um i think with nvidia was that i was i was starting to see okay this mining thing i liked it you know other people came out and criticized nvidia and said this mining hash was a it's terrible it's not going to work and for what it for what it's worth i did see it working it was working in the market the market was leaving the 30 60s alone versus the other cards but then the problem came in and they they provided the solution themselves that's what frustrates me people are like man this is going to get hacked it's going to get done people are going to hack it and it's going to be useless anyway but i didn't see any evidence of that and in fact when we looked at the p106 i never saw someone properly hack that sure i saw someone circumvent it for playing some games on up like one driver but the amount of effort that guy had to go through to get that driver working was probably huge and he gave up and you look at the p106 ongoing support right to this day go check it out p106 driver let's have a look we can do it right now on the live stream p106 gaming driver download let's have a look uh yeah like that's from 2018 like yeah okay let's go play the latest fortnite update oh i can't play it because this drive is so old so there it is that's all you've got there for driver support so in terms of what they did and how they did it i was liking it up until they provided the solution themselves and they proved the whole market right so uh mike g see canadian two dollars is brian easy coming back i think he might be i think it's time like honestly i've looked i've stared deep into my soul and there are some plays that you guys are going to see in the coming months that are going to uh at the end of the day i think everyone says you know humans are kind of alike and it's like no human yeah humans are kind of alike and i think we've got to stay alike us as tech yes citizens we have to keep together and start letting our voices be heard and start doing things that we need to do but i'm studying things at the moment i've got a big strategy in the works don't worry you guys will hear about it once i'm confident that it's a hundred percent it's uh i'd call it i'd call it um stupid proof don't worry i'm in the works on that one so don't worry even hardware unboxed will be surprised at this next move he won't even see it coming and then it's got nothing to do with tech by the way it's got nothing to do with tech by the way but it was uh me and him we have a good little um i like to have actually i got to tweet at him soon eh i'll actually tweet at him soon let's have a crack like let's have an argument online on twitter so i gotta have a crack at him you know and he can have a crack at me too you guys enjoy that like a lot of people tell me after we me and uh hardware and box have a go at each other on twitter that you guys like seeing you guys get the popcorn out and you love watching it see how good is that but anyway let's move over to some questions and uh q a for you guys and let's go on here and um let's go back to the real deal what's going on before we close off this live stream but uh if you guys have pressing concerns pressing concerns then let us know in the chat because i'm here this ain't a premiere this is the live stream you guys can ask me anything ama time so uh people are going on about linus uh yeah like linus showed everyone how to mine i think i mean look i'm not gonna comment on linus channel and how he runs things i just don't think it was the right move to make that video in the current climate i mean there's enough problems people have with having to get a gpu they don't need linus like literally piling onto the problem so that was kind of like the thing and i mean if he's sorted it all out on his end if he's apologized for it that's fine um yeah but yeah anyway we're gaz stanfield donation here and that's five pondo five i always get the euro and the pound symbol confused uh thanks for the donation brother i was given a 6800 graphics card yesterday unfortunately it was the 6800 gt not the 6800 xt yeah that was i i've got a oh man don't you shouldn't say that because now i'll probably see on marketplace 6800 for sale cheap and there'll be a blurred image and people try to be scamming people now with like 68 hundreds thinking yeah i think they know they actually sell an old-school 6800 as a like a 6800 they won't say it's an rx x yeah just say it's a six it is and like technically they're not lying but that's like that's the kind of crap you'll probably see on marketplace soon uh and especially on ebay uh two dollars from mark smith i'm new and enjoy your content cheers from ct ct oh sorry man i'm from aussie uh c what's ct that's a state in the us i'm guessing because most people in the us do abbreviate their connecticut okay i got you connecticut so from connecticut thanks man so um how's menu log so we've got corey designs by our house menu log trading you actually pretty good man uh like you gotta come up to the gold coast so next time i've got to get uh corey up to the gold coast and we'll do a custom build kinetico connecticut connecticut look we'll go to a us connecticut did that was that right did i get it connecticut now this is this is where you're at this part of the stream where it just starts to degrade so quickly and we just go so off topic that now we're talking about menu log and what what else getting delivery like a g they need to make a you know what they need to do they need to make an app for getting uh graphics cards in stock and delivering them to your door just not with the scalp i mean if they can do that then maybe they can get in with the retailer and they can make a fifty cut each and they're still saving money versus a scalper they can call it like maybe they can call it something like easy scalp except the scalping is capped at like 10 percent i'm pretty sure people would be happy with that jaden ori 10 donation thank you man uh your content has helped me grow from a neat isn't that like uh someone who stays home neat any et i i have read that to running a five figure pc flip an llc though still from her mom's basement oh it's she too thanks jade um i'm now paying state and city taxes do you do the same if so any tips so yeah yeah like five figures is awesome congratulations and thanks for the donation too but the flipping thing i'm gonna make actually i was gonna make a series on just how to show people how to flip some pcs like getting their first hundred dollars and making a cheap pc to flip and getting into the world of uh tinkering hardware i think it's a great hobby and it sounds like from the just the way you've worded the text is you're having a lot of fun and um i do the same as well like i do flip pcs and i you know it's it's no joke it's like easy i you know you guys would know i do over five figures in flipping pcs every year um in terms of tips i would say always try to network with people get deals like people are going to like you you know what i mean if you're energetic and you're positive and you speak to people they're just going to like you and if people like you they're going to want to sell to you versus someone else's say for instance you've got two people because this is what i would do if i liked someone i'm going to hook them up a deal as opposed to someone i don't like i'm not going to want to deal with them and that's the simple thing that's the reality of the world you won't hear this in a business and economics class because they don't teach you this thing they think the world works off oh here's the paper you've got to stick to the pen and paper it's not like that the world works in a much different way if someone doesn't like you they're just not going to want to deal with you period and you're not going to get a deal at all so learn to just i'd say i'd say you're doing a great job of it i mean i love the reading your text so i'd say try and network with go down to a recycle yard try and get to know the people there and just say hey i'm looking to buy some cheap pc parts and recycle them and they'll probably say hey we've got this for you we've got that for you and um and then from this guy's the limits don't be afraid to just go out there and just talk to i mean do it do it during the day like and do do take precautions don't just go like yolo into some dodgy neighborhood because i heard in the u.s there are some dodgy neighborhoods out there but uh just yet like get to know uh sort of the people that um do do well and then you'll you'll network and then sky's the limits from there so i've got mike g with a canadian five dollars canadian i think i'm working on my canadian way that was bad i know i look we'll get on to the us i didn't look i can't do the difference between canadian and u.s accent i really cannot distinguish the difference i think i was starting to get my us accent on point but we got the question uh would be cool to see a custom build with dab man we need more dab man okay cory designs by r5 if you're still out there you uh come up here and you're building a pc for dadman now the thing about this pc for dadman is going to have a celeron it's going to have a gt 1010 and it's going to be liquid cool like the best looking pc we've done but it's going to have the crappiest parts we'll at least give him 16 gig of ram too if he's brown if he's gold lotto numbers like and stuff like that he might have a couple applications yeah facebook scrolling dadman's like he's glued to facebook he likes watching all those like he's like brian take a look at this there's aliens there's aliens and i'm like what no it's like a photoshopped video dad man he's like oh really like it's so and you're wondering why those videos get so many views it's because like gullible people like dadman are watching them but i've got an easy monster 84 brian i'm 100 blaming you for me mining on my uh 3090 damn it i didn't want to cop the blame but thanks uh for the 199 uh profit that you made from mining on that i mean i'll take the profit uh dollars a dollar it doesn't care about your feelings right so um that's one thing with the dollar yeah sad reality money versus people people do care about your feelings money don't and just never forget that but thanks for the donation man um if you got a 30 90 i mean yeah just everyone like i guess the message that linus wanted to say one thing that i don't know if linus addressed this speaking of lannister is there he's like his little videos popping up on live stream one thing that i'd like to see him address is that hey if everybody piles on this mining gig if everyone with a gaming pc worldwide started using their pcs to mine it would drop the profitability and then that would hopefully deter the miners from buying more graphics cards there actually is some genius in there to getting people to mine and more of the average public to mine with what they've got already even though it probably overload power grids but there's something in there that if you drop mining profitability you can deter people from buying more graphics cards so anyway we'll just leave that one out there because it's a whole can of worms and i wouldn't even know how like yeah the problems it could cause as well just wouldn't be worth it i think you could overload power grids and stuff like that where i think there's already countries that have had power problems with uh cryptocurrency mining uh jeremy two dollar dono uh what's the difference between x 58 and x 79 instruction sets uh yeah so x 79 got um the avx instruction sets introduced that's the og ones they also got of course the better power efficient cpus the cpus themselves did take away from the north bridge which x-58 had and then they went into lowering the clock speeds to i think it was either 800 megahertz or 1200 maybe x8 800 on the desktop variant and then 1200 on the x79 variant but they went and changed things up and uh yeah overall x79 got quad channel memory as well and you also got true native usb 3 and you got true sata 3 built onto the motherboards i think and p i think sandy bridge ep no was it ep sandy bridge ep maybe ivy bridge ep got pci gen 3 as well so they're all the differences i can think of um if i did miss any maybe some people in the comments will uh put a bit more in there for you but they're the main differences off the top of my head that i can think of uh jeremy another two dollars i want to mine ether but don't know how to um yeah i mean i'm not gonna yeah i'm not the guy to teach you how to mine i mean i'm yeah we're not going there so i'm not i'm not going there man if you want to know how to mine after there's probably like plenty of guides out there on google anyway guys we're going to get over some final questions and uh more content when more dual socket sr2 perhaps if you guys have any requests we'll uh if you guys have any ques requests we'll then be sure to do them but uh we're going to go into uh x58 content i was going to go more along the lines of real just 100 pc content i want to make some real good bangers that people can go and sort of say hey this is a lot of fun i want to do this it's something different just got to take my mind off of the overpriced graphics cards and yeah 100 pcs that's going to be my new thing going into the next couple of months i'm going to do 100 pc here 100 pc there everybody is going to be a winner at tech yeah city uh that's if you you know build 100 pc so all right so uh will there ever be an am4 plus platform uh i don't why they just make am5 when ddr5 comes around they'll probably just make am5 so that'll pretty much be it uh do you really believe everyone in australia is upside down um that's a crazy way of thinking of what is actually upside down or not see now if we want to go to the universe which part of the universe is upside down the universe is just this continuously expanding thing so we could be downside up we could be anywhere we want we could be east meets west versus west meets east which way do we want it which way are we in australia mike g canadian five dollars do you still have any of the clothes from that business still just curious yeah i'd like look i never got around so basically we're talking about this video where me and dadman went and swapped a pc for a whole clothing business like all these buckets of clothes there was actually a lot of clothes in that thing um since then i just i've been like honestly with youtube i've been super busy just with youtube and then in my free time i kind of just want to game a bit relax um and just like live life a little bit and i just like i was like looking at this i'm like oh man like am i ever gonna get on to selling these clothes probably not so i just over time i started using the clothes myself i gave a heap to dadman it gave a heap to all my mates like you know that thing got raided by a lot of my friends they're like yo can i get a free shirt yo that shirt looks good could i have that and i'm like sure you know you get a good deal you you're sharing the spoils kind of thing so just like you guys actually this stream you guys are definitely sharing in the spoils and and sharing with the love with the donations they keep coming in uh jeremy with the five bucks uh thank you for the information last question are lga 2011 r and 2011 r2 compatible and backwards compatible do they use different gen processors revision 2 and revision 1 should be the same you're talking about the iv bridge release versus the sandy bridge you should be able to use the sandy bridge in the r2 but you might have to update your bias for r1 to use ivybridge um also but basically before we close off with the clothing business yeah i've still got a heap of clothes here if you guys are on the coast and you want some freshly steezed clothes then do let us know that was the name of the business i took freshly freshly steezed so we can keep keep it running um ganga din is corey mf mufc supporter i thought i saw those letters on his shorts while building your pc yeah he's um yeah he's a bit into ufc i'm pretty sure he's into ufc so he likes all that and uh he did have some clothes there yeah i think uh yeah all right i look i don't know man like ask little cory just come in the comments and answer the men's question okay easy monster 84 499 uh with some more [__] is it that was more crypto mind money wait yep i paid a scalper 1700 for the 30 90. i got ripped off i wanted to play fallout 76 of 4k then it crashed on the pc so i bought a series s on my c9 cheers okay that's a that's an interesting story like are you you say what you wait i'm trying to think so you got ripped off hold on let's have a look here go wait you got ribbed off i like i love it how we're starting to use ripped off as just a casual term that's what's going on like make no mistake people are getting ripped off everywhere he got ripped off for a 30 90 and then he played fallout 76 on the uh c9 are you still playing on the 30 or you just hop that into the wild again and then rip someone else off let us know in the in the chat um but that's i mean look the series x and the series s are good value propositions you can pick them up for really cheap right now and so we'll go to uh capec and he's donated five bucks uh do your best price to performance zeons with three different xeons for comparison yeah so one thing i've got with the xeons is i always keep them i keep the x58 rampage motherboard that i got for free it had broken water block heatsinks i just took all the heatsinks off got it working again we got x79 motherboard i picked that out out of a dumpster i'm now in negotiation i want to get an x99 board and i do want to get the best of x99 the problem with x99 is that it's actually kind of in demand especially those motherboards that can overclock like the old school of zeus and stuff they're really in demand so uh the x79 x58 i've definitely got them on hand i'd love to do some comparisons if you guys want to see some comparisons between the x99 xeons versus the other stuff let us know which x x99 xeon because i could make that happen but it's just really the motherboards we're having a bit of trouble and we've got here another uh well you guys bringing in some mad donations coming out of this stream uh red panther with aussie 10 thanks for the aussie man hey brian do you have any funny stories from pc selling like fans trying to haggle by referencing your videos i saw your video you built this pc for 50 bucks and selling for 300 bucks yeah i have had some people know what i build them for and then try to say look i want it at cost price and i'm like bro i'm not doing it at cost price like that's work you know what i mean me cleaning all the stuff up putting it together or getting the deals and that's one thing if you're getting the deals like if you're getting an rtx 3070 for a thousand bucks in a climate in a market where it's fifteen hundred dollars and people are buying it for 1500 bucks and it's still got the warranty certificate with it it's one month out of warranty you've technically made 500 bucks why like you don't have to pass that on to anyone that was your hustle you were pressing the f5 button quicker than someone else you got in with the deal like that's kind of like the rules i love the pc flipping industry there's rules here man there's rules and you get the deals and you go in you go hard and that's what it's all about it's competitive like you got to be competitive man so i do get people like they do come in and i do i do them a discount i do them a discount they if they watch the tech yes content i do them i shave off some money off the price that's for sure but um it's i have had a lot of people haggling in terms of yeah trying to like literally get it at cost and i'm like come on man like i've got to make a little bit for my my troubles um but then they're like hard pressed and i'm like bro like i've just sold this to someone else and got some profit so you just gotta like you are gonna get people that will hound you and haggle you so don't be afraid to block some people if they're being really rude but um in terms of most people like most people do send us a lot of messages and they show us the love that outweighs the bad stories by a lot more than the um then there's also you also get the haters as well uh they'll come once in a while and make some joke like i think someone made a joke about me selling the pc for a couple of cheeseburgers and i you know they're the ones that you get every now and then you got to ignore those ones uh but then we've also got here the uh 50 donations so no question take dadman out to eat no need to put it in a video or anything cheers mate matthew lang thanks for the 50 bucks dead man will enjoy a six-pack and we'll probably take him out and get him some thai uh there's this thai place down the road that does a really good uh what's that mung bang carry mam bang it's it's hard to pronounce but it's really good it's got potato onion chicken

then we've got easy monster 84 199 again 3090 is mining decided to play 76 on the series s oh man with this okay with this mining stuff like i'm guessing some of you guys are literally just like live donating your profits from mining while i'm my so like you're giving me free donations while i'm live streaming from your mining profits that's pretty cool thanks easy monster but uh yeah i mean it's kind of cool it's kind of not cool like let's try and i let's try and keep this crypto world uh so people can people who need some gaming graphics cards and are bored out of their brains can actually buy one that's that's the ultimate plan uh any plans to go back to japan after covert restrictions ease up from kogo my man my man that is like on my mind every day i'm edging to go to japan that's like kind of why a reason part of why i was kind of like not making as much content in the last couple of months was because i was a little bit like i just want to see my boy man i want to go to japan
