back once again with another monitor review this time we've got two in one this is benq's ex2710 and the ex2510 and this is their model that they're calling the mo boozy wait no they're calling it the mobies i'm calling it the mo boozy and when i spoke to him about this they said it's mobius and i'm thinking to myself there's no e there how can it be mobius last time i checked like that's not how english works and then they said look it's mo bs so this is where you guys can let us know in the comments do you think it's mo boozy or do you think it's mobius and with that aside we've got these two right here there is a big difference one big difference well two big differences between them why i'm going to be strongly and i mean thoroughly recommending the 25-inch ex-2510 over the 27-inch the ex-2710 and we'll get straight into that and that's because of the brightness the 25-inch when i was measuring it it had a higher brightness level and this was to the tune of 335 center versus 291 on the 2510 then over the 2710 that had a maximum of 253 nits and a minimum of 214 with a 16 variance so not only did the 2710 have a worse variance but it had a significantly lower maximum brightness and now this is important with this monitor because the motion blur on this model in particular is easily the best implementation of motion blur i've ever seen on any monitor come through here on the studio basically it's using what's called black frame insertion and when you couple this with ama turned on that's essentially benq's overdrive setting there's four levels here zero which is off one which is a light two which is medium and then three which is strong you would want to have this on either one two or three there's not a huge difference between all three of those settings but zero having it off is not recommended where i was measuring double overlay of frames as opposed to one which was scoring around seven milliseconds two was getting around six and then three was getting around five to six milliseconds so i personally like to have this on the maximum ama setting the overshoot and purple fringing wasn't noticeable in games for me personally and it wasn't noticeable when i was doing the ufo tester but when you turn on this motion blur reduction the brightness of the monitor drops and so that's why it's important to have a brighter monitor out of the get-go when you turn on blur reduction and so i thought the 2710 just didn't have that comfortable brightness level when we're turning this motion blur reduction on as opposed to the 2510 having more brightness it looked better and i was like wow for an ips panel 16x9 they're both 1080p as well 144hz refresh i was just blown away by how sharp and crisp the image was in fast motion with these settings turned on now they do support g-sync and freesync i think it's freesync premium as well so 48 hertz to 144 and on the amd side you'll also get low frame rate compensation now the trick is to getting these sync technologies to work as you i found here in the studio i had to use the displayport cable so they only included an hdmi cable so if you want to get freesync or g-sync working properly on these panels i'd suggest going out and buying a separate displayport cable individually and in future iterations i'd like to see benq include a displayport cable so once you do that you can then turn on these syncing technologies but if you want to keep the blur reduction on which i do heavily recommend you will then lose the option to turn on the syncing technologies or the adaptive sync so here's where things keep getting better for the mobuzi in that the input lag is some of the best i've seen here in the studio i'd peg it close to zero milliseconds or as close to zero as possible but what about colors and what about the srgb mode on these panels right here here's where this was very color accurate and i was surprised for a monitor that's coming in as an entry-level ips panel the srgb mode was very accurate when i put the calibrator on these panels on both of them and so if you want to edit videos or you want to edit photos on a budget this monitor is definitely going to double down to be able to do that where there's only some very slight differences so speaking of color modes they've got a few to choose from there my personal favorite at least for playing games was just to smash it into the fps mode turn the ama up to three and then turn the blur reduction on and you'll have happy days though there are some other modes there some of them feel like they were just quickly tacked together to from a guy in the you know in the lab was just like yo i've got to add some more modes in this to differentiate and then they just tacked on some some funny ones in there though we just said the word tack and this is where they've tacked on this hdr button and this is pretty much my only critique of this monitor in today's review with the hdri button you press this and essentially it's just some extra color modes where they're essentially just going to up the contrast up the saturation except in this case it doesn't work that well i prefer the other color modes especially the out-of-the-box colors are better in my opinion than pressing this button right here which we can do now and you just see here the blacks just completely go they're gone same with all the other modes and so just leaving it off is the best choice in my opinion then the actual hdr itself in windows 10. this is again these are 8-bit panels to get true hdr you want 10-bit and so when you turn this on this setting in windows 10. this is straight away to tell if your monitor supports hdr or not just like i said in yesterday's video with the 49 inch with its hdr it's the same thing you turn this on in windows and you just get a beautiful washed out image and in fact i think windows need to change this to woodier or washed out dynamic range because that's what it is on 8-bit panels and of course part of me putting myself in the shoes of the customer always i get this i get why these companies want to market hdr but i would think a much more successful button here would just be gaming in bold letters have the button there and it changes it to the fps mode instantly and the other modes that actually do really well now in terms of the osd this is phenomenal bank you have put the d-pad in here you can navigate the menu system really quickly change your settings and it's just a breeze the osd is set up like magnificently well benq don't need to change anything on this monitor in terms of the osd it works works well it's got all the features you've even got the quick menu feature which you can customize and add in your own settings that you use regularly and change them on the fly though there's the black equalizer setting and i know a lot of people do weigh this up especially if they're playing competitive fps games and they don't like these shadows this is where the black equalizer works extremely well on this monitor too so that's another good point where you can turn this up and it actually focuses on the darker areas and they have added another option in called light tuner which it works in other modes so they're essentially the same thing except i think light tuner just gives you the option to go the other way and make the darker areas darker if you want to so kudos to benq for doing a great implementation of the black equalizer and then the last two things to go over is the cross hatching which there was no visible cross hatching when i pulled up an orange background it's got a semi-matte coating it's a great balance if you're doing work and gaming especially which this monitor is capable of doing and then as for backlight bleed i noticed no visible or obvious backlight bleed on either of these panels so especially on an ips panel you do have to be careful of this and for what it's worth they've done a very good job of keeping that under control and then for physical attributes of this monitor it is height swivel and tilt adjustable 120 mil on the height and vertical adjustment however you cannot rotate the display it does include speakers but they are tinny i do suggest if you're serious about audio getting some proper speakers or of course a separate set of headphones and then for inputs we've got two hdmi one display port and the ac power which the power brick is inside the monitor itself and it's vasometable though if you are using a stand and you want a flush finish that goes straight to the screw hole then the max stand size will be 120 mil in a square format after that you will have to use extended screws and with all that out of the way it's now time to talk about these two monitors right here and straight away i'm going to say like i said in the intro going for the 2510 over the 2710 and it wasn't just the brightness thing it was the brightness thing coupled with what i believe is you're going to want to turn on some of the best blur reduction that i've ever seen and it's going to do a great job but then because you've got that extra brightness the blur reduction is going to work a lot better on the 2510 the second thing and probably the best thing is the price the 2510 is coming in at 249 usd in australia it's coming in at 379 aussie dollars and then for the 2710 299 usd and 439 aussie dollars so you can not only save some money but get a better gaming experience by going with the slightly smaller option now in terms of competition out there the nearest that i can think of or the closest that i can think of is the aoc 144hz ips panel now that's coming in at 180 usd and in australia around 300 aussie dollars that thing is really good value for money i'm not going to beat around the bush and say otherwise that's a phenomenal value for money entry-level gaming monitor especially if you want 144 hertz though i feel like this with its if you want to pay the premium for this you're going to get that motion blur reduction and it's going to work extremely well plus the srgb color profile is very accurate too so this has some extra things going for it that i feel make it a good purchase and after gaming on this thing i can easily say that the 2510 is a really good gaming monitor you're going to have an absolute blast especially if you want to copy paste my settings that i talked about in today's review this one's definitely going to be one to consider me personally knowing how good this motion blur reduction works i would be going for this and trust me i'm gaming on oled which has got sub 1 millisecond response times and this works extremely well very surprised very good implementation anyhow guys with that aside do let us know in the comments section below what monda you are rocking currently and with that aside we have here the question of the day which comes from a friend rocket jump ninja and they ask what's with the ugly mic and here's the thing zai let me tell you about the ugly microphone in time this microphone you guys if i take this microphone away you guys are going to be begging for it to come back you're going to be like oh man i miss the ugly microphone please the ugly microphone over time is going to grow on you and not only that i think the sound quality at least from what you guys were saying sounds really good so let's give the ugly microphone a chance hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another video very soon if you have any questions or comments about either of these two monitors then be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below i'll get back to you as soon as i can with that aside peace out for now bye [Music]
