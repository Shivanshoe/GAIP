this here is my main pc and as you can probably tell it is not the best of cases in fact you're probably sitting here and like what is this case brian i've never seen it before well this is the remnants of a custom build that i did quite a while ago and so what happened with the history of this build was it started out beautiful and then it went from bad to worse to now to uh if you guys know old school cars they've got a thing called limp mode so this thing is in limp mode where it just functions and that's all it really does in terms of aesthetics it's really needing a big touch up and this is where we are going in with the new corsair 7000d now this case right here has the option to mount up to three 420 mil radiators so you can have so much water cooling in this thing if you wish to and we're going to be using one of those 420 mil mounts to mount a h170i elite capelex rgb water cooler so we're going to be changing up a few things in this build in the process cleaning everything down too and this old case here we are finally going to put this to rest i actually forgot i i built this so long ago i think it was like a corsair 780 t if memory serves me correctly i mean well what's left of it so we're going from a 780 t to now a 7000 d and this is one of corsair's biggest cases they have released to date so let's go through the case and see if what looks like perfection ends up actually being perfection [Music] and now it's time for the best part of the build and that is the tech yes loving [Music] back [Music] my [Music] multiplayer [Music] so at the start i said we could fit three four 20 mil rads and technically we can we just got to improvise [Music] now [Applause] uh [Music] and here we are now the next day with the 7000d now set up as the new background prop pc but it's not just a prop pc i thought like coming into this build i've got to admit i was thinking okay this is going to be another decent rgb pc that doesn't really do anything special but i came out of this thinking wow this build just looks so clean and it has the rgb but it's not too cheesy and that's the look that this build will give off very clean and of course all the options are there if you want to build the pc you want to do now we'll say this is a full tower atx case so it will support eatx and a lot of more options in terms of six hard drives 3.5 inch drive bays and you've also got an additional three ssd trays at the back so either nine ssds in total or six hard drives and you can remove those completely if you're going for a hard driveless build like we've done here and if you actually want to change this front sliding portion here to be pushing air say for instance you've got a 480mm at the front you can actually take that out and corsair have included a bracket to then have airflow drive up from the bottom and into the build now we've gone with a bit of a different concept here in that we've got the two rear fans which would be traditionally outflowing air they're actually intake and then we've got the three rgb fans at the front as out take so that's sort of like it's a reverse setup because i really wanted to take advantage of the h170 size rgb and i didn't want too much rgb in this build but let us know in the comments what you guys think of the aesthetics and what we put together here but it's time now of course if you're getting into a case you want to know the most important thing and that is the temperatures especially if you're outlaying the kind of money on a case that the 7000 d commands which in america is about 260 usd in australia it's about 325 aussie dollars including gst and here's where we saw the temperatures that with the glass panel on versus off with the cpu test we saw no difference it was 92 degrees versus 92 degrees now keep in mind you're like well brian that's hot for a cpu but actually this is 18 cores 36 threads overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz with the avx-2 instruction sets going in cinebench r23 so that's why the power consumption drawer is so high as well as the temperatures so the fact that we were able to get the same temperatures means that the glass and the design of the case isn't hindering the temperatures whatsoever if you set things up properly and i'm going to say if you set things up properly because what we had here with the gpu actually was a big difference when it came to the way we set it up because i'm not going to blame the 7000d for this because this the sheer size of the rtx 3080 was that it was so close to the glass so the airflow was restricted so if you want to push your gpu forward just make sure it's not like a three and a half slot cooler like the rtx 3080 that we're using here so if it's two slots cooler you'll see much better temps and i'll pull up the grass for you here where you can see that if we mounted the gpu back we only got three degrees higher so 63 degrees versus 66 degrees but then when we mounted it right at the front i had to do this because i have to have my elgato capture card for recording videos like this or if i want to add in say usb to other pcie slots in the future then i'll have to have those free pcie slots spare because if i do mount the gpu vertically and push it back then i am going to then have only really the top slot available but they're actually on this motherboard since it's x299 there isn't that top slot available so there's those options there you do have them but keep in mind when you are going with this kind of build if you've got a massive gpu you might have to keep the glass off and for me since it is a background prop i am going to keep the glass off because if it is in the shot it's just going to be so reflective that it's going to be very distracting for the actual main a-roll shot that we're doing here of the subject and with the side panel it is tinted tempered glass they are going with the thicker five mil standard so we'll make your rgb shine really nice at night time however keep in mind it's reflective because it's gloss but i will say my first critiquing point with the build and there's only one of two critiquing points i have is the shroud on the power supply the cover there they've gone with a tinted cover for the power supply but it looks like when you've got a power supply that hx1000 since it does have the white label there it makes it look like it's been weathered but since it is dark enough in the shot like this you'll see it doesn't really come out at all in the background unless you pay particular attention to it that critiquing point out of the way there's only one other critiquing point i have for this case and that comes in the form of that radiator mount there with the 420 mil as we can see in this video we did mount a 420 mil rad and it did mount flush everything was absolutely fine but there wasn't the mounting holes on that bracket so if corsair could add those mounting bracket holes in there it would definitely make for a great combo with the h170i their best cpu cooler on the market with i'd say one of their best cases on the market it's a absolutely amazing combo that they can offer except the support isn't there from the get-go but if you want to make what we've done here happen you will have to get the drill out and start drilling that said let's get on to the really good points that impressed me about this case and first of all is the build quality in terms of the three dust filters on the top bottom and side they're all magnetic all really high quality you've also got one down the bottom where your power supply is but that is not magnetic that's actually detachable and then simply moving onto the rear of the case the modularity you've got the ability there to cover up all your rear cables with an additional panel and the cable management and routing is super easy even if you're like me and you do cable management very quickly you can still get a really tidy outfit in the end with no resistance on the back panel nothing blocking your way from closing up the build then of course you've got all that extra room to route the cables and the side of the case there will pay particular attention to the grommets that they've used or should i say grommet because they've made all those side grommets just one and so it doesn't come off i've built in pcs over time where those grommets come off and they're such a pain to get back on these were pretty much not coming off at all and the way they've designed it is it makes it look like in some areas it's all individually grommeted but it's actually one piece so your cables will look really good once they go through that grommet so continuing where the motherboard tray is you've got the option there with the gpu to either mount it vertically in two different positions or of course your traditional horizontal position all of which are really easy to do in a full-size atx case believe it or not and we've got good clearance underneath the bottom of the gpu so i know i've built in the past where vertical mounts it's been a incredibly tight fit between that gpu vertical mount bracket and the bottom of the case which if you have that touching directly it's going to cause issues so this is not an issue for the 7000d and then lastly there's a heap of different extras included with the case in terms of covering up cables on the side which included by the fault and then there's a cover beside those cable covers which is covering the 420mm rad but we decided to remove that because we had to install that radiator then if you're talking about fans out of the box this comes with three 140mm fans connected to a fan hub which works in the sense that it's actually a repeater so if you plug this into one fan head from your motherboard it will repeat the same pwm signal meaning that you can control all six fans from that one fan hub and not worry about power issues and it will still mimic the setting that you have on your motherboard in the bios whether you're using tuning software in windows and then the last point to talk about is the front and back panels are both push pin and they're on hinges and i would recommend removing them if you're going to do your whole pc build because they both are quite heavy in the case of the rear we did actually have the bill falling over when we had no components in it so i would recommend taking those both off before you do your build but the push pin element i actually prefer this over the magnetic element because once they're closed they don't accidentally open up which i've had with screwless magnetic side panels in the past so with all that out of the way i will say this build has been very refreshing as a pc enthusiast to see a return or at least some focus from the industry back to full sized eatx cases and this one just hits the mark in all aspects i absolutely love what corsair have done with the 7000d even though it's expensive at least the face price of 260 usd or 325 aussie dollars i think versus the competition in full size cases it comes in with a competitive price point but also an amazing build quality and also the utility that this thing offers is incredible so i think they've absolutely nailed it i'd give it a 9 out of 10 personally there was two critiquing points that i mentioned previously in this review but everything else from start to finish this is a well-designed case with everything just attaching and detaching perfectly they've done a great job but with that said do let us know in the comments section below what do you guys think of the 7000d what do you think of the build that we've got now for the new editing rig at tech yes city do you think i've done a nice job or would you change a few things love reading your thoughts and opinions as always but i will say one more thing and that is i like to see this return to full-sized towers i mean the whole industry has been going in the route of many itx and as much as i love mini itx and all the development there for me personally i love the full size atx options i've always been a massive fan of bigger cases and i think there's just been so much focus on mid towers and mini itx's it is just a breath of fresh air just like this question of the day here i know it's going to talk about problems but they are a breath of fresh air for me i deal with computer problems almost all day every day but we got here the question of the day from alex van der ku and they ask what about a workstation where the input freezes such as you type a sentence and then several seconds later the letters start to appear on the screen same with the mouse clicks so they're going to talk about their computer having problems it's an i5 75 124 gig of ram one terabyte m.2 ssd and basically they're saying that they do video editing and when it comes to a pc and having stuttering and issues i would go straight away to testing out the hardware first so in this case i'd get something like i to 64. do a stress test for a few hours make sure temperatures are not too high things are not throttling like the cpu or the memory is not failing and then make sure also your gpu temperatures are fine and they're not throttling as well since adobe premiere pro for example does utilize gpu acceleration so if your gpu is not working right then premiere pro could not be working right either however that said if since you are video editing and i'd look at that and say is an i5 4 core 4 thread enough for video editing especially in 2021 where i think at 1080p the 24 gigabytes of ram should be fine i know the m.2 ssd should be fine too but the four cores four threads that will seriously start as when you start putting a big load in adobe premiere pro it will start stuttering and causing big issues where to the point i've got 18 cores 36 threads here and even though i added a 4k i can bring this whole system to its knees if i put enough video editing footage through it and i've actually done this quite a few times especially when we do the parts hunts they go from 20 minutes to 30 minutes in video length and this thing can start to chug even with the best of the best gear overclocked with 128 gigabytes of ram so video editing can get very intense and that's just my experience with it hope that answers that question and of course if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you on another video very soon he's out for now [Music]
