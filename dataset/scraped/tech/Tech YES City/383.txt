in the last video we made here over at tech yes City we delved into the realm of potatoes and the thing was there was a few deals that were left hanging on the line that today we're gonna go pick them up also in the meantime we're gonna be looking as best as we can for those low end graphics cards we're talking GTX 680 7000 series but you kind of don't want to go any lower than that especially with the gtx 500 series because that doesn't even work in the new Call of Duty war zone there's like six series minimum for Nvidia and then 7000 series minimum for AMD so yes even potatoes have their minimum requirements I know you're probably thinking is that how it works if that's how it didn't work before that is how it works now because we've got to chuck one of these potatoes in the boot and go deliver it we've got a tacky ass delivery on the road so we're gonna make synergy happen here where we're picking up deals and delivering deals so let's quickly of course scan gum tree and Facebook marketplace see if there's any deals and let's go chuck this thing in the boot and get in the yes mabini [Music] so we just did that tech yes delivery and we got that coin now we're heading about 10 minutes down the road to mark from gum tree and he's got a heap of systems that we checked out in the previous potato episode I'll put the link for that up here but he's got apparently a lot more than the ad say so we're gonna check all this out and see what we can get so you're going over to pick up marks ads that he had all these pieces listed for you ended up having some extras so we ended up getting in total I think like around 10 pcs I actually haven't counted yet and now there's for 650 Aussie dollars so that is a really good score that's made this whole trip already worth it but what we're doing now is put a bit of a drive up north to the Sunshine Coast just like another hour from Brisbane so from where I live this is almost like a two-hour drive but I got to get those four graphics cards that motherboard and all that ddr3 RAM and that's a pretty good price and the good thing is at the moment is that fuels really cheap gas is extremely cheap I've never seen it this cheap since I was a kid so whatever is going on there it's basically cheap to go pick up PC parts right now [Music] so we're up in the Sunshine Coast now and I just picked up that deal where we got 20 gigabytes of ddr3 thrown in with that z170 motherboard and also for GPU so 77070 7950 and r9 280 and also another 79 50 so for $150 I'd say there's a really good score providing those graphics cards work I did ask them on the spot they said yep all the GPUs are working the motherboard apparently has a problem with it where one of the channels doesn't work properly but open a bit of tech yes loving we'll fix that up good and truly though from here on in we're going to go now pick up another deal on a 78 72 gigabyte and that's gone for 25 Aussie dollars so gonna hit that on the way back home as well as another potential deal that's looking like it's coming up which came from the guy who solved at the GTX 650 he said he also had some pcs parts spare so we're gonna see what comes out of all this very soon so stay tuned [Music] so we're coming back now from that Sunshine Coast place that we went to which is very far and we were driving back and we picked up the 7870 and the person also had a r9 370 I think and I was like wow but they said it was artifacting and it was problematic so they could chuck that in for free so basically what's happening is what that is I'm gonna get that back see if I can do anything to it to fix it but usually once an older card like that's gone there's a slim chance of getting and working again though the 7870 looks good it's got the custom gigabyte three fan model and besides that I didn't know I thought AMD designed that cooler for the RX 470 initially but it seems like they were using that on the r9 370 beforehand I actually didn't know that so a little bit of a blast to the past with these used parts but from here on in we've actually just given up there's a bit of a call and we're like going straight past his house on the way home so I'm gonna stop over and he said he's got no new stock but I actually need some our 19 inch monitors so I'm gonna quickly pick up a few of them [Music] so just finished up at Lazer's place and we ended up getting the 19 inch monitors which is great he did have some filthy keyboards and mice that I managed to extract as well as a bonus 20 inch monitor that he threw in for us so that was awesome and then I asked him what else do you have man like anything at the moment he had to z/2 30s like we got last time so we picked up two of those in the pot son I got one of these with basically no RAM and it was a 27 TV 3 and a 256 gigabyte SSD and it's the whole case passed by everything for 230 so he did that same deal for another two of those so we're gonna do with them is probably add in like a gtx 1070 add in 16 gigabytes of ram hard drive and then that's an easy flip in its own but from here on in we've got the last stop and that is a place on the Gold Coast they've they said they've got a couple of things possibly without the motherboard in them so I'm gonna go check that out and see what we can get in this last deal on the way back home and then when we get back to the studio we'll see all the potato coverage that we've got where it's looking so good right now like this car is doing really well right now in terms of how much potato luggage it can carry so there it is just back there you got the seat belt on they're strapped in those are the z2 tens HP's with no RAM no hard drives no power supply so 30 Ozzie dollars a pop for those and since I've got so many AI fives though you guys sorting that I 5 bro video that's me dropping all these old I 520 400s on the desk that'll still do fine for a budget fortnight gaming PC so yeah like I'll take anything at the moment just scrap so I don't really care so I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel right now and these sort of weird times but let's get back gotta get back ASAP now because there's someone who wants their for night gaming PC setup like ASAP dead desperate as for it and you know when someone's hungry for this stuff you can't lead them astray otherwise you're gonna lose the sales so yeah let's go get that sale [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so now we just got back to the tech yes studio and you'll notice that two of the four graphics cards are already gone and that's how much of a pinch I'm in at the moment where this one here was probably my favorite deal of the day scoring all this ddr3 memory there was some ddr2 memory but I really have already heap to that in the pile so getting four GPUs that are pretty decent all that RAM in a motherboard for $150 we really did end up paying off quite literally and we did that late night delivery and we just got back Tech yes delivery so this is where it's all that for me personally is these low-end rigs I'm loving this I'm just having a lot of fun really utilizing what I'm all about here on the channel and that is just bringing up trash to treasure and let's move over now to the big pile like guess where this is the main score so coming off today we've got like out of the pcs we've got left we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 13 pcs down here and I believe there is H or 9 monitors three of those don't have stands but the guy chucked them in with that first six hundred and fifty dollar deal so I was really happy to pick that up I ended up picking up off the last guy I saw and got beaten up with three power supplies and three will there's one down there as Z to ten and then two of the others which I've already flipped so it's just again just looking at those graphics cards that we had it's really at the moment just demand season especially for low end gaming PC's so I'm doing my best to collect what I can before supplies really run dry and say for instance layers I spoke to him and all he really had for me was monitors and those z2 30s with the zealand's in them you've already seen them in the usual part time last month the month where we picked up those for a really good price with a 12-7 tv3 Xeon so that's basically in i7 4770k 4790 and 256 gigabyte SSD but let's go through some of the stuff here bit by bit because some of it represents extremely good value now we picked up some 19 inch monitors for 15 a pop and they're really in season with just entry level gaming PCs you throw in a keyboard and mouse you get in one of these really cheap rigs you get here throw in a decent graphics card as long as it's got like a second gen i5 in it you are still able to play for at night especially with really decent fps and that's what it's all about but so those monitors they're great pick up and these ones here I'm probably gonna buy a dual stand and then have like a dual monitor setup going maybe with an office PC setup because they're really hard to source a single stand for them and it's gonna add a lot of cost to the bill but if you get a dual one can then sort of settle itself sell it it's pretty late as a dual monitor setup so that's that done the monitors let's go through these lenovo's here and check out what they're all about quickly because I ended up picking these up I think the guy said $25 a pop so that's incredible value for money but I don't even know what's exactly inside them so looking at these boards right here this is a a330 240 and there is unfortunately no RAM in this one at least I'll have to go through a few of them but you are getting a I believe it's a be 75 and so I can easily replace that with a lot of those I fives I have on hand add some RAM and I've already got the adapters for this so great especially for 25 bucks great repurposed job right here where the motherboard is really the cream of the crop here you even get to remove that IO shield and reuse that too so really happy with these lenovo pickups that is just probably I mean I don't know between that and the sunny Coast pick up with those 4 GPUs this one's really after looking at this this one's really coming up the list in terms of value for money so next up is the z2 30s we got these for 230 Asya pop the irony of the naming costing the same as the Aussie dollar but again SSD and the CPU and the motherboard and most more importantly I'd say the power supply is very crucial on this where you've got 400 watts available on the actual 12 volt line and that's pretty important because that means we can power GTX tense any absolutely no problems off this thing how did 16 gigabytes of RAM you get yourself pretty much a mid sort of higher range and gaming PC which it's really important to put together in this current climate because there is a bit of a demand for it but graphics cards going up and of course h80 1s and i7 is all going up and press it's actually hard to piece out that individually so this thing offers really good value for money in this sense alone considering what all these components are costing in this current climate next up is the dell optiplex --is these need no introduction than being the micro magic king of the modern era just slapping a graphics card you've got ample room in the case at an SSD if you need to but these were I think 170 Ozzie a pop and it's got RAM it's got a drive one terabyte drive included and of course you can use those power supplies and put in something even like a gtx 1066 pin and you should be good to go though we don't have a PCIe connector so probably have to use the SATA connection point here to splice off a 6 pin then use that for the GPU but overall pretty decent pickup I can definitely turn this into something magical with the monitor mouse and keyboard next up here we've got the Dell PowerEdge t3 10 with the BT X format so essentially all we can do with this is take out that GPU chuck in something else and then pray that things work but for what it's worth this one came included with some memory and it was only 70 bucks so case power supply motherboard and easy on I believe it's a i7 860 replica so like an X 30 470 inside this I haven't checked yet but 470 bucks it's an easy yes in my books considering all's we have to do is add that graphics card but another thing is to this power supply is very beefy so we'd be able to add in something like a 79 50 or 70 970 that we got since the power supply is really good and then that will give us a really good balance even in 2020 and then last up here we have the throw in which was from the guy we picked up the majority of Lenovo is from and that was an ace of fourth gen marathon but there's no CP or ram he just said he thinks the motherboard works he'll chuck it in as a bonus there was apparently some ants in there we can see the ant there so yes there was some insects inside this thing but hey I'll take it if it's a gift for tech yes city it doesn't matter if it's too old or we got a live one there there is and I mean it doesn't matter how dirty the part is if it's got insects on it or if it's got nature inside I will take it unless of course it's like core to jaw or lower because I've literally already got a Core 2 Duo pile over there and that just keeps growing because nobody wants it and here we are at the finale with this cool little mouse that LEDs threw in and I have never seen a mouse this small before so he made a joke and saying like yeah you know there's a kid that comes through once a fortnight gaming PC you'll have something to match his hand size and I laughed at first but then shock value hit me and I was like dude that's probably gonna be a real scenario so that's a cool little mouse I mean if you guys want me to send it over to rocketjump ninja maybe you can do a review on this thing where this seems to be a trend where mice are getting smaller and lighter this might be the next step of evolution where you can't even click the buttons it's that small but who knows who knows but I know one thing $10 for a power play where I've just got to get some custom cables done which I'm getting pretty used to doing that now with power supplies that are missing these cables and decent these are actually decent quality with this one here I think one of these in particular having this massive heatsink at the back of the power supply which I've never seen before in a power supply so it's pretty cool that some of this older stuff just had way more engineering and way more cool stuff in it as opposed to nowadays where it's all about cost-cutting and just getting you know the most cookie cutter stuff out there pretty much at any price point so cool to get a blast of the past of some of these power supplies and they're all tested and working which is good and now we're a conclusion time for episode 2 of potato hunter where this is the basically the birth of something new where supplies are stopping in every actions so it's basically coming down to the most common denominator and that is extreme micromanagement so what you're seeing here is me just taking on every single part I can get and as long as it's a decent price and funny thing is it's usually a filthy part or something's blemished or something like that and other people don't want the pots and then I'm gonna get a hold of them and then apply some tech yes loving and tech yes magic and make these things look better than brand new that is what we do around here and now with today's haul this was absolutely huge and to top all that off you've got people coming left right and center like yo heard you did a gaming set up for this price for my friend I want something similar so I've got to deal with all that stuff just coming through the channel now so I'm like really stretching it and I'm really strapped thin for time but one thing that's coming out of this is just exhilarating the whole process is reminding me of when I first went to Japan all those years ago and it was just it's sort of bringing back nostalgia and this is why this series potato hunter has been birthed because I want to show you guys essentially what I don't know when you mix Brian easy in with takia City what is capable in the PC world and that's exactly what we're doing here so if you know any guys around southeast Queensland who want to chuck those old pcs out as long as it's better than a Core 2 Duo then just send them my way and I'll even swing a few bucks their way because let's not chuck that stuff out let's recycle it especially now when all the new stuff and even all the other youth stuff that is really in demand is just going up through the roof the prices are just going up I know some people hear that a retail is they're actually going to other retailers and buying them all out of things like power supplies and graphics cards because there's just not enough supply to keep up with that demand anyhow with over 400 kilometers traveled here today we definitely had to add on some gas to this whole equation but the good thing is right now we're seeing gas in southeast Queensland down to like 90 cents a litre so all this trip and all those kilometers cost me a little bit over 20 ozzie dollars which is ridiculously cheap so that's one positive thing that's coming out of this and I did go online and did pick up some 78 50s for 50 Ozzie dollars a pop as well as some gtx760 s for 65 Aussie dollars a pop so I've got a few of those coming in to match some of these builds where I can really put those a cookie-cutter price performance builds together maybe if you guys want to see one of those builds here on the channel in a glorified video then do let us know in the comment section below but also let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite part and why love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this comment of the day here which comes from Lyons sin of pride and they asked kind of vs 450 power supply run an Rx 580 or an ir x 570 and the answer to that is totally 100% yes with those two graphics cards vs 450 is actually a decent budget power supply at least the newer ones I heard the initial v1 samples that came out years and years ago had some problems but I know the versions and reiterations after that had absolutely no problems whatsoever though do keep in mind when I say that it's absolutely fine with those two gravis cards that's considering you're not overclocking everything in system to the hilt so if you're going out and say buying a Rison v 1600 or an X 56 50 and then overclocking the CPU with a water cooler and then gonna overclock your rx 580 sky-high then you probably need a better power supply but if you're just getting something like even a verizon 5 1600 not overclocking it and then grabbing an rx 580 that power supply is gonna be absolutely fine I hope that answers that question and with that aside I'll catch you guys in and another tech video very soon if you enjoyed this one and you know to do hit that like button for us and if you stayed this far as always and you're enjoying the potato hunter in all its glory and you know yes something you want to see that content the moment of drops be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now but [Music]
