welcome back to tech yes city and today we've got black friday tech deal specials and i've looked high and low all over the internet to find the best deals for you guys and let's get on with the first section here which is actually coming in the form of laptops and pre-built where we've got here a 144 hertz screen and an rtx 3060 laptop with an i5 10 500h that's a six core 12 thread and that's going for under a thousand dollars and if you want to get into gaming and you've got absolutely no gear then all you'll need is an external mouse which we've got a deal couple of deals coming up on that later on so if you want a little bit more power then we've got an rtx 3080 laptop here of course not as powerful as the desktop gaming solution rtx 3080 but still going to be a great solution for those who want a high-end gaming experience especially with a 240 hertz included screen and an i7 11 800 h which is eight cores 16 threads and it's going for eighteen hundred dollars after you get that one hundred dollar rebate and of course the price is already down as well on the flip side if you want a dedicated desktop gaming rig then we've got an i7 eleven seven hundred and an rtx 3060 ti and 16 gigabytes of ram this is going for 1600 now the thing about the desktop discrete gaming graphics cards is that crypto miners are picking these things up so i don't think you're going to be able to find a deal on a dedicated desktop gaming graphics card that this will perform a lot faster than an rtx 3060 ti or 3060 gaming laptop so it's got more power though if you are looking for a laptop and those other deals get sold out then there's an rtx 2080 super laptop from razer going for sixteen hundred dollars and this is also packing a three hundred hertz screen and an eight core ten eight seven five h so not a bad deal if you want last year's model at a really good price so if you're in australia and since i am an aussie bringing the tech deals to the scene then we've got here an rtx 3080 laptop and again with an i7 8 core 16 thread this is going for 2 659 aussie after you use that coupon code now of course the aussie dollar is a lot weaker than the united states dollar so this would actually bring this under 2 000 us dollars and of course we do pay 10 tax included in these prices and that is free delivery so it's bringing it pretty close to that united states deal that you guys are getting so not bad but if you want to save a bit more on a gaming laptop and you are in australia then we've got an rtx 3060 with a ryzen 7 5800 h a core 16 thread and you can get this with 20 off for 1700 aussie dollars which actually makes it one of the best laptop gaming deals i've seen this year so if you are building a gaming pc or you're getting a pc where windows isn't activated then we'll move on to today's next sponsor which has got some of the best deals in the year for their keys and now the next deal coming up for black friday is actually a channel sponsor here scd keys now in november they do a whopping 35 percent off if you use that coupon code bftyc now the first deal you can get this on is of course that windows 10 pro key which is the most popular you can get this for as little as 12 and 80 cents typing in that bftyc and then clicking apply the one thing i like about the windows 10 keys is you can also use them for windows 11 but me personally i even use windows 7 keys still to this date now if you do want an official windows 11 key they've got those they're a little bit more expensive for 17 and 90 cents after you use that coupon but the last deal they've got is the office 2019 keys going for as little as 38 when you use that coupon code and the good thing about these keys is that you can link them to your microsoft account so you don't even have to install it on a new pc with the key you just link it to your account then you can download it from your microsoft account on even something like a different laptop or your main pc so i'll put some links in the description below for these deals let's get on to the next one so if you want to build a pc here's where there's some really good deals on individual components and first of all we've got a ryzen 7 5800x going for 315 usd on ebay it's a really good price for this cpu considering it's one of the best gaming cpus you can get right now and coupled with ddr4 memory and the motherboards being priced a lot better than the 12th gen stuff this does make it a very good proposition for high-end gaming now also if you want to get a similar cpu but even cheaper for 290 dollars we've got the ryzen 7 5700 g now the thing about this is it's a little bit slower than the 5800 x but it does have a gpu portion built in so if you don't want to get a discrete graphics card right now because of the horrendous prices then you can just game on this thing for the time being and wait for those uh graphics card prices to come a little bit better especially with intel making gpus right around the corner too now we've got a b550 itx gaming motherboard here from asrock i've used this board personally really solid board it's pretty much a high-end board even though it's small it's actually a really good price 150 save 50 bucks on this board though if you want a cpu motherboard and ram combo then here's where aliexpress have a phenomenal deal on a whole set here for 131.90 this is with a 6 core 12 threaded xeon tested the xeon in the past and this will give you a really good value for money experience especially when it comes to pc gaming but also like 1080p video editing this will do a fine job too if you want to get one of the cheapest cpus in the game that will play games extremely well and this is the 10100f this is the cheapest i have seen this cpu at 91 i haven't seen it cheaper than this brand new and of course you can couple this with a mid-range graphics card it's going to do a phenomenal job now motherboard's the cheapest i could find a motherboard for this is around 79 if you can find an h410 motherboard for around 50 then i'd definitely snap that up but now we're moving on to the next category and this is monitors where i'm either looking at for me personally it would be getting the best value monitor or just getting the best of the best period so we've got two picks here the first being the lg ultra gear 144 hertz 24 inch and it's also ips and it's got freesync 277 so phenomenal mono if you want to get into competitive gaming or just get a really smooth experience though speaking of high-end gaming this is the lg oled now you're probably thinking 48 inch but this is some of the best screen you'll get and i've got one of these in my studio and it's just absolutely phenomenal i've got the 55 inch but when i've seen the 48 inch here going for under 1100 i'm just jealous because i paid a bit more for mine and this is just absolutely phenomenal this price you've got 120 hertz 4k oled and the best response times as well as phenomenal input lag on this thing i haven't seen the oleds cheaper than this this is an absolutely amazing deal now if you're in australia it's the same deal i haven't seen them any cheaper than this in terms of aussie pricing nineteen hundred and fifty nine dollars but you can also get it with a hundred dollars off so it makes it eighteen hundred and fifty nine aussie dollars for the best monitor you'll ever get for pc gaming period as well as watching whatever programs and tv shows you'll get a really good watching experience there too but if you're in australia as well you can get 24 inch 144 hertz monitor from msy going for 239 aussie dollars this is from aoc really solid monitor for the money but now we're moving on to components and peripherals and here's where we've got the snowman and for me personally it's going to be the snowmen since i'm going to be buying a few of these up anytime these cpu coolers come in under 20 i'm buying them and out under 17 for 16.90 for this black friday sale this is a phenomenal deal now what you get here is essentially a cooler that'll be much better than the race stealth or the stock intel coolers so if you want to upgrade your cooler for cheap this will do a good job but it's also a great cooler for just builds in general where you've got say 47 90ks or cpus that come in with no coolers and you need something that's budget but also reliable this is one of the if not the best value cpu cooler especially at this price out there on the market now we talked about gaming mice before but here is where you've got the razer death outer which is pretty much a staple in the industry this is going for 23.17 you got the choice of black or white though if you want a smaller mouse because the previous mouse we just featured the deathadder that is a palm grip style mouse meaning it's a bigger mouse if you're like me and you have a claw or fingertip grip then the logitech g102 is another staple and especially at 14.38 cents you get this with a choice of white or black and this is just absolutely phenomenal mouse as well i've got both these mice here in the studio i've actually got two g102s because they're just that good for a reliable mouse that is going to give you a great gaming experience though next up here for coolers if you want a cpu cooler and you want high-end cpu cooling so for me it's i guess you've seen this with the monitors and it's the same with cpu coolers it's either get the best value or just get some of the best but at this price it's some of the best value too 65 dollars after a 30 rebate for a h159i rgb platinum this is my main go-to cpu cooler besides the h170i which we'll get onto next but phenomenal job it'll handle all the highest end cpus like the 12 900k 5950x do a great job of keeping those under control and also extracting some overclocks but it does say here is refurbished but as long as you get a warranty with that it should be absolutely fine but then next up we've got the best all-in-one cooler i have seen to date this is the h178 elite compelling i'm actually using this in the background here you might see it in some of the videos i record i've also done this with the build but this is for 140 mil fans coming in at 180 after you use a 20 rebate so this cooler will pretty much cool anything without making barely any noise and i pretty much rival that of high-end custom water loops so if you need a headset and you don't want to break the bank then the hs45 cloth edition is actually a really good pick for 35 dollars me personally i would pick the cloth over the leatherette i do have leatherette and cloth headsets here and the cloth seems to last a lot longer after a certain amount of time some of the leather headsets especially if you've got sunlight coming into the room they can break down pretty quickly but if you want to get a 7.1 surround sound thx headset then the razer kraken at 53 dollars certainly provides some pretty good value for money though next up we've got a keyboard here mechanical linear switches from evga it's got rgb it's even got what looks like a really good wrist rest included this is going for 45 dollars down from 130 the last section we're going to move into is memory and ssds if you need ddr4 memory a 32 gigabyte kit 3200 megahertz cl 16 so we'll do fine for gaming but also giving you that extra storage then at 93 dollars this silicon power stuff definitely looks like it's a really good deal you've also got the 16 gigabyte kit going for under 50 too so that may be worth checking out if you're building a new pc but if you need storage one terabyte ssd from team group going for 71 but if you need the m.2 nvme style then that's going for 73 dollars so really good deals on storage on that department but if you need something that's really fast and you've got a motherboard that supports pcie 4.0 then the gigabyte auris i've got this drive here in the studio i've tested the speeds out this thing is phenomenally fast and 140 it's a really good deal the last up is the deal for the aussies and it comes to ddr4 memory i'm actually going to be buying a few of these sticks after this video and this is a cl 16 3600 megahertz rgb ddr4 coming in at 99 after you use the coupon code so really good memory not just in terms of the price but also the speeds too that's all the deals i could find where it was a really good price especially compared to the historical prices i think on black friday there will be some people out there or some retail outlets that will just jack up the price and then take a discount off and make it look like they're giving you a deal but when you compare it to the prices of the stuff in in the past it's actually not that good of a deal so do be careful of that here in today's video i did pick out a lot of good prices that i found on this stuff that's beating that of prices i've seen in the past for this gear so i know it's a really good deal when you look at its actual raw price for what you're getting does that aside do let us know in the comment section below if you've got any good deals that you've found and if they're really good i'll i'll put them in the description because some of the deals though you've got to be very quick especially if they're heavily discounted sometimes these deals can only last 10 to 20 seconds but do join us in our discord as well i'll put the link in the description below if you've got some really good deals post them in there too and we'll be active there as well as twitter i'll be posting up some deals on twitter as well so do get ready to save some money and get some of the stuff that you've been looking for hopefully it's on sale but when it comes to those discreet graphics cards i don't think they're going down in price the crypto miners are just hanging out for them all the time looking to snap them up the moment they go even close to msrp which sucks right now i'm just hoping this crypto mining craze will end and we can get some normal gravity prices so we can get back into the glorious pc gaming golden days like we had before 2020. anyhow guys do let us know in the comment section below your thoughts and opinions love reading them like always just like this question of the day here which comes from xenon and it should be zeon i'd like to see it without the end there and an x at the front and that would be a perfect name but wait will an optiplex 750 work with these motherboards so this question is referring to yesterday's video where we took a look at converting a dell optiplex from the office pcs into a full-fledged gaming pc with the led bling and everything and in the end it worked perfectly we got around it and we didn't spend much money at all and he's asking if this motherboard in particular the 750 because we used a 990 in yesterday's video they're asking if this 750 motherboard will work and from what i can see here the 750 motherboard should work but it is a different layout it looks like it's got that same 5 pin power adapter as well as it looks like it does have the same proprietary fan connectors so as long as you pull the fans out and you um then do the work around for the power connector you should be able to get it to boot but it does look like it's got a front input output permanently integrated into the board so i'm not sure how that would work in terms of mounting into a gaming pc case but also there is the possibility that you'll need the power adapter 2 because this looks like it's got a 6 pin power connector instead of the 24 pin so you need to get an adapter for that but overall it does look promising it looks like it should work though of course i can't guarantee that as i haven't used the motherboard personally i hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
