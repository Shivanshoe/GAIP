welcome to the next installment of can
yes fix it. This is that episode that happens once in a while where you guys
send in your broken parts or stuff that just has weird problems and you want to
see if I can either give it some tech yes lovin' or I can try some janky
methods to try and get this stuff working again, and today on the desk we
have so much stuff that you guys have sent in and we're gonna go through the
letters here just like this one here love the channel brother keep up the
awesome content and you guys have to know by now that that feeling is mutual
I love you guys too let's move on with the next letter here we've got from
comes from Ben and they say hey Brian this B150 M board has been giving me
some issues I think maybe relating to RAM it has a three short beep code and
it is beyond my abilities to get it to post I've tried both Kingston HyperX RAM
modules and Corsair modules but it just won't post thought this would be a
possible contender for a Ken yes fix it episode good luck with this one Ben he's
got these ins to handle they're plugged and then we got the next letter
Brian greetings from sunny Singapore I love watching all your videos on YouTube
this is an old motherboard that I've managed to save from a junkyard in
Singapore I'd like to see you working some magic on it for an episode of can
yes fix it or can yes wash and make it work again I would love to see you in
Singapore and going on a used parts hunt to stay safe and healthy and keep the
content coming but the most important thing out of that message is definitely
stay safe and healthy in terms of a used parts on in Singapore if the road ever
takes me there then you know what's gonna happen it's gonna be some mad
deals on wheels hopefully if I can get wheels in Singapore I don't know the
situation there but here we've got the next letter from Kevin over in the
United States and they say Brian thank you for inspiring me to get into PC
building as it has become quite profitable for me and very fun you're
persistent positive energy and great content is something to look forward to
every time I log under YouTube I don't know how often you hear this but thank
you for your hard work and please know that you make a good impact on the lives
of your viewers a little about me I've always been
computer nut and a car guy I became an automotive technician and I credit my
success in that field you know my experience with computers as a type of
person who continually looks for alternative sources of income
supplemental income I found that building and selling pcs is
the best complement for my experience with two kids at home and wife building
PCs in my garage it's a much cleaner and less time-consuming side job that my
kids enjoy as well choosing to take on a new venture and become a PC builder
started when I discovered your channel thank you for everything you do on your
channel and thank you for sharing your knowledge with the world and thank you
so much Kevin I really love reading letters like this and that's part of the
channel is just yet showing the whole journey along the way and sharing the
tips and making everyone grow together this whole tech community when I first
got into tech it was just a world full of open minded intelligent people and I
love that it's still that way in 2020 and I love the fact that it's helping
your life and it's helping your beautiful family thank you so much and
they also said one more thing Australia has always been a place I
wanted to visit and once before considered relocating there if I'm ever
in the Gold Coast area I owe you a beer I'll definitely take you up on that
offer I love me a good beer anyhow with those letters aside we've also got some
other packages that were sent in everything here is on the desk we're
gonna segment this whole video into different sections where look first off
we're gonna start with gravis cards go through them see what the problems are
and then quickly see if we can get these working again the simple process to go
through here is to give it a clean initially then if it doesn't work after
that we can then try the heat gun method after that we're gonna segment into
motherboards and we've got a few of these that we're gonna try out here and
then we'll after that go into these two laptops that were sent in with problems
and then lastly some faulty ddr3 memory let's roll that intro and start this
massive plethora of PC parts here and see what unravel [Music]
so starting off with the GPUs we've got a massive pile here but what we're gonna
do now is sift through them and quickly see if they either give out no signal
or they have a problem where they artifact in Windows or the device driver
just simply doesn't install now one of these scenarios if it happens and that
is the artifacting or there's weird glitching on the screen I'm actually
just gonna take the coolers off that and not even bother with the heat guns
because I've heat gun to this date a lot of GPUs and the only GPUs that have come
back to life fully from the heat gun method have been ones that have either
given out no signal or given us a b2 error on the debug readout so basically
they're the cards that we're really looking for here and we're gonna pull
them aside and then give them some proper tech yes loving and then a heat
gun session so let's start smashing through these cards right here and see
what the verdict is [Music]
so this Radeon 79 in but it's only working fine off the DVI to VGA adapter
and so this is a thing you can try as I guess before you take it to the heat gun
and that is maybe the HDMI scaler in the GPU is gone and so running it through a
VGA cable can still extract performance out of it and can still make it work
absolutely fine so this is this graphics card here it
doesn't need to go under the heat gun but that being said the future of the
card itself means that it's going to have to work with a VGA monitor or a
monitor that has a VGA in like this AOC right here [Music] you so got one more graphics card here that
had the exact same problem as the 7950 and that is the HDMI scale is gone
worked through VGA perfectly fine [Music] [Applause] [Applause]
so out of all the GPU testing we did we've got four GPUs that work fine these
two here just need I guess to clean up and this one here needs the cooler
attached properly this gtx 680 came with like a water cooling kit that is on the
CPU and the GPU in one 240 ml loop so i guess it would work well with say an i7
3770k or something like that even on the 240 mill loop both overclocked on GPU
and CPU these two here are VGA only so going with the DVI 4-way so you can see
the horizontal and the vertical line there that means it's actually got
analog support built in so that the ports were using from here on in as
opposed to this port here is DVI only so DVI a works fine on both of these so
they're good to go they don't need any extra work done to them and but let's
move over now to the balcony where we're gonna start the next process so now
we've got all our cards here on the table this one is not going to get a
cleaner or a heat gun unfortunately it's the RX 470 and when I booted it up it
quickly got into Windows and then said there was a memory error so this one's
just that old that the memory has now degraded to the point where no amount of
heat gunning or cleaning or tears loving is going to bring it back so useless
card but these are the ones on the desk here they all have a chance in my
opinion so what we're gonna do now is brake cleaner them down and it's just
the quick and easy method of course if you've got time and you want to save a
bit of money you can wash your components down just make sure you dry
them up 100% I have done this in the past but break clean is the quick and
easy method and it does clean off all the dirt and grime and then after that
we're gonna go through each of them with the heat gun and we'll quickly go over
the settings after we've done the break clean
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Applause] [Music] and now we've prepped all these graphics
cards we are ready for the final phase or the Hail Mary and that is the heat
gun and I've got this set to about two-thirds of the way full because I've
found that's the settings that's worked for me in the past and now you want to
give it around six to eight minutes but what and what you mean by six to eight
minutes is if the PCB and the card and the die especially is smaller then that
gets less time you can even get away I said five minutes on something like a
GTX 10v two TI but if it's a bigger card like this gtx 780 here we can give it a
good eight minutes of just straight heap now for mounting them up i've got two
little pieces of our four mount them on the side without the bracket here so
that way it's not i guess all the heats not sink
sinking into the table here though with that aside we're gonna get on the weight
of heat gunning all these cards and see what comes out of it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
so our first card which is the r9 270 we've fixed this it is working and
initially I just put the little hate thing on to save time because if it's a
goner it's a goner but this one showed some response and now we've put the
cooler back on it with stress testing it and it's looking like it's a-okay we are
now 1 for 1 [Music] [Music]
and now here we are with the next card that is working and it's came back to
life this is two four six now so we did come into quite a few duds all in a row
here but this r7 370 seems to be working absolutely fine so I'm pretty happy
two four six I'm pretty happy with this hail-mary method so here is now our 780ti that didn't
even boot and give out a signal before it is back it is working absolutely fine
giving us some pretty good FPS and the temperatures actually look really good
too on this model now this is the third of the seventh graphics card that we've
got back here so I think like at least with this method I'm doing overtime with
the heat gun I'm saying I mean I'm starting to just get decent at it where
you know how long to do it you know what temperature to do it on and you know to
give the components the best chance they've got so man this one's just like
I'm super ecstatic about this one because I think it got sent in and it's
just like the person thought it was just gone like they thought it had no chance
it's a Hall of Fame and we've given us some tech yes loving too so it's looking
schmick as well right on that table man this one's actually this one this
one's hit the fields now we're on the last graphics card here which I did
bring back in a previous video I forgot exactly which one but the FPS on this RX
570 was just like dipping and going up and down up and down now it's back and
stable like a hundred percent after the second round and I I guess it's just
that you just got to work on that technique with the heat gun and here it
is here rx 570 now back from the brink and that's some really good news because
I think we're now full graphics cards out of 8 which is the highest success
rate I've ever had now here's the four coolers for the ones that didn't make it
and the good thing about this is we've still got the coolers and especially the
fans so if I come into a GPU in the future that has a busted-up fan or
something like that or it's just got a really crappy
reference cooler or some really weak cooler then I could definitely see
myself using one of these three coolers this one here yeah I mean it's really
cutting it I mean this is probably why that 1050 Ti didn't make it in the first
place okay we've got three good coolers in the bag so now we're on to the
magical world of motherboards and I'm going to give these
a complimentary tech yes service this is on the ones that look really clean and
as we have done previously in other videos which is going to give the pins a
light clean down because I've had some really good success with that except for
this one here which is an am-3 socket motherboards so we'll get onto that and
then see if these boards have been sent in that are working or if their faulty
if they're faulty we can then maybe give them a more thorough cleaning or see if
they need some sort of bias update or something like that to get them going
[Music] so out of those first five motherboards
three of them worked absolutely fine they were giving out a signal and
everything was good to go now one thing when you're testing motherboards you can
go through them pretty quickly like I do here if you just got a basic stick of
memory and also just a basic graphics card this here is like a 56 70 and I
just plow through them and so the signs that you're looking for basically
hopefully a keyboard post and that you at least get some kind of a light out of
it that means you can do some further cleaning you might want to dip it in
water and just thoroughly clean the board but in this case the azouz board
just switched on and then switched off after 15 seconds and it was just giving
out no signs at all even with a different ddr4 memory sticks so the big
150 was a no-go the msi h97 when we turned that on it just literally
like switch quickly on and off so something is inherently faulty on that
board to the point where you're gonna have to replace a faulty part on it
because you just quickly go and then it would short out and then if you try to
turn it on after that it just wouldn't turn on at all and so none of the lights
or none of the diagnostic lights worked either this was just a completely faulty
board though the good news there we've got three or five boards working however
the next lineup of boards here they are absolutely filthy so they're gonna need
the brake cleaner they're gonna need a thorough cleaning so let's get onto
these and see if we can get them to work [Music] [Music] so now we've finished up with the last
three motherboards and the gigabyte was the most interesting of the board's
because this one can work except it's going to need a BIOS where the main BIOS
chip actually is because it's currently missing and so when I acted the backup
boss to flash to the main boss that's when I realized oh this isn't working
what's going on and then I saw there was no main BIOS there so I believe this
motherboard could work if there was to be a main bar soldered back onto it now
I actually don't have the tools to do that in my studio here so I will keep
this motherboard around because I think it can come back to life in terms of the
other two motherboards the Biostar that was just complete junk it would just
turn on and it basically wouldn't give out any signals at all try different
memory try different CPU try different slots nothing and then the b85
motherboard we tried that as well and that was booting up and then I was
booting off in just this consistent pattern and the good thing about that
was I could play musical chairs with the RAM in that every time it booted off I
could quickly change the RAM slot without having to turn anything on and
off again just to test all the board out and see if it was total toast so there
we have it we've got I don't know what you call this maybe half a motherboard
because half working but we've got three and a half motherboards out of eight
working so far though the next thing we've got here is faulty memory or
memory that just doesn't work properly what we're gonna do here is wash this in
hot water with detergent and then after that we're gonna give it a quick heat
gun not too long we're only gonna give it a minute because it's a very small
sized PCB we're gonna give it a quick zoom over with the heat gun and see if
we can bring this memory back to life [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
[Applause] and we just finished off testing the
memory and we've got some really good news here that is three of the seven
sticks are now working again one of those being an 8 gigabyte stick so
that's really good news 16 gigabytes in total is back to life
and now we're gonna finally move on to these laptops which I do put out a
disclaimer their laptops pretty much not my field of specialty but I'm just going
to take a simple no-nonsense approach and see what I can pull off here so
we're now checking out the first laptop of the two and this one looks absolutely
fine it did have a message on their boot problems so we went into the BIOS and if
you get into the bar so that's usually like 99% of the problem solved and then
I saw there was only two-year bytes of RAM so we installed a 4 gigabyte stick
to it the to you back stick out because if you want to install windows
especially x64 Windows 10 you need 4 gigabytes of memory that's a
prerequisite so we put that in we set the BIOS clock to the current date and
then we reset the system and it seems to be fine I mean Windows is installing
right now we had to put in our own Drive so I just put in a regular 2.5 inch
firing you buy hard drive and it looks like this is fine
[Music] and now here we are at the finale with
this Lenovo laptop and we have removed the SSD we've removed the Wi-Fi we've
unplugged the battery and it still just boots cycles after being booed up for
like a minute so I did get into the BIOS and I did change the settings in order
to get this thing to reinstall windows but it has a problem where something is
inherently on the verge of giving up and it's faulty now this is the problem with
these laptops here and this is a big reason why I'm not big on laptops
personally and that is we've got GPU CPU we got RAM all on the same motherboard
so if one thing is faulty we've got to replace this whole motherboard in this
laptop so I don't know how much one of these is gonna cost and I mean I could
try I don't know I can try and put a heat gun to it but I'm not putting a
heat gun to it with the battery so close so I think we're gonna stop there and if
someone repairs laptops they can and specializes in this kind of thing maybe
they know exactly what's wrong with it but I've got a feeling that it's it's
one of these three things right here and because they're all attached to the main
motherboard the motherboard needs to be replaced
so this one here unfortunately is a no-go er but we did get an m2 SSD out of
it and also a little Wi-Fi card too and here we are now at the next morning the
conclusion we're actually filmed this last night but my microphone my lavalier
mic had a faulty extension and then that caused noise to come into the recording
and it was too late so I was like we're gonna get some sleep
get some yes sleep and then get Thunder charged for the next morning and what
we're saying here is the power of quick and easy and effective methods that work
and they work well especially with the gravis cards I haven't had that much
success with cleaning and a heat gun ever in the history of this channel and
this episode was definitely a big one in terms of the amount of stuff that we got
fixed and working again so we got a whole table of working parts
and in part it's thanks to these right here these chemicals so of course we got
the brake cleaner that's the quick and effective method for just getting all
dirt and grime off really dirty parts but also getting into areas where you
say for instance a USB port or something like that and it's clogged up and you
just don't have maybe the right tools to clean that out like a very small brush
or something like that with a thin bristle this will just get it all out
easy done and dusted and then of course this right here is the everything spray
makes stuff look good you can spray it on live electronics won't do anything as
opposed to the brake clean you've got to make sure it's all dry before you try to
boot that part up though what we came out of with today was just a really good
experience in that if you take your time with some of these parts and just go
through a process of ok it doesn't work it's not giving out a signal what can I
do I can give it a heat gun then you can get parts back to life now this 780ti
was for me the favorite resurrection of today where this thing was just showing
no signs of life before we gave it some tacky-ass love another heat gun and now
it is back to life it is fully working again and it looks like it's working
well plus after some techie ass lovin it's looking schmick as well of course
going through the motherboards I've been down this path so many times before look
for bent pins try one memory stick try resetting the CMOS and then after that
if you just kind of get anything out of it even if you try a different CPU for
example in a different memory stick and it's usually most of the time it's just
a goner I mean you keep it around try some different things you can even try
washing it that's a last case scenario but generally I find motherboards you've
got just a simple standard set of methods that you go through after that
you just don't bother with them you're just wasting way too much time and I
believe me you can waste a lot of time on a motherboard to get it working again
if you want to and then at the end of that you might not even get it working
again so you've just wasted a heap of time and I think the Ken yes fix it
episodes they do fact in that time efficiency and because you
don't be wasting a lot of time to when you're dealing with PC parts especially
if you don't have to so with the motherboards we had a few that worked
well we had a few that didn't work - and then the memory that was one thing that
actually surprised me because I thought all these memory sticks just would not
work before I tried doing the clean and the heat gun they just didn't work at
all they would boot with no signal but then after we did that we got 3 sticks
working again and that is Zeus p67 multiple that I've got pretty handy
because it's got that D Ram LED so if the RAM is causing the PC not to boot
that'll just flash up and let you know so and of course last up we had the
laptops and I got one of them just I think one of them wasn't faulty to begin
with it was just more a compatibility issue with Windows 10 and then the other
laptop it just had a really weird problem where I may try hate gunning
that and see what I can do with it but after I thought about it a little bit
more of a night I thought it might be the memory the RAM on board that because
Ram will cause a PC to boot in such a cycle like that where it's gone poomm
poomm poomm poomm poomm and since it did work momentarily I believe it has
something to do with the RAM who knows if you guys repair laptops and you
definitely know what that problem is be sure to drop a comment the comment
section below and also let us know in the comments what was your favorite
fix-up of today and as I said before the 780ti definitely wins it for me and also
if you've got some tips and tricks of your own about quickly fixing parts and
be sure to drop them in the comment section below
love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the
day via which comes from gray and this one's a really big one and they asked
I've been thinking of getting into reselling there is no shortage of x58
next 79 parts to be had cheap as well as 1050 TI's and RX 580 type cards is it
worth it in 2020 to buy these build them up and resell mainly in the
US market they still work decently as production computers and I can play a
fair amount of games at respectable fps I'd like to eventually get into x99 kits
too because the ability to use car Jen parts on many aftermarket Lobos is
there as well but even though many current v3
processes are reasonably priced for enthusiasts a full set up might be
overpriced so I'd like to start by building X 58 X 79 stuff people can
still get a few years out of before moving to X 99 any thoughts and when it
comes to PC reselling basically my thoughts are with that is if you can get
the deals then definitely go for it it's all about the price that you get that
stuff for and with X 58 and especially x79 those are two parts that at least
where I am locally you can find someone selling a whole PC and they're just
getting rid of it and you can say for a hundred Aussie dollars get next 58 mobo
i7 920 or it's usually a 960 or something like that 12 gig of ram
harddrive case power supply for that kind of money yes you can definitely
resell and make a buck it all depends on that deal that you're getting initially
in terms of the respectable fps in 2020 X 58 next 79 are going to deliver
especially with a 1050 TIR in rx 580 that's not a problem whatsoever
especially the six cores and on the XM e 9 these 8 core Xeon I'm going to be
doing a video on that soon where I'm going to be comparing that to the best
of the best from AMD and Intel we're gonna see how that fares but I'm also
going to be giving that a really hard overclocking to so in a nutshell yes can
definitely be worth it it's all about what price you get the stuff for and
with that aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button for us and if you've stayed this far and you're
enjoying that check yes content and you want to see more than hit that sub
button ring that bell because we've got also some input latency stuff coming up
and there's a lot of juicy videos that I want to get done this month that have
been on the back burner and I finally got time to do it so I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
