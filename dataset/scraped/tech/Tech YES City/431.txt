here we have another rx 5600 XT from AMD this time is from gigabyte it's the osya version it's got 380 mill fans on board and the cooler weighs in a little bit over 900 grams so it's similar to that of the azuz tuff which we took a look at in the previous video we did and I'll put the link up here where that came in with a base clock even after the BIOS update of having a the memory speeds at 12 gigabits per second effective speeds where we know for a fact that the RX 5700 and the 5700 XT have those four 10 gigabits per second speeds and then the sapphire pulse and now this model here I can confirm that after the v bus update has the 14 gigabits per second speeds now in the previous video I also and in this video today as well I'm going to show the overclocked numbers for the tough because that had a lot of headroom to overclock before the v bios update and also after in the fact that the memory speeds were able to go to that for linking bits per second which admittedly that's where these graphics cards pretty much top out in terms of overclocking and in fact I didn't even put overclocking numbers in today's results because the overclock sometimes fared a little bit worse on this graphics card meaning that it's pretty much found its max sweet spot out of the box so there's pretty much no overclocking Headroom now another thing that does bother me before we get into this review is that these cards have already started shipping and when I go into manufacturers websites I do see the 12 gigabits per second pretty much advertised everywhere I do see the previous before the V BIOS update results which I'll be showing you guys today I'm seeing them advertised everywhere as well and there's no mention of these V BIOS updates in the form of the actual product listing so they're not telling you hey go update the v bosse for some extra performance so pretty much the average guy who goes out and buys this card most likely as it stands right now and from what I can see is going to get that previous update and they're gonna be getting less performance than they should or at least a lot of reviewers are showing but it's great to see though that pretty much all the reviewers that I'm watching are doing before and after the boss updates to give you guys an informed opinion and here as well we're just showing you guys those results because it's important to know that a lot of the times these after V boss update numbers aren't guaranteed in that it does vary and I have confirmed this with a few different retailers now even after the V bias update you may be getting those 12 gigabits per second effective memory speeds it just depends on the board partner whether they feel comfortable in putting out a warranty on those higher speeds which wasn't maybe their initial intention which a lot of these models are carrying three year warranties on board though with all that nitty-gritty aside will quickly get through some of the numbers here and then get back and talk about this model in particular the gigabyte OSI 5600 XT which is retailing for about five hundred and sixty-nine ozzie dollars in Australia so it's coming in over seventy dollars over MSRP in Australia and then in America I think it's about two hundred and ninety nine so about twenty dollars over the MSRP [Music] so the first benchmark we've got for you guys is the 1080p numbers for fortnight and then the 1440p numbers well we see that this thing is pretty much trading blows with the 5600 xt tough when I manually overclocked it and as I said in the intro there's pretty much no room for more overclocking on this card so it's pretty much maxed out and lo and behold it's pretty much performing similar to that of the azouz toughed in this title the 5600 xt does score a victory over the RT x 2060 so if you wanted to get a graphics card before playing fortnight and for tonight only this would actually represent some pretty solid value for money though moving over the next game we've got for honor this was trading blows with the RT X 2060 and yet again pretty much coming in right on those 5,600 XT Tavo C numbers in strange Brigade we can both see at 1080p and 1440p this title does favour Nvidia graphics cards so the RT X 2060 did score out the victory both at 1080p and 1440p though when it came to shadows of the Tomb Raider verse at 1080p and 1440p these cards were trading blows RT X 2060 and also both the 5600 XTS one which was manually overclocked and the other which had its aggressive v bias update and Tom Clancy's division 2 didn't differ much from the norm where again we saw those trading blows at 1080p and 1440p then for the last title is far cry new dawn we're at 1080p and both 1440p numbers we again saw that similar trend of trading blows between the RT x 2060 and the 5600 x t so now summing things up the 5600 xt before the v bias update pretty much scored exactly the same as the zeus Tov model so and that it had pretty much the exact same v biased configuration in terms of memory speeds and also core clocks but then after the V bias update it did gain those speeds on the memory which caused it to perform similar to that of the tough when I manually overclocked it so if you guys are not into overclocking and at least with the first shipments as I'm aware to my knowledge you'll have to download an exe file which is really easy to do and then apply that update and then restart your computer you do have to make sure however you have no services open whatsoever I would do it on a clean install of Windows to make sure everything goes smooth because when I tried to update the v bosse on my machine it did crash the computer because MSI Afterburner was open as long as River Tunis so that is one thing to be careful of if you do get these cards make sure you update that v bias on a clean machine though under the power consumption numbers and here we can see the 5600 XTS both models i've got here are very power efficient even if they're overclocked or even if they've got an aggressive v bios on them though the gigabyte OC does score a few watts higher than the zeus tough and this actually has to do simply with the temperatures I believe we're out of the box this card and I'll pull up the affair curve profiles for you guys we can see here the auto settings only takes the card to 27% max and that does so at 31 decibels so it's ridiculously quiet though at these speeds the card will go into the 60 degree region for the GPU core so I measured up to 68 degrees and then on the memory it goes up to 82 degrees and then on the vrm 67 degrees so these numbers are absolutely fine especially since I'm testing in a twenty eight C ambient environment and when we compare them to the zoo staff model they are a little bit hotter but that noise trade-off is pretty good though when I started ramping up the fans to 60% manual static speed as well as 80% as well as a hundred percent the noise was pretty much unbearable at all three levels so we had 49 decibels 55 decibels and then 58 decibels and I'll let you guys have a quick listen to this thing at a hundred percent fan speeds because it was actually really loud it was getting near that of reference card levels and then lastly going over the other nitty gritties on this card we've got the typical three display outs and one HDMI 2.0 out of the back we've got an aluminium backplate which is actually made of metal so they're not going with that plastic backplate that they use on some of their models and then we've got a single piece a power connector and then there's a gigabyte RGB logo on the side which you can turn off and change the colors with the RGB fusion software mine for whatever reason always comes switched off I guess that's the way it likes it and here we are now at the conclusion of this graphics card and I'm gonna give you guys my opinion on what I think whether you should buy it or not or whether they should just hold out for now and I would say in America the price is pretty decent it's coming a little bit over that MSRP it's an aggressively clocked model out of the box carries gigabytes really good three year warranty which I can adhere to and I have heard as well from people who have bought these products locally the gigabyte does a really good job with their warranties so if you did come into any problems you'd be in good hands so in Australia this is coming in at five hundred and sixty 9rz dollars where the cheapest model I could find in Oz is about four hundred and seventeen nine ozzie dollars but what remains to be seen is will the average customer be getting these speeds that I'm showing after the update I'm still not a hundred percent sure but because on the product websites whichever website I go to it's still saying those lower boost clocks and it's still saying the twelve gigabits per second and I know that's a thing affecting the first wave of shipments but I'm still given people a recommendation and I don't like to be wrong because that'll come back on me they're the biggest thing that concerns me at this point in time is on those product display pages on the retails websites is there's no mention whatsoever about downloading this Exe file all the extra speeds that you can get it's just simply ignored period and so if I'm giving out a recommendation for someone I'm saying wow this thing's gonna perform like this and they go out and buy it and it doesn't I will feel terrible so what I'm saying is I'd like to see these retailer websites updated to reflect what US reviewers are actually showing in our reviews or the potential results that the customer can get and then stand by that and that would make me reassured and saying okay the first wave of shipments like AMD said came out with the lower clock speeds but you definitely can update those speeds and get better performance but as it stands I'm seeing no mention of it the old speeds are advertised and so I really don't know at the end of the day what the customer is going to be getting a hundred cent and that makes me feel a little bit uneasy recommending this thing and so if the future you comes to this video say in a month or a two months time and the product display pages on the retailers reflect these new speeds and it shows the 14 gigabits per second and it shows two seventeen hundred and 80 megahertz boost clock and the price is right that's the most important thing then this card will be a decent option for you but I feel like in Australia needs to come down by a bit and also in the u.s. it needs to really make sure it holds under that two hundred and ninety dollar price point I feel so this thing can come in at the 279 MSRP considering its three models it's aggressively overclocked out of the box then it will be a decent buy but ultimately as it stands in this point of time I am uncomfortable recommending a 5,600 XT in general even though the two models I've had come through here are solid examples of a 5600 X's he and also as I mentioned in the previous review of the Azusa Soph the market rates at the moment for our X 5700 s and also RT X 2060s are really competitive right now and the rx 5700 is gonna give you that extra 2 gigabytes of vram you also get a 256 bit boss versus 192 and you also get the option since we're talking about V bias flashing to flash of 5700 2 or 5700 XT and gain an extra 10 percent roughly on average for doing very little I'll have a video coming on that very soon and then on the RT X 2016 you get those extra features like ray tracing you also get a better onboard video encoder for h.264 soph your recording or streaming then the RT X 2060 is going to give you better image quality bit for bid then the rx 5000 series will give you and with all that out of the way I hope you guys enjoy today's review if you did then be sure to overclock that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below what do you think about this whole 5,600 XT launch are you loving it or are you hating it love reading your thoughts and opinions as always though speaking of thoughts and opinions we have the question of the day which from Caesar and tiller and they asked a hey yes man with graphics cards having zero rpm and does the RPM feature the zero rpm feature caused some strain on the bearings sporadically from zero to 30% then a jump from 30 to 50% for example according to temperature levels multiple times in a minute verse 2 if I was just to leave them at a static fan speed of say 60% this is like a really good question where at least to my knowledge fans are 12 volt Max and how you control the fan speeds is via pedo mm so you actually feed them a lower voltage and so with fans stop you're gonna have zero voltage and then it's going to kick in and give it some power to say go to 30% which might be 5 volt and so whether it's kicking in and out if that causes a strain on the circuitry I would say it definitely can cause more of a strain on the actual electronics inside the fan in that every time it stops and starts and it goes to a higher level it actually over volts the card to higher than what's intended to say for instance if it's over vaulting from 0 to 5 volt it might go up to 7 volt and so that's why in the grass if you look at your fan speeds with the fan stock technology sometimes you'll see these massive spikes and that's essentially the over voltage on the PWM going over to get to that particular speed from a previous level and so running a static 60% for example could be better for the long run in terms of the electronics on board but I'm not entirely sure because the max level is still 12 volt so maybe if someone in the comments has really advanced knowledge on this field with fans maybe they can chime in though in terms of the bearings themselves they should be fine I know for a fact if you're running highest speeds like a hundred percent versus a 60 percent then you will wear out the bearings faster because the fans simply working harder so hopefully that answers your question and with that aside guys I'll catch you in another tech video very soon and if you've made it this far and you're enjoying the content and you're not yet subbed maybe wish consider hitting that sub button or running in that Bell and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon but I'm actually going to be flashing at 5700 to a 5,700 XT and documenting the whole process involved so catch you next time he's out for now BAE [Music]
