[Music] and this is five minutes before the launch and then launch comes the whole roller coaster just gives out [Music] so early in the morning or late last night i'm in australia so it was a late launch for us the websites here in oz were all down they were flooded with traffic and you could get a little bit of website up and if you got that small time frame where that website was up for you and you use basically only text which is the most important thing if you want to get one of these cards and you know demand is going to be huge you have to put your browser into text only mode so that means not loading up the images and stuff like that because the servers are so overloaded they're not going to be able to spit out data enough so if you were lucky enough to buy one of these cards on launch then you were one of the very small few where i feel like this launch has just been a roller coaster this is the easiest way to describe it but let's of course talk about the problem first and then we can talk about the solution and the solution unfortunately ain't going to be one that's going to be alleviated anytime soon but uh let's get into it and before we do if you're new here make sure you hit that sub button for us and also hit the like button helps me out a lot on the youtube algorithm but what we saw here was nvidia issuing a public statement they said they apologize for the launch of the rtx 3080. now there's a few things that happened here right let's backtrack to when jensen live streamed the rtx 3000 event he hyped it up big time and then after that i'm guilty of this too youtubers are hyping it up and then it released and i thought the hype was real like this thing delivered it delivered in not only the performance but it delivered in terms of offering for me personally that hdmi 2.1 and that connects to those oleds and you've got 120hz 4k refresh it's absolutely gorgeous it's beautiful and so you saw this reality of this card was at 700 usd it was a really good buy that's if you could get it for this price now in america i saw the pricing on newegg and it was reasonable like they were charging 50 more for aib cards and i've got a review coming out on the tough gaming soon and the aib model i feel is uh justified i'd personally go out and pay the extra 50 bucks for the aib models i think they offer better cooling and with that better overclocks which if you're gaming at 4k you're going to want to overclock this thing to get more performance but we'll talk about that in the review when that drops so straight away the cards in the us were reasonably priced but if we go over to good old aussie down under where i am this was just a mess like all the retailers were charging way more than the 1139 aussie dollars i think uh ple and mwave actually had within the realm of realist pricing like it wasn't a complete ripoff but then there was other retailers that were charging 1700 aussie dollars this is the retailers and that's about 1230 usd for one of these cards and i tweeted about this i was like this is just too much like i mean the other retailers are offering it for 1400 aussie dollars where's the extra 300 aussie dollars on top coming from that's just pure scalp and this is the problem right here is that you've now got this additional element in 2020 where scalpers are coming along and they're buying up these cards without the purpose of using them for gaming without the purpose of using them for even crypto mining and that's the thing if you guys are worried about crypto miners you don't have to be because i've got a video coming out too where i've tested the crypto mining and it's not good people are not buying these cards for crypto mining so what's happening now is you've got a lot of demand from gamers and you've got people who realize that and they're buying up these cards just with the purpose of re-flipping them and we saw on ebay this absolute mess of people offering bids for pre-orders and then you had people that missed out on cards and so they went and trolled all the people who were selling these or scalping these cards and it just became an absolute mess and so that leads back to the problem of if you want to get one of these guys i know a lot of people want to get one of these cups what do you do about it and i don't recommend going out and paying double retail that's what the scalpers want you to do that's how they make their buck that's how they get justified to keep doing what they do and this is the funny thing if people think oh this is an nvidia problem this is not just an nvidia problem this is also ps5 the playstation 5. uh the pre-orders opened up at least here in australia they opened up yesterday morning and that sold out like pretty much really quickly and so now the playstation 5 that's sold out until 2021 that's pre-orders for playstation 5s so i can only imagine what happens when the series x drops where the series x looks like it'll perform even faster than the playstation 5. i think people are just going to go crazy for these new consoles but we're also seeing people going crazy for these new rtx 3000 cards so demand for these latest and greatest tech products in 2020 is simply it's at a level that's never been at such a level in the history of any gaming product really crazy demand crazy demand is gonna come these supply shortages because if anything at least at least you egg like i gotta say at least new egg i do give them props for not just blasting the prices out of reality and so that's at least that's one thing that came out of this that was actually good new egg didn't scout people so newegg kudos to you guys for not trying to scalp uh the launch prices but from here on in there's simply there's got to be a newer system in place that's the only solution for it and what is the solution well i saw some retailers doing raffle tickets and i'm and i know people will laugh straight away like what you've got to enter in for a chance to buy a card and really when you look at that the raffle system i think that's the only way to do it right now because that's the fairest way you're making sure it's not going into the hands of a bot and so this is another problem that's happened you've got these bots that are just essentially what a bot is is it's just a automated program that will do what you tell it to do in this case buy up graphics cards from the websites extremely fast and so that was a problem that's been around for a while now and scalping is nothing new i mean scalping has been it's pretty much been banned when it comes to tickets and events because you'll have an event and then you'll have so many people that want to go to that event and there's only limited number of tickets and so people who know that people really want to go to that event they'll buy up the tickets and then resell them and make money this was traditionally where scalping sort of really came into play with people wanting to profit from it and so now it's affecting the tech scene and it's affecting the tech scene big time you're going to have scalpers and this is going to go on for years because of the supply shortages and because of the world the way it is people are staying home more than ever and when they're staying home more than ever they're going to be gaming more than ever so when you i guess you're essentially now dangling these amazing products and look these products are good and i'm sure the ps5 and the xbox series x they're going to be amazing just like the rtx 3000 series and so when you dangle these products in front of people they're going to want to get them they're going to want to get their hands on one and so going forward with the video i think they're going to have to be put on notice and say hey we need more supply before we actually announce these products and release them but at the same time i know why they want to get their product out first they want to be the one with all the eyeballs on them and same with the playstation 5 right that pre-order came out of nowhere they want to beat xbox series x to the chase so they want to get their product out there first they want to build the most hype but the problem is you're now creating a lot of frustrated people who want to get their hands on it and they can't so there has to be a balance there has to be a better system for people buying these cards even the raffle system i agree with that and there also has to be more supply before you actually release these cards now in terms of the rtx 3000 i heard that these cards are going to be much more in stock towards the end of october and so at least in australia now when it comes to the us i guess they'll get shipments beforehand so i'd say mid-october you guys could probably expect some more cars to come in play but you've also got the rtx 3070 coming out so i'm guessing around that time frame you're going to have both those cards hit with a bit more stock and of course there's the rtx 3090 which i can only imagine if that has the demand that the 3080 has then you're probably gonna see these things go on for two and a half thousand usd or four thousand aussie dollars i think when people laughed about those prices part of me was like no i think that's a possible scenario so to break it all down for you guys the hype was real the demand was real but the supply wasn't and that's the problem right there is the supply and so nvidia they have to be aware of this and they have to say look when we launch these cards we have to at least do some kind of a survey and realize hey maybe we should hold back the launch until there's much more supply in stock that would make it fair for everyone and sure if you want to create the hype just let the reviews go up and just say due to making things fair we're only going to sell these a month later i know it might seem like a crazy idea but at least you're going to have a lot less frustrated people out there and this goes for the series x and also the playstation 5 they're going to suffer the exact same problems where they're going to have supply shortages too and so i feel like in 2020 now with all these amazing like gaming product and as i said before the hype is real it's justified the rtx 3000 like i was gaming on that on oled 120 hertz it is something you want in your life and i'm not going to lie about that i'm not going to beat around the bush to try and downplay this card it is freaking amazing in every sense in the world like you're going to see me already seen me in my founders reviewer yesterday i recorded that after no sleep and i was still excited in that review today's review of the tough gaming when i look at that it's going to be even better because that card is like in my opinion is better than the founders so you've got these amazing cards coming out and they're good and kudos to the companies for making really good leaps and bounds for gamers in 2020 but now there's this new problem out there and it has to be addressed and i guess you have to think of a new solution things are ever changing right in this whole world things always are changing and you've just got to adapt survive and thrive and so i mean well nvidia's already thriving but i feel like they've got to adapt and just let the gamers that they're targeting thrive as well because at the moment man i don't think the gamers are surviving out there they're like damn i want to get my hands on one of these cards and i can't get my hands on one of these cards what do i do and the only solution right now is to simply wait and this is the problem you've got guys like me i'm telling you how good these cards are and you want to get your hands on one and you're just frustrated because you can't and so that frustration is is not good it's not a good thing anyhow guys that's all from me today if you enjoyed this one then you know what to do but with that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from mitchell sobol and they asked is there an lg oled monitor that can do this yet or is it only the tvs and yeah unfortunately it is only the tvs right now that are giving out the oled gaming experience and i've been harping on in my monitor reviews for years now that i want to see oled gaming monitors and no one's doing it but lg's doing those oled tvs and trust me this is what your eyes need basically i keep hopping on about i'm like a broken record here on the channel they put these cheap blue leds in the back of your monitors and they sell it as gaming products and your eyes do not see detail through blue period they see it through green and they see it through red and so oled emits light through these green and red spectrums and it's good for your eyes it's much better than uh cheap blue led white leds because they've got a yellow phosphorus layer on them that are going in the back of gaming monitors and it's funny because even the older ccfl backlighting technology when lcds first came out is better for your eyes than these leds are so that was my biggest gripe with it the fact that lg are offering these oleds in a form of a tv i just want my eyes to feel comfortable again with gaming so and if you don't believe me look if you don't believe me what i'm saying you can go out to uh a depot store go buy a little uh blue light a low blue light for when you go to sleep and just try and read a book with that low blue light on as opposed to say a little green light or a red light and if you do if you use the blue light you'll suddenly realize that your vision is diminishing the quality of your vision will diminish very quickly but basically don't do that i've been there done that it's an experiment that is just i don't want to go back there again it was horrible anyhow i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] yes
