there is some REALLY good news and it's finally come in the form of a blog post which i got alerted to this morning when i woke up about an email from nvidia and that is with the rtx 3060 which is right around the corner it's only another six days away from release this card has got nerfed cryptocurrency hash rates mainly for ethereum and of course with ethereum if you guys didn't know that's the main cryptocurrency that people are mining right now with gaming graphics cards because it's the most profitable and in the ways it can something like even an rtx 3080 that can bring you in ten dollars a day profit and that's usd i've got a video coming out on that tomorrow with an rtx 380 review that i had to do for colorful where they uh sent me an email they're like look we want you to review the 3080 and then when i got it in i'm like well this whole crypto thing's gone really bad to the point where it's going to be a very different review but this is some really good news and it's really welcomed finally in the industry where people who have seen all the rtx announcements they're enthusiastic about pc gaming they can finally get their hands on one of these graphics cards and know that miners aren't going to buy them up so some of you guys might be a little bit skeptical where this is sometimes just news and there's actually no truth to it but i've actually got someone in the scene and i'm not going to say their name they were using the graphics cards for cryptocurrency mining they got their hands on a 3060 and they sent me some screenshots that showed that the ethereum hash rate actually starts off around 47 ish mega hash and then it drops down into the 20s so what nvidia have implemented in the driver set here for the rtx 3060s is something that will drop around 50 indeed let's talk about some of this good news and what it means for gamers and how much you can realistically expect to pay for one of these things based on some of the research i've done here straight after this sponsor spot if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code pftyc you can get yourself a legit single end user windows 10 license today links in description below so straight away let's get this blog post out the way we'll read it for you guys read it back with a bit of more enthusiasm because it's something finally to get enthusiastic about and here it is we are gamers through and through we obsess about new gaming features new architectures new games and tech we design geforce gpus for gamers and gamers are clamoring for more yet nvidia gpus are programmable and users are constantly discovering new applications for them from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics mining cryptocurrency is also one of them with the launch of the geforce rtx 3060 on february 25th we're taking an important step to help ensure geforce gpus end up in the hands of gamers so let's quickly pause before we read the rest of this and talk about getting gaming graphics cards in the hands of gamers because i know there's going to be some people out there and they're going to argue with me they're going to say it's a free market brian doesn't matter if it's a gaming graphics guard if i can buy it and use it for what i want to use it for therefore i should use it for what i want to use it for and from my research no you should be going out and buying an asset miner and there should be much more asic miners available these are application specific integrated circuits and they are designed to mine cryptocurrency much better than a gaming graphics card and they're also more efficient which means they're going to be using less power they're going to be better for the environment and they should be making you more money so that whole argument of it's a free market yes if the gpu was the most efficient choice i wouldn't disagree with you but since in the world of cryptocurrency we've got two different ways where cryptocurrency is the future some are saying we've also got that other path where there is a lot of corruption within cryptocurrency itself and for me personally when a lot of these cryptocurrencies made their algorithms acid resistant that's when i started to disagree with it and a lot of the arguments made for the acid resistance really in my opinion when you look at it logically it falls flat and so gamers have suffered in 2017 they've suffered in 2018 and they've had yet again to suffer in 2020 and 21 but let's keep reading this blog post here with halving the hash rate rtx 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm and limit the hash rate or cryptocurrency mining efficiency by around 50 percent that only makes sense our geforce rtx gpus introduce cutting-edge technologies such as rtx real-time ray tracing dlss ai accelerated image upscaling technology reflex superfast response around yeah okay nvidia we get it you're doing a quick marketing plug here within this uh text but it's all good it's all good let's continue on with the news to address the specific needs of ethereum mining we're announcing the nvidia cmp or cryptocurrency mining processor product line for professional mining cmp products which don't do graphics are sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency they don't meet the specifications required of a geforce gpu and thus don't impact the availability of geforce gpus to gamers for instance cmp lacks display outputs enabling improved airflow while mining so they can be more densely packed cmps also have a lower peak core voltage and frequency which improves mining power efficiency creating tailored products for customers with specific needs delivers the best value for customers with cmp we can help miners build the most efficient data centers while preserving g-force rtx gpus for gamers so first things first the by around 50 that is looking very true from the shots that i've seen here and i'm showing you guys the next thing is the uh cmp line the nvidia cmp line looks extremely interesting because of a few things and that is first of all with the lower core voltages and lower frequencies that means that they can use a lot of gpus for example a lot of yields that didn't make the cut for the rtx gpus they can now use them and sell them to crypto currency miners so that looks like it's a big win for nvidia from not only in the fact that they can now get a lot better yields on utilizing their product stack but also the gamers can get the gpus that were designed for gaming so let's look at these specs right here we've got four different gpus that they've announced for cryptocurrency mining and first of all the 30 hx this is 26 mega hash and it's 125 watt one eight pin and six gigabytes of vram and it's available pretty soon so this honestly looks like similar to the numbers that we just saw here on the rtx 3060 that with a 12 gigabyte that someone sent us over with the screenshots and honestly the power consumption on that i think it was like a 118 watt that they were burning up this here looks like the vram's been halved and the mega hashes are coming around the same after the driver nerf anyway so either they're using an older say for instance like a 1660 super uh gpu die for this or they're using the newer stuff but they're making it severely lower in performance to the point where it's performing the same as an rtx 3060 i mean hopefully if they release this 30 hx the price reflects that and doesn't push people to buy an rtx 30 60 12 gig anyhow though next up here we've got the 40 hx which the mining hash rates don't really make any sense from the uh rated power of 185 watt so for instance i know the 30 60 tis they do around like 60 plus mega hash and you can get them down to like 120 watt and they've got eight gigabytes of vram too so 3060 ti is definitely going to be looking like miners will still buy that card up if these hash rates are true for ethereum hashing next up here we've got the 50 hx and that is again looking like it's inferior to the rtx 360 ti yet again with higher power consumption it's got 28 pin requirement 10 gigabytes of vram which does suggest that it is based off of the rtx 3080 uh gpu in that they're using that same die and they're using the same memory interconnect and the boss on that but the hash rates do look awfully low compared to what an rtx 3080 is capable of doing where i know that that's capable of doing 90 mega hashes because i just tested that yesterday where i'm doing that and i'm going to be talking about how bad it is for gamers right now to buy a graphics card but next up is the 90 hx which this is falling right in line with an rtx 3080 and that's got a 320 watt uh power rated power here suppose with the rtx 3080 they should be using around 220 watt and they're getting around 90 mega hash so their rate of power consumption numbers here are probably a worst case scenario but they should use a lot less power if these numbers are anything to go by compared to what the rtx graphics cards are already getting in terms of hashing as we can see here we've got 10 gigabytes of vram again so what they intend to do with these cmp lineup of cards remains to be seen until someone actually gets one in their hands and takes the cooler off and takes a look at what they've done versus the rtx 3000 cards that are already out there on the market but regardless of the cmp lineup one thing that we can be certain is the rtx 3060 is finally going to be the first card that's come out in the rtx 3000 stack that isn't going to be appealing for cryptocurrency miners at least in terms of what gamers are going to be prepared to pay for it versus what a cryptocurrency miner is going to be prepared to pay for because around 25 mega hash versus the 60s plus on the 360 ti a lot of cryptocurrency miners will go for the 30 60 ti and especially having better power efficiency what this means for the rtx 3060 is this is going to be the first time in 2021 that we're going to see the raw demand from gamers determined the prices of this rtx 3000 series card versus the previous four that have been released from nvidia where the miners lately have just been going on a binge buying up all these graphics cards and paying stupid prices from where i went on ebay the other day and it's two thousand dollars these are the bids well these are the buy now prices that these cards are actually going for 2 000 us for a car that's meant to come in around 700 us dollars that is insane markup i've never seen that before even in the 2017-2018 boom i did not see anything like that and so hopefully with the rtx 3060 it doesn't go above 500 us i'm hoping it stays below that line because i know a lot of people have been messaging me like brian i just want to get a graphics card like i want to get something decent and play games in the curved pandemic and i know i've got to overpay for it what should i do and so the rtx 3060 is finally looking like a card that will come closest to msrp versus the others in the bunch and now we've got that question of the 329 usd what are these cards are realistically going to come in at and looking at all the demand out there all the gravis cards are getting bought up at overpriced prices because people just want to play games they want to build a gaming pc and then they've got the demand from the crypto miners coming in so i think these cards will go anywhere from 400 us to around 500 us that's just me being realistic with you and seeing what's going on in the market right now hopefully the retailers and also mainly the distributors i'm looking at you guys when i talk about the distributors hopefully they don't raise the prices too much on these cards because i have heard some crazy stories even in the last few days of apparently under 100 units of rtx 3080 cards coming into australia like that's for all of australia for all models 100 rtx 3080s which is ridiculously low and so you can see where those uh distributors are sending those cards before they even hit retail shelves anyway guys that's about it for this main piece of news here i thought i'd make a dedicated video on it because it is a big topic of discussion right now where crypto is just making this insane amount of demand on top of already highly demanded products during the worldwide covert pandemic and i think it's just a breath of fresh air for gamers who just want to get a card and just want to play some games they don't want to get involved in any of this other cryptocurrency stuff and bitcoin to the moon and dogecoin they just don't want to bother with it because it doesn't really interest them what interests them is actually not going out of their brains because they can't go outside and do what humans were intended to do and that's move around anyhow guys if you enjoyed today's video then you know what to do hit that like button and drop a comment in the comment section below letting us know what you think about this news right here one thing for certain is that nvidia as a company i'm pretty certain that they do not want to repeat anyway themselves of 2018 because that really hurt them as a company where there was all these cards that were getting bought up back then for crypto mining and then once crypto mining went bust all those graphics cards came back on the market and that actually hurt nvidia's stock price as well as them getting i think a filing as a lawsuit against them so they definitely don't want a repeat of that and this news definitely correlates to them doing the right thing for gamers but also them doing the right thing as a company for themselves and i think having these two things co-aligned finally means a win for the gamers though in terms of the previous cards that have already been released the 360 ti the 30 70 30 80 3090 i don't think they're going to get any similar driver nerfs mainly due to the fact that again that could probably put nvidia up for a lawsuit if they've sold previous products that were working as intended in a particular way but then they don't longer work in a particular way so that's some bad news for the previous four cards that are released but at least for the future cards being released here on in there is a solution and hey a 30 60 12 gigabyte is going to be nothing to complain about if you're going to be able to game on one of these things you're going to have a really good time anyhow guys we got the question of the day here which comes from msi max overclocker and they asked quick question is this mod just for those cpus listed i was looking at a 2699 and also if i can use this with an azus board with b clock adjustments to be applied thanks for the video and they're talking about the x99 xeons which you can get for really cheap off aliexpress we did a video where you can unlock the turbos to the max multiplier and that just gives you extremely good value so to answer that question directly yes you can unlock all the xeon skus in that fourth generation lineup though do be careful because you've got to make sure they're not engineering samples and they're the actual retail samples with a certain micro code so do watch that video do look out for that because if you buy an es you can't do it and talking about the zeus board i believe you can do it but you have to unlock the bios first with a bios modding program and then you have to actually use the flashback utility on the back of the board instead of trying to update within the azus motherboard bios itself anyway i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell to get the content as soon as it comes to your sub boxes and i'll see you in the next tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
