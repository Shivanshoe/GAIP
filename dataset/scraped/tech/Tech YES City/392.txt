the world is in a very serious and weird predicament right now and in times like these one can only seek refuge in a zeal or I guess should they seek refuge in a zeal that is the question for today's video that I hope to answer where we've got an 85 26 78 v3 which features 12 cores 24 threads and the thing about this is it's coming in at 110 US dollars shipped internationally the accompanying x99 motherboards at least on Aliexpress they're actually really good value for money where you can get the machinist x99 which is the one that we used in today's video can also get the atomizer as well as the one and Z and I do recommend getting the one and Z out of all these three motherboards if you can afford the extra because it does add a very good value proposition to this CPU which we'll talk about a little bit later in this video but firstly let's talk about exactly what this Xeon is and why it's so good at its current price point and that's got to do with the fact that it's an old Xeon server CPU that's now becoming mass available on the use market the motherboards are cheap and of course the accompanying ddr3 memory is very cheap if you get this particular version now you do have to do your research with these CPUs and hopefully these videos will help you out in the process if you wish to buy one of these because what I'm holding right now is the 26 78 v3 which is pretty much exactly the same CPU as the 2680 v3 the only difference really is that this is actually a better model in that it supports DVR three registered as original 2680 v3 and also the 26:20 and 26:40 v3 they don't support ddr4 registered I did take a look at these CPUs I'll put the link to that video up there where they're going to be a better recommendation in my opinion for gamers and someone who wants performance now and just wants to save as much money as possible and go with say a four by four gigabyte ddr4 solution of memory now let's move on to the gaming benchmarks and one thing about these CPUs is that I've unlocked all the Xeon v3 as you see in today's graphs I have turbo unlocked them and so if you buy one of these you will want to turbo unlock them as you're going to get the max servo multiplier on all-cause which really extracts the value for money out of these particular Zeon's if you're interested in buying one of these CPUs and doing this mod for yourself then I'll put the link to that video up here now let's pull up the first gaming benchmark where we can see a trend that's going to develop through these games where F 1 2019 this CPU right here the 12 core Xeon actually lost to both the six core and the eight core when I paired it with an RT x20 atti and even though it was losing in these graphs it's still an absolutely fine score especially if you want to get on say 144 Hertz monitors whether they're IPS or TN this is still gonna be a great CPU for that they want a shadow of the Tomb Raider just like f1 2019 you weren't really gaining anything from going up four cores and eight threads on this particular title and the six core was actually winning out the value for money proposition here and the eight core was doing the best in terms of its max performance on these v3z on lines it is overclocked a hundred megahertz higher however so you see there with the max multiplied as being 3.2 3.3 and 3.4 between these three different Zeon's though on to fortnight showed that at high settings the 12 cores Ian of course was doing very well scoring 264 average FPS the 17.1% loads were good if we stop this down to say low settings with epic distance 100% render scale we were getting extremely high FPS so this 12 cores ian has no problems doubling down as a gaming CPU if you want to be competitive at fortnight they're continuing on this is where the good news stops for the 12 core pulling up Assassin's Creed syndicate we had significantly lower FPS than the 8 core in particular and I can only guess that this is just due to the game not really being well playing nicely with this 12 core 24 thread where the 8 core was beating it out and even the 6 core was getting a better score too though on the far cry new dawn this showed the same trend as Assassin's Creed syndicate so the value for money proposition is this being a gaming CPU it's starting to look a little bit lower and when I moved over to talk off I actually just had to can this benchmark because the game was just playing up I could not get it to run properly where it was getting literally ha the FPS that it should be getting and of course the eight core and six core did a lot better when I tested these in the past so basically as it stands games really have to be optimized for 12 cores 24 threads or at least not be buggy with this CPU in order for it to work properly as we saw a fortnight works absolutely fine with this CPU f1 2019 works pretty well too but some of the games like Assassin's Creed syndicate and a talk off especially we're just not running up to par so coming out of those gaming benchmarks the six and eight call variants not just within the Z online but all other ranges we're doing a better job than this 12 core right here so as it stands I think games aren't properly optimized for any more than eight core 16 threads and going into the future we've already seen the PS 5 specs and Xbox Series expects touted and they're pretty much gonna be 16 threads max as well so you can see going into the future that the 8 core 16 threaded CPU is going to be the best play for at least than foreseeable future in the next few years I'd say at least another four years and so having the extra 4 cores and eight threads there is really only a good option if you know you're going to utilize that say for instance you're gonna be playing games and then maybe watching movies or streaming and editing videos while you're streaming at the same time or you're Dischord Skype or if you want to make a new meta in the streaming industry you can be streaming while you're playing games and watching poor I'm sure the viewers will absolutely love it and you can do that with this one hundred and ten dollar CPU right here they wanted some productivity benchmarks here's where this twelve core really starts to shine out and I feel like if you're going with a workstation first gaming desktop second this is where the CPU is really going to put in the value for money punches where if we look up first of all 7-zip we can see here the compression numbers is actually beating out that of a ninety nine hundred K the decompression numbers are still very respectable against these higher-end CPUs here I'm moving over to thee I'm not gonna pronounce the name because I don't want to get deep monetized 1.3 benchmark again this was scoring a really respectable score with a hundred and fifty nine seconds and that was coming in the same league as the the CPUs here which cost a lot more they move over to Geekbench board we had a very good multi-threaded the score of course 12 cores 24 threads and then the single thread was lacking behind a bit and this continues on into Cinebench are 20 where the multi-threaded score is very impressive scoring over 4,000 points and then the single threaded scores coming in the same range as the other two Zeon's of course the last thing to talk about is the power consumption where the CPU is going to use up 120 watts once you unlock it in practically every benchmark that has a hundred percent CPU utilization and you may notice from some of the b-roll that I'm showing here but the CPU doesn't always stay at three point three gigahertz all-cause and that's because of the 120 watt TDP that Intel implemented with this CPU pretty much motherboards using these server chipsets have to pretty much strictly adhere to that 120 watt TDP rating it's different as opposed to overclockable motherboards that TDP score in my opinion doesn't carry as much weight in the enthusiast market as it carries in the server industry so once the CPU hits 120 watts it then starts to down clock to around three to three point one gigahertz so if you're doing a heavy workloads that's what you can expect this thing to all core at and then if you're game you can expect it to go to three point three gigahertz all caused all the time though with all that out of the way this CPU here makes an excellent balance CPU that's going to last you a very long time whether you're gaming or whether you're going to be making a cheap workstation where this is the I guess I said it's the jack-of-all-trades and I didn't say it was the master of none because it is the master of one and that is value for money what I'm holding in my hand right here is 64 gigabytes of ECC register ddr3 memory and now I got this 480 Ozzie dollars which would just be a little bit over 50 USD and when you look at the price of that memory and compare it to ddr4 so if you want to go with say rise in CPUs or something else that's newer and latest and greatest you're going to be adding to the cost substantially when you can pick up yourself some cheap ddr3 registered memory make a good 4k video editing rig on a budget and you're still going to be getting very good performance so that's where the extra value of the 26 78 three really starts to pull ahead and that's why in the intro I did recommend that if you guys want to get this CP you go grab yourself that one and Z which then has the four memory slots for ddr3 and basically there it all is with the twenty six seventy eight v3 now some things do consider as well is if you're going to get the CPU don't go out and buy expensive ddr4 or ddr3 memory and that goes for all the v3 turbo models here when you do the turbo unlock because they've got quad channel memory and the motherboards use server chipsets you're not going to be able to overclock the memory on that though you can actually overclock the memory but it's not guaranteed and it's a very tedious process where you've got to manually inject text into the BIOS and have it lock those as default profiles and if you screw that up then you're just going to be wasting yourself a lot of time and that's where the benefit also of ddr3 comes in where it's already got those low timings and 1600 megahertz and then you quad that up you're going to have pretty much essentially the similar speeds to thirty-two hundred megahertz on the ddr4 side of things so really good value proposition there I like this CPU where it's coming in at though keep in mind it's not the best dedicated gaming CPU it's got all those extra calls and threads mainly if you need them and if you know you need them or you want to say gear up a PC for the future then this CPU is definitely gonna be one worth considering especially when we look at and actually will tie this in with the question of the day where Israa Litton and I like the name Ezra's watching that on the Star Wars rebels there's Ezra it was pretty cool they asked why would someone do this instead of buying used Rison 1600s mp3 50 motherboards basically this is where the differences they explain what the ddr3 registered and also the fact that this is readily available at the moment in this current time in this period of what we'd call chaos and so new rising stuff I know for new rising stuff to rosin five sixteen hundred AF I'm going to be doing a video on that but I'm gonna wait until that comes back in stock because what I'm seeing is this CPU starting to get sold out everywhere this CPUs still in stock and it looks like the shipping lines are starting to clear up as well so if you order it you'll probably be waiting the typical three to four weeks rather than what I had to do and wait like literally two months and also the ddr3 registered motherboard that I ordered that got canceled like right at the last minute so I've had to reorder that and it's unfortunate because I was going to do a x99 budget I'll Express motherboard round up for you guys but that'll have to wait probably another month or so now so I look forward to giving that video for you guys so do let us know in the comments section below what you think of the twelve core 26 78 v3 would you get one or wouldn't you get one if not why if so why love reading those thoughts and opinions as always and if you guys enjoyed this video and be sure to hit that
