[Music] [Applause] today we have here a pc that has been fully submerged in flood water in queensland in australia now when i heard about this computer i was actually very upset to hear the story and if you guys didn't know recently in southeast queensland there was massive flooding and a lot of people got their whole homes destroyed and in ways a lot of their lives were affected heavily by this and so me are hearing this story about the person losing their gaming pc and that they think it's just completely gone and they're just reaching out for help when i heard the story i decided to jump on this one and also another pc that we did in yesterday's video i'll put the link up here where this one is going to be much more of a difficult task where this pc here today was again fully completely underwater it's even got traces of mud going through this graphics card this is going to be a very difficult fix but it's one that i'm definitely going to attempt to do and try my best to restore this back to life now there is one key component here when i heard this i think we might have a chance of getting this working again and that is after the floods the person did not try to boot up the pc which is very important because if you try to turn it on and there's different circuits that are shorting that can completely destroy the components so it was some decent news to hear that they did not try to boot the pc up and that's anything electronic if it's been submerged in water don't try to boot it up so what we're going to do right now is take all these components out and then take all the heat sinks off and bring them back to their bare raw form and then we're going to put them in the ultrasonic cleaner and let the tech yes loving begin that's what if you guys watching this for the first time that's when i clean the components up as best as they can be and try to make them look like brand new never pay full price for windows 10 or 11 again with today's video sponsor scd keys you can get activated as little as 15 using that coupon bftyc links in description below [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so now we've pulled this whole build apart and we've also pulled the heatsinks off the gravis card and the motherboard and we've also taken about the power supply we can start to put this stuff in the ultrasonic cleaner so i'm going to put the most important stuff in there first that's the ram the cpu the motherboard the cooler the gpu and then from there we'll try and clean these components and then dry them out and then give them some multi-purpose spray one by one and after we've cleaned out all the components and got them all looking as clean as possible again and there's no water left on them i'm then going to try and boot them up but we can see even by looking at this msi cooler here on this graphics card the rtx 3070 ti you see that this thing is definitely looked like it has been in better condition in a previous life so we're going to try our best to restore this to its former glory [Music] so while our ultrasonic cleaner is busy cleaning up with round one we're gonna start cleaning up some of the bigger stuff as well as bathing down case screws and then specialty screws and uh letting them sit in multi-purpose spray just to get any rust off and clean them up and we're also going to be hosing this case down and these other brackets with multi-purpose spray 2 to try and lift off this real sort of ingrained flood water rusty water that has sort of made this case look like it's aged also this fan i forgot to take this off i will take that off now and place it in the round two of the ultrasonic bath but uh let's get cracker-lacking [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so we have now finished the ultrasonic clean round one and what we're going to do with these parts is we have to dry them all out which we're going to use a data vac for which is meant for dusting but i actually use it to completely dry the parts off and then we're going to apply some multi-purpose spray especially to this cooler here since it did clean the surface but in between the fins is still really really dirty in my opinion so we're just going to give this the best chance we can give it and then we're going to hope it all works out [Music] [Music] and here we are after drying off these parts and then spraying them down with multi-purpose spray i've actually pretty much used up almost a whole can in just today's video so far but what we got right now is parts that are ready for the initial test i want to really if i can get the motherboard cpu and the graphics card the ram and the ssd to all work that's actually going to be the most like happiest part for me because that's pretty much the core of this build that will be working again the all-in-one cooler and the power supply i will get onto them if this stuff ends up working because they're a little bit more finicky especially the water cooler i i have to i mean it won't open in the core of the water cooler so that's going to be something i'm going to have to figure out but at least with this stuff if we can get the most important stuff working i think it's going to be an absolute thriller [Music] and that right there check your citizens is how it's done we've booted up into windows we've got a signal everything has booted up and that's the main component that is the most important part the ssd works the ram works the graphics card looking like it's working fine too jake wherever you are right now you might be seeing this and hopefully this at least put a smile on your face because i'm pretty confident we can get this whole thing back to the way it was before it got rummaged [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so this right here tech yes citizens is what it is all about we have this pc booted up and it looks like it is functioning a hundred percent now i've still got to run it through some stress tests which is what i'm going to do now just to make sure the cpu temperatures are fine when we stress it the graphics card make sure that is fine when we stress test it but i don't know if i'm more excited or jake's gonna be more excited because this right here is my biggest testament to date getting a pc that was submerged in flood water and bringing it completely back to life and every single component is working so i like i'm actually shocked that we got this all in the end to come back that's like i don't know guys let me know in the comments what you think about this one because this is that that tech yes loving it's i think it's peeking out right now because this is just i don't know i'm kind of a stag i'm i'm actually really shocked i thought something would be damaged in this system but we've got it even all the fans are not there's nothing there's no noises no odd noises the uh all six fans are working the leds on this screen it's perfectly working and the water cooler as well you may be thinking well maybe the water cooler's not working properly but the water i can feel it it's flowing through this pump and it's working full force it's absolutely fine now i also decided while i was at it to change the orientation of the system a little bit i uh moved two of the fans up to the top here and created a bit more rgb in the middle of the build and also the aorus fans i decided to leave the rgb off on those as to reduce a bit of clutter but as well jake won't have to install any additional rgb software on his desktop so i thought i'd make some personal changes as well as removing those uh two custom cables on the motherboard and gpu uh those the reasons i took them off and i tried to avoid using those cables was because they were just saturated in flood water and they were the softest material in this build so even if i did clean them in ultrasonic cleaner i believe they would still carry a lot of that flood sort of water like saturation in the actual cables and uh in the process we also reduced the cable clutter as well so this build let's uh let's wrap it all up and do some stress testing [Music] [Music] i don't know [Music] and after playing some games for a couple of hours we had absolutely no problems but a smooth experience and this pc is now ready to hand back to jake and hopefully there can be some smiles that comes out even after a devastating event such as a flood but today's journey i have absolutely spent we took apart this pc piece by piece and then we cleaned it down with the ultrasonic cleaner after that i had to do some additional cleaning with the multi-purpose spray especially where there was bits where there was a little bit of surface rust building up and then we took that off we dried it all down made sure there was absolutely no water in the parts and then we applied the multi-purpose spray again just to protect the parts and hopefully give them a long-lasting future now hopefully one thing that comes out of this video is if you guys have friends that have pcs that got submerged in water say they're at work at the time and they couldn't get their belongings from their house at least if that pc hasn't been turned on since and that was actually something uh really good that jake did was he didn't try to turn this pc on after the flood and so that means there was a chance to get this stuff working again and so what we did here today was just showed you guys that if you can clean the stuff down and then dry it the same day and give it a very thorough clean down then you can get the stuff working again and i was actually shocked to see that every single component on this pc started working again all four of those eight gigabyte sticks are registering they overclock with the xmp profiles and also the ryzen 75800x is running completely fine as well as the graphics card and even the m.2 with all the data is still retained so there's no losses to jake except some custom cables but i'm sure jake's going to be able to live without those custom cables and with that aside guys i'm gonna now jump in the shower and give myself some tech yes loving you know what guys we're just gonna leave that one in there and uh do let us know in the comment section below what you think of the after with this gaming pc do you think we did a good job here today and also if you've helped out people as well in similar situations then do leave a comment below let us know those stories i love reading them just like this question of the day here which comes from phoenix phoenicia and they ask hi i'm planning to get a new pc i need your advice about the pc specs below and so they go through the pc specs and basically they say do you think it's worth the total price for the specs above need some suggestions thank you so basically looking at this you've only got eight gigabytes of um ddr4 memory now i'm assuming that's a single stick so you'd want to get two eight gigabyte sticks for dual channel with a new gaming pc especially with the i5 12 400 f and the rtx 3060. so what i would do just by looking at the specs here everything looks pretty solid except i'd try and add in another eight gigabyte stick and if you're on a strict budget what you can do is i'd probably say go with something like a gigabyte b660 it's going to be absolutely fine with an i5 12 400 f then use that remaining money that you've saved going from that msi motherboard to get that extra eight gigabytes of memory and then you'll make it so there's two sticks of memory in the motherboard and you'll have a great smooth gaming experience hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell to get the content as soon as it
