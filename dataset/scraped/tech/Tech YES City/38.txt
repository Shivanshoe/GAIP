with the recent crash in gpu prices here in australia one has to wonder if you are sitting on some stock especially if you sell gaming pcs is there a way to mitigate the damage and today we're going to be actually mitigating some of my own damage where this is the main one here a gtx 1080 ti i paid 650 for this card and also then because it had a water block on it i had to buy an aftermarket cooling solution and put that on so this owes me 700 aussie dollars now i'll put the us dollar pricing up on the screen for you guys so you can roughly work out how much it would be in your area but this card right now i don't believe in the current environment it is worth that 700 aussie dollars where i recently picked up personally a 30 60 ti for 670 aussie dollars delivered so i'd much rather a 30 60 ti than a 1080 ti so now we're sitting in a situation where i was going to put this in a gaming pc and i kind of got caught with my pants down so i've got to fix the situation and today i'm going to be fixing that situation pretty quickly but what we've also got here is a 1050 ti a 1050 a 970 and also a 1660 ti now the prices i paid for these i was actually very happy with the prices i paid i'll put them up on the screen for you and i don't really have much to worry about even if gpu prices come down more because i got such a good deal on these cards i really am in no sweat where i have to rush out and sort of do something quickly but with this gtx 1080 ti we kind of have a problem that we've got to fix very quickly [Music] so we've just picked up a gigabyte 650 watt power supply for this build we got this for 40 aussie dollars we've also picked up the rgb case with the four fans that's 60 aussie dollars and i ended up from another contact i know they do tech upgrades and they're kind of like a little tech outlet and they had an older z87 motherboard with six gigabytes of ram that they do this for 50 aussie dollars so we're going to add in an i7 4790 into that put a cooler on top and i've also already got a 120 gigabyte ssd 2 terabyte hard drive so all up we will be putting this rig together uh for under a thousand aussie dollars now with a 1080 ti so we've gone and got the other deals to make this rig happen for a relatively cheap price to offset the higher cost of the graphics card relative to the market so that's the most important thing for me i'm like okay how can i sort of make lemonade with those lemons and this is the thing right there they're rotting by the day those lemons are rotting by the day so you've got to use them up faster before things could get potentially worse we'll talk about what could potentially be good when we get home we'll build this rig up make sure it's okay then we'll talk about possibly what could potentially get worse are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message and if so today's video sponsor fcd keys has you covered for as little as 14 using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro 2 link in the description below [Music] my [Music] and here we are now with the build finished but you may notice one thing with this pc and that is the gravis guard is literally taking up four slots in this build i actually haven't put in a card that is a four slot gpu in any rig i've ever built or sold so this is my first time using the morpheus cooler and we have mounted two 12 centimeter fans to it i don't know if there's some particular model of fan that you should be using with this cooler but i'm hoping that this will be either like one of the best things for this pc or it could be bad we've got to see ultimately what the temperatures perform like in games so if it runs a benchmark and the temperatures are extremely low for the gpu we can then kind of use that as like a wow the coolest 1080 ti on the market like figuratively and literally so we got that uh set up and the pc is just running like really humming along it's quiet really extremely quiet but also we've got these red cables that came with this gigabyte power supply and they kind of spice up the build a little bit so overall i'm really actually happy with what's come out of this price performance like on the surface so far uh with the gigabyte power play though um i'm pretty sure this is the one that's not the bad one i gotta double check that which i will uh but i think anyway with a non-oc cpu with the 4790 and a ti if we maybe perhaps even under vaulted that's actually another good idea uh 1080ti we'll run it out of the box and then we'll undervolt it see how low that we can get the temperatures over ambient because i mean maybe if we get a 40 something degree running 1080 ti that would be actually pretty cool [Music] and now we're here at the final stage of the flip that is we're gonna put it up for sale and we're gonna put this one up actually for sale for 1100 aussie dollars i think we'll be able to get that just because that cooler in the end did perform really well with the under vault and here's where we're going to report on these results a little bit where it went up to 64 degrees and in heaven it ended up getting under 6 000 points just out of the box default but then when we upped the memory speeds lowered the core clocks a bit lowered that voltage we were then getting 54 degrees maximum but also the score was higher we came over 6 000 points so that was really impressive to see that an undervolt works extremely well on a 1080 ti and of course the best part of all that is that our power consumption went down from 394 watts from the wall for the whole system down to 298 so that's nearly a 100 watt drop from the wall just with this under vault and i'm kind of like if you guys remember i used to use quite a few acceleros back in the day when they were going really cheap i think they're like 30 at one stage for sale that was the triple fan accelero and people told me to use the morpheus they said get the morpheus give the morpheus a go i never really bothered because the morpheus was more expensive than the accelero but trying it out today the morpheus sort of i think is not as good as the accelero so be some people out there that probably don't like that but maybe it's because i put on these two cooler master fans that were just lying around maybe you can get much better fans for instance probably the noxual fans would do a better job but the accelerator already has the three fans included so that was definitely leading the race i feel between accelero versus morpheus they're back to the matter at hand and that is the flip and potentially losing money in this kind of market now i've had a few people on our discord talk about they got these gpus they paid higher prices for them they were in the process of trying to do some flips and these prices are coming down they're worried that they will lose money and for me i'm only worried about this pc really because that 1080 ti as i said before we paid 700 aussie dollars in total and i feel the market value where i am locally of the 1080 ti is going to be about 500 aussie dollars now especially when the rtx 3060 and the 3060 ti they just crashed down in prices where i'm locally in the previous video that we did i'll put the link up here i talked about how the 360 ti where i am locally i picked one up for under msrp and that's 670 aussie dollars that's brand new rtx card got all the latest features faster than a 1080 ti and that card was 670 delivered so we can see that i got that card cheaper than this 1080 ti which i got back a little while ago and it's just much better value now so that's how quick the market can change on you and so you don't want to be caught with your hand in the cookie jar so to speak and be called out by these market shifts because what we're going to see now and i said this last year i expect the next year in 2022 to be a roller coaster and so this is definitely the beginning of that rollercoaster ride especially on the way down and so how long this is going to go down for i'm predicting gpu prices will keep coming down until september of course in the on the way there may be some sellouts at retailers and whatnot the prices may move a little bit higher but in general i think the prices of gpus are coming down just simply because of that massive threat of institutions dumping cards on the market because of the move of of ethereum from proof of stake but even if they don't move over to proof of stake on ethereum i was told in june anyway there's going to be this massive increase in difficulty which will make the miners definitely not as profitable as they are now so pretty much the writing is on the wall at least for crypto mining in terms of especially buying these new cards at those higher inflated prices and then just trying to make profit on them but as it stands i think mining is still profitable from what i told and actually it was really good i spoke to a few different retailers and what was going on in the market was that even in australia these cards were getting shipped to australia and some of the retailers were then just selling them back overseas to other countries with massive mining demand and not even selling them to the public here so that's some more information i found out uh today and i was kind of a bit shocked to hear that because it's like you've shipped it all the way to australia okay there's not really that much institutional mining going on in australia so we're going to ship them to the countries and they're paying ridiculous amounts for these cards and then they're gonna essentially take them out of the hands of gamers so it's been a big problem where gamers haven't been able to buy these cards but now it seems like a lot of those institutions have stopped buying the cards and now suddenly there's this massive supply on the market for the gamers and of course the gamers aren't prepared to pay anywhere near those ridiculous prices that were being offered beforehand and so that's just sent the market into a complete talus spin almost in like a week and this was just insane and i'm hearing people in the u.s now are getting really good deals on gpus they're coming down a lot in price in the us it seems like australia was kind of like the first foot in the door in terms of leading the way in these prices but what we're seeing right now is the whole market is having to react now to this and that's me included a person who does sell gaming pcs and i've got to be quick to make sure that i don't get caught out even more because if some of these newer gpu prices say for instance an rtx 3080 does come around the msrp and it's just readily available in stock and say for instance an rtx 3060 ti can be had for those prices day in day out that's going to put massive pressure on the used market which means the prices will have to drop there as well meaning that pretty much everything in general will come down in price so new and used gaming pcs will be able to be built a lot cheaper and already they're going to be built a lot cheaper as we can see with me i'm just getting this 1080 ti which i believe three months ago i would have been able to score around 1400 possibly even 1500 for this rig instead i can i'm now trying to get 1100 for it so you can just see the massive drop off there and i'm just hoping to crawl my money back and not lose because i just hate losing and that's one thing i don't know about you guys but i just hate losing and i generally over the time of doing flipping i can't really off the top of my head picture one flip where i've lost money and so i want to keep that trend up i don't want to be called out and this is me just reacting with that final gpu that i paid i feel back then it was okay but now i feel like it's not a good deal so i'm going to try and work that out and fix that problem without losing money but going forward if you want to get into pc gaming i feel like it's going to get a lot better finally where we've been waiting out for such a long time and sort of crawling through the sand just trying to survive this gpu apocalypse but now i feel like things are getting back to normal at least in pc gaming and someone did make a joke in one of the gpu videos i did recently where it's like the whole world around you is just crumbling down but hey you got your gpu for msrp so you're happy but if you're a seller though this is where it comes down to if you're a seller i've been saying this for quite a while where my personal philosophy on it is generally i like to do high turnover and that's because you're not sitting on anything for too long and i think that high turnover model is a lot better in this situation as we saw in the last two weeks gpu prices just fell off a cliff from what they previously were which has created this market distortion where you then have to react to the new pricing and so that's what i'm doing now and i'm sure in a few days when i do the parts hunt things are going to be a lot better this month i'm looking forward to getting some really awesome deals coming into it but until then i want to rid myself of the old deals even if i'm breaking even at worst and so that's kind of like that profit margin i originally had with that gtx 1080 ti i'm now just going to forfeit it who cares at least i didn't lose and then i'm going to move on and react to the new market and so if you are selling gaming pcs and you're sitting on that stuff now you might want to move it as quick as you can hopefully without incurring any losses because i have heard some stories here locally of some people someone recently bought uh 20 or something 30 60 tis two weeks ago for i think it was like eleven hundred dollars a piece each and then the prices are down to like seven hundred dollars each and it's kind of like well there's four hundred dollars times twenty you just lost 8 000 but i think the last piece of advice is if you are a seller and you've got some stock especially gpus and you're sitting on them and you've paid x amount for them then you may wish to think about selling them sooner than later especially with that sort of shadow hanging over the market where there's the potential for gpu prices to come down even more so that is lingering out there i think that is now something that even a few months ago just did not even seem possible but now it can be a reality and i think that's in the back of people's minds and so i've always been aware of that sort of factor and things can change so quickly where you can have sometimes a year of events happen in just a week and i think that's what's kind of happening here a lot's taking place and so for me i always position myself not to get my hand caught in the cookie jar so hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button also for this pc it's running really smooth i'm actually really happy with how it turned out i was playing a bit of apex legends on it really good fps so i'm happy with uh how it turned out in the end of course when it comes to putting this thing together you can see with the motherboard all the components i'm putting in i'm just saving money on every single turn and that's i guess enabling me even with that overpriced 1080 ti not to lose a whole lot of money so hopefully you guys enjoyed this one if you did be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below if you have any questions whether you're a buyer or seller love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from puts and they say can you share what the name of the track at 30 minutes and 39 seconds is cleaning the gpu heatsinks and testing afterwards part so to answer that first question uh a lot of people ask me about the music i think the best thing to do is just get an app on your phone called shazam where it can just test out the song and then tell you the name of it i use so many tracks but in this case that track was called 1984 lasers it was actually a really cool track that i just heard and i thought okay i'll pop that in the video and also the last question is uh what is the fate of all the faulty gpus you encounter where do they end up so at the moment all the faulty gpus are just piling up i've got this massive pile of faulty gpus and i do want to when i get some free time eventually try to do proper fixes where i'm changing things like mosfets and stuff like that so i'd love to learn that until then the gpu pile will just keep stacking up also i do sometimes use the coolers off those faulty gpus and that's a really important thing if you get a faulty gpu don't just chuck it out the cooler can be very very good and it's actually saved me where a few of the coolers have had fans that aren't working and i can just because it's the same gpu i can just replace the faulty gpus cooler on the one that's working and i've got now a 100 functional gpu so the cooler is definitely worth something in itself so i do keep them and there is a pile building up but we'll work that out later hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell also if you want some behind the scenes footage there is the join button two which i will be posting a vlog very soon catch you guys in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
