with windows 11 finally being official here is 
everything you need to know and we'll start from   the most noticeable and end up with the under the 
hood changes you probably wouldn't have noticed   do you feel like this when you see this well if 
so you can get rid of that windows activation   message with today's video sponsor scd keys for as 
little as 12 usd after you use that coupon bftyc   you can get activated today links in description 
below starting with microsoft's new visual   language there's an emphasis on glass i mean 
semi-transparency from the rounded corners to the   pop-ups even to the radio buttons it looks nice 
there are new animations for interacting with apps   like maximizing windows and more noticeable 
minimize animations too though the biggest example   is the new start menu it seems to have switched 
from a resizable dynamic element to a static   element where the only customizations allowed 
are the content the scaling and the placement   you always have a 6x3 grid of pinned apps at the 
top and your recommended section underneath that   which can show you three things recently installed 
most used apps as well as recently opened files   you can choose which of these three are visible 
or hidden but they'll always appear in this   section they don't have their own tabs and even 
if you disable all three options the section will   remain with a link to enable them in the settings 
which in my opinion is quite lazy programming but   it looks nice so i won't be too critical you 
can't resize the start menu's height with or   how many icons appear it always looks the 
same besides what apps you choose to pin   and the color based on your theme and background 
your account options look like this and your power   options look like this your programs list is moved 
over to this button here and now looks like this   you can also have multiple pages of pinned apps 
personally my favorite is the snaps layouts   all you have to do is hover over the maximize 
button for a couple of seconds and it will show   you a bunch of screen layouts and then you can 
click to add your window to one like the fancy   zones app the next big change is the addition of 
widgets you get a little bit of finance weather   news and sports is customizable in terms of size 
and placement and what you see is based on msn but   that's not even the worst part you actually need 
to be logged into your microsoft account to even   enable them which is a big no-no i do not support 
microsoft locking down features to people who log   in in fact i appreciated the fact that you could 
completely use windows 10 without a microsoft   account with the exception of the windows paid 
store apps like forza and hvec codecs but forza   is on steam now and you can just use vlc so you 
could feasibly use the pc without any logging in   forcing a microsoft account increases unstoppable 
telemetry requires a password login and is just   a bunch of hassles so when it says continue with 
limited experience if you don't need an msn feed   you won't have a limited experience at all but 
in better news there is no more forced cortana   rejoice the cortana app remains but the windows 
setup and taskbar are not using it anymore   the search option remains but as always you can 
just start typing in the start menu so the search   button is redundant for people with muscle memory 
speaking of useful voice assistance unlike cortana   microsoft implemented native multiple voice 
assistant support which will allow voice   assistants besides cortana to function natively in 
windows i think you can already set up alexa to a   small extent but seeing the google assistant right 
on the taskbar would be very appreciated being   able to control smart lights or play music with 
google voice would actually be the one use case   i would use a voice assistant on the pc4 besides 
asking stupid questions and seeing how they answer according to circle care the banana plant and 
herbaceous plant not a tree because the stem does   not contain true woody tissue that's why bananas 
are not technically a fruit but it's an herb   maybe i'm getting too far ahead of myself i mean 
this is microsoft after all if you have multiple   physical monitors windows will try to place 
apps in more natural places and reset them   when you reconnect or disconnect secondary 
monitors speaking of monitors if yours is   hdr then windows will take a feature from 
xbox and attempt to convert sdr content   into hdr content but they still haven't fixed 
the washed out look on 8-bit hdr certified panels   like my lg b7 and the aegon super ultra white 
here in the studio even though the panels have   800 nits and 400 nits respectively on the topic of 
xbox features the direct storage api requires an   nvme ssd to boost gaming performance windows will 
copy files from the ram to the gpu memory this is   similar but different to nvidia's implementation 
which features a game api telling the gpu to load   files directly from the ssd to gpu memory and 
decompress them without utilizing the cpu at all   keeping with gaming windows 11 has native support 
direct x12 ultimate api although i'm pretty sure   windows 10 already had this feature as 
a feature of a previous update and this   becomes a little bit of a theme with windows 11. 
microsoft describes brand new features and they   have already been implemented into windows 10. 
two examples of this is spatial sound support   and wi-fi 6e support in the way of native things 
though microsoft has stopped including skype 3d   viewer and paint 3d on new installs but they are 
still available from the microsoft store speaking   of they have introduced a new store you can now 
search and install android apps like tick tock   and have them run on windows without an emulator 
another feature is alleged ability to install   android app packages also known as apks but again 
this functionality wasn't working in our dev copy   however a new installer that is working on our 
build is the win get package manager which allows   you to install an app with no hassles it's kind 
of satisfying you can use wingate search to find   programs in public cdns and win get install 
to download and install without a single click   in most cases speaking of command lines windows is 
transitioning to the new windows terminal which is   a single app that allows you to run powershell 
command prompt and even linux subsystems   it's seamless and looks very modern it allows 
multiple tabs overall very nice windows 11 feature   updates will be released once per year instead of 
quarterly and will still receive monthly quality   updates tablet mode has been replaced with s mode 
apparently and it's a whole new edition of windows   which only runs windows store apps but even more 
importantly for touch devices running windows 11   a swipe keyboard finally microsoft has also 
removed a few features that nobody ever used   or should have used like internet explorer the app 
and file history timeline and the wallet really   begging the question of why did windows ever have 
these things in the first place windows also has a   new setup menu or an out of the box experience if 
you prefer finally we have a few changes to finish   up hardware scheduling is enabled by default big 
little cpus seem to be properly optimized you can   move the taskbar to the left so it's not forced to 
be in the middle if you don't like that the search   menu will try and add experiences to the search 
like if you search for the weather or calculator   new sounds in windows very soft and then 
new wallpapers new windows logo new icons   added padding in windows explorer by default 
and finally moving over more web executables   to microsoft edge and edge view 2. teams is now 
edgeview based instead of electron based electron   is chromium based anyway guys that is all the 
features and differences between windows 11   and windows 10. this is sort of like a change log 
and do let us know in the comment section below   did we miss anything and also let us know in 
the comments what is your favorite difference   between windows 11 and windows 10 besides the uh 
different ways microsoft is going to get telemetry   enabled but i'm pretty sure that's going to be 
nobody's favorite thing just like in an explorer   and with all that out of the way if you've stayed 
this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content   then be sure to hit that like button for us and 
also if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying   that content then be sure to hit that sub button
