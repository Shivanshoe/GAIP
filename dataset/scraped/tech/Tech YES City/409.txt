I once knew a guy named Hughes ik and he said to me he likes the music but does he like the Sound Blaster x3 and that is the question at 120 bucks this is a standalone device that is powered by USB and then connects to itself by USB type-c so you don't need any additional power connectors but at this price point is it worth your money and this is the thing when we go to any audio device we always have to start off with the objective numbers if they're bad then I don't consider that unit worth a purchase at all you're probably going to want to get that thing put it back in the shipping box and ship it back to where it came from but the really good news is here is that this thing is actually going to be very desirable for those looking to get some of the best and the good news is is here with the frequency response curve it is the best that I've seen here come through the studio with basically a flat line across the whole line there which means you're not gonna get any base roll-off you're not gonna get any roll-off of the treble side of things but we did have this in direct mode which goes up to 32 bit 192 kilohertz support it also has power for 32 ohms up to 600 ohm headphones I did test out some ortho dynamics on this thing and it did have the power to drive them as well as the base to but continuing on with those numbers when you put it in direct mode it's basically going to bypass the onboard creative sound processing device and just go through the DAC then to amp it to your headphones but if you want to go through the audio processing you're then going to go down to 24 bit 192 kilohertz on both input and output though speaking of the crosstalk again another victory here getting minus 97 decibels so you're gonna have no leakage on either left or right channel or at least you're not going to be able to hear it and then they've got 115 decibel signal-to-noise ratio here and I gotta say with the looking at the THD numbers they pretty much support these claims where we've got 0.001 percent measured THD on the noise floor and these numbers again look pretty good just like the channel balance where was perfect so from the get-go it's a great device for powering hard to power headphones or if you want to get something that's better than bad onboard audio or bad laptop audio which we took a look at in the recent g3 review that we did last month and that was coming in with some decent figures too but this is giving out better objective numbers than that even though that's half the price basically this does have a few extra features on top of that where it's also got three preset EQ so you can save into the middle button and you can go through them with the different color codes and white purple and blue and then on the left you've also got the ability to change your mic volume which will then light up red the default is blue for your standard volume and then if you hold it down you it's going to light up green which will change the channel balance between left and right so you can swing that with the infinite knob on there and you can also control this by your smart phone as well set different profiles and connect to it wirelessly and the best thing is you can then hook that up to a console and then you can still get the benefits of those three eq's or on the right hand side they've got what is the super x5 button and this is another advantage this has over the g3 where if you guys remember an old technology called cmss 3d this is pretty much the new-age spin on that where it has a deep of different profiles that can pretty much tailor audio for that particular headphone in this case I did make my own profile and I'll give you guys a listen to that soon with the Dolby HD replication but it did remind me of cmss 3d not the exact same thing but it did give me better positional cues and it did open up that soundstage a bit more so we took a look at this the first time back at the start of 2019 I believe over in Vegas for CES and since then they've refined it and they've done a great job where essentially what their intention is is to emulate live room audio on headphones and so what I noticed here though was the benefit of the super x5 tech was that it was giving me much better a directional space and we will test this out in FPS very soon but I'll give you guys a quick demonstration in between direct mode which is just flat and then this tech turned on and then also the surround mode in the SPX profile [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so for my ears music sounded the best in direct mode that's how I like to listen to music on headphones though when it came to anything where I wanted to hit directional cues I did prefer the super XY mode turned on the surround mode I've never been a big fan of that honestly in the SPX profile I thought some of the other features in that profile are much better geared up towards using everyday for instance the crystallizer if you want to add more clarity to lobe bass voice smart mode will definitely equalize the volume for example if you are listening to movies and the music is overpowering the voices and then another benefit on top of that is the optical out which you can then turn on Dolby Digital Live to support 5.1 or 7.1 Digital through that Toslink cable there speaking of surround sound you've also got the manual ports at the back to support discreet 5.1 or 7.1 as well as in the software you can support virtual 5.1 or 7.1 if you wish now another feature on the x3 which makes it more appealing than the g3 is the mic boost feature in other words they've put a better amp on that ADC line and I'll give you guys a quick listen to the virtuoso broadcaster mic with the recording so this is what its gonna sound like normally with microphone boost on testing one two three one two three and the noise is pretty quiet we can see by that little straight line right there but let's add on some different sort of things now like voice clarity so this is with noise reduction on but let's go for voice morph into a female in that recording I can virtually hear no noise so it was kicking it hotter than the g3 was and it's a great thing if you're into streaming and you want to give your viewers a great listening experience on a decent mic however one thing I will critique about creative here is that I'd love to see them add in an XLR port where they've previously added in XLR ports with weak amps on that ADC line this has the strong amp on the ADC line but they don't add in the XLR port so maybe in the future if they upgrade it or they make the x3 plus or something I'd love to see them add in an XLR port this would make it perfect for streamers basically up until this point I can't fault anything with this unit even the build quality is nice and solid weighs in at 330 grams has 130 ml by 130 ml by 40 ml tall dimensions and I think the last thing we can do here is boot up some fps give you guys a demo of this super x5 tech turned on versus direct mode and then vs. their Scout mode which helps to enhance the footstep frequencies via an EQ and see if you guys enjoy this new tech that they've slapped on the x3 so basically from here on in I'm going to be using this thing when I now play competitively in games I like that super x5 feature do let us know in the comment section below what you guys thought about it in both of the demos however time to critique this thing there was only one thing I found kind of wrong with it and that was when you turn it off or essentially unplug it and then plug it back in it sets back to default mode whereas if you had your EQ setting on or the sx5 on it'll then reset it but it won't reset the profiles they're saved into the unit itself so I would like to see them via a firmware update fix this perhaps because the software does allow you to quickly update the firmware easily so basically that's one thing I found that I could critique as well as I'd like to actually see them bring back cmss 3d I absolutely missed that technology I thought it was extremely immersive I think the super XY does add a different experience and I like that too but I do remember it sounding a bit different to cmss 3d and of course if they added in an XLR port as well this thing would be ultimate it would be unbeatable for pretty much anyone out there so then with the x3 this one at 120 bucks I can recommend this thing it is really solid if you either want an upgrade or you want to get the extra feature sets out of this unit it will power hard to power headphones does have a great mic input and it does have pretty much the best objective numbers that I've seen here come through the studio so kudos to creative for making this one and the g3 that we checked out if you haven't seen that review I'll put the link up here where that one was coming in with a little portable solution that did fix bad audio problem say for instance if you add laptop audio a really bad onboard audio you didn't have enough to afford this because that would then easily solve that problem for your ears there one thing before I get on out of here I will say devices like this give you a very clean signal especially in direct mode now even with a pair of Fidelio L ones listening to 80s tracks for example like Lou Gramm midnight blue that's one I've been banging lately I can hear nuances that I can't really hear on my loudspeakers so whether you like those nuances or not me personally I don't like them then you may be spending money on something that you may not prefer so again Audio is very subjective but that's why I listen to eighties rock on loudspeakers however a lot of the new music coming out especially electronic music sounds phenomenal on these devices here with a good pair of headphones so do keep that in mind different strokes for different folks so do keep in mind what you're getting here is really good audio to the point where it may be too good anyway that's about it for today's video if you guys enjoyed this one - be sure to hit that like button for us and we've got the question of the day as well which comes from El CAC Dora and they asked a semi serious question why doesn't Intel have a strong memorable PR leader AMD has lovely doctor suit Nvidia has a leather Jensen what does Intel have and I kind of do agree with this like there isn't any like main figure in Intel this sort of pokes jabs at the competition I mean I look at Jensen he sometimes says something towards AMD and they grab me scars and then Lisa and AMD they say they have jabs at Intel and and also in video and I like that culture I think it promotes competition but I can't really remember anyone from Intel that's poking any jabs or really wants to get up there though with Intel I'd like to see them either enable who they've already got on their employment roster do a little bit more of this or employ someone to do that in the field where I did ask them and this is a true story I did awesome at the events why they didn't partake in that kind of culture and they just said they didn't need - so maybe they want to but they said to me that they didn't need to because I've actually asked them this question in the past so great question and if you guys have any questions that you want answered then be sure to drop a comment in the comment section below but one thing while we're on that note of audio - I've met guys in the past that have tinnitus I don't have tinnitus but I've met people who have it and they tell me you do not want it very strictly and that's enough for me to take care of my ears so when it comes to audio guys don't be putting really cheap audio whether it be a crappy DAC amp on a budget motherboard or a laptop and then blasting some cheap headphones because you will damage your ears and you do not want to damage your ears so take it from someone who's heard a lot of stories about tinnitus either in person or even on the Internet you don't want that hurting you for the rest of your life anyway Oh catch it and all the take video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out but now buddy [Music] you
