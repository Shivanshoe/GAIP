[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and welcome to part 2 of Ken yes fix it the episode where you guys send in your broken pots and I do my best to try and get them working again and yesterday's episode I'll put the link up here if you haven't seen that already we did get some motherboards to come back to life but this time around we're dealing with an entire range of different products we've got graphics cards CPUs with bent pins and CPUs that came in and are untested as well as a heap of memory sticks and a motherboard with two Xeon x58 sockets with his own unique ddr3 memory sticks that were made only for this board I believe so that's something I've never seen before the first thing we're gonna fix is this rising 720 700 X here which got sent in from a user via Twitter who said they had some problems installing it it was very finicky and they just got they didn't want to damage it anymore and so they offered to donate this pot if I could get it working and Ben pins is one of the specialties of mine so we'll quickly get straight into that and see if it works [Music] and now we've got this 2700 X it is working absolutely fine after we bent all those pins back and I've also decided to test out the ddr4 memory that got sent in from my cousin and he's also sent along to 6600 K's so I'm going to test them out as well because he pulled them out of a PC and that will essentially just scrapped PC so he didn't know if they worked or not but this six thing about the ddr4 that works as well [Music] so I've now finished testing the 6600 K's out both of them work find that memory works fine and what we've got here is two motherboards I picked up a while ago for $20 a pop and that's what I've been saying about deals I know this is a pretty good deal at 20 Ozzie a pop which is like 15 USD and now I've got literally the perfect scenario for these motherboards where I've got my cousin Sam and thank you so much for these donations we've got these CPUs working and we've got the memory that works on this side and then I've added another 16 gigabytes of ddr3 on this one because this board's a ddr3 version this one's a ddr4 version but I couldn't ask for a better scenario in this case because it's all worked out where I've got to bare-bones kits pretty much for 90 Ozzie dollars total but now it's finally time to get onto the gravis cards and usually what I do with cards like these that are untested I just clean them down first because cleaning them down first is just gonna save us a step in the process where if I boot them up and they don't work anyway then I'm going to clean them anyway so why I just clean this stuff down first is I just get to the bottom of it and do all I can first and then if it doesn't work I know it doesn't work [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so cleaning down these five GPUs actually took a lot longer than I expected that's mainly due to this GTX 580 right here and this GTX 280 mount of screws on them where the 580 actually had these very small inverted hex heads on them where I had to get a special tool that I rarely use and use that on this because I didn't even have a drill piece small enough to quickly unscrew all the pieces on this 580 I believe in video have reintroduced this with like the founders Edition cards on a GTX 10 series and r-tx cards but regardless of that we've got five cards now that are all cleaned down and have brand new thermal paste on them and I've also left purposely left the back plate off the online 390x because I want to test it without the back plate on first just to see if it gives out a signal [Music] so the first card up and running is the r9 390x and it is working absolutely fine the FPS a little bit low because I'm testing 1440p ultra 8-speed msaa which is really strenuous on the graphics card but the temperatures are really good the also the noise on this card surprisingly is actually really good I've never really come into one of these r9 390 s from sapphire before I think it's the Tri X and it's doing an extremely good job though one thing I have done is left the backplate off as I said before and when I looked at it closely I could see like there was these spots on the back plate with the plastic where it's been smeared and so that's not a good sign because I have had in the past the GPU there has been causing issues due to the backplane when I took that off it worked fine after that so this is probably another case of just the card over time something's happened and then it's not enough to cause any permanent damage but it's enough to basically make it capacitive so it's interrupting with the signal that's what I think happened though I'm not 100% certain but one thing I do know is that we've got an online 390 X that's working like brand-new and it's had the thermal paste changed and everything is good to go so let's continue on with our next line of greatest cards [Music] [Music] and here we are with the GPUs all finished and testing and the three on the right here these are all working absolutely fine and the GTX 260 one gigabyte of video RAM on board so I wouldn't mind seeing if it could play even just for tonight at low settings at 720p because maybe we'd be able to put that in a real budget orientated rig the one below that the GTX 580 that is still a decent card if you have those motherboards that don't support any of the newer AMD or Nvidia cards because this has the older firmware on board that still supports those secure boot pcs and so that's one of the decent reasons to still use a GTX 580 in a real low-end rig and still get some decent performance and then of course below that is the main prize of the bunch the r9 390x I'm super stoked that this one works though over here both these GTX 460 s they gave out problems and they gave out actually different problems to the point where this one here with the rusted ring that we cleaned off that gave out a b2 error and that means that it just can't even initialize the GPUs firmware so it's pretty much just a toast card the fan wasn't even working either I'm using you ever had this had the fan go out on them and then that's cause the GPU pretty much just to melt and that's a goner and then the one above that was must have happened at the same time because this one here was actually booting fine like it would boot to Windows but it would just give out no signal whatsoever so when this one went I'm guessing something went on this too with the display on the back edge and giving out no signal now and I mean honestly that's not really that big of a surprise being that it's from a company called point-of-view I've never heard of them before and probably never heard of them for good reason because this thing just it looks like garbage and they both pretty much just dud cards that are gone but now it's time to get onto some of the best news and that is to Zeon's x58 in this dual soccer board with that proprietary memory [Music] [Music] and so with the Jules Eon system I've spent over a good hour trying to get this thing to post a signal but it just doesn't both via vga on the graphics card or via a actual port on the monitor itself and I've tried changing all these different pins here looking up the manual online and setting them to enable things like the SMB trying to enable vga on the board which was off when i got this in and what worries me the most is that even the pin with the speaker it's got the internal speaker even that was enabled is not posting any beeping noises or anything so we just get essentially getting no signal out of this thing and i just can't figure out why it's not booting at all so we had the two xeon x 5677 s in there initially but i've taken it back now to a 50 500 series process that was made in 2008 to see if that could help it maybe it needed a BIOS update but it's essentially just not posting and all there's something wrong with this board this motherboard inherently to the point where I think it's not working but if there if you guys have had any experience with dual socket x58 boards and there's some kind of trick that I'm missing to get this working I'd love to read that in the comments but for what it's worth since the speaker's not posting any beeping noises that is pretty worrisome because usually on a server board especially a tooth like a board you usually get a beep to let you know that the board's booted up even so we're not even getting that so not sure what's going on here but we're going to keep on rolling [Music] and here we are with the conclusion of all these parts here and the majority of them are a success story where we've got three graphics cards that are working absolutely fine we've got all the CPUs there working fine too and even that i7 860 that we pulled out of that motherboard with those severely bent pins in the previous episode that's working 2/3 of the RAM sticks one for you bite one to you button 1 egg ebay stick they are posting but I still would like to run them through a stress test to make sure they're 100% though this one memory stick here unfortunately didn't make the cut we're just sent the motherboard into a loop before I could even post so that one's out of the picture and then we've got these two GTX 460 s which are also out of the picture quite literally and behind that we've got this one the mystery the dual Xeon x58 socket board here that is not posting properly it's not even giving out a beep but I figured since there was a heap of motherboards getting washed and maybe this board here it's just a little bit sweaty so tomorrow morning I'm gonna wake up because I'm pretty tired it's pretty late I'm gonna give this thing a shower and just make sure it's all hygienic and then we'll give it one more try though there is some bad news already and that's I've looked at behind the board and there's like some Brown tianjin on one of the circuit lines so that's really not some good news but of course we will go out with a bang in this second episode of Kenya's fix it [Music] and this is some really good news our super micro Joule Xeon motherboard is now working at least with one CPU and we're now going to try and put back the original to Zeon's in onboard and then see if it boots off this VGA and if it does that then we can go to the graphics card and see if it does that after the GPU because if it does work with the GPU then I am going to be super excited because the tech yes waterworld has now brought back one very important motherboard back to life [Music] hey Devin have you been to Tech yes little world I'll find the refuge on there's gonna come a feeling like a new man [Music] so that rollercoaster ride has now come to a conclusion and this board the CPUs and all the memory is now working a hundred percent and initially we as we said before we had to put in an older Xeon and that worked and then what I did from there was I tested out the single socket with all those CPUs so there's 5677 and they both worked individually just fine I tested out all the memory sticks individually they all checked out fine so I then knew it was the motherboard that was just having some issues with getting two CPUs to work and so we got the VGA card working and then after that we got both the CPUs finally started booting up normally and what we've got out of that now is eight cores 16 threads sixteen-year lots of RAM and the board also works with the latest and greatest graphics cards so after that initial VGA test I then put on a newer graphics card and that was posting out a signal as well so really happy with the results here in what we've got out of this because initially it just looked like there was no hope last night before I went to bed I was like yeah that boards a goner but then we took it to tech yes water world gave it a nice clean and I did use detergent this time some of you guys were like saying yo use detergent dude give it some detergent and then dried it off and then it also gave it some data backing as well just to make sure every speck of water drop was off this board and so as we said in the previous episode if you guys are gonna wash pots make sure the water is completely off the board 100% and in the previous video I did cop a bit of slack forward washing motherboards and doing some of the unorthodox stuff that I do around the channel here but I've been doing this stuff for years and I remember like over four years ago when I started using wd-40 or CRC 556 and brake cleaner I was met with way more skepticism than I've ever been in racing time so that's why I get the skepticism now I just flick it off because it's nothing compared to what I copped back then and fast-forward four years I'm still doing the same stuff I'm still using brake cleaner still using wd-40 and I got some really good comments in the last video where someone tried out the multi-purpose spray and they were blown away by how good it was and so I love reading comments like that because at the other day I don't tell people to go do what I do I just show them like look if you got nothing to lose you can try doing this stuff for yourself and if it works you've then got something that didn't work working again and you can recycle that stuff and put it to good use in terms of some of these methods and how I came up with them the history of it has just got to do with cars mainly I used to work on cars and some of the stuff would be so filthy like you guys haven't seen dirty parts until you've worked on car parts and so I try some of these products and then my car would work better after that because I used to mess around with these old JDM style cars and so it's just trial and error and what we saw with this Supermicro board is a classical example of this board the person who sent it over it didn't work for them they'll they looked a guest give it a crack and I gave it a crack and I gave it my all and now it's working completely fine again but basically around tech yeah City I'm just gonna keep doing me and I hope you guys are enjoying the content and also on the process you bring in some of those PC parts back to life they're looking back on today's episode we had one of the biggest success rates that we've had on any kenya's fix-it episode where we started off with that 2700 X we ended up bending those pins back that went really smooth and we got that working again and then my cousin sent over to 6600 KS and also 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory all that ended up checking out absolutely fine though I will ask him what pcs he did pull them out of so I think he said office pcs but I don't know of like any like office pcs that have sixty six hundred K's in them though I will ask him and then after that we had those three of five graphics cards that we ended up getting to work especially that r9 390x I think that was the most important card to get working and then it did work unfortunately those GTX 460 s from some weird brand we've never heard of before both of them just didn't make it to the final car and then we had the other sticks of memory the ddr3 sticks we had three or four of those worked out fine with one of the corsair sticks was bad that was the 4 gigabyte module and then of course that lasts up that Super Micro board both the CPUs the motherboard ended up working and all the included memory ended up working fine but we did have a lengthy process to get that working again there with that aside if you guys enjoyed part 2 of can yes fix it then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know what your favorite fix of today was and also one thing I'm gonna say before I get on out here as well I'm not like a micro electrician or anything like that I don't have any skills when it comes to micro soldiering sure I can do your basic soldering wires together and that's some stuff I do here on the channel but I've tried micro soldiering before and I'm terrible at it so that's one of those things as well in Australia like it raises the argument of - one thing I'd love to hear from you guys in the comments was even if I did that stuff how long would it take to usually fix up a motherboard if you are a skilled technician in that field and even then say for instance if we've got like a $60 h61 motherboard would it just be cheaper to buy another motherboard or fix it or how much would it cost in terms of time and parts to usually fix up one of those motherboards that has a busted down logic circuit I'd love to read someone's opinion in the field who actively does stuff like this because that's one thing I've sort of shied away from mainly because I'm I'm terrible when it comes to micro Sol during like my hands just sort of fidget that little bit where you need to have what they call surgeon hands where you've just got so much precision in your hands barely move like if you've got a 200 mil camera lens and zoomed in on some of these dudes man then just be like wouldn't even move if you did the same on my fingers it would just be shaking you just didn't sit be like an earthquake or something but anyway that aside I also need some opinions on the x58 sockets that we've got here in that they've got screws coming out so I can't use - snowman coolers on this Supermicro board and I'm pretty sure it's not LGA 2011 which has got a different socket so if someone has some cooler recommendations for this motherboard I'm all ears as well love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we'll also got the question of the day from sidebar 84 and they asked is it wise to put the water pressure on the pins and this is basically coming from yesterday's video and also today's video I did watch this motherboard pressure with pins is one of those things where I actually haven't got an exact answer I'd love to hear if someone has actual statistics on the pressure and maybe it's in psi or something like that on when the certain amount of pressure gets to a certain level that pin bends because from my experience I know LGA pins will Bend easier than PGA pins the exact pressure is unknown though but the water we're using in the videos yesterday and today was just really is just running tap water in that it wasn't high pressure at all don't go putting a pressure washer on pins or don't go putting really fast running water on the pins that might actually bend them though that being said I'm not curious to try because when I do Bend those pins back whether it's PGA or LG a you kind of gauge the pressure it takes to Bend those pins and then you kind of know with sort of like the street smarts that that won't bend it or that will if that makes any sense so basically a slow running water is not going to bend LGA pins or pga pins but i'd love to know if anyone has the actual official statistics on those bending limits I'm all ears and without a side I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the content and you're not yet subbed and you want to get those videos as soon as they drop sub button ring the bells down there and I'm gonna let Dad man also take out this outro well you guys peace out for now BAE make sure you
