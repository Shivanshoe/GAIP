so last year I took a look at create his flagship a nine sound card and although it had a lot of good things going for it it just missed the mark on some points and that ultimately led to me not recommending the product and creative then came back to me and surprisingly offered me a sponsorship and I said to myself well basically my reviews always remained my reviews I don't let any money or anything influence the outcome of those reviews and I want you guys to have the best advice as consumers and they came back to me and said look we really want to make our brand the number one in sound cards and audio and I said sure well if we're going to do this we're going to make sure that you start from the bottom up and so what we have here today is creatives bottom-up approach in that they're making something that hits hard on a budget and is a portable USB device that works on not only PC but also Mac and things like PlayStation 4 Nintendo switch and other consoles so what I'm going to be doing with this thing is running you guys through all the objective numbers which is the most important part with any audio device and then we'll talk about all the other features this little thing has to offer which is coming in at 60 USD [Music] standing straight into the nitty-gritties this is an old plastic build construction and it's got two rubberized feet on both ends weighing in at 32 grams without the adapter in that it's got its base form with the type C adapter then if you include the type A adapter which is the normal USB as we know it it then weighs 37 grams the dimensions are 10 mil by 40 mil by 75 mil long so it is quite a small device but it does pack good build quality where none of the knobs or switches felt loose they all felt solid and everything felt good to click though at the front of the unit you get a headphone input as well as a 3.5 ml mic input and then a hybrid in-between which has an included Toslink cable so if your onboard audio or your laptop for example is missing optical then this can work as a solution to fix that as well as work as a line in if you're recording as well as having the ability to switch between the volume and the mixing function so you can change between mixing the microphone balance and the audio balance on the headphone output on the left hand side of that is an instant mic mute switch as well as mic volume control and with that aside we will go straight into the details of the frequency response curve and looking at these numbers closely we can see the channel balance between left and right channels is almost perfect I only measured maximum of a point one decibel drop so basically the sound going to your left and right ears on your headphones is going to be equal out of the box also the distortion figures on the total harmonic distortion looked pretty good as well as the noise floor is some of the better numbers I've seen around here in the studio even compared to that of high-end onboard audio solutions and then under frequency response curves it was a relatively flat frequency response curve all the way through the lines from 20 Hertz and onwards there was a tiny bit of shake if we investigate it really closely but it was nothing to worry about especially when we compare it to a laptop for example and that onboard audio but we'll get onto that later after we go through these numbers here where the 0 to 10 Hertz was a minus 6 decibel Roth and the 10 to 20 Hertz was only 0.5 roughly decibel roll-off so basically bass is still going to come through very well on these headphones and you've got an ohm rein for your headphones ranging from 16 to 300 ohm so will power most headphones out there on the market though keep in mind if you want to power authors or 600 ohm hard to drive headphones you may need another separate amplification solution though the crosstalk numbers out of the box were showing - 65 to minus 70 decibel which is pretty mediocre I have seen a lot better going from minus 80 and lower in the past on different solutions - 90 is the best I've seen and that's phenomenal but still you're going to be able to distinguish between left and right perfectly fine on this device though that moves on now to onboard audio which is sporting very similar numbers on a high-end solution like the zi 390 tai chi that we're comparing it against here so basically what you can see out of this comparison is that if you've got high-end audio already on your motherboard for example then this solution won't likely be for you however if you're going now to a laptop and this is one of the scariest things because I've never tested onboard laptop audio before this video and what we can see with these numbers here is that it's actually very scary and I did measure this across two different devices on the line ins just to get accurate numbers and this was showing the basically onboard audio on this Dell laptop I think it's an e 74 20 latitude it's a 4th gen laptop I recently picked it up in a deals hunt this was showing numbers that were basically the voice was the only good area that you could listen to reliably so if you want to listen to music on this latitude laptop for example it will and I stress this it will damage your ears if the volume is too loud where I measured anywhere from a difference of the high and the low peaks from 80 decibels so basically if you're listening to music you are damaging your ears on something with a really cheap onboard audio solution like this latitude laptop so this is where something like the g3 with its pretty good objective numbers will come in and help your ears in the long run especially if you're a headphone user which is what this is catering for now going back to the g3 for example versus other audio solutions I was testing out the software suite and it's actually pretty impressive what they're doing with it they've got the game mix feature as we talked before where you can mix the voice or the game and prefer one over the other which does work better on PlayStation 4 than it does on PC when I did test it on PC does need a bit of improvement where for instance if I'm in a Counter Strike trying to hear voices and I switch this to basically to the attenuate the games it'll also attenuate all the voices in csgo however the other software like the footsteps enhanced which you can actually control via the button in the middle you can just press this and it'll pretty much flash white which means that it's now working that'll set the default footstep enhancer on so basically you plug it into a console you can still benefit from this effect and what we'll do now is roll onto a counter-strike demo where I'm playing one round with footstep enhancer off versus one round with it on they're going through some of the other effects here you can change things like crystals surround with the sbx profile and also assign that to a hot key with the middle button so if you wish to turn this on and off on the fly you can do so by double clicking the button instead of clicking at once as you can change things like base surround and also the crystallizer effect and make those adjustments from zero to a hundred to get the desired effect I find it works really well in RPGs if you want to make a different experience they do keep in mind software like that is essentially what they call color in the audio world a lot of people don't actually like it but it is there and it can work in situations especially like in queueing that's one of my favorite and on that note of e queuing if you do change it to your favorite EQ and you want to have that on and off then you can set that as the default and then turn it on and off quickly with the button instead of having footstep enhancer as your default profile for this button though changing over now to the other side that's the microphone input where if you're gaming especially on cheap onboard audio you're going to be getting noise creeping in especially if you're using harder to drive microphones so what we decided to use today was the Corsair virtuoso broadcast mic where that's actually a little bit harder to drive than say for instance of a motor boom Pro or a lot of standard microphones that you'll get on headsets and this microphone in supports up to 96 kilohertz 24-bit just like the output which also supports 24-bit 96k low Hertz and so let's show you guys a quick test between the onboard audio on the z3 90 taichi which is a higher-end solution versus this little g3 so now we're testing the microphone on the z3 90 taichi motherboard from asrock we have had to boost the volume however with plus 30 DB and a volume level of 85 even to get this microphone to power to these levels this is the corsair broadcast the microphone on the virtuoso plug directly into the g3 on a serious note though this is what it will sound like with no effects turned on and the volume set to default out of the box so we'll quickly see if you guys can hear any noise so I would definitely even like North HR which we can change to a longer emo that is a feature that's enabled on the g3 as well and now we're recording with the smart volume feature in the sound blaster recording panel as well as having the acoustic echo cancellation thing he turned on but let's try out a couple of effects now to compare it to the original two sources and here's what the microphone will sound like the virtuoso microphone with a improve vocal clarity as well as vocal presence the preset turned on so this is actually a microphone equalizer which I've never tried before so coming out of this if you guys want to have some fun with that voice morph technology is actually pretty fun to use but people will get sick of it pretty quick I did try the sound in games especially in dota 2 and people were like yo can you turn that stuff off that wasn't the exact term that they said but it can get annoying pretty quickly so the power is yours with that you do have the option to turn that on which is a cool little neat feature though in terms of the voice clarity and also the boost in the equalizer for the mic in I thought that added more noise as opposed to the smart volume feature which I thought was very handy that's basically going to control your voice and make it equalize straight out of the box whatever microphone you have so that was the best feature I thought on the software side for the mic input where if you plug in any mic just hit smart volume it's going to control that for you and also do so while pretty much giving out the lowest noise I heard in these comparisons with the virtuoso broadcast mic it did have a hard time being driven on that onboard audio and so I had to set it quite high and then the noise was starting to creep in so it's good to see that this little g3 here does have a pretty powerful mic in amp onboard so your friends are gonna be hearing you white noise free and now it's time for the conclusion with the g3 and running all the tests here I was very surprised with this unit it's exactly what I wanted creative to do with their budget options and that's pretty much offer everything and hit all those boxes pretty well it didn't hit everything the best I've seen with the objective numbers but it hit them really good enough to make it a viable option for me to recommend and we would look at the mic input that was very solid for a $60 solution the portability is great the constructions great and then the objective numbers on the headphone out also posted solid figures even though the crosstalk wasn't the best I've seen I can't really critique them that hard considering how small this unit is so creative have done a great job to implement all this hardware in a little unit that's going to serve you well if you want to be a competitive gamer or if you want to have a bit of fun with the software side or if you want to mix things up with that game mix technology and also pack with all the other features like muting your mic on the fly volume changes on the mic volume out and also the mixing tab and the equalizer hotkey as well as the optical out this thing's really giving a lot of value in a small unit like this so I can thoroughly recommend this little thing for someone especially if you've got a very cheap onboard audio solution as we saw with those latitude numbers for that Dell laptop they were absolutely horrible so please guys do your ears a favor because it's one of the five senses and you want to keep that and keep it in good shape and headphones driven by very cheap on-board amps is the quickest way to damage your ears especially if you're listening at loud volumes as we saw for those eighty decibel differences that's 80 decibels that's massive in the differences between the lowest and high points so basically if you're listening to music you may not even notice that your ears on a cheap solution for example is giving you the damage that it's actually giving you but you will notice in the form of you is ringing afterwards so remember guys very bad distortion does cause problems for your ears very quickly and it's good to see that this thing had very low distortion and it had some really good numbers so it's a great solution for someone who wants to get good audio on a budget and this is what I like to see creative doing if you guys enjoyed today's review then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below what's your experience with audio both headphones and speakers I prefer speakers personally because again that's an extra layer of defense for your is plus I like to move around and listen to music a lot though I love hearing your thoughts and opinions because if you're a competitive gamer then technically headphones is going to be better than speakers due to the distance of that sound has to travel from the speakers to your is which will give you an a competitive advantage if you're using headphones versus speakers but I don't really play competitive anymore but love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we've got the question of the day which comes from Gami two to four and they ask why do you always use extremely cheap parts and use Aliexpress for links so this is got to do with basically when I'm especially when I'm using Zeon's this question came from the Jules Eon set up that I used whenever I'm using Zeon's always put I'll Express links because I'll Express has got great prices on you Xeon CPUs that anyone in the world can get access to and I personally buy a lot of these Zeon's off Aliexpress and use them for my own builds hence why I can recommend it a lot so it's great value and a lot of the times when I pick up local deals as well if I can't replicate that price and it's pretty cheap on Aliexpress then I'll also put that link in the description below so someone who say kind of get access to deals locally can then get a similar build or price to what I got here on the channel anyway hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and if you've enjoyed the video and you've stayed this far and you want to keep getting the content the moment it drops don't forget to hit that sub button ring that bell and I'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music]
