wherever you are in the world right now
i want you to quickly stop what you're doing and
take a look at the clock because you know what time it is it is
used pc parts hunting a clock with tech yes city we're going to jump in the tech
yes mobile and go look for some of the best price performance
deals money can buy on the used market but before we do that
we've got to come into this month with a strategy there are things that i'm
particularly looking for and the main ones being of course gravis
cards that has been a trend i think through all of 2020
and i don't foresee it stopping anytime soon if we can find a gpu
at a good price we're going to snap it up another thing i'm looking forward to
is desperately is ddr3 memory and were we're going to probably have to make a
separate video on ddr3 memory itself because what's
going on right now is something really bizarre where the
prices of ddr3 memory new are more expensive than ddr4 memory this
is a true thing and you probably like me and you're left
scratching your head but we're still going to look for used power supplies as
well and of course any good one-time deals whether it's whole systems oem
systems we'll go pop up and see les but also
another thing i've noticed with cpus and motherboards
i'm not too keen on looking for them because i've already got
quite a few motherboards and i5s and things like that but
we're also looking at ryzen 330 100 and also an a320 for example
coupled with cheaper new ddr4 memory now that's definitely bringing
a ceiling to the used market in terms of i7 7700s and other cpus like that where
these things will go more expensive on the used market than a
ryzen 3 3100 would go for on the new market so
there's a bizarre thing happening there but if you can sift through all that and
create better value with your systems of course the ultimate
goal being a gaming pc then that's what we're going to be doing
here this month though speaking of deals there is no better way to start off a
parts hunt than already scoring a deal what we've
got up first here is a 120 hertz 27 inch ips gaming monitor this is called the
overlord i believe it's a korean ebay import
but at 140 aussie dollars for these specs 1440p
ips 120 hertz i think i'm getting an absolute bargain they wanted 150 for it
i managed to shave off a tenner but before we go up and pick that up
we're going to go on good old gametree and facebook and check out what deals
they've got so let the hunt begin so this might sound a little bit weird
and for me personally it is weird because i've never done a parts hunt
like this in this manner but i started looking
high and low through good old game tree and facebook and we'll get on to that
soon but basically what happened was i was
planning to hit up that put all the offers in and then go hit up
les in brisbane but what happened was someone called me
and then another person called me and i got
two sales in a row for gaming pcs so when that happens and a solid offer
comes in i always give that top priority above
everything else because you never know when a solid offer will come in again so
that's what happened but then on top of that the guy with the monitor
he messaged me and he was like well i'm staying out late for dinner and i was
like okay then what's going on he's like let's
make it tomorrow morning and i'm thinking okay well
i can't call up les too late because i've done this and i've only done this
once and i've rocked up to les is like i think it was
close to around 7 pm and he was like he was furious
so i know not to do that again to poor old les
so um basically if i called him up at like you know 6 p.m i'm like yo leslie
i'm stopping through he'd basically tell me to foe
so i'm going to call him up tomorrow morning we're going to hit him up we'll
go hit this monitor up and hopefully by that time all these offers that we've
put down offers on they'll get back to us and we've
actually got a heap of good deals here we'll pull up the first
which is a gtx 1070 azus jewel they wanted 350 i put down an offer of
280 aussie and i'll put the usd pricing up here for
you guys so at this price point it's pretty decent if we can land it for that
it's going to go well in a gaming pc then the next offer we found
is for a gtx 774 gigabyte and obviously being the 4 gigabyte model
it carries especially the vram and look guys i'm not a big
believer in the vram thing but trust me it works when you're flipping a
gaming pc the gtx 770 off the top of my head
should possibly be even faster or just as fast as a 1050 ti
4 gigabyte but this is going for 80 aussie dollars now
i put in an offer before before this parts hunt even began i put in an offer
for a gtx 1050 ti for 120 aussie dollars and apparently
that the guy went and sold it for 160 or 150
or something like that i'm thinking to myself okay like 150
aussie dollars for a 1050 ti is out of my price point so this 770 at 4
gigabytes actually represents really decent value
so hopefully we'll get that next up here we've got a gtx 964
gigabyte uh we're just trying to shave off a
little bit off this they're actually selling it for a decent price at 100
aussie we've just put in an offer of 90 aussie dollars
and then after that we have some ddr3 memory we found some
kingston 16 gigabyte kit and they've got 80 on it but it looks like there's no
interest on it and when you see something
hanging up on the marketplace for a while with absolutely no interest
you can sometimes put in these offers and they might think okay if it's cash
just come and get it so 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory in this current climate
considering how deer ddr3 is at the moment brand new for unbuffered stuff
i would say that's a pretty solid offer next up here we've got a 32 gigabyte kit
of ddr3 memory now i put in an offer of 120 aussies so
we'll see if they get back to us on that because
i am kind of desperate for ddr3 memory right now i'm running dry
and then we've got a 4770k and we put in an offer here of 80 aussie dollars
they're asking a hundred so the asking price isn't that bad to begin
with but of course with a little shave hopefully we'll save a little bit of
money then next up here was an acer desktop a whole package monitor
keyboard mouse i5 a fourth gen eight gigabytes ram one
terabyte hard drive i just put in asking price of 125 aussie
dollars and so we'll see what they say with that
in the morning that's a pretty good deal at that price like that's looking pretty
good considering you could just shove in a graphics card
like a 1650 and you would have yourself a relatively
solid especially price performance wise you'd
have yourself a really good price performance gaming pc
but anyway moving on we've got a user with the name i don't know
very interesting username on gumtree and uh they've got a motherboard
16 gigabytes ram and a 2600k for 90 however they said they don't well
they haven't really tested it so they don't know if it works so initially i
threw them an offer of 90 now they have gotten back to us and they
said look i know the cpu and the ram works i'm just not sure about the
motherboard and i said okay i'll take the gamble
what's the best price you can do for us and they said they'll
do it for 60 aussie dollars so i'm like okay
sold i'll come and pick that up in the morning so that looks like it's a done
deal and then next up we have here the last up on
good old gametree is an a320 motherboard they're asking 50
dollars i put an offer of 40. and so it's a no-brainer at that it's a cheap
motherboard it's a decent one so we'll see what they say when they get
back to us in the morning though moving over to facebook marketplace i managed
to find two deals here that look pretty decent first off a 500
watt power supply it looks like a thermal take 500 watt even though they
don't really show any photos of it uh they're asking 25 dollars i just
dropped in an offer of 15 aussie dollars and this thing will power like you know
which is the next deal we'll show here like a r7 370 build so perfect gpu for
this power supply if you've got this combo
for this gpu they're asking 75 aussie i put in an offer of 50 small
so we'll see if they get back to us what they say
so we're going to let that sit overnight and see how it brews up
but it is looking pretty good like i'm not used to finding this many potential
leads in one weekend perhaps i have to do the
parts hunt a little bit earlier in the month this is
a little bit earlier than i'm used to doing it i'm used to doing it right at
the end of the month so maybe times are changing a little bit
anyway i'm going to get some good rest thunder charge up and we'll get back to
it in the morning and yes i do have the anti-hunchback uh device
on because you got to do it every now and then
right you don't want to get a hunch back you don't want to
start dwelling in notre dame here we are at the next day and it is a
rainy day but that rain is not indicative of what
the deals are looking like so far because
we had a few people get back to us already and the a320 motherboard they
said there's no io shield so they'll do it for 30 aussie dollars
and i'm like cool i'll take that and then there was also on gumtree
the motherboard the 2600k and 16 gigabytes of ram and
they said look they're pretty sure the motherboard might not be working
so they'll do the whole combo there might be someone messaging me but
the deal they'll do the whole combo for 60 aussie
dollars anyway back onto the i7 deal 2600k
p67 and 16 gigabytes of ram they're pretty sure the motherboard might not be
working so hence they've done it for 60 aussie dollars which
i'm gonna take the gamble on that because even if the ram
all works and the cpu and the motherboard don't we're still getting a
pretty decent deal so it should work anyway moving over to facebook
marketplace i managed to find a couple of new deals this morning which
is what those messages are about there's an i380 100 they're asking 70
aussie dollars i put in an offer of 50 aussie dollars
they accepted so that's i mean it's a really cheap price look the eight the
i380 100 is nothing special but a 50 aussie box i could definitely
make a really cheap banger with it especially considering i'm getting some
ddr4 memory 16gb kit for 80 aussie dollars so they
messaged me back they said they'd take 90. i offered 90.
and then we've got the r7 370. they messaged us back
and they said they'd take the 50 so we've got five deals that we're going to
go pick up right now and hopefully in that time that we're going to go pick
up that we'll go see les as well more of these deals that we put off us
down on yesterday will get back to us and you know if we've got a
spare few minutes on the road we'll check out if there's any more gpus
available and what not but it's looking slightly exciting
already let's get on the phone to les and see if he's ready to do an early
morning special for us hey liz what's going on mate what's that uh
yeah uh um uh how you been like just uh no i've been busy but i haven't got
much stock i'm just scraping the bottom of the
barrel oh mate ever since co started i think we're all
scraping the bottom of the barrel yeah hey what about your mate with those
ssds for green spot ah i'll i'll actually go with
the green line whatever it's called yeah i'll give him a call
and see what if he's had any word back hey so hopefully
there's some word hey yeah because um yeah every i think everything's in
demand right you know you need ssds you need ram
how are you going with ddr3 oh i just got enough for myself i happen
to buy more yeah yeah cause i got my hungry
house so what do you do yeah exactly right
like everyone wants eight giga ram you know what do you do
yeah at least well that's right who wants four gig around now they know
what i need for a buddy seventy dollar computer or something 80
buck computer i've got a couple there might be
well i mean you know just for for me i only just take a little bit of cream off
the crop you know what i mean like i'm just taking a little bit here and
the cream just scoop it all yeah it just was just like a little scoop you know
what i mean like you got you've got like a 200 litre bowl of ice cream and i'm
just taking just a couple of scoops out you know what i mean
so yeah i'm enjoying it too you know yeah i know yeah
to be honest oh okay like i act like actual like you haven't been
eating much i can spare you three hard drives or something if you need them
right okay cool yeah at the end of the day um
yeah you can buy them off that place in logan
fifteen bucks but uh yeah dude i've found that hey like i've had
to take back so many late models yeah those ones that those
guys man i've had to take back so many drives to them hey like literally one in
three drives will be screwed it's tough yeah the problem you know
it's gone then you've been half an hour time to get down and
go in yeah that's annoying that one i've had some problems with stuff from there
right gpus ram it's like sometimes it feels like
they're just taken anything and everything you're like exactly all right yeah okay
i'll pop on through on the stinger man i'll pop on through on the stinger for
you almost 1500 yeah like i've done quite a
few so anyway man i'll uh so we just got back now to the tech yes
studio kind of like an intermittent break before we have to go head out
again we got this a320 30 bucks i think that's
a bargain 30 aussie dollars for that uh let's
throw in some free keyboards the dirty ones and some mice
cables and all that stuff for us we got three 500 gigabyte hard drives off him
for 50 because he did the keyboards so i gave
him a little bit extra freeze drives and then a just a banger power supply
300 watt for 10 bucks sure why not there was an i3
8100 we got that for 50 aussie dollars and then we actually got five monitors
and i've already sold one of those so one of them's already gone but we got
these ones for 40 a pop the 22 inch dells one of them is already gone
and then we got this one for 20 bucks the lenovo it's a bit banged up
and then same with this one this is 30 this one's actually pretty good but a
little bit banged up and then we've got a 19 inch i got this
for 15 aussie dollars then we've got three pcs over here
where two of them i mean they're all aesthetically like
bad cosmetically damaged but they've got i5 45 90s two of them with eight
gigabytes a ram motherboard power supply we got them for
90 aussie each and then one of them with four gigabytes of ram for 70 aussie and
that's the one with the real dinged up case but les
can't use these so that's why i get them for pretty cheap
so i'm happy because i re-case them anyway but going forward from here
the reason i had to stop off is actually twofold i've got to sell a pc
soon i've had to do two other quick fixes
in the meantime and then i've also got to
wait on the guy with the monitor the 120hz ips panel i'm waiting on that
apparently went out parting last night and he's not going to be back till later
so i'm like damn kind of wanted to get that while i was
already up in brisbane but that didn't happen
and then there's a guy over another side of the town
which is like 40 minute drive and he hasn't messaged me back so everything
was pointing towards me quickly getting back and doing this other stuff
and then the other guy with the i7 2600 motherboard and 6 gigabytes of ram
he's really close to the other guy so it's like i'm kind of trying to make
synergy happen but i've kind of i don't want to leave
it too late because it's already like in the
afternoon about 3 p.m now so kind of got to hit the road soon but in
the meantime what i'm going to quickly do
is maybe look for a few deals because i'm waiting for someone to come around
pick up a pc which one of these monitors will be saying hey
see you later [Music]
kapow [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
so i'm going to make this really quick in between now and
me getting back to the studio there was two people like two people who said they
wanted tech yes delivery so i needed to hit that up and i've done
that now and then we've just got the 120 hertz
tempest overlord ips monitor so that's in the boot 140 hours you
finally scored that now we're going to go hit up these two
last deals the r7 370 i think that's 50 aussie dollars
and the i7 2600 six gigabytes around the motherboard so
it's time to finish off this parts hunt and get back but the one thing is i love
the nighttime driving i i've always been a nighttime driver
listening to music sorry the lights off automatically and it's like one of my
hobbies and passions so like this is kind of a bit of fun
a bit of tech yes time but let's get back to the studio let's go get these
last two deals get back to the studio and finally see
what we've got on the table [Music] [Music]
so after this mammoth day of being out on the road
doing the tech yes deliveries and all that we've finally picked up the last
deal where it was that motherboard ram and
cpu so we're going to check out that and see
what actually works and doesn't work out of that combo 60 aussie dollars man
that gamble is easily worth it and they also had a razer keyboard
mechanical switches and a cpu cooler master cooler which they
said they'd do for 40 bucks and i'm like yep throw that in the boot
so now we've just got to get back to the tech yes studio
and man i'm bugging it's like almost 9 p.m and i'm still out on the road
i haven't even had dinner yet so this is you know what i wouldn't do it any other
way i'm glad baby i'm glad we'll be blind but we'll be blind
[Music] [Music]
and here we are the next day thunder charged all ready to go
yesterday was just a mammoth of a day like it was
for a sunday too i have not worked a sunday that hard in my life
i don't think so that was that was just totally like out of this world so we've
got r7 370. that's the graphics card right there we're testing it out right
now with this monitor so we're getting a two-for-one test here
and they're both working absolutely fine this pc here i'm going
to sell it a little bit later today as well so that's how clutch it is
at the moment around here for graphics cards i need them i need them
desperately and that one there is working absolutely
fine really good card and this monitor is
beautiful i love and the reason why i love this
the overlord or these old-school korean monitors is because
they've got the gloss coating on them and if there's no sunlight in the room
we can quickly show you guys take the sunlight out the colors just
start just popping through magically and it's one of the things that i'm a big
fan of personally but we've also got 120 hertz on this thing
ips the screen is absolutely gorgeous besides these hideous beautiful
bezels around the outside so this monitor right here
for 140 is easily my favorite deal of this month
and then we've got this uh razer keyboard i've cleaned this up i've given
both the monitor and the graphics card and this keyboard
some tech yes loving and that cooler and this thing cleaned up really nicely
it looks really good uh we got the cooler and the keyboard
for 40 aussie dollars and it's these scissor
scissor switches so feels really nice everything works absolutely fine on this
keyboard and then we've got the last thing the test here and this is
the motherboard with the 2600k and the ram so what i'm going to do
is i'm going to test this motherboard with just an i5 2400
and some separate ddr3 memory that i know works first
because this uh cpu socket has it had two missing pins and it had a few
more bent pins and in the process of fixing trying to
fix one of the bent pins it just pretty much fell off so we got three
missing pins on this motherboard now so i mean three missing pins i don't
like my chances but we'll still give it a go and of course
even if the motherboard doesn't work but the 2600k works
and the memory works then we're still in we're still
up big time on this deal so let's check that out
right now [Music]
and some really good news now coming out of that motherboard is that it works
and the 2600k also works now i tried testing the memory out
and all three of those sticks were giving out the dram error message so
one thing about that memory is it could be what's called the high density memory
i think and that only works with the fx cpus i actually this is one thing i
don't know yet and if you guys have sort of like a diagram or some easy
way to tell visually how to check between high density and
low density memory that'd be really good that's one diagram
i could use because some of the writing on the memory chips
themselves is all just faded out and blanked out so i've got no
idea if that or no idea how to tell between
low density and high density memory and i've looked around for some good
diagrams on google and i can't find anything so
basically with the high density and the low density stuff the low density is the
only stuff that works with the intel's the majority of ddr3
is this stuff it's just they made these batches of high density stuff
which only works with the amd fx cpus at least
that's what i gather and i've had some sticks here that didn't work on intel
but then when i put it on the fx systems they do work so you can utilize
extra hustle out of that if you can get sticks that people don't think are
working but they only work for fx chips kind of like a weird thing going
on but the high density stuff is also generally cheaper on both the used and
new market though telling up this month's deals hunt we just had
some really good deals come through here i mean 30 aussie dollars
for an a320 motherboard a zeus board i'll take that
60 for cpu motherboard and memory that possibly could work
uh keyboard really nice keyboard with the cpu cooler 40 aussie dollars
we got here r7 370 50 aussie dollars les he always hooks up nicely with those
three banged up oem systems i can definitely
take all the juice out of that and utilize it we always get a heap of
monitors in case you want to do monitor keyboard mouse combos
and of course the cheaper you get them the better but of course les i don't
really need to check his stuff because he always checks it for me
which is an added benefit of going to les and buying off him
some of the other stuff we've already checked through it all the tempest
monitor absolutely gorgeous and it pretty much
tallies up everything here for 815 aussie dollars
and i mean in usd terms that's about 580 usd at the current market rates so we've
got absolute bargains and i mean in between we're doing all this
hustle and making all this synergy happen
and honestly it is sometimes i do get burnt out pretty hard
but uh you just keep going and i mean after i clock off this video i'm gonna
go hit the treadmill i keep fit you know go eat some sushi
and stuff like that because you gotta you gotta keep
yourself on point to stay on point and that's one thing we do around tech
yes i always encourage you guys to do that and uh stay on point and
one thing the last deal that i picked up sorry as a phone someone's going to pick
up a pc soon as well the last thing as well is
when i went last night to get the last deal
the person knew who i was now really nice guy and
they just said man you make it look so easy on the videos
and it's not the case like it isn't so easy but it's one of those things with
experience if you guys like doing anything in life starting out is
always the hardest thing like when i first got into this when i
was first bending back pins with a toothpick for example
it took me a long time to get the hang of it but now
i can bend pins back in just a couple of minutes with the
toothpick now of course in that sense itself let's give it another example on
that some people prefer the mechanical peso
the pacer method the mechanical pencils and of course that's a good method in
its own right but it doesn't work for me so i've over the last few years
especially the last few years i've seen what works for me
and i've worked on that and i don't mind sharing it here on the channel so
if you get into anything whether it's pc flipping or whatever
you've got to work on you and what works best for you and your methods
so that's just a quick example of one thing that i guess with me differs from
other people and how i bend pins back and you saw in this video right here the
success rate's pretty good like i got a board that i thought wouldn't
come back to life working again and it did so very quickly another thing
on that too is is the pricing of your rigs of course
you've always got to stay that's why high turnover works better than
making the best ultimate rig that you're going to sit on for a few months because
you're then not susceptible to market changes but another thing too speaking
of market changes i did put a few bids down on two 1050
ti's and i the most i'll pay for them is 140 aussie dollars
it's a 1050 ti i mean 1650 supers and 1650s for example 1650s
go for around 200 aussie dollars on sale and that's brand new and that's a better
car than a 1050 ti so why would i buy one on the
used market for 200 aussie dollars because that's what these people want
from why would i buy one for 200 aussie dollars when i just wait for the 1650
super deals not even have to leave my house get them
posted to my door and i've got warranty on them
so that's a big difference and another thing too about 1050 ti's
is i've probably had around maybe 25 of them or 20 or something come through the
studio and i'll tell you now they have a pretty
decent failure rate compared to 1060s and 1070s
for example i've had a heap of 1060s heap of 1070s
come through and i find the 1050 ti's fail a lot more
than the 1060s and the 1070s ever did so i'm guessing they use cheaper components
in the 1050 ti and that causes it to fail
a lot quicker so that's my gripe with paying
more than you should for a 10 50 ti anyhow that being said
i'm the last one one of them i offered 124
another i offered 144 in both cases they said it was way too
low it's actually i think it's a pretty fair price so i just moved along
so lastly speaking of deals that we missed out on we
didn't pick up that ddr4 memory what happened was i was up around that area
and then i got messaged about someone wanting to come over for a gaming pc
and then i had another thing that i had to get done so i had to rush back to the
studio and then the guy was going up north or
something he was going way too far away so
that deal just didn't happen and that was my own bad but
also it just was not fortunate in that the guy had to do
something else later that afternoon and it just didn't work out
and then some other deals that are in the works there was a gtx 760 that came
up for 60 aussie dollars i put the asking price in because
it's a fair price and someone else is definitely going to go snap it up if i
don't so they agreed to that but i've got to
go pick it up it's near lesser's place so
i'm going to probably try and pay now and get visual proof of it working just
say can you send me a photo of it working
and then i'll go pick that up later in the week and then the gtx 960 for
gigabyte they go back to us for 90 aussie dollars so
they said yes and i will go pick that up too so they're two
two more graphics cards that i desperately need and we've bagged and
tagged them so this month's part sign has just been
pretty epic i mean you if you always look for the good
deals you can find them they're out there
uh you just gotta i guess keep looking of course there's
the element of luck but luck will average out
if you keep trying and with all that out of the way i hope you guys enjoyed july
2020 use parts hunt of the month if you did be sure to hit that like
button for us also let us know in the description or in the comments below
what was your favorite deal of this month
i think that monitor just brings back memories for me personally it's a
sentimental thing so i'm going with that of course i think
the 2600k and the motherboard and the potentially working ram i've got
to check that out that's definitely going to be up there
in terms of the value for money deals though do let us know and also let us
know if you've been rocking some used parts of your own what deals you've
been picking up i love reading those comments as always just like this
question of the day here which comes from elva
and they ask why is disable meltdown protection greyed out
and this happens on either really old cpus
that were never exposed or potentially risks
at risk of meltdown uh security vulnerabilities
or it's on the amd ryzen cpus as well i think fx as well too
they're just not susceptible to it so that's why it's grayed out there's no
point in even enabling or disabling the option
there because they're not susceptible to those risks
it's only on the newer intel cpus or the i guess the ones with hyper threading
and stuff like that so i'll put the link for that video up here where we tested
spectrum meltdown updates disabled enabled
and also on the amd side of the fence we had i think the spectre update enabled
and disabled just that one we tested the performance
before and after and with that aside if you guys have stayed this far and
you're enjoying that tech yes content and you want to see it the moment it
drops sub buttons down there ring that bell
and you get as soon as it comes in your sub boxes and i'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye
[Music] you
