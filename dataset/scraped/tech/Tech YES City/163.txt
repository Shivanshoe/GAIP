gpu prices are at an all-time high however ethereum prices are also at an all-time high as well as ethereum difficulty what do these things mean well they could spell some good news for gamers in the potential next few months and i'm going to explain why according to at least the research i've been doing recently where the say for instance in rtx 3080 the profitability on one of these in terms of mining has actually come down when i last tested this a few months ago i was seeing around nine to ten dollars a day on an rtx 3080 in terms of daily profitability that has now dropped down to six to seven dollars so that is a 30 drop in its daily profitability now when profitability drops down the desire from miners to buy more of these graphics cards also goes down too however there is some good news around the corner for gamers who want to get their hands on graphics cards let's explore what this exactly is and how it can mean that there might be more gpus available very soon and especially at lower prices right off this quick sponsor spot we've got here the z590 motherboard that's right this is the phantom gaming itx with thunderbolt 4 usb 3.2 gen 2 front out double shot pro combining your neck and your 6e wi-fi together for double the speeds and the hyper m.2 gen 4x4 if you're looking for the best mini rtx motherboard that has it all then i'll put some links in the description below so the first big catalyst for driving down profitability for ethereum miners that's gpu miners predominantly at this point in time is the fact that there's two different companies and that's bit main as well as another company called inno silicon they're releasing asic miners and these are known as application pacific integrated circuits in other words these miners that these companies are releasing in the next two months they are dedicated towards mining ethereum and with that they also bring higher efficiency and much higher hash rates now this is important to look into because one of these manufacturers bitmain is touting that they've got 3 000 mega hashes of crypto mining power and ethereum and this is important when we contrast this to an rtx 3080 which gets around 90 to 100 mega hashes this means that this one asic miner can potentially mine at roughly 32 rtx 3080s and it does it from one box and it does it with a lot better power efficiency so what this means is a lot of corporations will then be buying up these asset miners and this will drive out the profitabilities of the current crypto based gpu mining and the first reason is of course the higher hash rates but the second reason is of course they're much more compact 32 rtx 38s is going to take up a lot of space one asic miner will take up much less space so the current crypto farms and all the corporations that are buying up precious gpus will now have the incentive to switch over to these asic miners which will bear them more profit when it comes to mining so basically the crux of this is as these asic miners start coming online and bringing with them higher hash rates they'll essentially drive the profitability down for the existing gpu miners and hopefully the existing gpu miners will then get pushed out of ethereum now you're like well brian the gpu miners will then just go to another cryptocurrency and this is where i did a bit of research in the last few days and i've been seeing that people are talking about different cryptocurrencies if you were to alternatively mine to that of ethereum and currently it stands at cryptocurrencies like ergo there's conceal aka octopus there's also xano but what i decided to do here was add up all the total market caps of these cryptocurrencies and also the 24-hour trading volumes of the top 10 alternative cryptocurrencies that you can mine as opposed to ethereum and keep in mind the profitability even on something like an rtx 3080 drops tremendously at current market rates so when i did this math i found that the top 10 cryptos that you could mine for profitability after ethereum ended up being not even one percent of the market cap of ethereum and an interesting trend here was that the 24 hour volume was also under that of one percent meaning that if you had a lot of crypto miners jumping off ethereum and going to these other cryptocurrencies they would simply get overwhelmed and the profitabilities with that would drop tremendously so basically when we talk about crypto mining and profitability we're pretty much referring to ethereum and so now that these asset miners are in production and they're coming online there's going to be a lot of demand from them from corporations and that will essentially as we said before put pressure on the gpu miners and as their profitabilities go down they won't be willing to pay as much of these higher prices especially from scalpers and overpriced redistributors and that means the prices should come down at least temporarily there's also a miner from inno silicon which provides 2 000 mega hashes and comes in at a price point of 15 000 so the profitability versus the cost outlay of these asic miners is much better than the current pricing of rtx 3080 street pricing and of course coupled in with the better efficiency this will make for a much better option for people who simply want to make profitability mining ethereum which when we check out the profitability of ethereum it's much higher than that of the other cryptocurrencies at this point in time though some other good news in the form of gpu availability actually comes in the form of the gpu supply itself when i've spoken to nvidia they're telling me that they're shipping more 3000 series cards than they've shipped in the history of other gpu launches especially compared to that of the previous generation the rtx 2000 series and then i'm talking to amd and they're doing their best to get supplied to the market as well albeit i would like to see a card for instance like the rtx 3050 or a cheaper variant that's new and provides better efficiency out on the market though for what is worth a lot of people have their eyes on something like a 3060 ti or even an rtx 3060 and with the news from the asic miners putting pressure on the gpu miners this can only spell better availability all other things considered but what about playing devil's advocate for a moment and looking at say for instance a scenario where the crypto prices were to keep rising say for instance the ethereum price just keeps going up well that is a possibility but if we look at the previous trends of the exponential increase in the crypto prices especially ethereum over the last year we can actually see that that exponential growth has come to a slow down over the last two months so when that price starts leveling out and then you've got pressure from asic miners coming in it pretty much lets the market dictate the price of not only the gpus but the profitability of crypto mining itself and so there's that age old saying the cure for high prices is high prices however in this case it would seem the cure for crypto mining and profitability would simply be greed and self-interest which does seem to have reached a peak and so from here on in i can only really see two trends taking place and that is gpu availability gets better or we start seeing massive amounts of inflation due to governments printing out and providing excess supply of dollars though as for the inflation scenario that is a scary reality so the next few months are going to be crucial to see what is happening not only in the cryptocurrency world but also the broader economy in general but that being said if you have been patient in the last few months waiting for gravis card prices to at least normalize somewhat then your patients may be rewarded with the help from the asset community now there's also one more curveball to throw into this whole cryptocurrency mining demand and that is the fact that ethereum itself could move over to a proof of stake system where then mining becomes completely irrelevant and if this was the case then the whole mining scenario on the cryptocurrency ethereum would simply come to a halt but usually if they do something like this it will be in more slower steps where they change the percentage rewarded to proof of work where also this would directly affect profitability and that would become less and less also so everything points to less profitability for gpu miners which in turn will mean better availability and better prices for people who want to potentially buy a gpu for gaming so anyway guys i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comments section below what you think of the whole mining scenario versus gpu demand love reading your thoughts and opinions as always but another thing i will throw out there if you're someone who's sitting on a lot of rtx 3060 ti's or a lot of rtx 3070s or even 3080s then perhaps you might want to start selling some of those in case there is a massive supply spike from dropping profitabilities and to quickly quote one of those groups from the early 2000s eiffel 65 too much of heaven can bring you underground heaven yeah can always turn around too much of heaven and we've got the question of the day here which comes from te dej and they ask hey i'm currently on an i7 7700k it would make sense to upgrade to an i5 11400f the simple answer is yes it would make sense in that you'll get two more cores four more threads and you will get a performance boost but i would say if you're sitting on a z2c for instance or a z170 then i've got a video in the works that might be an alternative answer but i do have to still test it so stay tuned for that without some pretty cool options from aliexpress which means that you wouldn't have to go purchase another motherboard and you could sell that 7 700k on the free market and the upgrade itself wouldn't cost a whole lot of money though again i'm only in the early stages of testing this is the product right here i will drop that video so if you want to see that the moment it drops and the other tech videos around tech yesterday be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] yes
