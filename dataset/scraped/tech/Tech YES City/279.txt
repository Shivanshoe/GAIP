the corsair h-115i elite capel x is it just me or are these titles getting a little bit confusing nowadays well if they are i'll help break it down for you the 115 on the cooler lineup refers to corsair's millimeter radiator solutions where the 100 refers to 240 mil for example and the 150 refers to a 360 mil solution the elite capelix however differs further from other models with two 140mm ml fans these fans are typically quieter than other 140ml solutions and you may notice that these fans look very similar to that of the h-159 rgb platinum coolers fans as well and that is because they're essentially identical however after the 115 comes the i and this stands for iq this is called says software utility and here you can change the colors of the rgb fans rgb pump head and even change the fan operation mode for the capel x model with three different settings that is balance default mode quiet and extreme finally however the h stands for hydro that is water now you may wonder why i always want to look at the 280 mil versions which are my personal favorites even over the 360 mil solutions i mean after all bigger is certainly better right well the difference between these two actually has to do with 140 mil fans versus 120 mil fans as the bigger numbers of 150 versus 115 for example certainly doesn't make me feel insecure i mean i've got an ex-wife for that basically i know what i want when it comes to a cpu water cooler though is the h115i elite capel x what i really want over the h159 rgb platinum and the short answer is i still prefer the rgb platinum h115i and we'll go over the numbers here to explain that further basically out of the box the default fan profiles are quieter on the platinum even though the temperatures are better on the elite i do actually prefer lower noise since my computers are usually des mounted and are quite close to my ears i decided to test this over four different cpu setups and the numbers are very consistent these 280 millimeter coolers do a very good job even that over the flagship air coolers out there on the market though corsair says the elite capel x has a new pump design and in testing it performed well and the new capel x leds there is 33 of them by the way are essentially smaller brighter and more efficient rgb leds that do a great job of pushing out the bling you even get a swappable clear plate if you want more rgb to shine through however the ml1 40mm fans are still what looks to be identical to the h115i rgb platinum and as i said before it performs similar to the point where it's more a fan profile trade-off and i personally think corsair absolutely nailed it with the h115i rgb platinum fan curve profile over the new elite capellax series i wouldn't change it it's perfect and it's my go-to recommendation for someone who wants a premium cooler and can afford the extra bling to cool down a high-end cpu though at 169 us versus 189 and in australia 244 versus 259 dollars the elite series does cost more and this is another reason why i do prefer the rgb platinum however that said you do get with the elite cappellax the commander core rgb control box this allows you to connect six pwm fence and six corsair rgb connections which then connects to your computer via usb 2 front out in the software you can link the rgb to other corsair products and have syncing effects there is also multi layers of rgb that you can add and to quite simply put it the iq software is very polished and works extremely well for customization when it comes to rgb however i do like to set it to the temperature setting so it does more than just aesthetics it's actually indicating how hot my cpu is getting i think this is a really good thing if you're overclocking like me and you're constantly being conscious of overheating also included in the box is the amd and intel mounting brackets so this will mount to either platforms with these including am4 and thread ripper and even though it doesn't say it on the box x58 lga 1366 it will also amount to that as well clearance on practically any motherboard is also a big plus for all-in-one water coolers some air coolers for instance will have troubles mounting on certain motherboards especially if the vrm component area is beefy i'm yet to have this problem on any corsair water cooler that has come through here and i've tried a lot of motherboards and also lastly corsair do stand behind their water coolers offering a five-year warranty on the elite compellex ultimately it's now conclusion time and if you like better temps at the cost of more noise and you like more rgb and the included command controller box is for you then this cooler is a solid option but for me personally it costs more than the h159i rgb platinum which is still my favorite go-to cooler on the premium side of things and when i'll send one in for review a while ago i absolutely loved it and since then i bought two more for my personal pc and benchmarking setups the balance of temps noise and aesthetics really struck a chord with me personally anyway if you guys enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the
