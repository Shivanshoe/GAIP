over a few months ago here at tech yes
city we started a series where the goal was to start with a
hundred dollars and flip my way up to a high-end gaming
pc and now we've got some good and we've
also got some bad news and obviously the bad news is that due
to a certain worldwide phenomenon at the moment we have had to
delay this series because the market went all
haywire but the good news is since i did that first episode right before
all that happened we had sold five pieces that we picked up for a hundred
dollars and we've made 520 aussie dollars so
that was the most crucial part of this series and we absolutely
nailed it but now in the second episode here today
we are not going to stop we have got the goods ready to go to
pick up some of the best deals and get those gaming pcs flipped and
flip our way up so get excited and let's get into it
[Music] so jumping straight into the deals it's
always a good thing when you're on a strict budget and you want to get the
best gear possible for the money something
that you can not only play games on yourself but also the
possibility if you want to flip it and make a bit of money
it all starts with getting the best deal now you can
wait and patience is a virtue here if you wait
then you can really pick up some good deals now of course the benefit of today
and i've already found this deal on facebook marketplace which we're going
to go check out very soon but the good thing about finding deals
today is is that it's a weekday and it's like right now it's 11 a.m so
if ads get posted up on the weekday when most people are at
work and it's just people clearing out their
old stuff you can get some really good deals during weekdays during
business hours i find these are some of the best times
to really get on your game so what we've got here first up is an i5 just desktop
computer but it also comes with a monitor
keyboard and mouse and from the phone i mean there's only one photo on here
so but what i see there is a lot of potential so we're going to at least go
check it out even though i'm sort of i told the guy look i'll pay the 200
asking price that you're asking for this if it does check out
so we're going to check that out right now but we also in the recent parts hunt
picked up an i5 banged up desktop computer from
les so we're going to use one of those that's 90 AUD
comes with an i5 4th gen 8 gigabytes of ram
and a power supply motherboard that's the crucial thing so to complete that
system the 90 dollar system all we're going to
need is a graphics card a case and a hard drive so upstairs here
with the tech yes calculator if i'm doing everything correctly
we should have maybe about a hundred dollars left over after we get a
graphics card and a hard drive for the other build and we still don't
know what could be wrong with this first build it could be something faulty we
might have to add something so i'm not too sure there so that extra
100 or so dollars that i'm still budgeting for in our budget is
still left over in case we come into some problems but if everything goes
right then we should definitely have here
potential to turn 520 aussie dollars into over a thousand dollars and that's
really going to put us in a good spot so finally let's go for a
ride and actually i know a few you guys
probably thinking well what about gas prices brian
you have to add that into the budget and uh here's a little secret for you guys
just borrow a ride off your friend you won't have to pay any gas so just picked up this first deal now
and this is looking really good i couldn't wait to get back
to the tech yes studio to check out what's inside it so i quickly pulled the
panel off and it's got an i5 45 90 and also an r7 270x 8 gigabytes of ram
750 gigabyte hard drive and a 400 watt power supply so power
supply should be fine we shouldn't have to replace it providing
everything works and that's one thing we've got to get back to the studio and
check it out for of course things like the cooler and the monitor
here do need a bit of tech yes loving so the monitor is 24 inch samsung but does
have a bit of dirt on it and this keyboard
and mouse these look amazing so hopefully they haven't had water or
anything dripped on them because i actually didn't test this out i just saw
it pop up and i'm like these are those kind of deals that you
just quickly snag up otherwise someone else is just going to come in and swoop
it up so we're going to now move on to the next
deal and get papa lopping [Music] so now we've got a crucial hookup here
from les which was really good and i'm super happy about this
uh the 500 gigabyte for 15 aussie dollars that's pretty standard in the
industry but then he had a b grade monitor
well i'd say b minus because it had a scratch on it and it's 22 inch
adele we got this for 20 aussie dollars and then we got the
keyboard and mouse thrown in so usually if you're picking up pc parts i find a
lot of people if they've got banged up keyboards and mice that are
dirty they haven't been cleaned yet they'll just give them away they'll
throw them in with the deal as a sweetener i mean when i sell pcs i do it
myself the thing is i'm pretty good with the
techies loving process at cleaning these keyboards and myself so it takes me
about five minutes and i can get them looking like brand new as well as that
hygiene they're very clean don't worry about that i use these
keyboards myself too and you've got to see me around techie
city i don't really get sick and of course around tech yes we do the whole
practice what you preach i use some of these uh
cleaned up keyboards around my studio haven't been sick for
i think like four or five years i haven't had like
any sort of illness or sickness so been pretty good
maybe you need a bit of tech yes loving in your life
anyhow from here on in we've just got to go around the corner to a computer
store and pick up a case loaded with four led fans
and that's 59 aussie dollars and it's got a clear side panel and stuff
this is pretty important because we need a very small case
where we can run our cpu from the hp power supply
so if it's too big we won't be able to run the cables but this looks perfect to
be able to run our cables and do everything in between so let's
get cracker lacking on that and in the meantime
we're going to look for a graphics card whether it's a 1050
or a 950 960. they're sort of like what we want because we're
using that stock power supply we can't go too heavy on the power consumption on
the gpu so these cars are usually perfect especially coupled
in with our budget so we're going to be very conscious of that
so let's go pick up this next piece and hopefully we'll find a graphics card by
then [Music]
so we're just on our way to the computer store and something really cool happened
that is i put down a few offers of gtx 950s and also 960s and one person came
back to us and i put in an offer of 80 and they
came back to us at 90 and that was for the 960 and it's in
the zoo strix so we're going to quickly go detour and
grab that asap and snap it up because everyone's hungry for gpus and that's a
pretty good price believe it or not where i'm at at the moment for gpu so
we're gonna go snap that up and then we'll go get the case
[Music] so we've finally got back to the tech
yes studio and we've got some really good deals
here i mean this is what it's all about when it's on a
budget but of course there is one risk and that is
we're still going to especially test out this 200 system
and we've got to put together this system right here and hopefully
hope that nothing goes wrong in the process though we've got a tally here
that's 474 aussie dollars and that gives us about 46 dollars left
to play with wiggle room in case we come into any
problems whilst we're building these two systems
out but yeah let the tech yes magic begin
and see what we can muster up here [Music] [Music] so [Music]
[Applause] [Music] now
[Music] and we've finally completed both these
setups however we're doing this one first like we're going to talk about
this we're going to install windows first
mainly because the other setup actually has a problem and we'll talk about that
in a second but for what it's worth we've got the 24
inch monitor that we got from the other setup and we're going to use
it with this one because there's rgb on the other one with the
keyboard and mouse and it's got some other selling points
but i feel like you shouldn't have all the strong
selling points in one ad and all the weak ones in the other so
we're using the weaker keyboard and mouse in this setup and then we're using
the stronger monitor the stronger 960 and then of course we've got the four
blue led fans which look great and we're going to use that to sort of mix and
match strength and weaknesses and that's a great thing to do
especially around this price point in my opinion we've also pulled out
three fans from the deep cool build that i feel i just we can keep these for a
later hustle especially because they're just
not shining through that front panel they're not going to make a difference
whatsoever we can add more bling later and then
we've also pulled off a usb bluetooth dongle that if we get a higher
end build we can add one of these on and it's a great selling point or we can
just someone wants to buy a dongle when we're flipping our pcs we can just
add 15 dollars on top so let's get windows installed on this
one and we'll hopefully this one works too like the graphics card
seems fine okay but you never fully find out if a graphics card's 100
until you install the drivers and start stress testing it so
let's get windows installed and then let's get on to this other build right
here while this one's uh sort of setting
itself up to save some time so this system right
here we can get into the bios which is great means the graphics card works the
ram is all showing up everything's fine here but there's just
one problem and that is if we go to
the boot device there's just nothing showing up so there's no boot
drives here we've got the starter cable plugged in we've got the drive plugged
in off the side of power it's absolutely fine but
there's just no uh drive showing up so i feel like the 750 gigabyte hard drive
that's put in this doesn't work at all so what we're going
to do is we're going to try and take this drive out
use the same cables with another 500 gigabyte hard drive i've got here
and if that works then we're going to have to add another 15
onto our build total and on top of that we've had to add another
five dollars in connectors that we used on the hb build
since we had a pca uh sata to six pin adapter for the graphics card
and we also had to then use a molex to solder adapter and then the molex to
the four pin uh fan headers and of course we
ended up soldering that on to get that to work in that hp build
so let's just try and change this drive around and
see what we can make out of it but i will say one thing so far
and that is that the keyboard and mouse look
better than i thought they would so that's going to be a great selling point
for this build the case looks tidy the 22 inch monitor
is going to go great i think we've got two winners if the
hard drive works i mean i'm hoping it's not the motherboard
that's going to be a big pain if that is the actual problem
[Music] uh
and now we're at the finished products because we've got two complete systems
that are set up i've been running these stress tests for quite a while
and they are running absolutely fine the noise is low the temperatures are
good everything is stable we are ready to rock and roll
and sell both these setups here and the best thing about both these
setups is windows 10 pro is activated on both of these systems i didn't have to
put any keys in but i did have a little bit of budget spare for that if i needed
to but we've got a system that's running
absolutely fine one thing i'll probably have to do on
the strix the 960 here is change the thermal paste around
as it is getting a little bit hot there so that's just one thing we can quickly
do before we sell it with that being said
though we'll get onto a conclusion here where i'll talk about how much i plan to
flip these for and what's the coming plan
after we hopefully sell both these pcs and with all that out of the way we are
at the finish line here for episode two of flipping our way and turning a
hundred dollars into a high-end gaming pc and i'm
already excited about these two setups because
i know they're going to sell because they're presenting really nicely
they're functioning a hundred percent we're stress testing it out in the
heaven benchmark leaving it on i'm going to leave them on all night
to make the like solidify the stress test but
other than that it's just this episode is the most crucial in terms of
trading our way up and not going backwards and then getting that healthy
budget to do much more we've got so many more
opportunities than we would have had previously when
we're on that tight budget of 100 bucks we had to really micro our way and get
these deals that we're going to make more money straight away and i had to
put a lot of time and effort into it this here today was just an afternoon
spent quickly banging up these two setups so it's getting easier
for me and i think as well when we look at what we're going
to try and sell them for i'm going to actually try and sell them for the same
price each and that's about 660 dollars for both the setup so combined that's
about 120 dollars so we're turning essentially that 520
into 1220 all things go well also another thing
too is that is in aud not us i mean 660 us would be
pretty expensive for either of these setups i wouldn't be
selling that myself it's just too much but in australia that's what
roughly this would go for for someone who's ready to get
a setup like this and it's all set up ready to go install their games
and they've got no more problems after that now in terms of the 500 gigabyte
hard drives yes there's no ssd in them but i think because they're newer 500
gigabyte hard drives i had no problems with them personally
i think they're fine i disabled some of the windows services to speed them up
and they're going to do an absolutely fine job of course if someone wants to
add an ssd in they've got the option in both of those
to put an ssd in and of course speed things up in
terms of their boot times but when we look at call of duty warzone that game
alone is now requiring 240 gigabytes of storage so
the 500 gigabyte even is going to be half full
by the time you even install that one game and we did throw on the call of
duty warzone background because both of these will play it on 1080p low
settings absolutely fine so they'll give out a smooth experience
for this game and overall i just think everything went
pretty smoothly besides that one hard drive that was busted
in that first pc deal that we picked up but that's not a problem really because
i expected that to happen i expected
something little to happen i mean all fingers crossed that the
graphics card wasn't the faulty part in the case of the gtx 960 that was
absolutely fine and then also the r7 270x r9
sorry i keep getting those confused i think there's one model i think it is
the 370 in the 370x it goes from r7 to r9 in the same numbering scheme
it's like anyhow with all that aside i hope you
guys enjoyed this one because this is easily the most
requested series that you guys have been wanting to see
the next episode of almost every time i make a video now someone is asking
for these episodes to come to their sub box and
i'm going to make sure i do it a lot faster than the last episode don't worry
it's just because of this whole thing that's happened worldwide i had to
uh seriously like do other stuff and i couldn't really go
out too much but now we've ramped it back up again
hopefully it just keeps continuing smoothly but that being said
i'm in one state in australia where everything's fine here at the moment but
the states like as you go further down south
it just like literally goes south in terms of
the conditions so it's like there's a victoria where i
live in australia i mean victoria's in like complete
shutdown at the moment so that is uh not a good thing i'm hoping
things get better down there but that aside if that happened up where i
live then there'd probably be another delay to this series but
hopefully it doesn't happen and when i come back with the next episode
i will report how much we sold these two setups for and we'll look at what we can
do with the extra budget that we're now
going to have available because going forward i'm really confident in
what we've got here and we've also managed to micro
three led fans and a sata cable as well and we've still got i think like 26
left over so we are microing hard but we're going into the next episode
and i'm sure we're going to have a bigger budget and finally before we get
on out of here we got the question of the day which comes from jd craft and
they ask can a xeon x 3450 with an rx470 stream and the answer is yes put the uh
load from the stream on the gpu encoder i
always say this and i actually did this recently with
the warcraft three uh setup that i made i actually did that i gave that a little
test that had a nice seven eight sixty i think it was or eight
seventy and that was pretty much a similar
uh to the xeon x 3450 though if you can overclock that x3450 xeon
then definitely do it and if you do want to stream i would recommend 16 gigabytes
of ram in your actual system too that does help
out if you've got another application open especially if you've got a website
open and some other programs like that in the
background it will help greatly but other than that you should
be able to stream just depends on the game of course
don't go into it expecting high settings and everything like especially on call
of duty war zone and then smooth fps you might have to
lower the settings but you will get a pretty good decent experience so you
should and hopefully that answers that question
and with that aside if you guys have stayed
this far and you're enjoying that content and you want to see it the
moment it drops then be sure to hit that sub button ring
that bell and also let us know in the comment section below
what was your favorite deal and favorite part of today's video
love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and i'll catch you on another
