hit that live stream hopefully we're live hopefully we're live and i'll just wait for a little bit of chat to come in and um you know it's been it's been really crazy this morning i've been trying to set up the live stream for hours and i've had some big problems like i'm on the gh 5s i was on the other camera before and it just wouldn't work i just kept getting a black screen and i was like what's going on here so i put it down to a faulty hdmi connector so hopefully there was a faulty hdmi connector that i had and i just like i was losing my mind this morning trying to get the live stream thing to work so if you have an issue with a black screen if you're trying to hook up a camera to your computer then it's probably going to be a hdmi connection issue but anyway we're back this month we are live come join come say hello come chat and i can see you guys already joining the chat welcome this is the uh i do two live streams a month that's usually what i aim to do just chat with you guys you got questions uh hang out if you've got really important pressing matters that you need to get off on your chest and um and uh and uh donate the camera someone's like donate the camera to me here's the camera here okay so the camera still works the camera still works like it's still fine it's just there's something i think there's something wrong with this hdmi port and that's causing it it was just causing so many issues i tried everything i was putting in like a dedicated usb card people are like oh you gotta put in a dedicated usb card i was um i was trying usb settings in the bios trying different usb connections with video adapters because i got a backup so i had a backup one and just wasn't doing anything i tried another computer it didn't do anything so okay we'll try a different camera completely and a different hdmi cable and there we go it's all fixed so anyway so yeah so now and that's the thing there's a little bit of a bonus here is that we've got this camera it should be recording in 4k or at least like it's 4k true 4k downsampled to 1080p so it should look a little bit better than this right here which is only doing 1080p output so hopefully the live streams are a little bit better and uh but we've got a live stream for you guys where there's some um sort of i'm watching it unfold right we're watching this unfold in real time so i noticed from the parts hunt that there was a few more gpus up for sale and and it was actually it was getting to point i'm calling it the point of no return for uh these i'm calling it kind of like the point of no return here where it's going to get to the stage where crypto mining profitability is going to go down to a point where people like oh should i just sell the cards now or should i hold on to these graphics cards should i just sell the cards now hold on to them and mine a little bit more and it's gone down like i mean when you look at it profitability's gone down i think 20 percent in the last two days if it keeps going down at this trajectory we could at any moment see that inflection point happen where people like all right i'm getting out now i don't want to lose too much on my graphics cards and then the the show that's when the file the fireworks really start beginning so um that's uh that's what we're at right now five dollars probably around thirty eighty so if we were to drop in a uh rtx 3060 ti then uh that's the i think that's the main one right the 360 tr was getting bought up in droves this was the main one that was getting bought up in droves and people like man i really want my 30 60 ti so here's the profitability here i'll show you guys it's saying it's about at the moment three dollars and fifty cents for a 360. now people will point to this one right here ergo they'll be like brian there's these old coins and they're making the miners so much more money and i saw this tweet recently i just saw this tweet um on twitter and someone tagged and video and they're like yo care to explain uh yo you care to explain this nvidia you've only nerfed the uh ethereum dagahashimoto mining uh crypto mining node and they don't like there's nothing really to explain there i mean this should say it all this uh crypto that people are gonna point to and be like oh man ergo's profitable bro i'm just gonna switch over to ergo it's like the volume traded in one day on this cryptocurrency is 1.7 bitcoin like i mean you could probably have a tradie with a small sole trader that's someone who runs their own business trade more in one day than this crypto is uh trading in the world so don't look at the like when you look at these cryptocurrencies look at their market cap and look at their volume volume especially because it shows you how much the the cryptos trade i mean if we look at this one here i mean if you guys like donate a few dollars to us i would probably beat this uh this crypto and its volume in 24 hours so you have a lot of people looking at these altcoins and they're relevant when you look at the sheer size and volume of ethereum and that's where all the mining is built up at the moment all the ethereum mining is built up in this highly liquid ethereum market that's got a huge market cap and huge volume so if basically if ethereum goes down all the miners will then disperse to all these other cryptos but they'll quickly realize that it's not going to be profitable and so the guys selling their graphics cards now probably the smartest fish in the room in the pond but anyway there's other good news though so we've got the grav scars inflection point that's what i'm calling it i'm going to say i've seen actually quite a few rtx 3060 tier ti's and 3060s coming up locally here i am people are kind of like trying to get that premium still but some of the guys are discounting them i've seen 6 700 xt's coming up for sale so it does look like i guess some people are trying to are getting a bit nervous maybe and they're starting to sell their gpus down and that can only mean one thing that means more deals for us guys so stay tuned the good news is getting better that's why i'm just i'm keeping a close eye on this because it has everything to do it has everything to do with uh what we do here at tech sydney let's build gaming pcs and i think the whole broad youtube enthusiast tech scene in general is that if you're building pcs you can you can look for deals here there and everywhere but what's the point if the graphics card's an absolute rip-off and so that's the problem that's faced uh in the market at the moment um and we got you know best time to mine is the bear market i mean that's a good one like i think i've spoken to some people like they're talking about you know best time to miners in the bear market i mean if you if you can take the um if you if you have your own power consumption and all that stuff and you think crypto's going to go to the moon again then yeah definitely take that advice i mean for me personally i i was out of crypto in the uh 2008 by 18 boss i got out right before it went bust and ever since then i've just been watching on the sidelines so that's how come this time around i'm actually really surprised it went so big that's the um that's the one i'm just surprised about because there's so many and we just keep talking about there's so many cryptos out there and they just keep like the the rate at which new crypto currencies are being introduced to the market is just accelerating so fast i think it went from like i think it's over 10 000 crypto currencies that now have now been minted which is it's insane so um just be careful out there if you are investing you know this is the funny thing the guy from the deals hunt yesterday there was a guys from the deals hunt and uh he he told me like he uh he told me there was this good guy from this um i picked up that power cyber power pc off him and he was he was a really cool guy like we just got chatting i was like you know what are you doing oh man i'm into crypto you're into crypto i'm kind of like nah man i'm just watching on the sidelines uh just having a look and he's telling me um this guy's telling me he's like oh man i i the recent drop like the recent crash i'm kind of just above break even and i'm thinking to myself well and he's like oh it's going to go back up and he's so he's telling me he's like man this is going to go back up and i'm like as it stands you don't know if it's going to go back up no one has a crystal ball so if you think crypto's going to go back up that's great but just be prepared to uh if there's some if it crashes be prepared to uh suck up those losses and i'm thinking you know i could just i could just see it in the making you know like at the end of the day i just hope some of you guys aren't in a position where you don't know what you're buying that's all and so i do keep warning about that because i think there's going to be some people that get caught out if there's a massive crash in crypto some people will get caught out cause i got a few other friends who were telling me they're like man i just cashed out uh made a heap of money cashed out and they're setting off into the sunset they're out buying a new car someone else put a deposit on a house i mean that's that's some great news i mean if you're cashed out and you you really can turn that crypto into some real hard assets good on you you've done well uh but for the you know but you gotta remember that there's always someone there's a transfer of the bag there so basically someone else has bought those cryptos when they're gone up in price and they've given that money to someone else and now they're using that money to do and buy other things so i mean it's all relative though but anyway let's get on to the good news uh even better news is that we've got some good news here and that's if you guys have been after a new ryzen 5000 series they're like they're looking like they're in stock and they're back to that 299 price point i remember for a while uh these ryzen cpus were just uh they were going crazy everyone wanted to get one and uh the prices just went through the roof but now they're coming back to a sense of normalcy so that's good to see and that sort of like backs up but maybe this this fomo has sort of dropped off a bit i think people got into um not just pc part but there was this fomo to get the parts even when they were priced way above the msrp and i mean i've talked about here on the channel i've talked about inflation happening inflation's a separate issue altogether inflation you'll see that happening and i think i'm already see i mean i know i'm already seeing it here because i'm i'm going out and buying things and i'm seeing inflation rates that are you know i'd guess around 5 to 10 so but inflation's a different story when you've got prices on these pc parts just going way above like just shooting through the moon and they're just double msrp you know something is really off and i mean society can't monetize money that quickly well i mean the us government can but that's whether that trickles down to everyone in the economy is a different story but in terms of this cpu here it's good to see that this one here the ryzen 5 5600 x is back in stock and the prices are good and then we've got up here next i've got double i pull up a double tab there 5900 x i was going to pull this up because this one i've seen this go up to like i thought i thought i saw this go up to like 900. at 680 it's still overpriced i mean you're not getting a really good deal this cpu needs to fall back down to that 500 price point before it's a go but keep in mind when it gets under 500 bucks it then starts becoming a really good cpu to get so i've been watching that one i've been on the sidelines it is coming down a bit but that one's in the works of coming down so then the 3600 this one's finally dropping down to that 200 price as well so the 3600 the one of the most favorite six core 12 threaded cpus especially with the given the upgrade pass that one's coming down to 200 bucks now so that was a that was a delight to see that one and someone put in the comments newegg has the 5800x for 429 so there you go we're seeing cpus at least with the new ryzen 5000 silicon that's normalizing then there's this one here i mean look if you want to build a budget pc and you're like look brian i know crypto's gonna go belly up if you if you if you can trust your gut and you're sitting on the sidelines waiting for the big one waiting for the big one to happen waiting for the big drop the big bonanza you can build yourself a cheap 10 100 rig now wait for like a 1660 super to come up on the market uh especially for 150 bucks not too bad then you've got a motherboard 73 bucks still decent and then you go on to something like uh 79 for 16 gigabytes of ram and a power supply for 40 bucks now go build whatever case you want and then you've got ssd 24 bucks and you're good to go just go get a one terabyte hard drive so but how about ram though isn't there a shortage so you guys are asking in the comments about ram isn't there a shortage uh like i'd like to get see i'm also one well one good thing is that i do have some contacts in china that ship and you find them through alibaba and stuff but they constantly give you prices and you see those price swings you're going to see a lot of like shortages like the word shortage is going to be thrown around a lot and the only thing that there's a really there's a shortage i mean the factories all these factories are still pumping out these tech products as quick as they can it's really a it's over over demand well there's too much demand and so we've spoke about this before and that just comes from people are being cashed up from cheap money so really when the demand falls off the prices will fall off too a little bit so um i don't think there's any ram shortage at all i just think it's just uh i mean there'll be some articles coming out which you know whether they're whether those news articles the whoever's making those news articles has the sources that they're getting the information from is right but i'm always a little bit skeptical of it but in the meantime guys if you know always uh just keep things into perspective don't try and get into the whole fomo thing because fomo can cost you a lot of money especially if you make the wrong especially on big purchases so try not to get into that sort of fomo thing do your research before you buy something of course if you've done your research and you know the price is good say for instance if you've done your research on a 1660 super and that price comes down to like say for instance you see a 1660 super now for 250 bucks you're like okay i know that's a good deal just gonna just gonna get it and you're not gonna lose too much so i think when you get a deal always always try to look on the other side of the fence and say how much can i lose on this deal so at the moment that's the pc prices uh we've got this month it's come up so what is fomo it's fear of missing out so basically people like for instance my brother is a true story i'll tell you about fomo uh so my brother um the other week oh man this one was bad so i was having a chat with my brother and he's like he's showing me all these like he's just going at this there's this cryptocurrency called xrp and my brother was just like brian you've got to buy this now you know you've got to get xrp right now this was like when i was like two dollars or something it was like in australian dollars like two dollars something and um and he's just telling my mom as well he's like telling my mom my dad he's like yo you got to get x up you got to get this cryptocurrency right now you've got to get it you're going to miss out it's going up to like 500 you don't understand and i'm like i'm just sitting back i'm like like i said to him if you've ever studied uh liquidity and volumes of certain things you'll realize there's a momentum factor right so if you look at the price of something right so it all relates back if you look at m2 money supply right there's a thing called m2 money supply and that's the actual money going around in bank accounts cash everything so m2 money supplies your base right if that starts going crazy then you got to start worrying yeah maybe maybe go crazy like if it starts going really crazy like we're not talking even last year it went pretty crazy but we're talking like just astronomical levels the charts start going through the roof if that starts going too too crazy then you've got to worry but as it stands right you had the us government going crazy on the printers they were going 25 uh 30 but you got to understand like when a crypto goes from say 50 cents to 2 that's a four was it for 300 profit 400 gain it can't keep going at that rate if it just keeps going at 400 percent in a week you're going to end up at yeah probably 500 in five weeks but there's no real asset class that does that with real liquidity and we're talking real liquidity where everyone's in the market everyone's trading it it's a highly liquid market the only time that's ever going to happen is some of these alt coins if you see on cryptocurrency there's some of these alt coins that have no liquidity in them and that's because no one's buying them but they they pretty much prop up the demand and make it the price look like it's really going up so quick so fast that's where you'll see that crap but when there's a highly liquid market and there's people trading that asset a lot then you're going to see prices if they do go up 200 or 300 a week you've got to stop and think okay has this gone up too much too quick and should i just wait it out a little bit and basically with ripple i said to him i said to him um i said to my brother i said just wait just wait like just wait a couple of weeks let things settle down a little bit and then buy some ripple and he's just like no you don't understand you've got to get in now ripple's going to 500 bucks and he's literally like you got my mom to invest i think it was like a couple thousand dollars and i said to my mom i said like i was calling on the phone what are you doing like you know just just wait just be patient a little bit and sure enough like literally like two days later the price of ripple goes from like two dollars in australian down to like 90 cents and see me and my old man uh dadman if you guys have watched the channel for a little while you'll know uh me and dadman we were just laughing at this like dadman was really laying it in like he was like can i get some investment tips on how to lose uh how to lose 50 of my money in a couple of days and um look i was laughing as well but you know my mom my mom and my brother oh man like they were just like oh like my mom was kind of like just the sucker and all this but my brother's like doesn't matter man i'm holding for the long run i'm in it for the long run i'm just gonna stay in this you don't like no one understands and apparently i don't understand momentum and prices of things and how prices can't keep increasing at certain rates because sooner or later the liquidity is going to run out basically the easy money will come to a stop unless it does keep coming into the system so you always keep that right always just try not to go fomo on things unless you've done your research and you know hey there's much more money coming into this sector and the best thing to make if you guys want to make money like you know if you guys see this sort of um if you guys see this kind of a thing happening before your eyes uh and you're like okay well i want to be the guy who invests in dogecoin at one cent and sells at 70 cents you've got to be an insider in that so the guys who would have made money off dogecoin would have been the guys who were buying it before one cent and maybe they were heavy influences on media and whatnot and so they're the insiders and the insiders usually make money whether it's a legal insider activity or legal insider activity is a different story but basically this is why i mean when we look at the market that we're in we're in uh you know especially the guys who flip pcs and stuff like that you know the market so you guys know the market better than anyone if you're into flipping pcs me too i know enthusiast tech i know the market pretty well and so this is what i'm sticking to basically i stick to what i know and so i make good money i make good money out of it and it's it's one thing that i want to stick to but when it came to maybe buying stocks or buying shares in relation to these companies okay we perhaps see that amd sales might be slowing down because this maybe if we go back to some of these rise and rise in parts we can say okay maybe amd sales might be slowing down now maybe the future earnings might go down maybe with nvidia if a crypto crash happens on all these gpus go on the market their revenue will drop so because we're in the market we know this information now and we've got it with relatively say for instance we'll give it a month don't go crazy now but wait and if gpu sales start dropping off and there is a crypto crash then you can start putting down like something like get some put options on nvidia and that might be a smart call and then that's how you can sort of make the easy money because you're you're inside the industry you're not you're you're in the industry and you're seeing what's happening and you've got that knowledge before the broad market has it and so that's what you want to stick to if you want to make money in this world you can kind of stick to things that you know i mean if you've got a hunch on other things sure go for it but always stick to what you know and that's uh so yeah and and try not to be the biggest lesson you can learn from all this um there's a biggest thing you can learn about all this is is at the end of the day just don't be the loser so don't be the loser in it all so anyhow on some other news we'll get some we'll get some really good news out the way we'll i guess this news i am like i'm going to be a little bit uh skeptical about this next piece of news here i'm going to be as skeptical of this one because the the low hash rate mining so there's a 30 60 lhr that's come out and that's these apparently are baked in at a hardware level so this time around nvidia is like look we're going to make sure that no one can crack this tech it's got low hash rate mining implemented from the get go and there's the 3060 which has 21 mega hashes at 120 watts no one is going to really want to buy this for mining even at msrp so that's going to be a good thing if it sticks to the code that is if it's not any there's no workarounds and the guys who are buying these up in droves there's no workarounds this will actually be good but i'm going to wait to see first because i know this can work this 30 60 low hash rate stuff they already did it and we already saw it we've seen it once before 30 60s were on the shelves they were a little bit above msrp but you could buy one after a week like this the 3060 launched in a crypto environment and like it was there i mean i'm sure i'm sitting there for like a week as soon as the driver released they're all sold out prices went up again we've seen on ebay the last live stream that we did we saw on ebay that um the people were just the miners were clearly paying these high prices but then we got a 3080 ti and apparently that has also the same lhr implemented from the get go so basically the 3080ti is going to natively carry the block to get the maximum hash rate out of the ethereum and so it's mainly for it's mainly for ethereum and so that's what you're looking at now people have criticized we talked about that just before in the uh at the start of the live stream people were talking about okay there's going to be these alt coins and why isn't nvidia address this and they don't really need to it's all ethereum all this crypto mining is all based on one crypto and that's the theorem if you're not in s and you know if you might if you're mining other cryptos and there's really low volume then once f drops off you're probably going to be disappointed because yeah fireworks are going to unfold but the 38 ti 58 mega hashes at 200 watts this is basically making it half of that of a 30 90 i believe so they're basically leaked this hash rate score here it's actually funny because people like how's the 3080 ti going to perform well this should indicate that it's pretty much a 30 90. a 3080 ti will be very similar to a 3090 and it's just got half the hash rate so i think the 30 90 does around 115 megahash so that's on this theorem so 58 mega hash at 199 watts really places it out of the market for the crypto miners they're going to want to still get their hands on the 30 60 tis and the 30 70s and also even things like the 30 60 the ones that aren't uh low hash rate mining so there it is there and yeah like someone in the comments is like you could probably trade they'll probably trade a 30 60 tr i mean yeah if you've got a 30 60 ti you'll probably be able to trade it if the if a miner accidentally buys the 3080 ti he's like oh this isn't good you might be able to swap him for a 30 60 ti if you've got one so there are there are going to be some interesting things that come in the next months i'm sort of getting a little bit excited again because i can see the writing on the wall but that's just my opinion i can see the writing on the wall and um and that should hopefully be good so low hash rate mining hopefully it's here and hopefully nvidia enforces it properly this time around without any driver workarounds or anything like that so i was told i was told from rumors that this time around it is going to be a hardware based like this lhr stuff and also the 3080ti is going to be a hardware level lock that's what i've heard rumors floating around so there is an inside guy who's uh is that he's like he's associated with the league sites and i'm not going to say who it is but he's telling me it's um it's a hardware level so that'll be good so hopefully this fixes things so that'll fix things hopefully anyway that's the news that's the big one there but we'll quickly uh we quickly got a two sponsors for today's live stream as well don't forget to check out if you guys want an amazing microphone that'll just be plug and play and it's easy to use it's got a mute switch it's also got an anti-clipping feature then the wave 3 is going to be from you from el gato and then if you want to get yourself cop that cheap windows 10 pro single end user license then go uh click the link in the description below and use the code bftyc for a fat discount but let's go over now we're going to move over to q a so if you guys have them pressing questions then be sure to drop them down below and we'll be happy i'll be happy to i'm not we just single person here today uh i'll be happy to oblige and uh we got here from what is truth 101 what 4k monitor does 240 hertz and what gpu can hit that that's a no and a no there's no 4k monitor that i know that can do 240hz natively and what gpu could hit that well that would be an rtx probably like a 60 90. that'll probably do do it if that comes but um as it stands i mean as it stands i think you know 240 hertz for me personally after 240 hertz you really don't get you get to that stage where it's like you know for me 240 hertz the 360 hertz didn't do much and so i think the premium on 360hz over 240hz isn't really justified i mean if you guys have tried 360hz and 240hz do let us know what you think but 240hz from 120 is a big step up especially if you're a pro gamer so there we go thoughts on using an h510 board in a 10th gen cpu yes so we did a video on that and i used the asrock mini itx h510 the price was really good it works fine with 11400f i wouldn't go above that because it's a h510 right the vrm's not going to be that great you you chuck an 8 core i7 or an i9 in that thing it's probably not going to do you too well in terms of in terms of getting that full performance out of that chip so uh h510 though should be fine with eleven four hundred f uh just maybe yeah that'll be fine uh from what i was testing out it did it did a decent job especially when it came to gaming uh so are you interested in five uh 2640 v3s that's the xeons uh yeah i'm always interested in a xeon who wouldn't be especially if the price is right uh should i pair a ryzen 7 3700x with a 3060 ti uh yeah definitely a great combo um definitely a really good gpu to get and a really good cpu to get the ryzen 7 3700x is a really solid cpu and we've got here gtx 1063 gigabyte god uh god i mean is if god's a gtx 1063 gigabyte then damn man i must be like a gt210 or something wow okay so yeah you guys can compare yourselves to god with your gpu comparisons i'm a gt210 compared to a gtx 1063 gigabyte which is god um so won't miners move to other coins like ravencoin once one five five nine happens and yeah like there will be miners that will move to that that's the thing when you look at like the miners that will move across to other cryptos once uh ethereum or once theorem either moves to 2.0 or crypto goes belly up either too it's not going to be good for crypto mining because you've got such little liquidity compared to ethereum and so all that hash rate is going to go to these other cryptocurrencies and it's going to spell really low profitability and so i'm predicting that unless you have a massive massive surge in one of these altcoins that supports gpu mining then you're not really going to see profitability like you're seeing now with ethereum and that's like basically the reason ethereum is so profit and this is the thing when you look you've got a a lot of people just get into these cryptos and they don't do the research when you look at ethereum and you look at why it's so popular it's because it's got what's called a layer two system there's all these other cryptos that are built on the back of ethereum and people are trading things like nfts they're even using um exchanges uh sort of like they're making their own exchanges based on things like uni swap and a pancake or something like that so there's all this whole ecosystem built up on ethereum when you look at what other cryptocurrencies offer if they're just offering a single purpose uh kind of thing then they're not going to scale that well they're not going to do that well and of course the profitability isn't really going to be there so s sort of came out of the woodworks in the last year and and look i've i've said in the past ethereum's one of the few useful tokens out there there are a few useful cryptocurrencies but the majority of them are just straight trash and that's what i'm going to say and a lot of people if they're investing in all these different cryptos they're going to be in a few years time they're going to be scratching their heads and they're like man they'll have a big hangover and they're like why did i ever invest in that why couldn't i see the writing on the wall so that's that's my opinion i mean of course i could be wrong i don't know i'm only a gt210 so just uh don't worry when amd's fsr scaling tech comes will you bring out the four gigabyte rx 570 plus oh yeah so skilled rebuilds how you doing dude i'll bring out i'll bring out the big ones for you guys we'll be doing some rx 570 content that's where it's at an rx 574 gigabyte is where it's at right now and you can actually like locally i saw one here for 200 dollars so it's they're like you can get them for around i mean 150 us and lower so this the four gigabyte cards are really going to be that great card you can still get that'll still give you a 1080p experience that'll be pretty good so um can you please uh specifically test an rx 574 gigabyte uh sorry i'm reading the same question what what did what did youtube do with it it's like the chat went and bellied up on me uh so we've got ryan malik take a city do you think we'll see a 150 to 200 usd gpu launch in this year or are amd and nvidia going to prioritize higher profit margin gpus through this shortage i think you answered your own question there of course they're going to get the higher profit margins um again and this is the thing about nvidia they're a publicly traded company just like in just like amd just like intel and people like try to make it like that amd's you know amd's is saint compared to nvidia and nvidia and intel and they're not like they're all they're all beholden to the shareholders at the end of the day the shareholders want to maximize profit and uh do it uh while they can and especially if if money is flowing so easily and people are prepared to pay these higher prices for the higher profit margin gpus then they're just going to keep making those and they're going to strictly go towards that market but as opposed to once the market settles down and nvidia says okay well there's a market for say a 200 gpu and we can fill that gap then they'll release it then but in the meantime there's no point in releasing that because the margins are just getting and the thing and another thing is too on that is that the margins will be getting worse in that category basically if things like um i mean i'm sure there's going to be wage increases rising minimum wages and just everything commodities are going up gasoline prices go up everything in the pipeline makes it more expensive to get a 200 usd gpu to the end line so will there ever be a 200 usd gpu like you used to know it like a gtx 1060 ever again that's another question that we should be talking about because perhaps there won't be perhaps that'll be your entry level now based on i mean based on if they want to tell the truth about inflation so we could be in a really weird predicament going forward and we haven't seen i mean you've got the rx 570 the rx 580 still relevant graphics cards and uh yeah anyway we've got here from copek23 uh how would you try and fix an rx 580 that gives a code 43 so code 43 can be caused either by a faulty gpu which is not likely the case but if you've bought it off the used market most likely from a miner and that can be fixed with a v bios update and then that should make sure you get the exact same v bios and it's verified on tech powerup and then i've done it in a recent video where i was testing out the mining gpus uh and that was easy to fix so actually um we got here since someone asked me about what my skin care what uh so skin care if you guys want to know what i use for skin care um that's actually an interesting question uh if you guys want to know okay i'll tell you i've got two different types of oil i've been using for about uh 15 years now i've been using uh 15 years so i use a there's jojoba oil mixed in with vitamin e make sure you get natural jojoba oil i mean it's called hohaba i think there's a different name for i just call it jojoba because i'm um you know i'm a little bit you know when it comes to reading things whatever but i get jojobal mix it in with some vitamin e natural and i put that on after i have a shower every night and there's another one so i go on a two-phase routine right you got to take care of your skin man hey if you don't take care of your health and your skin then who else is going to take care of it for you and you're not going to have the guy walking down the sidewalk and he's going to come up to you and go hey bro i'm going to take care of your skin for you i mean in fact i don't even see anyone come up and say brian would you like a meal sometime or i'll cook for you or something like that i don't even get that so i mean if you don't take care of your skin then then who else is going to take care of it uh cosy asian asks how do you solve your eye bags so you just blast more light so you can just uh basically get your light projector and blast it so anyway jojoba vitamin e and then there's another one i use rose hip seed oil again mixed in with some vitamin e oil so i alternate between two alternate between the two and that'll keep yourself looking fresh you always want to look fresh you know what i mean you always want to look fresh especially if you're a young fella and you want to you know work your fella so you really want to start you know you got to take care of yourself and the sooner you do it the better you're going to have a better life so it's always i've been telling them on the channel here gotta take care of your health man go take care of your health so that's that one gonna be fresh yeah you guys that's something you've got to stay fresh make sure you do your cardiovascular do your workouts stay fresh stay healthy fellas anyway we've got zai han he has asked do you uh do you heard any news or have you heard any news regarding more factories opening in mainland china for more uh gpus i haven't heard too much i mean obviously they're going to um oh thanks for the two bucks quebec uh what about use we'll just finish off zion's question i haven't heard much about in the ways of what you publicly know already i think there's like fabs opening up in the u.s there's going to be more fabs from tsmc uh they're opening these up uh quite aggressively too because they just want to fulfill this um this demand they're like hey we're gonna make sure we fill this demand the problem is is the demand drops off and then they've got all these extra fabs that that can really spell um a bit of a sore sort of a sore sour feeling for these companies again especially when they're publicly traded companies and they've got to answer the shareholders so it's a bit of a messy situation in terms of more fabs but there are fabs in the works that are getting subsidized as well from governments so that one is in the works and of course when there's more sustained demand and i mean when we look at the trends if we look at the trend within tech that is more people have gotten into tech more people have gotten into tech over the last decade especially enthusiast tech especially gaming pcs but when we look at data center and things like that it's it's all just growing so much so they can see the trends and that is they just need to spit out more tech because there's so much more demand for it and it's not it's coming from all angles um especially when we look at um just everything you know telemetry especially is a huge one they want to know everything you do they want to know what time i'm the problem is when they analyze the telemetry on me they'll realize damn this guy like he's random he's spontaneous what makes you go spontaneous and that's for me that's chaos baby that's life that's living you know one time i wanted to jump in the car and just take a pair of clothes on with me spare pair of clothes and then just jump in the car and just go to a new town and just just see what it's all about but i've wanted to do that in terms of traveling and pc parts hunting and stuff as well but you know currently the uh covert situation ain't letting that happen but we've got kopechia with a two dollar donation so what about used uh price to performance that makes you what what is uh what is about used professionals that makes you uh have to am i just what is about use price to performance are you saying price performance makes me who i am yeah that's it man so any advice for a neet um yeah bro just start just start getting that uh getting them weights brother get a bit of sun in the morning get a bit of vitamin d and uh away you go you know and a bit of uh rose hip seed oil with some vitamin e mixed in you'll be all good to go we'll fix that problem man my skin care routine is eight hours a day of rgb and a spray bowl of mist water stay fresh stay up actually there's another one that i got another health tip as well if you guys uh have dry eyes especially in winter like in australia it's really dry plus coupled in with a dry winter if you've got really dry eyes get some collodial silver in the in the spray form and that's really good for your eyes uh i actually have to spray that daily in winter because my eyes get so dry we got here from r anderson five dollar donut cheers brian love the content thank you so much for the donation and uh we got here any uh is got um technically because i am worth it uh when do you think we will be able to buy gps at normal prices would appreciate the answer and overall thanks for giving us something to look forward to i said in the last live stream about a week ago i said give it a month so another three weeks we could even see gpu prices come relatively like you know it can happen quicker it can happen very quick it can all unfold very quickly so do be careful i mean i'm predicting yeah give it about a month and it should start to normalize especially if we've got these lhr thing i mean people are going to say okay scalpers scalpers scalpers scalpers right there's going to be a lot of people saying okay well the mining void miners aren't going to buy these new cards if they don't work for profitability then there's going to be the guys that say well the scalp is going to pick them up that's a dangerous game to play if you're a scalpel because suddenly you've got saturation in the market and you've got prices leveling out in certain areas and so if you're a scalper you're like well you knew at the start of the 3080 launch that you could scalp that but now if you're a scalper are you going to be out of scalp if you're buying these cards and there's not the demand there at 1500 for example for for a 30 70 or whatnot so if they come back on the market due to falling prices then if you're a scalper why would you buy them at and think that you can get them at height you know make money on it so that's that one i'm hoping that there's just of course there's going to be more supplies it's going to keep on coming in and the more supply comes in the more prices will go down so i'm predicting in the next month you'll start to see even a proper good glimpse of hope do you cook your own food yes i do but i do eat a lot of take out as well i'm not going to lie i try to eat healthy though like sushi and stuff like that so that's that one and we got here from yuja he asked i saw the ducktales episode on inflation how do people survive hyperinflation like in venezuela i don't know see this thing i can't tell you how to survive hyperinflation so if you guys looking for that ducktales episode i think it's called 1989 do remy that's the episode it's 1989. basically ducktales will tell you a lot more than the governments will currently tell you on inflation but if you know people have said people there's people from venezuela and they tell us constantly that inflation's just not good and it wrecks havoc so in terms of hyperinflation i would have no idea how to survive it because i've never been through it it's one of those things where you can really only listen to people with actual experience living through it because there's just going to be so many different things i couldn't imagine going through a hyperinflation scenario so if it happens it's like well what happens there and so it makes you happy yeah price performance makes me happy quebec and we got a five dollar donut from matthew lang what is your thoughts on amd switching from pga to lga yeah i did actually come across a quick article on that um i think switching over to lga is better technically because i think it is more efficient at a real microscopic level so i think lga is technically more efficient lga and a plus plus we're going to talk about the main we're really talking about the main um well the donations are coming in like crazy okay we'll go we'll do a quick donut around on the q a thanks for tuning in guys you guys are awesome but we'll quickly answer this question here and actually what do you thought so amd switching over to pga and lj let's talk about the biggest elephant in the room here and that is amd and intel can then just put the the buck on the motherboard manufacturers for bent pins i know for a fact that there are people out there that buy amd cpus they bend the pins and then they're like they go back to the shop because i actually know people work at the shops and they're like this is how it came in the box bro the pins were bent in the box it's like the retailer has such a hard time it's like no that's not how the cpu comes it doesn't come with bent pins and so why would amd want to have that deal with all that crap and they're like then they can put they can put pass the blame onto the motherboard manufacturer and then the motherboard manufacturer's got to deal with it now i've been to a lot of retailers and if you're buying an intel board they'll show you the pins and they'll get that on camera now and they're like yo you're happy with the pins is none of them bent and you're like yeah sure and that's i guess that's the only thing you can do now because i'm guessing they're doing it because there's just too many returns on bent pins so that's the that's the that's the real one that we've got to address there hudson jackson the second can't wait to see the rtx 4000 set rx 7000 series and can't wait to see you reach 500k thanks my man thanks for the 5 yeah we're going to reach 500k soon so if you haven't already hit that sub button and hit the like button for us uh so yeah we're going to keep the contents coming and there's going to be a lot more coming hopefully these gpu prices go down then there's going to be a lot more used price performance stuff coming very soon we've got another 4.99 from finding value here hi brian are there any g uh samsung g7 high res high refresh clones coming this year are they worth it are you talking about the yeah uh look man i'm i'm all about the oled so if you've got the extra money i'm all about the oleds and um and you did grab a seat bro yeah and i'm all about the oled so if you've got 120 hertz uh 4k and that's like that's the end game so in between that i'm more like a 144 hertz 120 hertz 1080p kind of guy and then just save up for the oled that would be my so when you talk about samsung g7 it's not really my sort of kettle of fish when it comes to those models even though they do serve a good purpose i'm all about now like that 1080p high refresh rate gaming or the oled you just pick the in between the inbetweener doesn't do a whole lot for me so hopefully that answers that question anyway do you think sneaker bots and scalpers will go away or will they stay forever now that they got their foot in the door that's a good question man like that's a good question from godot i just think the the scalpers and the sneaker bots they're always going to do what they do and they're going to do it because if people are prepared to pay the prices for it then they're always going to make the profit so they know though see the thing about that is is when you look at sneakers and when you look at limited edition stuff the manufacturers of that stuff are happy to make such a short run but highly profitable for themselves and so there's all this hype there's so much hype in the sneakers but when you've got a standard graphics card like just a 3080 or a 3080 ti or a 360 ti there's no real inherent value there's nothing unique about that you know someone else can always make another 3080ti especially if it's in production so there's that element there that i don't think matches the sneaker industry so i don't think i think they will go away basically to answer that question directly when it comes to gpus uh comedian five dollar donation thanks brother i can't wait for more of your tech magic i love goofy moves and puns yeah we'll get some we'll get some intros coming in we'll get some definitely get some hard intros for you guys we'll cop that you guys are loving them intros too when we go we've got here's the bar we'll go over that bar and we'll raise it a notch and so get ready for some crazy intros uh we got here we'll answer quickly go for some questions here even laptops brands are starting to raise their base price for about 10 to 20 now do you think it will come down later or is it just inflation day so look inflation's going up like there's a thing about inflation prices like they if things are going up 10 because of inflation they don't come down 10 percent that's what like the the thing is these governments are saying ah especially the fed like the fed in the u.s they're telling you transitory inflation i i've never heard this in my whole life was it temporary temporary inflation or trans when you're transit you're going from one stage to another so they're saying what there's going to be a heap of inflation then after that it's going to drop off well that's what it did in the 1980s we had a heap of influence 1970s heaps of inflation than the 1990s it dropped off so when they're talking about transitory are they talking about a uh long decade of of transitory inflation and then we're gonna uh just you know drop off again like the 90s what did they say they're so ambiguous these uh central banks and it's just it's really disturbing but basically if it is true inflation which i do think it is you're going to see a base price of 10 percent and that's good that's going to stay so basically but i mean when we relate that back to the gpu prices right that's what i was saying like 30 60 ti 550 600 us dollars maybe even 650 those prices will get back there because that's you know still 50 percent above msrp but we should be getting back there so inflation isn't that heavy yet so anyway uh surprised or not that intel hasn't killed 10 core lineups from performance perspective versus their 11th gen uh that was i was really surprised i mean i said that in the review of the 11900k i was really surprised that they went back two cause but they had to do it because they wanted to show people hey we've got this new fancy ipc and the ipc was like well it came at the cost of losing two cores so the 10900k was still a better buy i actually like the 10900k better than the 11 900k that was just that so yeah i was surprised that they did that um i mean they should have really i mean intel's problems have been their own it's been their own problems then they they didn't deal with them soon enough they should have really been you know a lot more forward thinking and it's came it's really come to bite them especially since ryzen has turned the tables on them so hyperinflation tips have a land learn to farm no bro all right bro uh yeah so you go i mean hey there's a lot of guys in the comments now you guys are starting to feel this stuff uh we got a donation here five dollars from sebastian lee five dollars i believe that the u.s fed uh decided to increase the interest rates by 10 to 15 the stock market gold silver everything is going to crash in prices depends i just don't think they have it in them to raise the raise interest rates at 10 i mean uh i think it might it might go to five percent interest rates could go to five percent in the next maybe a year and a bit but i don't think i think 10 to 15 that's extreme and yeah that would severely severely put all these people who are loaned up everyone is from everyone who's bought a house to everyone who's loaned up on different platforms that's going to really put them in a difficult position where things will go bust very quickly but of course there's people who now are materializing all that debt i mean if you take a look at even a simple thing like cryptocurrency if you've bought bitcoin at 10 grand and some dude's buying that crypto off margin and you're materializing that profit at 50k you i mean after you pay your taxes you're making a lot of money and then that that debt is materialized that person then has 50k so but when they say the world keeps spinning that's why the world keeps spinning because all that money is created and it goes into the economy someone's got it and just you want to be the guy having that you want to be the guy having that you want to go have the bag the good bag and leave someone with the proverbial capital s-h-i-t on their bag you don't want to be the one holding that bag so anyway hopefully that answers that question uh you're an idiot if you bend pins uh i mean if you're new to tech like you know you're new to tech bro you can't like if you're new to tech you can't um sometimes you're going to bend some pins you know like i've seen i've seen a lot of people bend because yeah there are a lot of yolo people out there that bend pins like and then they're like that if they if you bend your pins and then i think if you bend the pins and you put the blame on the shop yeah that's pretty bad i don't i'm gonna say that's pretty idiotic are most of those subscribers inactive you should be getting a lot more views yeah youtube's weird man like i've seen a lot of channels um basically youtube uh so ryan malek asked a good question about youtube subscribers and inactivity you're gonna see a lot of channels man like a lot of uh especially enthusiast tech channels where we cater to a small audience you're going to see that youtube it lives and breathes off the i think it's like the initial click of the thumbnail and the title and so even if you've got subscribers and even if they're active subscribers on youtube it's not going to show you that it's just going to literally like blank the video out and it's not even going to show on your videos that you're uploading and so what you know whatever i just you know keep doing what i do um and so if you know if there are other channels out there and they're doing it tough and they're got say their views are really low and versus their subscriber count you can only just keep going and uh make content that people are going to enjoy and sort of connect with your audience and whether if that means going more niche than so be it but you know i i've been reaching i've been talking to a few channels behind the scenes and they're really worried about you know like i want to do this for a career and stuff like that and like you know the uncertain nature of youtube itself makes it hard to do and yeah it does you know youtube doesn't get nothing but i guess that's life in general nothing's ever guaranteed so just live day by day man um but anyway i'll take you should i wait for next gen oleds for real due to brightness level increases um i'd like it depends man like i'd try and snag up a good deal on a c9 or a b9 um next gen oled they're probably going to charge a lot more for it so if you can get a good deal on b9 i think the brightness on oleds is perfect really good the brightness levels i just i'm happy with them i mean if you got too bright if you're if your levels of brightness is too low then you'll notice it because your eyes will start getting sore and i haven't had any sore eyes while using my oleds they've been absolutely phenomenal and so yeah 4k 120 hertz what gpu you want to get a 6800 xt or a 3080 for 4k 120 hertz that would be my recommendation of course picking up those two cards is very hard so at the moment but hopefully the 3080 ti will fix that uh what's a good upgrade for a gtx 1070 for 1440p 90 hertz good for two years i guess yeah probably man um that'd be good just keep it wait until the gpu prices wait until miners aren't mining then you'll get a good deal on gpus so anyway guys uh we gotta sorry there's a heap of questions here i'll try and round robin hey brian why xeons are getting expensive uh everything if everything's getting expensive then it's not just xeons if xeons are getting expensive then it's either a supply glot because um maybe that you know sooner or later there are used xeons they don't make them anymore sooner or later there's going to be a point where none of those xeons are for sale anymore but you'll move on to the next generation of xeons and then there'll be like a 6th gen xeon that's now cheap because it's flooding the market but if prices in general on everything's going up then that's just more of an inflation issue than than actually a supply issue so do you think low end cards will drop down in price now i mean i'm already seeing it like if you guys are seeing i'm already starting to pick up good deals on uh here and there and so prices of the non um say the the six gigabyte not sorry the four gigabyte and under cards they're already starting to get a bit cheap in my opinion especially from what they were when people were putting them on f test beds so they're signing it a bit cheaper is there a budget build coming up with one of those rx 570s you picked up dirt cheap yeah i can i can make a budget build too i really um really if okay so my crux is at the moment i'm trying to get a high end piece uh trying to get a high-end gpu and actually two of them because i want to do the cyber power pc that i just picked up and the parts on and i also want to do uh the i9 laptop cpu under 200 i won't really want to put a budget build with that together that'd be really cool so i was hoping to get that 2080 ti but the guy messaged me back and then i'm like dude i want like i was so hungry for that gpu i was just like as soon as you message me i said one of the quickest gum tree replies i've ever done i was like please but yeah here's my number man please message me please message me bro yeah come pick it up right now bro so he hasn't replied he hasn't sent me a text too so i think someone came in and swamped they swooped it up bro someone came in and just swooped up that 2080 ti now like brian wants to pay a k for it man i'm gonna pay 10.50 and i'll pick it up now and that's uh that's what public i see that's the that's the downside of making the parts hunts people see the deals that i've got up there and if i haven't picked them up already and they're still up for sale someone else will probably come in and swoop it up do you think low end cards will drop sorry we're ready to answer that one let's go through what accessories may i buy while waiting for a graphics card keyboard chairs case yeah if anything's cheap man again relative worth go and look at the completed listings on ebay go and know what a part's worth but yeah it's time to pick up all this other stuff right now if it's cheap and the price is good and then wait for the graphics card because it will come down sooner or later it's uh that's how the market works it always balances itself out when was the last time you met your uh wife and son bro uh that would be 2019 if you're talking about my ex-wife that was 2019 and then i came at the end of 2019 and then of course the whole situation came down i haven't seen him since so it's been it's been tough that's been a tough one so uh tech basics that's been a tough one uh will house prices come down and this is the thing like uh fred brown it depends on uh will house prices come down to find down see this is the new reality you might have to get used to in thinking will prices come down yeah but the actual nominal price might stay the same it's just wages will then catch up interest rates will go up wage wages will go up to catch up to those prices so they might not come down in nominal terms but the actual raw relative value of it might come down so just depends i mean and the funny thing is in the meantime people will be collecting rent on those places so it's all relative it's all relative but i don't think there's going to be a crash in housing i think a lot of people are starting to wake up to the fact that and there's another factor as well when we look at houses and real assets there's one other massive factor which a lot of people do not talk about and that's the emotional attachment to those real assets right in australia like say for instance i'm going to give you an example we'll we'll close this uh stream off there's so many questions but we'll close the stream off man you guys are awesome this time thanks so much for tuning in but we'll give you an example of why i like me personally i like real assets and why i like to invest in real assets over anything like a stock or a um or a uh a cryptocurrency i'll put this into perspective for you guys why i like to invest in real assets and that is because just imagine right if you've got you know if you're if you've got your girlfriend if you're gay if you get your boyfriend you lesbian whatever if you've got your partner and they're in they're living with you and they're inside your room right let's just convert that and let's say that your partner is a real asset if you've got a real asset in your room you're much less insecure you're not going to think about it much right but if your girl she's going out on the town every night and you're not she's not there you're suddenly i i know for me i mean i'll be insecure i'll be like what's going on here you know i'll be on the phone checking checking checking damn what's going on with this asset what's going on and then that's your emotion that emotional side that's there when you're buying crypto when you're buying stocks i don't i've only all i see is they're on a phone some those assets are somewhere somewhere else especially with crypto that's just in the form of zeros and ones on the interweb that's always on someone else's computer or it could be on your computer too but the bottom line is is that those things are out there on the internet especially stocks and they're not there with you so if they're not there with you you can get emotional and that can cost you a lot of money think with real assets if we've got a house especially if it's a house that you've invested in locally or you're into flipping cars or even flipping pcs you've got those assets with you that extra factor of not bringing in those insecurities and those emotions is another element that you can get rid of and it's going to help you so much which is why i like and i've never probably said this publicly it's why i love investing in real assets over anything in the form of stocks or anything like that because there's that extra factor added on and you're like brian man you should do a phd on this it's like yeah bro i should giving you guys some next level uh advice here on the live stream anyway uh we'll go uh we got i've got a mad don't know because i've got to read it before it goes off the stream here we've got mal hey mate thanks for the 15 donation brother 14.99 uh hey mate i got hosed on the on a 20 70 600 bucks code 43 i tried reflashing the bias and still the same what do you reckon it might be if i can't fix it did you want it oh man that's not good to hear dude uh problem with a code 43 on a 2070 is that you generally can't flash a mining bios on an nvidia rtx 2070 so yeah that's actually a faulty card and that's just sucks to hear in terms of um yeah that's that's that's a hose job man that's a 600 hosing now see on the amd cards it's usually miners flashed a different bios on it especially rx 570 or 580 uh 470. but yeah that one sounds like the hose job man i mean did i want it i mean there's not much i can do there too i mean i can try like i can try force flashing like a lower clocked bios or something but i think something's actually like physically faulty on that card man so you have to replace a chip on it and that's the sad but the good thing is it's not the actual g shouldn't be the gpu dial the vram itself it probably uh there's a chip on it that does the other stuff the scale or something perhaps um so yeah there'll be that there'll be that uh clip chip there so we've got alex uh gold mittens 50 uh 50 mexican dollars bro is that mexican dollars thanks brother for the donation there's no question attached um and we've got admins production real assets how do you know you are actually living in a real world you could be living in a simulation tech yes city well then my simulated emotions would still bring about simulated uh insecurities and simulated anxieties based on the fact that i can't see my simulated real assets in the same room or i know that they're there um and we've got at tech your city where do you buy physical silver uh there's two bullion dealers of choice abc bullion and also uh gold bullion australia brother there's they're my two um go hit them up so ah man i love you guys a lot you guys are awesome so ah man if no electricity how would digital assets be yes so if all the electricity got shut off tomorrow uh your wallets would be stored on your computers but it'd be a complete mess but i do believe there's all these like especially bitcoin there's people that have set up like these dungeons and they're like protected from emp and everything like that because they want to keep their bitcoins like forever so bitcoin's an interesting one so if you're in real assets how do you feel about gold or silver i love silver i love silver right now i love platinum and silver they're my two favorite precious metals i think they're really undervalued and i think they've got a lot of utility based on the fact that they're also a great store of wealth so i really love silver and platinum right now gold gold's at that level where you know it could go could go either way like gold's um especially relative to platinum and silver gold's i think a little bit overvalued again relative value so that's my opinion on silver and platinum so anyway that's about it guys we'll tune out we'll start tuning this one down because i've got to go help someone uh one of my friends um he's got to go we gotta go fix up his pc and uh get that done so good guy brian that's for me come on i'm helping i'm helping people out here help helping people out helping people out here we're going great and um yeah get some pcs ready so uh what camera are you recording with right now so we got the gh ah so it does the the camera looks that good man you gotta keep it look people are like commenting on the camera a lot so it's my gh5s and it's running off battery usually i've got my um g7 and the problem is is that the hdmi port there's something wrong with this so i couldn't even i've been i was trying all morning to get this thing to work and i just couldn't and i tried different just like i spent hours because this live stream was meant to be done a few hours ago so i couldn't get it done so my g7 that's going to be getting hot like this thing is going straight up on ebay i'll put up there like potentially faulty hdmi port but i'm sure someone just photographing or making youtube videos won't care it's mainly if you want to use the hdmi out for streaming uh we've got a torsten neurum oh man that name i you'd have to help me pronounce that one brother sorry i'm gonna butcher it hey uh is that norwegian kroner 200 knocks thanks for entertaining informative videos greetings from norway thank you brother for the donation if you've got any questions be sure to hit that one up too always i always love answering those questions sorry if i missed one like there's just questions getting flooded in if i missed them before i do apologize if there's there's any uh groundbreaking questions that you really need answered we'll we'll uh hit that one up and then we'll uh now i'm going to help this friend out i mean i can delay that my friend i could just be like hey just wait a little bit bro we'll fix your pc a little bit later we're fixing it for free so are you alrighty um miners aren't the villains uh you're right by me brian yeah look this is the thing so reiterate again with the miners and the in the crypto current like i'm anti like in ways i'm anti-gpu mining but it's based off the principle i like i don't blame miners for wanting to make money and if there's a if there's an opportunity there they're going to make money i don't hate them for that no in fact i did good on them go make that money brother i don't hate miners but i just think this is my argument asics is more efficient it's more efficient technology period and the arguments for asics and mining are much better than that of mining off a gpu especially a gaming one so it's one of those things where i'm against the actual principles in place for mining in that asic's a better technology for doing all that hashing so go use it don't use the gpus that are meant for gamers and that use that technology for gaming but you know that's how they have it that's the way the cards have fall fallen and so um that's the way the the way the things are churned out and now we're stuck with this mess and this message is that we've got a freaking global pandemic and people can't even get a gpu to play some games that's all it is so you know but i don't hate the mind again the miners are just doing what they naturally would do i mean look at me i flip a pc right if i find a cheap price on a gaming pc i'm going to go buy it and i'm going to go make value and then flip it the miners in their mind they're making value and that's all it is like everyone's you know everyone this whole world is built up on buying and selling but you know ask and that's the thing marcus fish raises the point asics aren't available to your average person they they will be if the the demands there you're going to see usb miners you're going to be small there will be small asset when bitcoin asic miners first came out there was like little usb sticks you could mine bitcoin on there was all these and of course they just got so much popularity behind it that um it just got so flooded i mean the same with gpu mining right now and people are buying up all the gpus with all the money it's the same scale it doesn't matter if asic or gpu mining you see the scale when there's profit to be made people just go buy it all up and go use it if it's profitable so if you've got the little asic miners that are real small ones that cost less than a gpu then they can be profitable and they can be available to the the broad public it's just that all that happening at the moment is the companies that are producing especially looking at ethereum miners they're only producing the ones they're going for the big ten thousand dollar ones because they couldn't be bothered making the little ones but you give enough um you make ethereum not anti-asic from the get-go and you would have seen so many different assets available for it that's all it was so um anyway and then asic manufacturers mine for months on them before selling i mean in newsflash some of those retailers are mining off those gpus before they're putting them in gaming pcs too and that goes on as well so the whole arguments again for asics it applies exactly to the gpu miner except there is of course the gamer who plays and then leaves his computer on overnight mining uh cryptocurrency that's uh but of course is that person then the balance is there the gpus are more costly to begin with so if you want to go buy that gpu and mine in your sleep you're now going to be paying over double msrp for it so um we've got designs by you just joined in he just hopped all right let's just get what's going on guys straight up man straight up my boys just joined chat before i was going to get on out of here oh how you doing corey designs by if i just needed to before i get on out of here you just want to like look just re re-blast it on live stream bryce what's going on guys what's going on what is going on guys just straight up energy dump that's it that's it my boy cory designs by rfr so anyway guys there's been a really good live stream uh hopefully you guys if you got any more questions but we'll save that for the next one we'll see what goes on in the next couple of weeks in terms of uh how gpu prices unfold and um yeah yeah you had to bring that energy it's all about bringing that energy like brian you got to get back up get that energy out again man just just a quick kick start uh you know the funny thing is it's just like a stimulus and government stimulus it works good the first time but then after you do it a few times it just wears off so hopefully if you keep doing what's going on guys it'll be like what's going on what's going on guys what's going on guys no then the stream will be finished anyway we've got we've got another donation coming thanks so much for that we got 4.99 thanks for everything you do how's linus's grandpa your
