in 2020 ddr3 memory is now officially
more expensive than ddr4 memory and you're probably sitting here scratching
your head like how and why is this possible well in
today's video i'm going to go through all the factors at play here but of
course there's the biggest one at play and that is used price performance or
older stuff is still in such high demand and i'm not
saying this because i'm a big advocate of used price
performance here on the channel with tech yes city
i'm saying this because this is just how it is when you go get
a used build and use second third fourth gen oem
most of the times that's gonna have maybe two four
eight gigabytes maximum of ddr3 memory in it and most people
wanting a gaming pc want 16 gigabytes of ram so there's already pent up demand
for extra ddr3 memory especially new then there's also on top
of that another thing you can do with used
builds that you can't do with a new build that is you've got a windows 7
oem sticker on it you can grab that slap it in a case
and you don't even have to buy any windows 10 license at all
so there's things that use price performance can do
that you can't and of course that's coming in
especially on the entry level where you can get a mid-range graphics card
and yeah and i've covered this heaps of times here at the channel in the past
you're not going to be losing a whole lot of performance then of course
there's motherboard manufacturers especially on
aliexpress these guys are making new motherboards
for these older platforms with a lot of these older xeons that are
coming out of servers they're taking the xeons out but since
the motherboards aren't being manufactured anymore
and of course used motherboards are clonking out on people with builds the
cpus are still fine there's this pent-up demand for new
motherboards that support ddr3 so basically demand for the ddr3 memory
is there in 2020 i just didn't realize that there
was so much demand for it that it would send
the prices of the memory more than
ddr4 so what we've got here is for example an australian retailer so we're
going to pop this up we've got here a 8 gigabyte stick of
ddr3 memory going for 49 aussie dollars now
we look at the speeds of 1600 megahertz and this is the cheapest i can find in a
straight here then we've got a ddr4 stick of memory
2666 going for 45 aussie dollars so this is true
i'm seeing this in the retailers not just the
spot exchange prices so we'll look at that now there's two different spot
exchanges and they're reporting the same data here and so what we can see is this
top one we've got to pay attention to this because basically ddr4
you can put a single side and have an eight gigabyte stick
and that's going for an average of two dollars and 62 cents right for those
little chips then we've got here right you can
compare these if you want to compare apples to apples sure you can do that
but most people just want to get the cheapest stick possible right if we're
talking about getting the cheapest stick possible and
putting in a dual channel this is what a lot of people can do and
of course you can overclock this stuff just like you can overclock this stuff
right here but this right here is going for a
dollar forty six for four gigabytes and so of course you double that and you
get two dollars and 92 cents so it is right it is going for 30 cents
more to get an 8 gigabyte stick together than it is for an 8 gigabyte stick of
ddr3 memory so there's your problem right there
and it exists the prices are officially more expensive
but there's also some other factors at play of course we've got the pent-up
demand there which is causing the prices to go but
another reason being is that we've had the factories that make ddr3
a lot of those switched over to ddr4 and so the the actual production of ddr3
memory as a whole compared to what it was say
five years ago is down in general and it's not like
they can go back and make another ddr3 ram factory because
i guess they perceive that as being an unreliable option it's not consistent
they don't know when ddr3 memory might become out of fashion and if you've
invested all this money in a factory then you
could really come into some financial pain so
the factory in the production line isn't there to begin with two
and then there's the next reason right here and that goes hand in hand with why
the factories wouldn't be willing to invest and make a
whole new ddr3 production line and that is this stuff's been out for 13
years it's been released since 2007. so
that's i guess in a nutshell what's going on with ddr3 memory
but me personally i look for this stuff used i
sometimes buy it new in uh batch quantities and the suppliers are telling
me when they give me the quote list for the prices of ddr3 this is why i'm
making this video i saw the quote list and i'm like
i'm scratching my head and just like you guys are scratching your head i'm like
what this is the first time i've seen ddr3 now more expensive than baseline
ddr4 memory and i asked them i'm like is did you
guys make a mistake and then they said no that's just how it
is and so i'm like whoa like what is going on here and so i
guess especially with uh what's going on
around the world at the moment a lot more people are staying home
there's a lot more demand for gaming pcs and because say for instance you've got
such a weird thing going on where cases and power supplies will be out of
stock so a lot of people will turn to the used market
for gaming pcs and so all the guys like me
who put together pcs are now suddenly on overdrive
putting together more gaming pcs and like damn run out of ddr3 memory and
that's exactly what is happening to me i'm
running out of ddr3 memory i mean i did come into a recent stash from two
sources i got a guy locally here ed he sold me a
heap of um ddr3 memory and then i also cleaned out
darth jar jar for 48 gigabytes of the stuff
and so that's that's a when you're in a clutch situation
you've got to make some uh sacrifices and perform and so that's what i'm doing
personally with ddr3 memory but another thing as well
this is another thing to think of if you're building yourself a personal rig
i'll show you guys an option that you may wish to consider
and that is ddr3 ecc registered now this is not going to work on standard
i7s for instance an i7 4770 is not going to be able to support this stuff
but you can just see the sheer price right 60 bucks
aussie if you buy four of these kits so if you're doing builds
you can buy four you can get 128 gigabytes of this stuff
for 200 aussie dollars which would be i'd say close to around 140 us
that's a heap of memory that's like about
25 percent of the price of our ddr3 memory
on the market at the moment that's what you can get it for so ddr3 registered
is definitely an option if you uh like to delve in the
land of xeons like i do so you can get a second gen xeon
with an x79 aliexpress board some of them are pretty decent by the way
and then you get 16 gigabytes of this stuff and you'll have a 16 year by
gaming pc for a lot cheaper than going with the i7
standard consumer route and so especially the value on some of
those xeons you get like an eight core 16 thread second gen that'll still play
games absolutely fine with an rx470 and stuff like that
you can still get that stuff really cheap and i've made videos on this in
the past with uh cheap xeons but this is a real
benefit when you look at the price of this stuff
ecc registered memory this is a real benefit to
use price performance at the moment this one's a little bit of a goldmine
but getting back to the topic of why ecc registered
ddr3 memory is very cheap that's because it's being pulled off
servers at the moment in mass and they're pulling the xeons out of
those things but at the same time there's not that much demand for it
because everyone wants the i5 and the i7 which doesn't support that stuff
then on top of that you've got really in the server industry there's only demand
for ddr4 ecc registered that's why you'll see the prices of that
generally comes in more expensive than ddr4 unbuffered
so you've got the reverse situation going on in ddr3
as to what's going on in the ddr4 world so if you guys are into building gaming
pcs you just may wish to consider getting some ddr3
registered stuff and going with a xeon that's just an option it's something i'm
going to be looking into seriously myself
being strained for memory right now but as it stands hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video hopefully it was a lot of insight and
let us know in the comment section below what you think of ddr3 ram pricing have
you done many builds yourself with ddr3 do you do more ddr4 builds i mean the
way prices are going this is definitely going to be pushing
people in the direction of you new builds i've thought about i'm like
what's the point of building an older system
when you've got like say for instance a ryzen 3 3 100
you can get an a320 motherboard and ddr3 memory and then overclock it a little
bit or just clock it to 20s you know some of
those boards are actually really good i shouldn't say overclock it because you
can't really overclock on a lot of a320s but some of those boards are really good
where they've got profiles in them where you can just lock in
these memory profiles and they work really well you can get 3 000 megahertz
out of even just the cheap stuff but do let us know in the comment section below
what you're doing at the moment and what build you've got going on
because i love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this
question of the day here which comes from vex u666 and they asked
did you try the same motherboard with another cpu
could also be the pcie slot so this question i answered in the first minute
of the video and yes i did try multiple different
motherboards that wasn't the problem but if you've got a question like and you
want an answer please at least watch the video or at
least the first minute of it anyway guys i'll catch you in another
tech video very soon if you enjoyed today's video

enough and you stayed this far and you want to see it the moment it
drops that sub button it's down there you just have to click

videos drop around tech yeah city and i'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye [Music] oh
