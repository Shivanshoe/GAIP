I think we go on life but the problem is you're going to I think we're live now but I've got to pull you back up I think people popping in here think it's gonna go live in 18 hours like why the heck did Brian put this up there - you knew - for 18 hours your head yep so just tell me if we're alive because I'm alive straight yeah I can't Welsh it says I'm live it says I'm live nope yep pop out chat I'll just grab that and we should be good like what is good everybody out there what is going on we are now officially live and I gotta close my email okay we have a live stream now I am joined by mr. Salazar how are you doing mr. great show is on I am doing mighty fine this Saturday night slash Sunday morning for those of you on the Aussie side of the world yeah I kept him up all it's pretty rude I was like Greg we're gonna start streaming in half an hour and then my program took another proverbial dump and I was like yeah it tends to it tends to do that a lot yeah so what is good everyone I it's just been a crazy month here before we even get into it right it's been a crazy month where last month was so like nothing was going on really and so I'm out there getting potatoes you know me I'm left for hunt sent a potato here at potato their potato everywhere now this month is just like everything's coming out like there's these SSDs are gonna check out there's AMD stuff there's Intel stuff coming up later and you have any z4 90 boards I've got already mmm I have three you know I got seven dude seven like and what do you do with them any boy whoa I don't know that's what I'm trying to think because they wanted overviews I said I don't do overviews and unboxings I don't believe in that like I don't play yeah anybody can make unboxing videos well that's not mean why would I why would I make something that I watch myself right so that's the thing it's all about treating your viewers how you treat yourself that's so I'm like no I'm not doing any overviews or unboxing so they're like some of the guys like oh man it's like read the spec sheet it has this and like they can do that themselves like like are you bringing anything new to the table guys it's got a heatsink on it it's got audio yeah how does the Envoy sound now is the cooling perform we can't do that and this is the thing this is the first time in history I've got seven motherboards and not one CPU to test with anyway I'm like okay they kind of have a it's like here's the review guys just put in a Core 2 Duo into this thing and we can get it running you know the motherboard vendors actually I didn't used to have to rely on a and B or Intel to source CPUs back a few years ago used to be the motherboard vendors with Senji at least engineering samples so you could you know get your initial testing going but they don't send those anymore they only send me you know that they'll wait to send the media saying is if they have there's a reason behind that like they like they do it's still low-key but they don't like doing this if they get caught Intel and AMD get angry as its doing it because there is a few channels in the past that have just been like hey day one reviews and then they're not been on the seeding list and the company they aim didn't tell you what's going on now did they good and to engineering samples aren't admittedly the best CPUs to have represent that product line so it's gonna make the company or that particular SKU look worse if you're saying well I could only get 4.2 this is a really voltage stubborn chip you know I don't recommend you buy it when in reality the media samples are the consumer samples are actually fine you know the engineering samples are just there so that the motherboard vendors can get their BIOS is sorted out and all that good stuff you know they're not doing hardcore overclocking with any of those yeah exactly right so I'm just yeah I mean that's that's sort of what's been going on now and yes I'm not looking forward to that actually sir I'll think about just when it releases I'll do the until like review and then I'll do probably just like a motherboard round-robin where we just go crazy on these motherboard reviews like every three hours we're dropping a z4 90 motherboard review yeah I'll try and bring the humor I'll try and bring just some I'll just mix it all up I figure I'll just do something with it there's something really weird but other than that it's been the use market is still nuts it's absolutely nuts and I think the one thing that I'm gonna talk about in a video upcoming video as well there is one thing that used has going for it right now over any retailer and that's what I've noticed it's just people will just want to go pick up a PC then and now they just want to go out you'd hang get the PC yep hook it up start playing games and that's what the that's what the market offers with use pcs PCs are ready to go and so people just like oh I gotta go get it and that's something that's crazy right now and they use market it's really it really is poppin off and that's just one of the reasons why I could be more expensive - yeah nothing it's just the instantaneous factor of what's going on right there's just people want want it then and they're an instant so yeah what's good is chat going good chats chat saw yes soon I was gonna say man I remember I remember when I was in college four or five years ago I had I had a client one of the PC bill and I was like don't worry I have something for you this weekend well my case that I ordered ended up getting delayed by a few days yeah and I ended up scouring Craigslist trying to find any case I could do and I needed a pain 50 60 bucks over MSRP for a used case oh because it was one of the only ones listed you know and looking back on I was kind of pissed at the time I was like how this is the only thing I can buy but because the seller was kind of smart because he knew it was the only one in the area selling a case and anyone looking for a used case is probably gonna need one you know a saps the only reason whether considering the use market so yeah there's that instant demand that instant you know satisfaction with buying uses oh let's be honest you were angry then because this seller got inside your head and he checkmated you check raises your eye my head of the situation and that's that's the power that you have in a market that has no competition yeah you know it's it's and it's not like it's always that way you know at some points there could be ten cases for sale and that's a good time to buy but that's the whole thing is like timing the market and my mistake was relying on a shipping company that I shouldn't have relied on to get a product in that ultimately ended up just sitting in mine I mean you know the weird thing is - right I've had um there was this one guy on on marketplace that got so salty at me hey for selling my pcs I think it was just mad in general you know you get the nice shot you do the nice description it all checks out and he's like this and that and this and that and he's saying my PC was a ripoff and I'm like I said to him straight away my reply was prove it show me in this time where you can get a better PC build so he'd never just he just kept deflecting I'm like we'll prove it it showed me a build list that your price performance is beating mine then show me that list and then we can come back and talk again and so he just kept going on and on I was just like dude just block if they've got legit points but a challenge on a certain point or an idea or something that's fine I'm open to it I could learn something you could learn something you know whoa but I well this is this is the thing right this is the thing a gtx 1066 gigabyte it was around 200 Aussie dollars before now they go on for $300 dollars bang like you've put a gtx 1066 gigabyte up to 300 bucks someone's going to just simply sweep on in and take it and yeah that's that yesterday I mean that's why I made that video about the GTX 210 70s here about how they used to be yeah 200 bucks under 200 bucks now they're 250 260 that's for a lower end model you know you want a Strix card you're paying 300 that's us you know 400 450 Aussie that's that's insane you know you could get a new car that performs as good and it's more efficient for less than that so what's you know what's gone yeah so the thing was with that was that that's gonna flow through then to the resale prices so that is the biggest thing right and so yeah like my pieces everyone's PCs everyone someone a gaming PC right now at least where I live they're overpriced if you would have compared them six months ago or three months ago to prices yeah and so I had to explain that to the dude he was like okay but you don't need just Estep you just kept getting angry you know some people just don't like to listen you know when when you try and have a civil like conversation they just like no no no I'm the best I'm the best you're what you're the meal the worst and it's like man come on no one's better than no one really but let's get on to this topic be 550 AMD they went hey guys this is what's up this is what is up be 550 and then they said they're not going to support like the B 450 X 470 and all their other chips 8320 be 350 x37 they're not gonna support the news and CPUs like they're not this upcoming Zen processes they're not supporting him isn't that what they said though about this into as well I mean I mean I I don't like that's what a 320 right a320 was officially not meant to work with the risin 3,000 I'm pretty sure off the top of my head ya know it even be 350 was gonna be even be 350 was gonna be really spotty and they said that would be up to motherboard vendors okay a 320 the same way I mean a 320 it's just they're gonna have such a stripped-down power delivery setup there that it wouldn't be advisable anyway hey 320 320 is my jam dude I'm probably one of the other tech reviewers out there where it's like a 320 is my jam dude and this is the reason right this is the reason I told people don't go with this upgrade argument stop it just go with what's good for now for the best money save that money because the future is uncertain and like look AMD have gone back basically what what I think what people are really angry about when it all boils down to it right this is what people are angry about is the fact that AMD is saying that no we're not gonna have future support for rising 4000 on these chips aughts chipsets even though we know it technically can work that's the problem yeah they know that if you have the microcode update and you had the right by us Abbie 450 is gonna support the new rise in 4,000 ships I think that's what people are angry about at the expense of past support I mean I watched a Paul Paul Paul Hardware had a really good video up about what be 515 can do and can't do and why they can't just continuously add micro code updates for support for newer processors because if you do that right you have a fixed amount of space on a little BIOS chip little BIOS ROM but if--and run out of space you have to nerf older support and then that can confuse potential buyers saying okay well does this board actually support the old processors now that you've got a new what microcode of it that supports the new chips or doesn't it you know then you have to change your product pages you have to change your product boxes it's it's kind of a nightmare to be honest it's not really not if you slice the updates like on a gigabyte like if you slice the updates they're already doing that on some boards they already slice the updates where you'll lose the sort will you lose support after you update to this blast you'll lose support right and that's the thing like the consumer knows that after it's already purchased but if you're gonna sell a be 450 board that has then three support now that didn't use to have it so you're gonna change the box to say hey now it supports then three oh but because now we're supporting Center sorry Zen - we're gonna nerf Raven Ridge support or a Bristol Ridge support right yeah too bad yeah too bad yeah but what I'm saying is that will affect people who would otherwise be buying it for the Bristol rich chip you can't please both audiences like you can give them the basics and then say hey there's this optional op BIOS update that will give you support for Zen tours and whatever 4,000 but we're not gonna officially support it out of the box for the sake of everyone else on the older chips right yeah but I mean you think the thing with that is I think even on reddit all's reading up on some some deep dives and apparently the the sixteen megabytes will still support it and then some like there's actually not really room running out on a lot of these bars chipsets I I have updated some BIOS as though and lost support for like it will explicitly say like if you update this BIOS you will lose support for it usually doesn't matter you know but I think they're running I mean it's clear that they have to make space they have to get rid of some stuff but I it's just not as cut and dry I think as we would like it to be because there are so many different lineups from AMD that they're trying to cram into this socket which i think is a good thing but a byproduct of that is product confusion on the motherboard side especially for the motherboard vendors because then you have to kind of you have to be strategic about how you advertise certain boards for certain audiences right well our beef okay you're just going to be pairing than 4-thousand with them you know okay so so basically then it comes down to another question then I'll throw the curve all right we're getting straight into it is coming at you so you're telling me then that they didn't have the foresight to say that hey we'd have four series of motherboards and they're not going to fit on it on this chip so that's when they gross made Rison they they gave the foresight they were the ones saying it's going to come out in 2000 it's gonna be supported until 2020 it's gonna be supported for so many generations and then they took a stab at Intel saying until you know you have to upgrade all the time and I mean look they've been better they've been a lot better than Intel don't get me wrong but at the same time it still comes down to them not having the foresight to say okay this is going to be a potential problem how do we get around it when they first design their motherboards so either way the BOK falls on AMD and yeah I think I actually I think the something went wrong with or maybe there was some tech like technical limitation with the size of the ROM itself like there I'm sure they've thought of this I mean they pay people millions of dollars in bulk to think about all of these things especially when you make such a claim like that how do you not I mean it's it's gotta be some kind of technical limitation I haven't done an IE rating you ready for the next one okay so here's this thing right you've got these motherboards coming out now I know for a fact motherboard manufacturers were having big problems backdating compatibility so I would say in ways motherboard manufacturers want this - it's not just AMD and a little bit of Defense because it encourages new sales right but it's not just a course it's all the coding involved - that's why I'd like why do you think we're getting sent semi z4 90 mother boards the board partners love Intel they don't have to cook I just have to release one set of code for one set of CPU lines done and dusted compatibility is easy the bios team gets to go home early they get to cut wages radda radda radda so that is a big argument right you know you've suddenly you got an a320 board that can support a rise in 4,000 you've had to go through four lines of code now and that's a lot of BIOS programming like let's be honest as opposed to hey Intel you just got one set one line one line a motherboard one set of code so you can see how it's all destroyed in the end of the day I've been saying this for years on my channel it's all about a dollar at the end of the day I'm gonna ask you a question have you ever met like you've met some people in your life that you don't like right let's be honest okay have you ever met a dollar that you didn't like what do you think every company wants to make a dollar let's not forget that AMD's no exceptions and when you buy these products don't give them over you're like don't you man blind loyalty blind loyalty sure you give them loyalty they've been good if they've been performing over the years very good like when it comes to Adobe Premiere Pro and NVIDIA there is a bit of loyalty there from me they've been working for years on end and they haven't missed a beat they've been pretty good I've been happy with it so I haven't bothered changing name down my main editing rig because what's the point what's the reason I'm happy with the with the workflow and there you go go hit me hit me Oh swinging that curveball so I think it's interesting and important to know that AMD is probably this is probably the first time when it when any either I should say CPU manufacturer has pledged this long a platform support for such a wide range of SKUs right yeah I mean when's the last time you can think of one motherboard supporting three different generations of CPUs I can't there might be one that comes close but off the top of my head I can't think of any so each one can with an AK each one 10 but but can you really blame AMD for for going as far as they did I mean I know we're kind of spoiled now by it but at the end of the day the fact that we were able to still milk three generations out of a single socket let alone chipset but you could put Zen 2 on B 350 and have no problems like to me that's good enough the fact that they're saying okay we've we've milked this as much as we could at this point you buy Z you know 4000 series and you just you know but here's the thing this is the thing right my my my track record says that I don't care and I don't that's why I've been telling people to go buy an a320 in the risin v 3600 call it a day who cares about your upgrade path that's - those are really powerful chips what 65 watt TDP chips like you could run those on a 320 no problem like that that's you know a 65 watts is nothing I mean compared to what there's some older chips that were really overclocking happy you know even like you can go back as far as the sheera you could overclock a 95 90 it'll consume over 200 watts of power like that thing is a power hog for a consumer great ship but now we have such power efficient chips that are as strong if not stronger than those you know just entire packages it's just yeah the viability of cheaper chipsets is becoming oh boy this is the thing another reason I recommend a 320 have a guess you're handing over the littlest amount of money day md as possible same with each age 410 those chipset licenses are cheaper than be forced easy 390 I said that oh you guys I haven't in the comment section have an influence on me I should have said z4 naughty what do you reckon is dead 493 490 but the bottom line is right we do we do official I don't know why I say Z is some man my brains all messed up maybe so anyway we got back to the blind loyalty right don't be blind insane for years stop giving companies blind loyalty now right let's just go back to another question for you what do you think my next graphics cards gonna be in my main editing rig 3080 yeah it'll be an nvidia card but that being said if nvidia screw up in my computer starts crashing in Premiere Pro it starts doing all sorts of funny buggers and then I'm out there reading about or I'm testing the new AMD cards in Premiere Pro and they're working fine guess what I'm gonna do yeah yeah I'm gonna switch it over I do not care I do not care I gotta get my work done I gotta get my work done as consistently and as best as possible so that's why I said with these they're all like look go we'll go back down the same road as well we'll go back down the same rabbit hole we've got SSgA we've got that State Street Global Asset Management fund we've got Vanguard we've got the other guy out there all these index funds they're all the same company owned in the same chunks of Intel AMD and even Nvidia in other words you've got the same board members telling these three companies what to do so I mean it's just like you go on these people were angry people it's like you're all just been played for sheep like this this is what it is you're just been played for sheep and herding around when it's all just like casual decisions at these places that are like yeah we got to make money bank and they and you know the employee the poor employees can't say anything though just yeah this is like that's like you know doing a certain I'll get DUIs yeah exactly as I no one can talk out about it deep internally so I can put a company can't make a company can't survive selling one product and then not selling it again for years you know like they have to keep selling more and more of a product and you have to innovate being innovative is one of the things that drives right sales because you have something that's bigger and better so oh I got to have that now motherboard is a little different though because there are plenty of people who are still rocking 350 boards and there anzen two chips and they're like I haven't seen a need to upgrade because motherboards are kind of in the background they gonna you expect them to work they they do the things that they say they can do on paper and that's good you know but that's all I care about well I feel really sorry I feel really sorry for the guys that spent out I spent the real high-end money on like the X 370 X 470 boards they bought those with the intention of them lasting as long as they in Falls used till the end of ddr4 they bought that with the intention to be like yeah I can upgrade my 1800 x2 for 900 X and they come to that effect I have no doubt III would be seriously surprised if there aren't released at least unofficial bios's that support sent 4000 I I would be sure I mean that's the same thing I mean and I covered this at Computex because I was I was drilling them hard in our meeting with AMD about sockets are about chipset support because that was what we were promised in 2018 and they kept reiterating the fact that they're not officially supporting B through 50 percent to well but what happened right maybe almost every motherboard vendor rolled out and published bios's to support Zen to and I really think we're gonna see similar things coming from at least a few of the vendors you know as rock always just something kind of on the DL though they'll push one out here there and maybe Asus or MSI to like I I have no doubt at least one or two of them will do it Arjun L will someone will do it first for the advertising and then the other guy we bet again we better jump on that man it'll be I mean I better see like the be 450 tomahawk for example that would that you'd expect that to get the Basques who's so many of those boards were sold right so you'd expect to get that steel legend as well to be 450 still legend that was a really that's a that's a top-selling board - there's some good beef for 50s out there that should get this support I mean sure it right so at the end of the day it's like I think it comes back down to Mike I mean I know people are angry out there but it's like for me it's as expected like I didn't I'm not surprised like are you surprised no I like I said I've we've been dealing with way worse for the past gate and the fact that we were able to milk three generations out of a socket at this point just good enough for me no here's the thing I did my I did my 10th gen announcement video I was getting cold and Intel fanboy in that I know I'm like I'm excited for the the i3 and the i-5 because I feel like it comes at a price yeah let's see what age 410 motherboards come out let's see what age 410 motherboards come out let's see what some magic we can pull with that is intense let obviously let's go to the gaming benchmarks you know you know what the fanboys are gonna say right you know I can already tell the Ambu fanboys are gonna say oh but you can't overclock a core i3 10100 and you gotta buy you gotta buy a z2 or 70 month or z4 night because you know they're not gonna release the h-series motherboards at the same time they release the Z ones and that's not just not gonna I hope they do I hope they come out soon sizable h4 take on the dealer now here's the thing right I think this will go up to 4.1 or 4 cores 8 threads at 4.1 gigahertz all cause it should be good like it's going to be no it should be fine you know yeah I don't think the and it's got it won't compete with the with the with the I don't know 3300 X was impressive I liked it I did I'd like to get is the first time I've liked an X CPU over the non X CPU to be fair like the first time like I said yeah we got a 3600 X versus the 3600 I'd like 30 that was totally different like yeah why would you buy the X I didn't see as big I saw other people found bigger differences than I did I think it was just the hardware configurations I didn't see a big difference between granted i I couldn't overclock that the and the board I was using I think it was just it just I don't know it just wasn't letting me overclocked past 4.2 but I couldn't even even clock for clock somewhere saying it because of 3,300 actions using a single CC X versus the split split CCD is like that that would help performance as well I didn't see that granted if I was throwing a 20 DTI 1200 Allah graphics card another mix I'm sure we'd see some difference because at that point you're squeezing the CPUs for all they can push out you know I mean yeah I mean the other day just gotta go in there and quickly decide one thing I didn't show my videos there just disable all the limits and stuff and just up both all the max yes and then you got no restrictions but mine hit a brick wall after 5:00 on both the chips - now the chances of that happening I would say a 10% right if I get two chips in at any time it'd be around about 10 percent of them hitting the same frequency it's just like it's just like I thought about I was like it's probably like the two pairs of socks argument right if you pull out one sock out of the drawer drawer what's the chances of getting the same pair yeah it's a simple it's very simple when you think about it's very simple in nature the question is variable it's one thing let me get a so you've got two pairs of socks in the drawer right you just blindly pull out one sock what's the chances of pulling out the pair pulling out one sock you can't you know you initially pull out one sock what's the chance okay pulling out another sock and getting a pair getting the same matching pair so it's two different pairs one in so simple right when you think about it simple right it's the same thing I got this one CPU it's five point seven five seven five gigahertz and then you're gonna have that range right it's probably one in eight actually because it's gonna be from four point five to four point seven or what at four point four 24.6 so it falls in that range of I'd say around ten percent of being same and it was all surprise Wow okay they both just would not like the 30 100 almost made it through a four point six almost it was the closest the 30 300x didn't hit me if aim D and I'm not sure to what extent or do I saw though I'm sure it happens with most companies if AMD is more or less cherry picking which samples go to reviewers and then the rest of them go to the regular you know whatever if we're getting cherry pick samples even if there's slight cherry picks do you think AMD would want the 3100 to 3100 to look noticeably worse than the 3,300 X or would they just be like you know little both they've already done that with the out of the box settings so like what right right but if both can clock about the same your I'd use this margin I honestly think they've kind of given up on that cherry-picking except when the 3900 and the thing is they are cherry pie 3939 50x they actually are cherry pick in reto yes technically they are I mean even the ones were sent we didn't get retail boxes with ours oh man I didn't get a little plastic bins so I know they're picking them you know they're they're picking them but I don't know how they're picking them if they're saying hey well this channels bigger so let's send them the even better chip they're gonna get more viewership yeah who knows it's like at the end of the day they can do whatever the heck they want but yeah it's you know just I just wonder what really is going on behind the scenes yeah I'd like to know too I mean I don't like I I don't think they cared too much with this this launch as opposed to say 3,900 x 39 50x or whatever they would have cared a lot more then this is just a budget fork or they know it's gonna get good like good reviews because it's a good price point overclocking really at this point like I've said in Mike in yesterday's video I said overclocking is kind of pointless at this level because the included coolers good value with a cheap motherboard that's where you're really maximizing value it's only really for the guy who can go out get a cheap X 370 update the BIOS and then get he's already got a water cooler lying around the signing and so yeah you know and even then you need expensive memories like I'm testing with thirty six hundred megahertz memory right it's not like the cheapest off around around so I will say the 31 the 3100 was surprisingly cool like temperature wise how does the boss in my three point not yeah it was like it was barely even overclocked to four point two all core which wasn't again as high as some of the others were getting but even at four point two all core which was still over spec it was only pushing 60 C after maybe 10-15 minutes in prime95 like that's and that's with a hyper 212 like that this isn't a beefy knock you in HD 15 like there's a $30.00 air cooler so so buddy I was gonna do a video I was thinking as soon as that as soon as I saw the power consumption on 3100 out of box it was impressive but I'm thinking about down clocking and on Diwali because the 3300 X is more power efficient clock for clock that's at least in the ones I got here the testing so I was thing about down clocking up there may be two point eight gigahertz and just gaming with no see you cool oh what a cool video that would be like yeah like using up like trying to get it down to like 10 watts or something and then be like you know I didn't even need a CPU cool or just do I did something similar with an air cooler that didn't use a fan so it was just a big passive cooler you know just a big heat sink I definitely wouldn't try running it without oh I'm gonna give it a go are gonna be final think dude last time I tried underclocking as far as like two gigahertz before the BIOS will only let you go down to like 2.8 or 2.6 like there's a limit it won't let you go the multiplier won't drop below like 25 I think in most boards so they shop it there on purpose because they know that below that frequency there's just no utility all in those chips they're just not meant to run that low even that even the you know the ultra cheap like for Intel the T variant CPUs are gonna be above that limit because that's the only place in which they're viable you know yeah I'm trying I'm gonna try I'm gonna try my own aside any ways are gonna be cool like imagine just building a PC and you have no coolers on there people be like what triggered and then they're like hey watch it game build says stick a 40-millimeter fan on top do it with the smallest fan you can like Wow fans yeah I'll just think it's something again give it give it give it a chance right give it a chance what about some of those $1 little heat sinks you know you buy ten for a dollar and you put them on your feet RAM and stuff just put four of them on there when you're the theme park just hold one of those up next to it and just kind of do it yourself so they know the day I mean it is what it is I'm like I'm pretty just I sit here bow like I guess the word for me is indifferent about it all like it's it's it is what it is with AMD and they're a company they got to make money at the end of the day so don't be surprised I mean I just kind of this is the thing right the last thing I'm gonna say on this issue this is the thing right who do they employ it their marketing man like you know it's the same thing is it's like time and time again some of these like into invidious marketing is impressive I'm gonna give him video that they know how to market in AMD and Intel it just seems like the marketing divisions dropping the ball and like if they watch the livestream was putting out I can give him some feedback here's how I would have done it right let's this ring replay the scenario right I would have just dropped risin four thousand all the reviews are out there I'm IPC increase over clocks better than rising three thousand then you just put out that little subtle are you by the way it doesn't work on before fifty and 8320 and see all the news is out there rising four thousand people just ignore that you mean mix it in yeah they should have wait they'd worked it the wrong way they're like alright we're just making an announcement guys be 550 and it's not gonna support up there so they made it a focus rather than just doing the little you know with you or they could have just I mean I know be 550 technically you want to release at the same time is or in this while the Zen to chips are relevant because that coincides with X 570 but they could have just outright delayed be 550 even more and then just have waited till they could have just not mentioned or could have just not mention the fact they could have just said it's gonna support but why did they have to come back and say all your other boards I'm gonna support a CPU it's not even released for a few months like who really marketing men well you know you want to like technically from an investor's standpoint you want to delay bad news as long as possible like you want to just delay it like that is natural so like I wonder how am i I really wonder who had more who had more tug in the relationship between the motherboard vendors an AMD yeah I really wonder if the motherboard vendors that basically stepped you said look this needs to be like we need a clean cut division between what we can support now and what we can support in the future because we can't keep up with all of this dicey BIOS update garbage that keeps changing our products cues and and changing our advertising and our you know descriptions and everything like I really wonder if they had more of a say so than we're letting on because but this is the thing I don't know like right I'm gonna give you another like lowest denominator example right here's the thing here's the thing right though of course the mean at the end of the day I don't know what goes on in AMD but let's just go back to the dumped example right the dump example this is what I going to call it yes so you're right to say you're out mowing the lawn right you're out mowing the lawn you can feel kind of things moving and lisas like honey anyway they do you tell her like hey Lisa I'm gonna go take a dump in half an hour no you wait until the last moment right or you just go do your thing and then you come back in like oh I had to take a dump that's exactly that's the bad it's bad you mean it's not normal to have an alarm to tell you when to take it up no no no but if you gotta take a break and go tell someone some bad day hey I gotta take it's not really good news is it so it's kind of bad you just do it and then say yeah look sorry we know we had some good news and and this just kind of got lost in translation anything that we're gonna say well I think it's I think it's good Ave MVP upcoming and you know our up up up front and forthright about the whole thing so there's no confusion at product launch you know like I'm sure if Intel did that the same folks would be saying all of them those jerks you know but that's just how it is some some people are gonna be that way but yeah I never please that but I don't want but I've never met someone that's informed me that they've got to take a dump in X amount of an hour late or a half an hour it's as always it's on the spot or it's after the fact right so it's like that's I mean the marketing team could utilize some of those basic human needs and realize maybe that's gonna play out so the other one I'd say out of this whole be 550 thing the biggest mistake made was the marketing department how do they get around us though well that's nice isn't it sound cocky here but if you if you don't say anything we're gonna figure it out we're gonna be the one trying the random CPUs trying the BIOS updates and then we're gonna realize hey you don't actually support this but you didn't say anything about it and then that's gonna make anybody look a lot worse now you know not your product and not send it to reviewers beforehand I mean they could I'm not sure how that would work it might be interesting to see how that all plays out but yeah because you've got a whole new release of CPUs because you got a hole in your release use that's gonna overshadow the bad news right it would still come out and it would be made to be possibly a bigger deal than it actually is because it's been moot it's now I had a huge deal right now like it's oh yeah oh yeah worse I bet you would be worse if it looked like AMD tried to brush it onto the rug well okay so yeah they're just well then what you do is you just you just let say that for instance the tomahawk yeah give well give one or two give one or two motherboards support for it and then be like yeah it's kind of gonna come out okay you just gave me an idea they should have then they should have just passed the buck onto the board partners like in total use it really weird this is totally a Brian analogy here all right let's say let's say you're about to start filming okay but you got this really big zip right here okay it's just it's so obvious I always get him on the nose you know it's gonna you know it's gonna be called out in the comments people can't help it they're gonna say something the first thing you do when you start filming is you bring attention to it you just want to get it out there and get it over with up front because if you don't you don't you don't address it up front it will be the talking point in the comment section that is literally the internet 101 I read that I mean that was the first paragraph of Internet 101 textbook it's you have to address it because if you don't and you let it kind of fester it will explode once some reputable source I know but yeah yeah but you're always but in the experience you always milk it in with some other with some other big news like you always mix it in with something that way it's just like oh yeah like like the whatever was the NASA thing with you know they released it right as soon as we were talking about CV so it's like oh yeah by the way we've seen some UFOs and it's like you know like that's the kind of thing I think they're trying to squeak it out people find out so they needed to do a squeak job that's exactly right they did like I think they just went about it the wrong way they just did barking Department really screwed up here guys that's just anyway yeah they needed just to do little squeaks little hints you're in there the guys in the marketing departments get paid more than we do for that very reason they're there they're paid bid books to think about all these things go through all the different scenarios up front so that all that you know are they next on text I think we're gonna have an interview as an anonymous marketing rep and we're gonna find out the conditions that go on deep voice so they can't and we go sex falls music anyway so that's that news let's go to chat we're gonna do trying to talk with you guys for hang out a little bit I mean there's I guess that was the only real juicy bit of news that I've been seeing coming up lately um again we talked last time about the laptop slapped I don't really care too much about laptops um but yeah they did be 550 thing is interesting honestly it's taken them way too long to get be 550 out anyway I just think they shouldn't even release it at this stage it's like I mean let's let's look at it right we lost a 420 there was no a 420 so we got we had three chipsets then two chipsets and then one chipset why not you know you're following just a cement like this it's perfect pattern ization right like yeah three then two two that's what I just did and I'm really Simone would like next year I don't why don't you be an Intel just collude well you could have AMD and Intel motherboard vendors clued to only release one chipset and just say here's a blanket chipset it's gonna do everything that we can physically make it capable of doing and good luck what is it what if I just merged and then the prices of CPUs just went up through the roof and then you just had like these update security updates that came up and the FTO performance 50% on your old sees that is what we have the FTC for to prevent stuff like that from anyway it's interesting anyway the whole thing like at the end of the day guys we're gonna restate it one more time don't throw it blind loyalty to any company never do because then they're when they're especially when there are publicly listed corporation they their main goal is to make a dollar whether it's in the short- or the line value for their shareholders in the long term or the shirt term it doesn't matter their goal is to either make a quick buck or a long-term buck so an AMD has been forced at its classical marketing 101 strategy classical it's the textbook they've got low market share when Zen was first released they've got to penetrate the market now that they've penetrated the market they've got up prices and make more money that's how it works so simple as that so don't if you if risin 4000 comes out the CPUs are more expensive than you otherwise would have expected don't be surprised it's long actually if the yields are a lot worse than they're expecting you know TSM she's been doing them doing them right by the past two or three gens but especially if the yields are not great I mean look it you know I think that could be a potential issue up front and if they have problems with chipset manufacturing maybe they have to push like what didn't tell us how to do they've had to basically fab the chipsets and the CPUs in the same warehouse literally on the same node that could also restrict inventory levels and I could raise prices as well I mean there are a number of things that AMD could run into that Intel is currently dealing with they could raise prices okay so okay at the end of the day yeah take it as it is guys don't worry we're gonna go over to chat now let's answer these is there any questions that you had to answer but is there any questions that came up that you would have loved to advance a during live stream I wasn't paying too much I was doing the stream for you guys I was yeah there's there was just a lot of talk back and forth it's all there entertaining himself it's fantastic ya know but it's been relevant to the topics were discussing Lee it's kind of good to see them kind of transition at the same time we are okay so upgrade Vegas 64 nitro 250 700 XT good idea it's not much there like there's not a huge I'd hold out for a bigger upgrade personally this is a concern about power yeah unless you unless something's going and there's something smells yeah if you got a smell there definitely think about it then three four point six gigahertz basically this is thing are they reusing the same seven nanometer if they are you could see higher clocks definitely cuz it's gonna be a more matured node we're gonna know that we got wino AdBlocker I don't believe in it man I just don't do ad blocker because it's that's you know that's a sight they got to make money man and I make money off ads it's just it for me I don't believe in adblock I never have it's a person the whole history you go back through my channel of sometimes I'll close down an ad like I actually manually closed it down if it's that annoying but if it just saw the lads that are sitting there you know they can they could take it there I use it when I'm like screen recording and stuff like I don't want all that crap in the screen cap when I'm showing articles and everything to me that's like it's different in the live stream because you can't really post edit anything but for presentation purposes I use it yeah what is your guy's opinion on x58 in 2020 uh you already know the answer this I absolutely love you keep going strong you're representing this is the thing I got asked about x79 1680 v2 if I was just gaming that would still be my main gaming rig right that would still be my main gaming rig x79 but I need like I need the 18 cause I do really need it so that's my thing I'm doing this for K May my my for K edits are getting a lot quicker now like I'm pretty much at peak in terms of how quick I can get an edit done now so oh you know what I heard I heard from another tech youtuber that one of the betas one of the premiere pro beta updates that you can get right now leverages the graphics card like heavily yeah and it's it's doing 10-minute 4k renders in like a minute 30 which what code I guess what and what I think it's CUDA but I it's Premiere Pro oh like it's a premier Pro beta update so they've actually done a good job apparently of utilizing a discreet graphics card which they haven't been able to do I saw that I saw that back in last year they were having that was it the scrubbing you were scrubbing 8k footage and it was just so smooth I was like wow so yeah the ID was something that was quick sync quick sync really was a kick in the right direction but now that they're implementing proper discreet card use yep it's like magical dude it's it's it's yeah it's really hot magic okay so we got asked this well should I upgrade my 90 100 F to a risin 2600 I mean the question is I've said this in the past if you've got to ask if you need to upgrade a CPU you don't you should know if you need to upgrade a CPU so you sounds like you're fine on your 90 100 F man I'd like to leave it is overclocking finished I didn't see the full question Gabriel Isis basically is overclocking in the future looking guy in the future no yeah overclocking is coming to an abrupt end like it you look at the trends right these CPU manufacturers are squeezing every bit of performance they can out of the box and they're doing it to remain competitive too so all your overclocking Headroom is now getting bend essentially where you're 90 well you would 10 900k it's going to have the best cores on it and then that's going to flow through we yeah obviously a 10 100 is gonna have the that's why there's no 10 100k because those cores are probably that bad compared to the 10 900k so that's it's getting worse yeah definitely I think overclocking seen like hasn't seen as good as days as a would have okay so what programs using live stream on YouTube I use OBS I'm gonna change to OB a studio like Greg recommend where I can save me out yeah save my outlay we can just click one button and we're good to go cuz every time I stood up a stream I got a triple check everything and then something goes wrong and I'm over it because it doesn't remember my settings someone said that um 5 gigahertz all core 9900 k DRM is running a 101 C on Azure RPG ITX don't know that I to IDX like people think they'll like they'll measure or they'll look at the arm temps and they'll say oh my god a hundred degrees Celsius like that's terrible but you can't you can't compare these temperatures to like CPU package temps like V RMS are actually designed to get sometimes that hot and hotter so if you see 100 110 or let's say and that's always safe but you can't just translate that from like a CPU temp perspective and say yeah this is way too high so I don't know about the ITX port that you're talking about but those kind of blanket statements about temperatures are usually not if that's 100 from software from the direct sense especially I think it's fun yeah I think it's funny the heatsinks getting 100 degrees oh okay double-check that get a fan on that thing ASAP yeah software yeah bits from the pivots from the software you should be fine I wouldn't worry sweat too much especially if the ambience a pretty hot where you are right now I've seen that I mean the the z43 90 ITX phantom game X the one I've got it's really good man I got it in my Mini ITX it hasn't missed a beat I use it for editing on the road 4k footage I've got a 99 hundred K in that thing and I play games on it it's like my little main gaming rig now because I got two 4k monitors here for editing so yeah I wouldn't wouldn't sweat too much about that so next question we've got let's go through these how long can we expect be 550 ah I would have no idea when we're gonna see a bee fly 4d ITX motherboard so I mean I would assume as rock we'll be getting on that straightaway and same with gigabyte they're usually pretty quick to the punch is the AMD 7 990 still worth it in 2020 no yeah I wouldn't get one I just get an RX 580 if you've got an rx 550 yeah because like yeah jool GPU support is like yeah maybe cool for lulz but that's about it is twenty four hundred year 3.9 you guess and a 2060 super a bad bottleneck should I upgrade to a 3130 300 X 2400 G is not that impressive I'd say yes in some games it's definitely in a bottleneck that 2060 Superman that's just what I'm going to say that yeah it's yeah but its weak as well so it's yeah well that's what's yeah it's sin it's like no I said it's hard to recommend 1600s and 2400 G's in light of how cheap sand plus chips are yeah and even sent you I mean even send two chips are pretty affordable if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks on them so yeah so I think um a 3300 X with decent memory as well is gonna be a good upgrade yeah like that's actually viable if you're if you want a game and game hard right now yeah it's gonna be a decent upgrade for you is an Intel i5 8400 and rx 580 going to last a while I don't think I need an upgrade for a while yeah you're fine man um guys only upgrade like this is the only upgrade when you need to when you need to when you're playing your games and you're like I can't stand this choppiness anymore I hate this that's when you'll need an upgrade so there's this upgrade down I guess I gotta make a video on upgrading because it's like I just think it's such a waste of money you know much wasted money in the world would be going on about people who buy stuff like especially in tech that they don't even utilize like you know how many 12 cause 3900 X's would have sold and they really the people really only need a 6 core I'd say the majority of people who bought those 3900 X's wouldn't utilize those guys I've been telling a man I've been telling since day one it's just not ideal for most people it's just spending money just to spend it yeah so I mean there you guys are propping up AMD's balance sheet you're propping up Intel's balance sheet that's why I like these budget man cuz like I look I build these gaming PC's all the time I test these games all the time like 20 60 super 20 70 super and and a fork or eight thread of CPUs is a good combo 6 cores 12 threads if you want that little bit of extra you know and I mean if you want that little bit of extra in you're like look but don't go you know you don't need 8 core 16 threads unless you go on with a 28 ETI and you're probably gonna know that and even then you don't need 12 cores 24 threads with the 28 ETI your 8 core 16 threads will be fine so it's just that's crazy amount of people just spend extra money like that don't need to so save you money and then when stuffs better in the future go put it in stocks right go put it in stock I always say put it into a better graphics card because that's where you're gonna see a real performance bomb once you've passed around past about 6 cores 12 threads you're not we're gonna see huge difference from 6 to 8 most games you won't even utilize a full 12 threads but let alone 16 but once you pass 6 cores you could pair a 3600 with a 20 atti and I wouldn't I wouldn't judge you for it because to me that's saying ok I want to maximize my gaming performance my in-game settings I want the best-looking best quality game and you know I might do some streaming on the side but you know what at the end of the day I have a killer graphics go in there and the only way I was able to afford that was by not overpaying for a CPU I don't actually need ya at the end of the day I think so this is actually a good question with a 6-0 f430 surrounded X with 3200 mega nuts Ram with a rx 5700 streaming and playing what is the best see there's the thing I'm gonna actually test streaming because if you're using the GPU encoder like I've said it like on these live streams before the CPU utilization is very little when you are streaming off your graphics card like when you're using that encoder built on you're not using up a whole lot of power so I'll give it a go that'd be a good arm good video actually to see how the AF fares against the 3300 X when you're streaming on the both of them keep in mind my 1600 AF here is like bottom of the barrel where I can only get the memory up to 3,000 66 megahertz that's with the 32 gigabyte kit maybe with a 16 gigabyte kid I could go a bit higher but um yeah it is what it is it's 3300 X all the new 3rd gen rising chips there XMP profiles have locked in first time on 36 hundred megahertz 3200 mega nuts just locked in like a breeze and it's worked which means the IMC's a lot better than second in 1st gen chips so anyway how much should I sell a 7600 K with the Zeus prime Z 270 a if you should sell it right now because people are paying good money for it it depends on USD I mean I try and get like 250 bucks if you could for it I mean like in Australia like you'd get 3 300 Aussie for that maybe if it was it was the right combo but maybe about 200 US maybe ok um all right let's close up some questions Greg's got to get going soon and 26 27 hundred x viable in four years yeah definitely I mean let's go back and four years ago let's look at what's fight 5820k is that still viable today 5820k is like still a really good gaming cpu if you know what you're doing with it so yeah 2700 X is going to be viable in four years time that's my guess and Joe's asking the same question again and let's that's that's when you know people are just switching off your stream when you get the same guy just asking the same questions like yo yo yo man yo no trouble see control via you know notice me cool hi notice me oh man all right so anyway excuse me what's the difference in two Rison 1600 1600 af well 1600 AF uses Zen plus cause 1600 users and cause and there's actually quite a big difference in my opinion I agree I've seen crisis okay is there a question there nope and currently have a r9 380 and an i3 6100 wait for ddr5 and ampere if you can dude if you can hold out yeah so why is that question so popular and why is it I just feel like that's so that's such a prevalent question in tech so it's like should I buy or should I wait should I wait for X or should I mind telling him but I'm telling him to hold out until he sees the chump I actually if you're comfortable enough right now just wait like why waste now if you're gonna be uncomfortable again in six months when the new stuff is all hitting the show that's that's it all right guys we're gonna be closing up this stream if if I wanted to stream what would the minimum CPU I should go for six core any relevant it depends what you want a stream like if you're just streaming like chat like we are now even four cores four threads can be absolutely flow yeah may be fine but don't take my word for that I haven't tested an i3 but I think it would be just fine but even if you're gaming in your cap in your FPS a fortnight your gaming cap an FPS at 144 Hertz you could get away with a 2600 K I'm pretty sure well and if you're using in bank or something yeah you know if you're doing encoding on the graphics card freaking a you could do it I three I think still no problem you'd be more bottle necked on the gaming side by the CPU then you would buy the streaming yeah that's also alright and now we got to close it off with accent time people have been waiting for this haven't done like god I'm so bad at this is something no you're improving your improvement so you want me to go further no I'm all right I'll go first do you want to you one day do you want to do pit vipers again oh I I just know I want to go first because I want you to end on a much better note than I would ever end with my terrible hmm I need a topic okay so you're thinking about upgrading an nvme SSD from a solder SSD this is the topic right okay and yeah and you can go with the oblivious route or you can go with the expert route you think you know what you're talking about well you don't know anything about this right okay good to go with you I apologize sincerely internet for this cringe it you're about to witness this is not gonna be an Aussie at all so guys I was typing on my computer on my keyboard and I realized I got a bit lag and it's like totally not at all and I heard IT professional come in and he told me that I needed to upgrade from my SSD which is about yay big to an in vme called it's about that big and I said there's no way that's faster it's a lot smaller how do you go from a bigger Drive that's slower to a faster Drive that's smaller it just didn't make sense to me I had time to go go out back and get jumped by kangaroo cuz I ain't having none of that nonsense in here okay I'm done okay let's go on to alright guys so I was at my place right and I pulled like I was watching some of these tutorial videos right and they like pulling off the back of the laptop and I pulled mine off and there was this thing there like it's set on an SSD and like my computer wouldn't boot up anymore so I took this in a Best Buy right and the guy had Best Buy's like dude that thing is smoked you've got to get this and he showed me like this this 2 terabyte and nvme and he's just like dude this thing's like 500 bucks and I'm like dude that's like more of my whole laptop and he's like if you don't buy this your computers and that's not gonna work anymore how's like dude let me just call my friend so call it my friend and he's like yo dude come over for bud and I came up with bud yeah you know smoke some good stuff now he's just like yo did you yeah you got to go back to Best Buy dude and just tellin you give him 450 for that two-terabyte nvme drive and it's gonna make a whole war of difference so I went back to I said let's do it can we do a deal for 50 the envy me he's like yeah dude I'll give you the special coupon code you whack it in took it home and plugged it back in laptop didn't even work again bro yeah host I see I'm reading the chat people loving this stuff so yeah that's it so 420 but yeah man all right guys we're gonna close off this street we hope you enjoyed and Greg's gonna go back to get his pit viper yeah you gotta add Cena head see that yeah add a little like your add a little one of that give it some give us the give us the little expression after it come on like in Ozzy might like some yeah bit of an add-on like I got the got the SSD might follow me might you know I can always do that one might like I have that they tone in my head so I can always refer back to that so yeah I'll do the loss so AMD and knocking off support for be 450 on the rise in 4,000 closing downstream but closing down stray I don't know where my mind goes sometimes all right guys we're gonna close off the stream love each and every one of you make sure you go check out my boy Greg Salazar previously science to do previously was it Greg studio before that previously Salazar studio that was right Salazar him subscribe to tech yes city and then before that it was tech city then before that was tech yesterday then before that I an easy yeah you kind of had a similar history not as bad as mine because three changes yeah three changes you've had them you've had them you've had them quicker sorry can you're gonna change the channel name again yeah so what's his next channel name guys decide in the comments for us and we'll catch it next time pit viper studio yeah all right we'll catch you next time guys peace out for now do you want to take it you take it away peace out to do a peace out for now bye give them something yourself for now boy
