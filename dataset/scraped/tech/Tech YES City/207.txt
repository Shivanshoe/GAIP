It has been a long time here at Tech YES City since we've done a can yes fix it and what we've got here is where you guys send in the parts and then i do my best via quick and Janky methods mainly tech yes loving to try and fix these parts and give them a new breath of fresh air to make them work again however before we do that we're going to read out the awesome letters that you guys send attached to these pc parts and as well we'll quickly check out some of the donations that come in too and a big thank you to you guys that send these in and the first one here was a um amd 970 xtreme 4 motherboard fx motherboard when i was at a deal hunt locally someone recognized me and they said look man i love your work so they gave us one of these motherboards with a cpu and ram installed and they said that they uh no longer had a um a use for it and they'd love to see it be put in a gaming pc and put for some use so when i get some free time i will put this in with a gaming pc and i will give that away locally to some unprivileged children because that is something that i love doing and also lately i've been on this massive thing around here in the studio where i'm cleansing the whole studio and getting rid of a lot of the stuff from 2020 that i picked up and either didn't yet sell or didn't yet use for builds because i want to come into 2021 with a fresh start and especially when we're doing the upcoming deals hunt very soon i want to be able to just catalogue 2021 as a new year for parts hunting but next thing we've got here is a really bizarre one because someone else sent in one of these boards i think we did a wash on it in a previous episode i'll put the link up here where we washed this motherboard and brought it back to life it was a really weird one really a lot of fun but then someone in the audience has sent out yet another one of these motherboards so now i've got two of these uh massive lga 11 uh sorry 1366 dual socket motherboards so it looks like you guys really want to see the dual xeons being tested in a separate video so perhaps we can make that happen do let us know in the comments section below however what graphics card you want to see that tested with mainly what's a good balance are you looking at an rx 570 still or perhaps you're looking at something a little bit more powerful say a 1660 super if that's a meta that you guys want to look at as i'll make sure it happens though let's get on to the first letter here which comes from they did not leave a name but i'm guessing judging by the email their name is luke so thank you for sending this in luke and they say i have sent this r9 290x for tech yes repair it is unusual so i'll give the best explanation i have if successful i would really like for you to send it back i would try to pay for a round trip not if not i will include worldwide stamps or i could send you a few of these pc parts i have and want to send either way thank you so i may have screwed up the bios trying to correct after i it did this i have had it boot to windows and even play a game with the stripe down the screen i just cleaned the entire pcb and thermal paste yesterday this is on the 8th of the 24th 2020. so 24th of august for the second time so i do apologize straight away it has taken me a long time i think this one came here in october it was sent from the u.s so has taken me a few months to just sometimes i get these parts in i'm so busy and i put them on the shelf where they can't yes fix it shelf so sorry it's taking me so long to check this out but on the exposed part of the pcb near the for the double bias switch it prefers being to the left when seated so this one sounds like it's a really janky uh graphics card going into it so we will try some things that we can do here with this graphics card but ultimately when you've got a stripe down the graphics card itself that is usually the gpu portion and that's just basically the great uh degradation and so these things there's really no coming back from those even the heat gun can't get that working again but we'll check out very soon and take a look what we can do for this gpu if it's at all possible maybe even run it through a vga port which is something that i've liked to circumvent the traditional um display port uh pipeline there so that has worked in some graphics cards in the past so we'll give that a try and then we'll see what the problem is but and then they've sent in an amd cpu and this has been pins i'm not sure if that's the culprit i bought a second mobo thinking that it was the problem all the ram should work it is for you some of the it is ancient possibly send cpu back i'd like to make a home theater pc intel cpu is yours so we're going to take a look at this broken ryzen cpu here and this broken gpu very shortly and see what we can do but on to the next letter here i mean and yes bent pins is definitely going to be the cause of a ryzen cpu not working if especially if they're not going into the socket right or the cpu even if it sits like a millimeter off going in properly the cpu won't work regardless of the motherboard that's something i've noticed on ryzen cpus and bent pins can contribute to that not fitting into the socket fully anyhow the next one we've got here is hey brian i hope you're doing well i am a massive fan of your channel keep up the good work i've got the gigabyte h55m motherboard that seems to be faulty i've tested this with a xeon x 3450 and tried to overclock it but it keeps crashing when i tried to stress test it started to smell smoke yikes we just stopped right there starting to smell spoke on a motherboard is not a good thing yeah and turning it off straight away is the recommended course of action good job there um i suspect maybe one of the phases of power delivery is in adequate as the cpu draws 139 watts can yes fix it kind regards michael from new south wales uh so we'll give this motherboard a shot very soon what i'll try and do with the gigabyte motherboard is i'll just try putting a standard i7 in there an i7 860 i think i've got one on hand here and see if that corrects the problem because sometimes with these old gigabyte boards they just go into this i don't know what to call it it's just like this weird phase where the bios it doesn't even matter if you flash the bias and re-flash it it just goes into this new league of just not working properly and i have seen this on two gigabyte mobos one being an h55 in the past and also actually no i've seen it on two x58 motherboards that have been gigabyte as well generally in this era i found these zeus motherboards sorry they told me to call asus as well the asus motherboards have been doing the best out of that error and that's why they're my top pick if you want to go first gen uh whether it be x58 or h55 p55 anyhow let's get on to the next letter here we've got here this is brian aka the yes man i love the channel and the great content you put out the older hardware builds you do are great i had these parts sitting around from an old hp desktop handed down from the kids recently build a new system for my boy and no longer have use for them i wanted to donate to your channel as i'm sure you'll put them to good use so they're talking about this pegatron board here and they did tell me that the board did have some something going on and this is funny because this is a pegatron board which originally i think was the owner or it was a split off from a from asus again look at zeus it was a split off from the company and this was the business side of things as opposed to asus being the retail side nowadays i think pegatron may even own asrock i haven't researched it enough but this brand in particular is very interesting and to have a pegatron x58 motherboard even if it doesn't work is actually something cool that i'd like to hang up on the wall so we'll put a cpu in this thing and see what the go is but so far it looks like the pins aren't bent at all so that's usually a bad sign like believe it or not the board's faulty and the pins aren't bent you don't have a real good chance of bringing that thing back unfortunately but let's get on to the last letter here because this one's a really big one it's a huge donation and like thank you so much for sending this out it just does really like i love this stuff and then when i look at the prices on aliexpress and stuff something like this a 26.99 v3 is not cheap and then 128 gigabytes of ddr4 ecc registered is not cheap either this stuff costs a lot of money so thank you so much alex for sending this out but let's get on with the letter here hello brian love your videos and decided to send you some love and care from sunny california right after i saw your video on the one and x99 motherboard i realized that i just ordered a similar motherboard x99 f8 with eight ddr4 slots to make my new home nas server i had a few xeon e5 v3 chips lying around as well as a bunch of ecc ddr4 memory much more than one person might need for his pet projects so i decided to share memory and cpu are both tested in working condition though i was not able to make the v3 chip work with this memory at its full speed it is stuck at 21.33 but it is still better than nothing now we'll stop quickly there because that is the biggest complaint on the x99 motherboards from aliexpress is that if you're using it with cheap memory you generally just and the xeon turbo locks you generally can't get higher speeds than 2133 i have seen some bios hacks where you can manually set in the memory speeds but it's so tedious to the point where if something's faulty you then got to go back and reprogram the whole bios just to get that memory speed locked in it's not as simple as just plugging in the memory speeds locking them in and then restarting your computer and if they fail reset the bios it's a matter of actually programming your bios with those innate memory speeds that you want to go with and then seeing if they work so it's a lot harder to unlock the speeds on that and that's why i don't recommend it generally for most people because you're just going to be there for days and days trying to get extra speeds when you've already got quad channel memory on x99 and that's going to do perfectly fine even at 21 33 megahertz but let's continue pairing this memory with the xeon platinum x82 xx series processor i was able to make it work at 29.33 without any problems so it even has some potential for future use so what they're referring to is they got this exact memory and they clocked it on a different board with a different xeon cpu that had the memory unlock features and they managed to clock this ecc memory to 29 33 megahertz which is actually really good that's a good impressive overclock and they did it without any problems so it even has some potential for future use i would love to know if you've got the exact timings for that then perhaps i could try that timing on a x99 board so anyway i used an asrock x99 motherboard for testing since my one and z is still in transit but i think both memory and cpu will work just fine thank you so much alex and we're going to put this to test i've got to get an x99 board in again i'm not going to be putting this one definitely not going to put in a 26.99 on the 100 aliexpress boards you need something more high-end for this i'm just going to say that straight up and something that will handle this i think this is this is an 18 core i think it's an 18 core 36 threads so perhaps if i do put this in an x99 board and everything goes according to plan then maybe i can make this my new old main rig if you guys want to see that do let us know down below in the comments but without further ado let's get into the last part here and the first that we'll put up on the test here today and this was a gtx 1080 ti they got given to us on a local deals hunt where the person said their computer completely crapped it and then they tried a different graphics card and they uh found out the graphics card was the culprit so we're gonna see because it's a 1080 ti it's a very big investment especially in the world of gravis cards in early 2021 we're going to see what can come out of this thing and see if we can get it to boot my first gut reaction is if the water cooler has gone then unfortunately what happens is if the pump goes the gpu overheats and that is really bad on a gpu a lot of cpus will have safety circuits in protection now but if a gpu a lot of times even though they've got safety circuits there to protect them because they produce generally a lot more heat than a cpu i find gpus they can go out a lot quicker and i have heard stories from people with all-in-one pumps losing their whole gpu when the pump goes out so it's one thing to consider when you put an all-in-one on a gpu especially do be careful that your risk of losing that because of the tripping not working as good as the tripping on a cpu there's a greater risk of losing the whole gpu entirely anyhow let's get into testing if you've got this annoying windows needs activation message and you want to get rid of it for cheap then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 bucks after you use the coupon code bftyc you can get yourself a legit single and use a windows 10 license today links in description below [Music] did we get that on camera i think we did there's your problem right there i know we should put some fans on the um i know we should put some fans on the actual graphics card but whoa okay that just turned off the whole system so there's something shorting out here we've got to turn this off and there's something shorting here i think [Music] so the problem we're having now is this gpu unfortunately just completely black screens even after we make it into windows so the water cooling must have just been giving it that last breath of room that it needed to survive and whatever happened to this gpu i mean it's just been used so heavily that i don't think it's got any more life left in it so if we press this right here we can see that it'll just turn off like normally so this one's a really weird one we can try baking it a bit later too which we will do [Music] when you guys sent me these gpus i'm pretty sure you just wanted to see me bake them up so we're going to get through the rest of these parts then we're going to give both these gpus here a go because this one here is like after we've done the tech ass loving and stuff this one's on the verge of giving out this one was showing all i could get out of it was just lines on the windows boot then when it made it to windows it just clonked out so the last hope for these is the heat [Music] gun [Music] so this pegatron board here we tried different ram different ram slots and even a different cpu and it's just not giving us any signal whatsoever it just keeps boot looping it starts up shuts off starts up shuts off generally that is an indication of a board that has something wrong with the power delivery that's what i find if the power delivery is actually physically damaged then that's one of the symptoms you'll get as well as it could be of course a faulty bios which in this case the bios is not modulus so we can't take it out and put it back in and so far we're three for three in terms of failing this is not how i like to do things but i guess you guys saw the last can yes fix it and you're like look i'm gonna fix up the yes man [Music] boom baby boom we scored a win here we got this 3 3300x back to life but that's because the tech yes method of bending rise and pins back never fails if you guys want to see how i do it i'll put a link to a video up here but basically with the ryzen 3000 series and up also the 5000 series the pins are much more sensitive to bends so do keep that in mind i found the 1000 2000 series cpus there got a lot stronger pins on them so they're harder to break and i feel like the 1000 2000 series are also easy to fix too bends are very sensitive on these ones so this one was super sensitive i think whoever had it tried bending it because the bends became very easy and you'd be careful if you bend it one way and bend it back another you can risk snapping the pin off but that's one out of like three parts that were tested so far so i'm feeling kind of good feeling kind of lucky we're gonna go in now with this motherboard right here let's give it a test see how we go [Laughter] [Music] [Music] so we've got this motherboard working now with an i7 860 it's fine everything's actually kind of fine in terms of using it but what i noticed initially when i booted this motherboard up was that the profile beforehand was locked in it was actually freezing and just doing all sorts of weird jazz keep in mind i don't actually have a proper cooler attached to this cpu but at 1.4 volt on an h55 motherboard you have to be very careful these boards h55 was never really designed for overclocking in itself p55 was meant for that with the bigger vrms and the bigger solutions so overlooking on h55 you do have to be very careful and that's why 1.4 volt i feel for this motherboard was just too much in general so if you want to dial that back to 1.3 volt go for a lower overclock maybe even put a fan over the vrm or a top-down cooler you can get a lot better results out of these motherboards and more stability so you go for a 3.8 gigahertz overclock rather than going for the big four gigahertz oc and that these board i mean these cpus are capable of doing just it's a bit too high i think with this combo right here that's at least from memory so this board looks like it's fine um there's not really anything inherently wrong with it just you got to be careful overclocking these h55 boards [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] so the two gpus we tried giving them the heat gun method give them both eight minutes that's my magic formula for bringing some of these gpus back but both of these gpus i think and especially this r9 290 here this is suffered from heavy degradation i don't think anything you do for it is not going to do anything for it unless you pretty much replace the gpu i've seen that before on that one this one here is still a little bit of a mystery this 1080 ti it gave out a little bit of a signal even when as far as booting into the benchmark but then completely cut out so i think something is just seriously wrong with this 1080 ti too and that's what happens with gpus again you take a gamble when you try to fix them and that's why the heat gun's the last resort method because i have had i'd say around about it's like 10 to 20 percent success rate with the heat gun so it does work but it doesn't work that much in this case these two gpus they're just too far gone we can't bring them back fellas but we've got one little more trick surprise for this video up our sleeve because i went and asked dadman if we had anything uh that was sitting around somewhere and he said that someone sent in an x99 motherboard so this is just like the the sometimes it feels like you go through the dips you go through the bad times and then you get rewarded and there's light at the end of the tunnel and that's what this x99 motherboard [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] thank you so this board right here we got it to boot and we got a signal out of it a couple of times and then sometimes it just doesn't want to boot and get stuck on a 5 3 error code so i'm going to basically what i'm going to try and do is in the next couple of days i'll play around with it because it's a really nice board it's just i want to get the most out of it in terms of stability so at the moment it's just not stable and i think that's got to do with perhaps i'll go back and clean the pins again because i did have to bend a heap of pins back and i did get the signal out which was really nice but of course we want that stability so let's move over to conclusion now where today has been pretty successful and the kenya's fixer we'll talk about the mechanics involved and when all said and done today's episode has been the typical quota where we got practically half the stuff working but i was disappointed about those graphics cards i love bringing the graphics cards back to life and especially now graphics cards are more than ever needed and so the fact that we just couldn't get anything out of them even the vga port wouldn't work that trick is not working because both of them just had dvi only so they didn't have the support for the older vga through dvi port which i think they eliminated that on the gtx 900 era and before that the hd 7970 before they brought out the r9 series anyhow these two graphics cards what you're seeing here is basically a typical thing as well where gpus generally once they're gone they're hard to bring back my success rate with graphics cards is very low and even within that success rate some of them only last like a couple of minutes and sometimes a couple hours but i have had a few graphics cards that have just kept going after we brought them back to life so that is the most desirable thing but it's also the most rarest scenario that comes out with graphics cards though for motherboards we did have that h55 that was important to note that i don't think the motherboard was faulty i just think it was being worked too hard with a four core eight thread on an h55 um so it ended up looking like it was perfectly fine once i reset the bios and just let the voltages not sit anywhere near 1.4 volt some of the other stuff as well bending rise and pins back and uh bending motherboard pins back i'm very comfortable with that sort of stuff i've had years experience doing that it's um once you get the right tools toothpick for lga uh pins that's my method and then i've got this special like it's not special it's a cheap screwdriver it's just a real thin one and i've learned to perfect that to get the ryzen pins bent back pretty easily i mean today's uh pin bending session on that 3300x that was like actually pretty easy believe it or not i have bent one back in the past and i actually did that one on video and i think i plugged it just before but that one took me ages there was one in the past i did where there's so many bent pins and that one took me ages and we got there in the end we got the cpu working so ben pins isn't a problem but it may be a little bit of a problem with the x99 board that we had at the end of this episode where that's just that's giving out some weird signals and i really want to get that x99 board working especially one like the g1 gaming where that is a high-end motherboard and i've got to check if that actually works properly with ecc registered as well because that's another thing some motherboards just don't like ecc registered memory period and so that's one thing you've got to be careful of so i've got to spend a little bit more time with that motherboard it's just getting a little bit late now and i kind of want to finish off the episode because we're going to also start the uh used parts hunt of the month very soon and um then we're going to be moving into february where this month has just been i've got to be honest with you guys it has been a slow one here at tech yeah city i haven't built many pcs i've just been uh sort of recouping and clearing out my studio behind the scenes so i can start again and i don't know what it is about starting with not much i love like this is going to sound maybe weird but i like starting with a little and then working that and really microwaving it hard to build something up i think that's for me i don't know if that's like a theory or a thing or they call it something but i love just starting with virtually nothing and trying to do these smart decisions build something big up that makes it significant and in ways people have been asking where's the 100 flip up chance that's coming very soon i've just been having a bit of relaxation i mean by the way it's gone very well all the stuff we did in the previous episode it's incredible there's an update on that and um the 100 flip up challenge really represented that where i kind of want to maybe just buy something like buy some collectibles or something with that money and then just start again with another hundred dollars because that was just like the the funnest parts of those episodes was starting at the hundred dollars it like once we started to get into the flow once we're getting into this flow now where we're building up a stack it's actually getting a lot easier believe it or not um and that's the sort of like i guess you like that challenge and so can yes fix it as well in ways is a challenge too for me to try and get these pc parts to work and so i guess like lately i've kind of wanted to challenge myself so going forward into this year i'll kind of be doing uh the content that's coming out on the channel is going to be more i guess focused on just more challenging stuff like stuff that i really want to just like utilize the tech yes brain here and sort of lay it out on the line of course there will be some new products if they're very important and focused on especially in relation to the used market i'll be covering those but in terms of the new products i'm going to be laying off new products this year as much as i can and focusing mainly on used and just doing uh different sort of content for you guys and focusing on the main topics that i think a lot of people have on their their minds and that's something that because i'm just constantly thinking even though some of this you know even though i might have an rtx 3080 around here and whatnot and believe it or not these are things that i love thinking about personally too and uh just they're always on my mind i don't know maybe there's something about me too is it's like sometimes you gotta shut your brain off but for me it's like this thing's always pinging and firing at all different cylinders and um yeah anyway there it is guys a little bit more about the man behind the camera which you know you guys can say in the comments you love talking about this stuff so i'm going to keep telling you about all the stories and do let us know though in the comments and if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit that like button for us but let us know in the comments what was your favorite fix of today or did you have any tips and tricks of your own that you've been coming into lately that's been working in terms of fixing things i will say one thing motherboards in the last six months especially motherboards older motherboards have been failing and i've been having so many more problems than i've ever had with motherboards in the history of the channel so i think as time goes on these older motherboards are the becoming increasingly the first point of failure besides ddr3 memory in this case you might even get some faulty ddr4 memory coming up because that's been out for i think almost seven years now ddr4 memory's been out and that's pretty crazy to think about that so do let us know in the comments what you guys think though love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from arun aravind and they asked brian can you ship your pc to india if yes how much will it cost me so generally we ship it with courier and that can cost like over a hundred dollars at least but if i think i just checked on the oz post if i'm trying to bring it down cheaper i think oz post i may be able to post a small pc with them for 90 dollars so if the pc's in a small case it weighs under 20 kilograms i'm pretty sure i could get that to you for 90 aussie which actually isn't too bad believe it or not i know it's a high price tag for shipping it's very high that's why traditionally i don't ship pcs internationally but that's actually come down a lot it used to be like well over 200 to ship a pc international where it just was not worth it for anyone but coming in at 90 for a small pc i mean it is doable especially if your country is um got some really insane rip-off prices but yeah the moment i actually don't have any pcs for sale except for the aliexpress one that we built with the six chord xeon but i haven't even listed that yet i've just been looking at other stuff that i've been clearing out so the pc hustle in january has slowed down a little bit but i'm looking first of all to solve the graphics card problem but we'll talk about that in a separate video because the graphics cards is the most important thing while you're struggling to look for them and get them it's really going to hinder you and waste a lot of your time that's all i'm finding personally so um until i can find a massive stack of gpus to sort of last me for a few months to flip pcs that's only then will i sort of start to really ramp up the flipping again anyway i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i will catch you guys in another one very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
