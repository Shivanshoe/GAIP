This tv box right here is actually in my opinion better than a chromecast even though it's coming in at a price tag a lot lower than that of a chromecast so this thing right here from Dynalink is coming in at $30, and today's video is Sponsored i will put that out there but i took this video because this little box right here is very impressive for the price it's essentially going to give you Google TV or Android TV where it's got Android 10, built in and also included in the box you get all the accessories you need so you get the little hdmi cable the micro usb power adapter as well as the remote and so if you press the voice activation on the remote which will give you a quick demonstration now play don't trust me all right don't trust me by 308 3. here it is on spotify so this will pretty much give you unlimited watching entertainment just by pressing the mic activation point on the remote now another good thing about the remote is is extremely uncluttered there's just the buttons you need you've also got the hotkeys for netflix and youtube and this gives you access to pretty much unlimited entertainment with that voice activation prompt where you can get things like amazon prime hbo disney plus espn hulu sling and other movies and tv episodes through the android 10 interface now the box is also extremely small and portable weighing in at just over 50 grams and then having a size of 69mm by 69mm by 20mm tall it also packs a quad cortex a53 inside and two gigabytes of ram as well as eight gigabytes of storage which is for the apps you've also got bluetooth 4.2 now some tvs already have smart access features built in but you can use this tv box and gain more features on top of that with the android 10 but also if you've got a monitor for instance a pc monitor you can then plug this in get some double-sided tape just put it on the back of the monitor and even use a different micro usb cable if that monitor has usb ports for example and then power the device off the monitor itself so you don't even need a power cable so it's less clutter and more ease of use now in terms of the support for signals it'll support 4k easy so you can watch with that high definition where as opposed to some tvs they sort of have problems streaming 4k content this will have absolutely no problems streaming that 4k content over wi-fi and after all those specs and what's packed inside this little box right here i'm going to save the best to last which was the most impressive thing and that was when i did the voice activation and i opened up youtube for example it automatically recognized that the tv was 4k and then it played 4k content as well as turning it into hdr mode so it's got that smart feature built in will recognize the device it's plugged into and suit the best settings automatically to that device in my studio here i can stream steam from my computer to my other tv right here so you can not only stream games but you can also play games on one computer in the house if you have these cheap inexpensive tv boxes right here and now the finale we've got here thirty dollars for an android tv box and for those who want to go out and get a chromecast the with google tv i think that's coming in at fifty dollars this essentially has chromecast built in so it does everything the chromecast can do and it only costs thirty dollars so i gotta give props to this little box right here the build quality is great the ease of use is it's just that easy you just unbox it plug it in you're good to go and everything just worked really well the remote the buttons everything felt good from start to finish so if you're after a little box inexpensive that will get you through boredom especially with lockdown in a lot of places still happening then this is certainly going to be something that'll keep a smile on your face anyway guys that about wraps it up for this little tv box right here i was definitely impressed to the point where i'm going to be using this in my studio i'm also going to be recommending it to my friends because the price point and what you get for the money is actually really good and i think because dynalink are a new brand i mean personally i've never heard of them before i think because they're a new brand they want to get their name out there and what better way than to make a buzz with a
