today we are going to be doing a new experiment and along the whole journey I'm going to just show you guys what I do when I get into a completely new market and that is we're going to be attempting to flip a laptop now I recently picked this up on a used pot hunt where someone had it for 70 Aussie dollars and I said sure thing I'll take it they said it worked but I would need a charger which since then I've picked one up for $10 off the used market and also it needed a battery where I got a new one off of ebay for around about thirty four dollars shipped so all up this laptop owes me about a hundred and fourteen ozzie dollars and the reason I took the gamble on this was because it had an i7 in it now has well fourth gen even though it came out in 2013 there was some big benefits to this over the previous generations that is they introduced a new super low powered mode sleep state as well as avx2 instruction sets and so what we're gonna do now basically is work on the strengths that we've got here right we've got a small what looks like either a 13.3 or 12 inch laptop and it's relatively clean also going to do is take this red sticker off take this semi-detached sticker off the top here and give it a good clean down I call this tech yes loving where I just get some multi-purpose spray and if it needs some alcohol wipes then I'll clean down the keyboard the screen and I might also take off this Windows 7 sticker so we're gonna quickly clean this thing up check that it works and then after that I'm going to go into the theory of how I'm going to press this thing up and then from there I'm going to actually let the market tell me if laptops are worth selling where I'm at and not even really looking at competitors I'm just gonna gauge all this on my own so let's get into this vlog and we're gonna make this a two part series if you are changing a mother bull with native Thunderbolt 3 and support to the latest Intel Core x-series processes then as Rox X $2.99 creator has you covered with things like 60 amp chokes MOSFETs native ten gigabit Ethernet as well as support for Wi-Fi 6 this is quite simply a motherboard that has it all links in description below to find out more [Music] [Music] so we just finished cleaning this thing and it took a whole roughly five minutes with a bit of multipurpose spray and a microfiber cloth these things are really good especially for cleaning things like laptops but what we've got right here now is essentially a quality check I'm going through and just testing out every single key on the keyboard making sure everything works find the mouse pad and the keys there I've also taken those stickers off just because what I'm going to do after everything's checked out and it has is that I'm going to be making a list of all the strong selling points of this laptop so basically we've got that i7 in there 4600 year we've got and luckily we've got this as well we have a 256 gigabyte SSD in it so that's going to be a great selling point and then we're looking at the Bluetooth and the dual band Wi-Fi it weighs 1.3 kilograms it's got a new battery that we just put in is 20 mil thick and includes a charger it's got a 13.3 inch screen I do have to check what type of panel because if it's IPS we can then put that down as a strength as well and then it's got a hefty and I do say this adjectives hefty 8 gigabytes of RAM because obviously having 16 would be more desirable but still having eight gigabytes in a laptop of this size is quite decent now the last selling point I'll probably advertise USB 3 since some of my competitors may be advertising potato laptops at this price point so anything to set yourself aside but I'd say this thing came up really well I think we're going to go ask off the top of my head I'm thinking just below 400 Aussie dollars so something like 380 Aussie I think we may be able to get that and if we do then I guess the laptop game is one that's very healthy at the moment but as I said in the intro what I'm gonna do though is I'm going to let the market determine how much this thing's worth and so you're probably thinking man you're not worried about your competitors what is going on here and that's because I'm entering a new market and I want to get a feel for say for instance that I put this off the 380 LG dollars the market is going to tell me via demand and simply how much this thing is worth and that if I get no inquiries on this laptop in say a week then I know it's too overpriced if I get a flood of inquiries in the next two days then I know it's under priced because I do believe I can get more of these laptops but it's just an interesting field like I love learning a new market and all the ins and outs of it so let's quickly check out that screen what type it is and then also snap some photos and get this thing listed up and now we've snapped all our photos and it's time to finally make up the listing and I also found out as a 12.5 inch screen which i think is like 768 P and basically that means it's a TN panel unfortunately there is another type of screen on this model that if it's 1080p then it's actually a IPS touch capacitive screen so I guess we didn't get lucky there on that front so it all balances itself out the SSD in it balanced out it not having an IPS touchscreen [Music] [Music] and we've just finished listing this laptop slash notebook PC upon good old gam tree and Facebook marketplace and I decided on the spot to go more with like a fast business PC because I thought when I looked at the photos we've got this hole a silver gray black theme going on and that relates to business in my opinion and then I guess all the specs kind of having the Bluetooth the Wireless the small form-factor the low weight that all pointed to going with that route as opposed to going with say a home user or something like that so marketing is very powerful and as we've touched on in previous videos in the past here a lot of people ask me how do i price up pcs especially when it comes to a desktop gaming PC and what you're seeing in this video is exactly that it's me testing the market and then gauging what the response is going to be because basically the market is going to tell me so much more than my competitors ever will and what I mean by this is I'm gonna be waiting now when I make part 2 of this video I'm gonna be coming back with my results and how things went because from this ad I'm going to be able to gauge responses as we said before gonna be out of gauge the demand for this item what's the main questions being asked to people want to trade in their old laptop or desktop or something completely different in order to get this Dell Latitude I think it's called an e 70 240 so the specs are looking pretty good and I'm not as I said before going to even check the competition because I'm gonna save that for part 2 based on what I've got here and now another thing when it comes to flipping things I guess like a laptop or me stepping into a new market is that you've just got to look at what you can get brand new and always gauge that against the use market so for instance I know like a budget laptop with an SSD is probably going to cost around $500 but it's probably not going to of an i7 in it so that I seven marketing is now an important thing that's why when I saw this laptop i7 fourth gen $70 and it worked fine I took the plunge on because I knew it was going to be a decent deal at that price and I'm putting the worst case scenario out here I think I would get at least $200 for this laptop making it worth my time at the very least though again if we do get 300 plus then this in my opinion is going to open up a new avenue for me to I guess look into flippin laptops more because it's a game that I have really no experience with and the only things I've done really with laptops in the past here on the channel is the occasional review of a gaming laptop though that being said it's a different market all together just like tablets and smartphones they serve different purposes me personally the only time I've ever used a laptop was back when I was a uni student and that's when it was really convenient for me to have one of these and take it to university do group projects take down notes on the fly and then when I was at home I didn't have to transfer a load anything else up it was just always with me it was like my little technological friend I guess that's what it is and honestly with handwriting like this I guess it was better for me to type my notes rather than write them down I actually did and during tests like University test is a true story I am I had to change from running writing to printing so I was like printing everything in my university exams otherwise the teachers just couldn't read my handwriting period anyway speaking of reading and writing if you guys have any tips of your own then please write a comment in the con section below for instance have you sold a laptop in the past is there things to look out for compared to gaming PC's love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day which comes from Cerberus gaming and they say hey TYC and other folks here what should I choose for my rig an Intel Core i5 4460 or an Intel Core i7 2609 using it with an Rx 580 honestly when it comes down to it I would honestly go for the i7 2604 extra threads and Haswell IPC over Sandy Bridge wasn't a whole lot more in other words I think you're going to get more max performance out of that i7 though the Haswell does have its benefits like it does have the baseline support for USB 3 native which connects to the VR support it also does have better power efficiency and stuff like that but ultimately when it comes to raw gaming unless that game uses avx2 which was probably I mean in terms of mainstream is probably a few years away I'd say the i7 2604 now is going to do a better job of playing games than the i5 4th gen will so hopefully that helps Plus also I find that the i7s have better resale value than I fives even a 2nd gen versus a 4th gen anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button also stay tuned for part 2 we're gonna update everything that's happened in the last week so we kind of going back to the future in this pretense of conversation here and we're gonna tell you what has unfolded and if mastering a new market is easy or if it's hard and so you can enter any market if you feel you've got the skills necessary to do what needs to be done and as we saw with this laptop I definitely have the skills for the tech yest loving identifying the strengths taking the photos and putting that listing up and without a sight I'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
