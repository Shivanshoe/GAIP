there is some good news finally coming 
towards gamers but don't be fooled by some of   the headlines out there as today we're going to 
talk about why we as gamers should collectively   wait even longer until those prices come down to 
levels that reflect what nvidia and amd promised   us during their fancy presentations nearly a 
year ago do you feel like this when you see   this well if so you can get rid of that windows 
activation message with today's video sponsor scd   keys for as little as 12 usd after you use that 
coupon bftyc you can get activated today so the   first piece of big news that we're going to talk 
about here is that supply shortage which is being   run around a lot of headlines that i'm reading in 
tech websites and upon digging into nvidia's own   quarterly financial report we can see that their 
margins have roughly stayed the same at around   65 percent this means that they have made roughly 
the same amount of profit on items sold that they   did this time last year however the revenue was 
up a staggering 84 from a year earlier in fact   the gaming revenue was up 106 that is nvidia made 
over double the money selling graphics cards from   the start of january through to the end of march 
in 2021 first the same period in 2020 where if   we take that same level of margin and subtract it 
from the revenue growth it means the graphics card   sales and more importantly the supply of those 
graphics cards would have been up roughly double   all else considered there's more to it than that 
but overall the supply was up quite a lot so there   is the proof that we all knew all along and that 
is the crypto miners took a lot of these cards   out of the market now the irony of this is that 
china is starting to just completely ban mining   altogether they've even taken it a step further 
by starting to ban cryptocurrency transactions   and crack down hard on any financial 
institutions dealing with such tokens   and according to the university of cambridge china 
before this crackdown accounted for roughly a   whopping 65 percent of all bitcoin hashing power 
or in other words china was responsible for 65   of all bitcoin mining so if we take that number 
of 65 and apply it to the gpu mining then we   can easily see that china is a massive player 
in the purchasing of gpus for cryptocurrency   mining and in fact according to some reports 
the gpu flood in china has already started   with one user reporting seeing rtx 3060s for as 
little as 270 dollars though upon checking taobao   personally i can still see that the prices of 
gpus are significantly higher than msrp a 360 ti   for example is fetching about 650 usd that's still 
over 60 percent higher than its promise 399 msrp   however here is where we can see the crossroads 
that is the point of inflection as we have record   supply of gpus being produced as well as in china 
miners not being able to purchase them leaves the   gamers as the only option left to purchase more so 
a lot of the cards coming out into the market now   have what's known as a low hash rate limiter 
embedded into the card and this has already caught   out some clueless miners purchasing rtx 3060s on 
the pretense that they could get the developer   driver and they'd be milking that cow harder than 
ever only nvidia quietly released a v2 of the rtx   3060 which is if you use the developer driver for 
that particular card then it wouldn't matter the   card would still only mine ethereum at half the 
rate so this simply tells me that a lot of people   getting into cryptocurrency to this date are 
still not doing enough research or paying their   due diligence and it's quite ironic when it comes 
to purchasing a tv a camera a smartphone or even   something like an internet plan people will spend 
countless hours researching these things to get   the best deal yet when it comes to crypto they'll 
just throw their money in hoping that it'll go up   just like it has gone up in the previous year but 
in my opinion as we watch crypto and going forward   i feel like in the coming months those avenues 
will get exhausted and the profitability will yet   again sink the next part of the equation is going 
to be a preemptive to the people that would say   well crypto is going to have a massive uptick 
in growth again well my response to that is who   is going to buy the crypto at its current price 
to make that explosive growth if we look back in   april and may people were selling cryptocurrencies 
at all-time highs those same people are only   looking to buy in when the price collapses 
not when the price is already relatively high   remember when it comes to dollars nothing is ever 
free despite what some people will tell you i   have never personally seen someone at my local 
shopping centre just handing out free dollars   it doesn't happen unless of course you were mr 
beast i wish you could hand out everyone some   free gravis cards but then again if he did that 
he'd become mr broke not mr beast however what   is going to happen from here in well you may have 
noticed i've been tracking one card in particular   that is the rx 6700 xt in my opinion it fits the 
bill of the value mid high range gamer perfectly   that is at its msrp it also isn't targeted by the 
mainstream gamer as say an rtx 3060 or an rtx 3060   ti due to nvidia having massive market share and 
more brand recognition than amd and the gpu gamer   space and most importantly its hash rates are not 
anywhere near as good as the rx 6800 which means   it's not targeted by miners as much as say the 
rx 6800 though expanding on that if we were to   look at the cards if they were msrp versus the 
price they are at market right now the 6800 is   much higher than the 6700 xt which does mean that 
miners are still buying up these graphics cards   for mining make no mistake about it just they are 
no longer buying them up in china which means more   supply for the rest of the world now back to the 
6700 xt it has been an ample supply for nearly   a month now just that it has been in supply at 
higher than msrp prices though the interesting   thing is i've seen this card go down from 1300 
usd to now 750 usd that is quite the drop in price   though it is still well above that msrp of 469 
that amd told us to expect and in australia that   is about 620 aussie dollars if you add 10 tax we 
should expect to see this card come in at around   700 aussie dollars and while the card is still 
sitting at over a thousand dollars so the solution   just let the cards sit there we have already 
ascertained the production and hence supply is   at an all-time high for these gpus crypto although 
still highly profitable at least for those not in   china does carry much more risk than at the start 
of the year i mean what if they were to ban mining   in the usa australia you may think that is simply 
just too outlandish but never forget in 1934   they banned gold as money i mean how do you 
ban money as money well if that can happen   anything is possible another risk for miners is 
that there is a massive change coming in august   for ethereum miners that is only three weeks away 
this could spell a massive drop in profitability   and more gravis cards could come onto the market 
in the meantime the only video game you need to   play right now is the game of patience though the 
most important thing is what's going to happen   between now and that time that we get in between 
getting to those msrp prices well in my opinion   it's just a matter of what we're seeing right 
now and that is the ripoff swarm coming through   see gpu allocation is going to go to countries 
that are netting the gpu board partners and   distributors the most profit however this effect 
is losing momentum vary and i mean very fast rtx   3080tis 3090s 3070 tis every lineup of card is 
now an ample supply in australia and of course   it is in ample supply at ridiculously high prices 
nearly double that of msrp the amount of customers   willing to get ripped off as time goes on becomes 
less and less and since that supply all-time   record high supply might have is a constant it is 
only a matter of time before gpus become much more   reasonably priced of course i'm predicting right 
around this time as well the price floor from all   crypto will just come out straight underneath it 
just as quickly as price has inflated they can   deflate as well though lastly in a video i made 
nearly two months ago i predicted prices would   come down and i got laughed at heavily in the 
comments section initially though now it seems   like those that were laughing at me were probably 
crypto miners and i mean if you bought an rx 6700   xt for 1300 usd in may and at that time you were 
laughing at me then i have to raise the question   are you still laughing though regardless of 
whether you are laughing or not i'm simply here to   report on the news and then interpret it and make 
predictions based on what my research indicates   whether that is good or bad if someone held out on 
buying a gpu in may due to my advice and they were   a gamer then i'm personally very happy as they 
would have saved a lot of money by buying it now   even versus them though going forward it 
also seems the governments are winding down   the stimulus measures and credit companies are 
tightening aka a credit squeeze which makes me   much more confident going forward that gpu prices 
can only go one way and that is down anyway guys   hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then 
be sure to hit that like button for us and also   let us know in the comments section below what 
do you think about current gpu prices are you   looking forward to finally buying one as a gamer 
and playing some games at higher refresh rates or   are you still not going to buy one even if there 
is a massive flood and prices do come down a lot   love reading your thoughts and opinions as always 
and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying   that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub 
button ring that bell and you'll get the content   as soon as it drops anyhow i will catch you in 
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye
