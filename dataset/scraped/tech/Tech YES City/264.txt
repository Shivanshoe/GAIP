the rtx 3070 is it worth 499 msrp well to answer that question straight away an overwhelming yes that's from me but let's get over all those numbers first for you guys and starting off at 1080p we tested eight different games here today those being shadow of the tomb raider do maternal horizon zero dawn fortnite and this is the nightmares update tom clancy's the division two the outer worlds and also mech warrior 5. now what we're going to see here is at 1080p the numbers really depend on the game you're playing and i thought when i started testing this card i would see a trend where perhaps the 3070 performed better at 1080p and then at 4k the 28ti performed better but this wasn't the case at all in vice versa actually where it actually more depended on the game and which title won at which resolution we can see here at 1440p they just like 1080p trade blows and it actually depends on the title and then stepping things up to 4k they yet again trade blows but here's the winning factor for the 3070 well actually two big wedding factors first of all that price point and second of all ongoing updates where driver updates will make this card perform even better going forward into the future the gaming numbers for the price point are quite simply phenomenal that's of course we've got to talk about the big elephant in the room and that is the supply so whether you can get one of these at day one is going to be another thing where this time around i've spoken to so many different people and it's always the same story the demand for the rtx 3000 series is like none other that no one's seen in the tech space period so in order if you don't get one of these on day one rest assured you will get one you just have to be patient but what i'm going to see here is that the power consumption is another big factor for this card really just landing a big victory over the 2080 ti where we show you guys the power consumption numbers here we can see that it's just beating out the 28 ti but another thing is too since i've been focusing heavily on undervaulting the 3000 series cards the 3070 just like the 3080 and the 3090 does benefit greatly from a solid undervolt now tuning this at around just over 1800 megahertz and then actually upping the memory speeds in tandem saw our power consumption drop roughly around 70 to 80 watts depending on the game and the application being used but again that's down from 220 watts direct draw on the card itself so you can get this card tuned to around roughly 140 watts with the performance you're seeing now coupled with the weight of this card right here this is the founders but i'm also checking out some other cards as well and a lot of these cards are coming just over one kilogram but coupled with this smaller footprint and the lower power consumption especially if you undervolt the card this will be great for people who want to install a high-powered gpu into a mini itx case for example now in terms of the cooler design they're going with instead of the founders cards the 3080 and the 3090 which had a fan on the rear of the card this has two fans on the underside of the card however it still has the back of the card being open in that it can blow air through now my one critiquing point about the 30 70 founders versus say the 3080 sounders and the 3090 founders is that since it's smaller in length this actually places this second fan right over your memory so it's basically when you're gaming blowing hot air straight onto your dims or your ddr4 memory and this is the thing i don't know over time if this could potentially shorten the lifespan of your ddr4 memory for example but my gut says of course with experience with pc parts the hotter something runs over time the more likely it is to fail they're going over the rear of the car this is a standard rtx 3000 output designed here three display port outs and one hdmi 2.1 and this is important if you want to get the 120 hertz 4k 10 bit experience which is very nice i'm not going to hop on about it like i've harped on in the past about the 4k oled but if you want to play more competitive style games at 4k 120 hertz this card will definitely do it as opposed to the 38 and 3090 which are more suited to upping the settings at 4k another key difference between this card and the 3080 and 3090 is the 12 pin power connector included it only requires one single eight pin versus the bigger cards which required two eight pins to this 12 pin connector now in terms of the cooling performance this is where the 3070 founders really did a good job where you'd want to use the auto out of the box settings in my opinion which took the card to 48 and at these temperatures and also fan speeds it was whisper quiet which was actually very impressive i mean taking it to 72 degrees but i did dealt it adjust the temperatures here for my normalized temperature testing against other cards that i've tested so if you guys go to another review that i've done on a graphics card you'll be able to compare the temperatures to that particular card we can see that upping the fan speeds to 60 did bring down the temperatures same with 80 and 100 but i thought out of the box this thing was tuned for maximum noise versus temperature efficiency but then the added benefit if you want to undervolt it which i do highly recommend you do you'll be tasting even lower temperatures and lower noise which this cooler is geared up to handle 140 watts for example very easily but what if you want to go the other way say for instance you don't care about power consumption you just want the best performance right here right now and you want to overclock well here's where this car did actually quite well even though the cork clock did not go as high as i've seen in the past where it came just under that of 100 megahertz the memory overclocks were some of the biggest i've ever seen here in the history of the channel scoring over a 1 000 megahertz boost which in effective terms is a 2 gigahertz boost which put this card at a very healthy boost in fps after we overclocked it and the added benefit of that was the power consumption didn't actually go up that much i believe i measured around about another 20 watts maximum on power draw after overclocking the card anyhow all that information out of the way brings us to a conclusion with the rtx 3070 and i'm gonna have to fight over the baby maggie out here on the balcony singing to me during this review and that's actually a first for me with the review where a magpie has been singing out on my balcony while i'm trying to do the conclusion what that means is even a magpie is getting excited about this rtx 3070 right here and testing this thing i'm really excited about the value for money it's going to be bringing to the table and one thing i did is i looked back in history where i saw a lot of these cards say for instance a gtx 670 that was the one of the cards that i remember buying and just really playing that card heavily and that came in around 399 usd i believe this card at 4.99 when we look at the years that have passed eight years we can see that this card inflation adjusted is bringing so much value to the table where it's performing slightly better than the previous year's flagship card it's giving you guys the great thermals temperature and power consumption and although compared to the rtx 2080 ti you do get a similar feature set in that you get rtx broadcast rtx studio drivers and also the ray tracing itself this card does differ in that it does have the hdmi 2.1 port at the back you also get a better thermals and lower power consumption and better ongoing support that coupled with the much lower price floor of this card makes it an extremely good buy however there is one disadvantage and that of course is the 8 gigabytes of vram on this card versus the 11 gigabytes of vram on the 2080 ti and of course if you compare that to the rtx 3080 and 3090 they have gddr6x where as opposed to this card and also the 28 ti they carry gtd r6 so although everything on this card isn't flagship the most important question you guys have to ask i'm guessing is is it a true 70 series card does it bring that higher end performance at a much affordable price point and the answer as we said in the intro is an overwhelming yes so if you want to go get one of these cards i can definitely recommend this if you're in the market for a gpu now of course what's amd got around the corner they're going to announce that very soon as well but one thing i can tell you about what i've spoken to the retailers if you want to get one of these things just like the 3080 then you better be very quick because demand for these cards in 2020 with what's going on and everyone staying indoors is through the roof there's an artificial extra layer of demand that was never there due to the global pandemic but this card is definitely going to entertain you if you're in the market for something that can perform anyhow guys with all that out of the way if you enjoyed today's review then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comment section below if you have any questions about the rtx 3070 and we do have some partner cards coming up as well as some cool builds surrounding this card right here so do stay tuned for the content to come in the next few days i also apologize for not getting the review out for some of you guys who want to see it straight away i actually thought the nda was a day later than it was so that's my that's my complete uh bad there but i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye
