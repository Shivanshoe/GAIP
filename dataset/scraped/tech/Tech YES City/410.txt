it's now been a good month since the 5,600 XT has been released and launch day caused a lot of problems especially for reviewers like us that had to present two different sets of numbers that was before the V BIOS update and then after AMD rushed out AV bias update and here's the thing now a month later looking at different websites of all the graphics card manufacturers a lot of them haven't implemented official support for those 14 gigabits per second memory speeds however asrock they said to us look Brian we've got a solution that is pretty easy and it may end up needing you more performance and then they asked me if I wanted to take a look at this sleek carbon-fiber red accented graphics car with a nice phantom gaming backplate triple 80 mil fans weighs in at 850 grams and 280 miles long with 112 mil with and also 52 mil with three DisplayPort outs in the HDMI to out and I said sure thing I can take a look at this card for you guys and then even use your software tuning program and see how it stacks up against other popular ones the most popular of course being MSI Afterburner so let's get into it and see what performance we can get out of this thing and see if it's actually any good [Music] so first things first with this card you can update the BIOS if you haven't already and essentially all this is is just downloading the file and then opening up the update and then I'll do it all for you and then you restart your computer and you go back in and they've got their OC tweak program which I've got to say is very simple in that it's a good thing for some people and of course it won't compare in other ways to something like afterburner where if you're a benchmark err you're going to be able to utilize River tuna for example and get so much more out of that program but what I do like about this OC Twix in particular is just easy to select through the three different modes out-of-the-box so they've even got the silent mode which should be called under vault mode because it does save a little bit of power and you can see that with the max power limit it drops it down by about 10% though clicking through the silo mode and also default mode you may notice that the memory target clock is still at 1500 megahertz aka 12 gigabits per second now this was the day one speeds that we saw when I reviewed the azuz tuff 5600 XT for example and even when I applied the V BIOS update on that model we were still left with the same memory speeds and a lot of manufacturers out there for these cards aren't guaranteeing the 1700 megahertz for 10 gigabits per second memory speeds simply because they haven't validated them at the factory which means that even though you left-click overclock mode here in this software it will raise the memory target clock to 1750 megahertz but asrock can't guarantee those speeds because they haven't validated them at the factory so they've only tested and they've only had time to test for these 1500 megahertz speeds even though the overclock here which I'm actually running in 29 degree ambient heat is working absolutely fine and so if you get one of these cards from asrock whether it's their Challenger or their to fan or what we've got here the three fan phantom gaming X models this software is super easy to set up in that you can just go to preferences left click both these little boxes here and then left click OSI mode and it will essentially boot your GPU up now with these set clock speeds in mind and so you'll get a lot more performance even over that of the 14 gigabits per second V bias updates that AMD dropped and we can see that here where we've got 1750 megahertz on this GPU because as rock with their phantom gaming X models I was told decided to bend the memory on the GDD r6 when they made these particular models in mind the one really cool thing I found about this software was the memory usage we can see here the GPU memory utilization is actually reporting lower than that of afterburners so I believe this software is reporting actual GPU memory usage as opposed to afterburner which pretty much reports on the maximum that the buffer will use for that particular point in time so it's different ways of reporting but I feel like this is more accurate so that's one cool advantage to using this software another thing you'll notice with the phantom gaming axe is there's no vrm temperature probe however in my testing I found the vrm temperatures to come right around the GPU temps especially with models where the vrm heatsink is attached to the GPU heatsink which in this case that's exactly what's going on and so we can see here out of the box I'm recording this while I'm benchmarking about 40 centimeters away from the phantom gaming axe and the temperatures in a 29 C ambient environment are really impressive especially for an OC mode where the most we saw was 63 degrees Celsius and then the hotspot temperatures essentially your memory temperatures that got to 74 degrees so temperatures and noise on this card it doesn't matter what mode you select you're going to get some really good results though one more thing you may notice about this chart is I've added in the custom overclock which is what's called in the software user mode so you can set in and apply your own overclock and you can do this really quickly in this software and the good thing is I've got here 1820 megahertz on both the memory target clock and the GPU target clock so what we're gonna do is now get these numbers and see how they perform against some of the other numbers I've got here with other 5600 XTS and then report back on the phantom Gaming Act you come easy surprise [Music] we have now finished the benchmarks with this little 5600 xt and your berry singing damn that looks a lot smaller than it did in the b-roll that's because the cooler is actually overhanging the back here where I think it's a really good design when we looked at those temperatures because the air can now blow straight through the card at least on the last fan and that's not restricting airflow which I was really impressed with this model in terms of its temps and noises and the fact that that OC mode and the custom overclock mode did slightly better then both the gigabyte card I had through here with its official 4 10 gigabits per second BIOS update and the azuz tough both with its v bias update and overclocked and the micron GDD are 6 memory in this case did go all the way up to 1800 and 20 megahertz there compared to the 14 gigabits per second v bosse update models out there you are getting a little bit more by going with the OC tuning software from asrock and then locking in that overclocked mode the custom overclocked mode it really wasn't worth it as we saw in those benchmarks one extra fps they've really done a good job of tuning their card to perfection out of the box where I was surprised to see that the default AMD mode was losing to the silent mode which was saving you a little bit of power so I do like in this case how asrock have spent the extra time going through those profiles and then delivering them and they've also got their polychrome sync RGB software but in this case it really only changes the logo but you can also turn it off if you are not a fan of RGB though the good thing is it syncs with their asrock motherboards for instance we're using it tight C on the test bench here so it's able to sync up and get the same colors on that logo as it can on the motherboard so now it's time to give you guys a conclusion on the phantom gaming X and I gotta say this is the most impressive 5600 XT that's come through here not just in the case of the numbers it produced here today but also the fact that I didn't even need to change the fan profiles because they worked on all the modes that I set here today and they gave really good temps and really low noise so whatever as where I was doing with this model I'd like to see them keep up in future models of their graphics cards because I think just nailed it with this card now there is going to be a little bit of a premium of course for this model versus say a reference model that's usually the way it goes for a bit of extra quality on your GPU and that's about it for today's video if you enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button and let us know in the comments what you think about the 5600 XT I do think that asrock in particular have done a great job of mitigating what AMD did on day one with these cards in the fact that they're still giving you an option to easily get performance out of it without sort of saying hey we haven't validated this but we're just gonna throw it out there forcefully s' and I know there's going to be some people out there that are gonna say well company X's release these V BIOS updates and backdated them even to the cards that they haven't validated and I'm looking at as rockin like even like a Zeus and other companies especially the ones that come from Taiwan and if you guys have like been lived in Japan or Taiwan and stuff then you'll know how a lot of the Asian culture does things and that is they just simply won't guarantee something that they haven't validated it goes against their principles in their culture and so I guess that's why you're not seeing the official 14 gigabits per second updates being rolled out forcefully on a lot of the cards out there so do let us know your thoughts and opinions on this one and speaking of those thoughts and opinions we've got that question of the day which comes from Scotty MSU and they asked why can't we talk about a certain virus is this speak police we have to worry about now and basically yeah that's how it is in 2020 you guys know the drill I'm just ultimately here to give you guys tech videos and I want to stay away from all that mainstream stuff where I'm just giving you guys the vids the enthusiasts tech vids and I want to make sure my channel goes through that without getting scuffed in the process so that's pretty much the only way I know how to do it and that's the way it's got to be I guess so hope that explains that and I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon and of course if you're enjoying the content and you stayed this far and be sure to hit that sub button on the way out ring that bell to get those videos they drop and I'll catch you on the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
