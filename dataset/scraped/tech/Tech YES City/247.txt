towards the end of yesterday's review of the 6800 XT i took a look at the encoders and the differences between the 6800 xt the 5700 XT and also the rtx 3080. Now it was clear when we analyzed these in 4k and i'll put this example up here again in 4k for you guys that the center image was lacking detail now the colors which we will talk about a bit later that's not so much the issue here it's more so the detail that you're getting out of this captured image which was taken in obs stream labs which is a very popular program for streamers especially if they're streaming at 60fps 1080p however we'll show this now in 4k since yesterday's video on my channel got stuck in processing and it looks like it's forever stuck in processing where i had to go back and re-upload that video in 1080p for it to work and i don't know what's up with youtube sometimes the dramas that have followed my channel over the years do leave me scratching my head but what can you do but just keep going on anyhow let's keep up with some comparisons between the image quality between the rtx 3080 and also the 6800 xt where i've used an external capture device on an external pc using the same cpu encoding settings at 4k 60fps let the showdown begin [Music] and starting out here with the first title we've got shadow of the tomb raider this is 4k on the highest settings preset and what we saw here with the results from yesterday's review was at this resolution was these cards were performing pretty similar where i think the 3080 only slightly edged out the 6800 xt and then at 1440p the 6800xt edged out the 3080. so they'll perform very similar in this title but another thing is too is that the image is actually looking very identical to my eyes at least in terms of the picture quality now one thing i will quickly say again is that we are using the same encoding settings on a separate pc with a 4k 60 capture card from corsair and then we're using the cpu encoder at 4k 60. so there may be some stuttering from left to right or vice versa so one may look smoother than the other throughout the comparison but that's because it is a very cpu heavy encode at 4k 60fps do keep that in mind but what we're seeing or what we should be seeing is the encoding settings will be exactly the same in terms of the raw image quality so what you're seeing coming out of these two graphics cards from that hdmi port is going to be what you should be experiencing when you're playing this title now another good thing about shadow of the tomb raider is the benchmark itself since we're going from one card to another from nvidia to amd and vice versa it's good to see that this game is showing the same picture quality on both cards which means that if you're going to play this game with one card or the other and the fps numbers that you see for this benchmark it's going to say okay i'm playing this game for instance at 60 fps 4k i'm going to be getting the same experience on both cards which is good if you're an end consumer but this isn't the case however for this next game that we're going to be pulling up here and this is dirt 5. now i'm actually going to be scrapping this benchmark i used it once in yesterday's review for the 6800xt versus the 3080 and i just noticed that while i was benchmarking this there was just massive areas of the map that were showing completely different amounts of shadows and so for me personally watching this i'm like well this isn't consistent we're here now testing apples to oranges where we're actually benchmarking why i like to use benchmarks that are consistent but watching this benchmark back there's not only a little bit of inconsistency in the car positioning and how they interact with each other but there's also a big inconsistency in parts of the map where the shadows display on certain cards for instance in this benchmark run that i did on the 3080 on the right versus the 6800xt on the left we can see that well we'll get into it very soon that it pretty much just starts going really dark for the nvidia card and i guess processing a lot more shadows than it would on the nvidia side rather than processing that same amount of shadows on the amd side which can of course if it's the wrong set of variables hamper one card versus the other hence why when i saw this benchmark and wash it back closely i'm actually going to be scrapping it from the numbers though if you guys are on a 4k monitor feel free to pull this up and watch it at a higher bit rate than say 1080p because you'll then be able to see some of the differences if they are there i watched it back and in terms of the detail coming out of both these cards very similar when we're using the same encoding settings unlike that comparison we did before we're pretty much testing the nv encoder in streamlabs versus the 6800xt encoder in streamlabs and so hopefully amd can update that in a few driver updates and give a bit more detail but as it stands the 3080 encoder is giving out more detail for the same bit rate that's recorded at a high quality mp4 size in obs stream labs so closing out on dirt 5 we tested this out on the same preset here on the ultra high in the settings menu itself using the in-game benchmark but basically this game unfortunately for me personally is going to go from benchmark to the first real case of a trench mark though switching things up here for the last title we are going with horizon zero dawn and this game actually looks really beautiful at 4k if you guys are doing some 4k gaming especially on oled where you can turn on hdr support with 10 bit this game looks absolutely gorgeous it's jaw dropping when you get into it though this benchmark itself it's good to see that we're getting an apples to apples comparison like we are with shadow of the tomb raider here where the details look the same the colors look the same there's no different placements of shadows the only difference however that you will see in this game is locations of npcs or non-player characters and so you'll see them throughout the benchmark just different characters will be randomly walking around in different spots but this shouldn't affect the fps too much you may see a variance of around 1 fps to even 2fps depending on how many runs you do but that's generally when you see reviewers testing hardware they will run benchmarks multiple times to weed out variants and then give you guys an average score however one dilemma i am having is that with the averaging out of benchmarks which personally i do three runs and then i give the average of those three runs i have sort of had a question to myself and i would love you guys your feedback in the comments below would it technically be better to make sure the system is running properly first making sure there's no bloatware or anything like that on the system and then perhaps just do the first run and take that first run in that game because when you think about it if someone's jumping into a game they're gonna be playing that game for the first time and then going through the level and i mean depending on if they okay if they fail the mission or whatever they restart the mission again they will replay that same section but for a lot of gamers they're really playing that section only once so that's sort of like the conflict i've been having with benchmarking at the moment is it more realistic just to do the first run and give you the results from that or go back and re-test three different times do let us know in the comments section below what you guys think about that so there it is with the image quality at 4k 60fps hopefully youtube hasn't compressed this comparison to the point where it's a blurred out image hopefully there is a lot of detail still left in there so you guys can see it for yourselves but what i did see was that there was no discernible difference between the two in terms of the raw colors and the image quality coming out this time around the 6800 xt and the 3080 looked pretty much identical for what you were getting at except for dirt five and this was an important thing for me because i will be making a video uh talking about differences between numbers when you see different benchmarks and whatnot but this does show in real time that some benchmarks just aren't giving out apples to apples and therefore benchmarks like that i'm gonna personally i'm gonna scrap dirt 5 from my benchmark suite after seeing that in today's tests though what we saw with the differences between the two if you're an end user gamer there's nothing to worry about you're going to have a great experience if you can get your hands on a 6800 xt or a 3080 that's still an ongoing problem is supply but if you're an end user gamer you're going to be enjoying both these cards that's what i said in the original review from yesterday and i'm going to be standing by that going forward though the differences between the two cards as i've said before there's a 50 difference there one's got 16 gigabytes of vram versus one having 6x and 10 gigabytes of vram where if the games aren't limited by vram then the 6x will do a better job at 4k as we saw with the benchmark numbers though outside of gaming if you guys want to know more about either of these cards then i'll link yesterday's review for you right up here and you can check that out but with that aside the image quality it's a good thing to know that you're going to be getting a good experience out of both of these and with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like button for us also let us know in the comments section below did you like today's video if not just hit the dislike button and let us know why not and the good thing about that is even a dislike helps us out on the algorithm with youtube so with that side we've got a question of the day here which comes from blake2423 and they ask i mean you get the cards and us customers can't get them and you don't want to be a beta tester to help us out as i said in my review yesterday i have done enough of beta testing for 2020. there's been so much of it already and i am i'm pretty tired i'm pretty burnt out and today's example of dirt 5 especially in the benchmark mode does show some wiring differences there which i guess in ways would constitute beta testing so uh and so speaking of us customers as well i actually am a customer too i do get review samples in but i do actively partake in being a customer in the market buying and selling things uh for instance i have a 3080 that i bought i've got another 30 70 or 3080 that i'm buying for a challenge and there is also if there's a 6800 xt on pre-order that i can get then i'll be ordering one of those too so i do feel like i like to take a customer stance on products as much as i can and if that's not good enough for you blake then just hit that dislike button for us anyway i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content and you know what to do and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
