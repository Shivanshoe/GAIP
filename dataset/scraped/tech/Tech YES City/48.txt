[Music] it's just one of those days where you don't want to wake up everything is wait that's not right everything isn't forked in the world of pc gaming where gpu prices are finally coming down which makes it so that if you've been holding out to build a gaming pc then now isn't too bad a time where today we're going to be putting together a beast gaming pc for a little over 1100 usd and it's going to be featuring the latest intel 12th gen i5 12 400f and also the rtx 2080 super which for the rtx 2080 super this graphics card is a very good pick if you're looking for decent value for money since crypto miners are not really going to be targeting this card and also crypto miners aren't buying up gpus like they were last year so this means that it's finally a decent time to start building pcs so let's see what we got on the table here and then put it together tune it all up and then see how it performs in games are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as fourteen dollars using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below [Music] welcome back to tech yes city and everything in today's video is going to be new parts except for the graphics card this is the rtx 2080 super really good pick if you want to buy a used graphics card for a decent price but if you want to get a new graphics card then the amd cards have actually dropped a lot more than the nvidia cards on the new market so if you want to go all new then something like an rx 6600 is going to be a decent buy to get still decent value for money but i'll put all the prices for the parts up on the screen here for you guys so you get a bit of an indicator on if you want to build something similar to this on what you should be paying i'll also put some links in the description below but with that aside let's start undervolting the cpu and tuning the graphics card to get the lowest power consumption possible and also the best fps [Music] [Music] so after completing this build we've installed windows and we've also gone into the bios and locked in our 3200 megahertz xmp profiles on the memory however there is a little bit of a fork in our plan here to bring the power consumption down especially on the cpu when it came to the graphics card we managed to drop the power consumption down considerably to the point where we'll show you the results first and then i'll show you guys how to do it where if we were running unigene heaven benchmark which is a basic benchmark that's free to download it's very quick to get up and running we can see from the wall this whole build in total was using 376 watts power consumption but after we started tuning up the cpu we managed to tune this up a minuscule amount and also for the gpu we tuned this up greatly with msi afterburner we dropped down the power consumption all the way down to 268 watts that's over 108 watts savings from the wall and we're pretty much getting very similar performance i'll pull up some before and after benchmark numbers before we did the under volting and then after we did the under vaulting and what we got here was out of the box cpu in time spa we got 8410 points and then 8492. so the cpu actually went up slightly after doing this then the gpu went from 11 583 points down to 11 125 so we didn't even lose five percent performance but we're dropping the whole power consumption of this build down 33 and it was a similar story with fire strike extreme where the cpu scores were pretty much identical and then the gpu score dropped down from thirteen thousand five hundred ish down to thirteen thousand and fifty eight so the benefits of under vaulting not only are we going to be saving power in this case 108 watts say for instance we're gaming for 10 hours that's going to be one kilowatt hour roughly that's going to save us in australia around 20 cents so if we're gaming for 50 hours that's a dollar so every 50 hours that we game on this pc we're saving a dollar just by under vaulting and so over the course of a year you could even save 50 dollars by doing this little trick that we've done here today so now we're at that point where you're like brian you've showed us the results i want to know how to undervolt this particular gravis card and the rtx 2080 super is very easy to undervolt you just have to download a program called msi afterburner and then while you've got that program installed and up and running i want you to then hit on your keyboard control f and this will bring up the curve editor and then we can hold shift left click our mouse on one of these dot points and then drag it down to 1800 megahertz roughly and then at around 825 millivolts we grab that point hold left click and we drag it all the way up to 1800 in this case 1810 megahertz and then we go back to the msi program and we click the tick and then we can save that as a profile and we're good to go that's the main component of undervolting but also since your gravis card is running cooler we can also afford to up the memory speeds in this case this rtx 2080 super we got an extra 400 megahertz on the memory so you can feel free to try and copy my settings if you've got an rtx 2080 super and then you should be having much better power consumption as well as a much cooler graphics card that was for the cpu the 12 400 f the motherboard didn't have a whole lot of voltage options in it to undervolt the cpu and then also when we went to windows we couldn't install that intel extreme utility application because intel haven't added in support so i would like to see intel add-in support for that application with the 12400f then at a later date we can come back and undervolt the 12400f especially with this motherboard right here though speaking of something that is not going to wait for a later date that is the gaming benchmark numbers where i'm going to start in 2022 i believe this is probably one of the first budget builds i've done this year because it's finally a decent time going forward to build pcs i'm actually going to start putting up value charts for you guys and you can see which builds have performed to what fps and the value you're going to get there going forward so if you want to build a high end pc you can say okay am i going to be paying a mad premium for it or am i going to be getting a pretty good deal but let's get those gaming benchmark numbers done and then come back to it fuel reserve foreign [Music] and after all those benchmarks are finished we have an absolute winning formula here with this gaming pc and what we saw with the under vaulting was the temperatures on the gpu and the cpu were remaining quite low in games and this is summer where i live here so basically in australia we're the opposite of the rest of the world where it's winter so your temperatures would be really cold if you were using this exact same gaming pc in the same settings but let's go through some of the fps that we got in these titles where i'm going to add up all the fps in the end and i'm going to put it into a value chart but what we did here with these four games we tested age of empires four we tested call of duty cold war tested fortnite at epic settings and then we tested on the last game we had apex legends and i played arena and so i'm gonna test the same map and the same max settings when i do other gaming pcs this year and then add up the total average fps and then divide it by the dollar amount and that'll give you the fps per dollar on these rigs that we're producing here so say for instance you want to build something under a thousand dollars you can see the value for money it presents and maybe it's worth it to get that little bit extra and go for a higher end bill that's what these charts are going to tell us so this pc right here did perform with over 4 fps per dollar which is really good in the grand scheme of things and considering the fps it was pulling in all these titles it was an absolutely smooth experience at 1080p and this is max settings so of course if you want some more fps out of these games you can lower the settings but it is ultimately a pc that will deliver the goods and it also has the blink to match now for me personally i'm using these budget cases with four rgb fans and as you saw in games the temperatures that we're seeing here are absolutely fine so you don't have to go out and spend big money on a case unless of course you're probably going with like an i9 12 900 k 30 80 ti or 6800 xt and you need to get the best airflow to go through that case but all the components we used in today's build are great value choices and it finally marks a time in pc gaming where it's actually not a bad idea to finally go out and build a pc i think all of 2021 was very painful if you guys were looking to build a gaming pc last year there was even one of my viewers who asked me about his vega 64 and what should he do and i just told him to simply sell the vegas 64 last year for a ridiculously high price and just wait till the gravity starts come down now he would have been waiting a few months but at least that money if he sold that vegas 64 then he can now buy a much better card even with the same amount of money so that's kind of where the gravis card market is going it's looked like it was tapped out last year the miners just kept piling on they just wanted to keep getting more graphics cards and more graphics cards but now they're getting to a stage where the crypto's going down the profitability is going down but also even some of the i think the ethereum developers were coming out at the start of the year and just saying look we're moving to proof of stake really soon so if you're looking at buying more graphics cards for mining i wouldn't buy any more personally and that's what they were saying so they were sort of giving the big time miners the signal that proof of work mining is going to drop off and that's a really good thing for gamers so it seems like when the crypto market's doing bad now the gaming market is going to start doing good so hopefully fingers crossed these prices do remain subdued and they keep going down for gravis cards and this is going to bring back enthusiasm at least to the pc gaming world the enthusiast tech world which has been sorely missed in 2021 honestly 2021 i was just walking around like oh man we just got to look high and low constantly like the deals hunting was excruciatingly hard last year i had to go everywhere to recycling yards and all these other places to try and get really good deals and in the end i was getting good deals but it wasn't like 2020 especially before the whole crypto mining boom where you could go on marketplace and you could just get a good deal or you go on your local gumtree or your local sort of a used deals marketplace and you get a pretty good deal on something and that just wasn't the case for gravity cards and it wasn't even the case for a lot of other parts too there was just so many people looking for used parts because the miners had pushed the prices up of the gpus and sort of that scaled on to everything else in the market where we saw the likes of say amd with their ryzen 5000 series chips they were just charging a lot more money because they could and so this year it looks like there's a bit of a balance on the scales and hopefully the printers they're pretty much turning off right now so in america the federal reserve's turning off the printers and hopefully now they start reversing and i know it's a hard concept to imagine but it's called quantitative tightening and that's when they actually start the federal reserve starts selling the assets on their balance sheet and taking cash out of the economy so if that happens then all these big you know dogecoin going to the moon type high flyers out there and you know go buy a picture of an ape and all that stuff that's going to go down with that line that's if that happens of course it looks like it is going to happen but there's always and i said this to all my viewers out there always be quick on your toes to know the information i'll be helping you guys out on the channel here telling you what's going on when to react but for the time being if you've been hanging out to build a gaming pc then now is a decent time and you're not going to lose a whole lot more say for instance if prices do come down then a build like this is already a pretty solid price where you're going to get really good performance for the dollar anyhow guys with that aside i hope you enjoyed today's budget build we've got another one coming with pretty much all used stuff it's going to be used ryzen 5 first gen and also an rtx 2060 and we'll add that into the charts and as we go through this year we'll even add in things like a laptop for instance and see how that stacks up against the gaming pcs and hopefully you guys will start enjoying the new builds that we bring to the channel this year and hopefully a bit more excitement starts coming back into enthusiast tech if you guys stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what you think of today's build and also if there's things that you would change out personally then do let us know what you would change out and why as for the stock intel cooler it is okay in games and but if you're doing heavy work on this and you're going for say 32 or 64 gigabytes of ram with the 12 400 f would highly recommend changing the cooler over and also if you had a bit more money i would suggest perhaps just getting an m.2 ssd one or two terabytes as they are pretty cheap nowadays and then just getting rid of the drives all together so that'd be the two things i would change if i had a bit more money but of course i do like to keep it on a budget i do like to give you guys choices as well especially if you're just a gamer and you're getting into it this build will be really good anyhow guys do drop us a comment down below love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from marcus salangi and they asked do you ever flash bios to newest when you get these old things to work and they're talking about the previous video that we did the 100 flip up challenge which is an exciting new series it's definitely going to deliver this year i'm going to make sure of that and i'll put the link to that video up here but this in this series we got the motherboard which was just absolutely filthy we got this to work again and so would i reflash the bios on this motherboard even though i didn't in that video and the answer is yes definitely yes on older parts it's definitely worth reflashing the bios just to get it up to date where in the past i have had experience with certain motherboards and a thing that i personally think is called bit rot and that's where the bias just needs to be reflashed because over time the integrity of the data on the bass chip itself has rotted away so i definitely do recommend re-flashing the bias but of course before you do that do make sure the computer is in the bios and it's been running for a few minutes and it's not going to crash when you do that bios update i hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you joined that content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Laughter] uh
