in today's video we are going to be
talking about enthusiast tech prices and from here on
in which way are they going to go now a few
months ago we talked about gpu prices going up and i could see some
trends already developing as well as the actual just pc parts in
general related to this particular thing going
on in the world right now and looking back we did give out some
very solid buying advice here at tech yes city
and hopefully you guys during this period didn't get
ripped off when it came to buying pc parts but what is going to happen from
here on in well i'll do my best to see what's going on right now
and make some observations and see if we can identify that trend
which is very well indeed your friend but sometimes it
might not be your friend if that's not the trend you're hoping for
so straight away gpu (graphics card) prices they're pretty bad and they're
probably going to remain relatively bad and the reason for that is
because we've got now the used market is a big factor when it comes to building
pcs a lot of people weigh in the price of a
used pc and then maybe just slapping a
graphics card in it and getting really good price
performance but basically when it comes to building
a new pc no one's going to go out and build a new pc and then slap a really
old graphics card in it or maybe very few percentage versus the
amount of people that are doing the opposite
and so what we've got here in the pc world is pent-up demand for newer
graphics cards but still at the same time a lot of
people are using first second third fourth gen intel cpus some
people are using first gen ryzen stuff there is still a lot of demand for those
older used parts and so we've got that demand there we've
got demand for new cpus like ryzen 3rd gen now intel's 10th gen
and so when people are buying the new components they all want in general
the newer graphics cards and that is one trend that you'll see
so basically with gpu prices they're not going to get
magically better especially for the stuff that gamers want
and the gamers generally want 10 series and better
and on the amd side rx 470 and better and so you're going to see still a lot
of demand for gravis cars and with that the prices are going to remain
mediocre too bad and the thing with this advice is i'm basing this on
where i live at the moment in australia and more specifically
south east queensland but that being said it's still
australia is a competitive place for tech and it actually has quite a healthy
market when it comes to the supply of new pc parts and especially used pc
parts too but moving forward from here if you're
looking to build a new gaming pc in the next few months
it is going to be a lot easier than it was trying to build a gaming pc three
months ago when this stuff first started and the
reason being is now the supply chain is being alleviated a lot of supply has
been ramped up to accommodate this demand
but on the flip side of things what we've seen with demand is that at least
locally here demand has fallen off big time at least
compared to what it was three months ago so now you've got all
this supply coming through for power supplies cases
ssds ram and all that other good stuff that goes into a pc
but you don't have the demand there and so what this is going to cause naturally
is a drop in prices so if you are looking to build a pc in the next few
months especially brand new what you're going to see is decent
prices now start to come back into effect and some further good news
on top of this is that i'm already seeing this
with things like ssds and when you look at ssds the reason why you're seeing the
prices drop on ssds so quickly is that they're a lot quicker to ship in
internationally from places like china where they're made and because with ssds
and especially ddr3 and ddr4 memory for example
because they're going freighted by air they get to the destination a lot
quicker than buy a boat which is how a lot of cases and a lot of
power supplies are shipped internationally and so what
you're seeing with ssd and ram prices not only are they falling
but the production has ramped back up in the factories over in china
and you're also seeing because they're able to be shipped quickly you're seeing
this effect come into play sooner as opposed to
cases and power supplies which i feel will follow this trend
very soon in that they will also be back in stock and come down in prices
because the demand really there was this massive wave of demand
that already came through and i would put it down to roughly
double that of christmas that's what i felt it was here locally it was like
two christmases happening at once in the middle of april and may
and you left scratch in your head you're like what is going on i've never seen
anything like this in my life in terms of just demand for
tech products and we hit that big thing that you
always hear about in life and that is that there is
always a balance to everything in life so what we've seen with this demand
is and here's the balance right here you've seen the demand shoot over
and now the demand is starting to come back under the balance line
and so this is for enthusiast tech pcs and so what we're seeing right now
is this demand that's under what the supply is at so what's going to
happen now is it'll because it's becoming
and prices naturally become cheaper people then start going oh
it's so cheap to buy a new pc and then that balance starts
going back up to the equilibrium back again
so what i'm thinking you'll see with in general with tech prices say for
instance cpu ram and ssds i'm not sure about graphics cards so
don't hold me to my word on graphics cards what i'm seeing with the majority
of tech products is what you'll see in the next few months is
very cheap prices so what i feel going forward
is basically in the next few months it will be some of the best times to buy
and pick yourself up a bargain on new enthusiast tech products so now
that we've touched on the new market what about the used market and here's
one thing that i actively participate in i love flipping gaming pcs it's one of
the backbones here of the channel and i also
do a lot of stuff behind the scenes that i really enjoy
and so basically in a nutshell the used market is always going to have this
buffer between the new market so unfortunately
for used pc resellers it's going to go down with the prices of
new parts as well so during covert those new pc parts were
right up sky high same with the used pc prices everything
was going in sync and the same thing is going to happen
with used pcs going in the next few months so as much as i know a lot of you
guys out there love used price performance and even a
lot of you guys love reselling used pcs i mean whatever i don't mind being the
bearer of bad news because that's what this channel is built on it's always
built on just telling it how it is i'm not gonna hold back and say
oh it's gonna be okay guys it's gonna be awesome like yeah you're gonna keep
selling them use pcs like you did yesterday basically
i feel like the next few months are going to be some of the most competitive
months you'll ever see in your life and that's with that
balance that we talked about before so in the next few months you might only
make a couple of bucks or even break even on your gaming pcs
but that's just the nature of the beast so hopefully during that previous time
you sort of made a bit of a buffer to account for the bad times ahead
now there is of course that elephant in the room to talk about
and we're not talking about the guy who's two meters tall we're talking
about helicopter money and this came in during
the first wave when no one could go out and spend
that money on holidaying or they could go down to a place like
the cass but this time around at least in australia it's going to be different
where things have all opened up again and
people will get that money and they most likely won't spend it on a
gaming pc this time around but that being said it will be a healthy
bump in demand during the next month in
australia so if you're in a country that has this
helicopter money getting thrown around and you know the dates surrounding that
then i do suggest getting some gaming pcs ready especially
if you want to make a few bucks but after that i feel things will return
back to that downward trend so now we've laid all that news out on
the table if you guys enjoyed this video then be sure to hit that like button for
us and also let us know in the comment section below
are things a little bit different in your country because i am basing
today's predictions and news a lot on what i experience here in australia and
what i see and what i do when i talk to people at
retailers and also people who sell pcs locally here
so that's how i'm able to formulate my opinion though
i love reading each and every one of your opinions in the comment section
below so do make sure you drop a comment too
and now we've got the question of the day here which comes from
uh carlo sensei and they asked this question on this p106 graphics card
video that we did and they said what if i don't have
integrated video can i still make it work
and the answer to that is no you can't make that p106 work if you don't have
the integrated graphics because that's the port you have to use
because the p106 doesn't have a video out though i have heard of people
soldering on hdmi ports and getting them to work that
way so that may be something you want to look into
in terms of how the card stacks up with the latest drivers
i actually do have one still at the studio here so
maybe i can put it to the test and see if i can get it working with the latest
drivers and play warzone if you guys want to see
a video on that then make sure you let us know down below
and with that aside if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes
content and you want to see at the moment it drops
be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
