and we'll get back to english so here we are at tokyo tower with three brand new headsets coming out from corsair and this is the hs 55 stereo the hs65 surround and also the hs 80. now you're probably thinking these aren't on the shelves yet and that's what i was asking as well because i couldn't even get a sample of these there's only the displays at the moment so these are coming out sometime next month but they wanted to show them off in tokyo this month and i thought well i'm in japan so i'll come and take a look but not only that i'll also show all the details of these headsets and we'll go through them and look at the specs and we'll even do a microphone test and i'll give you guys my thoughts and opinions on the pricing versus the performance all in one video so let's go find out what is cracking with these new headsets welcome back to tech yes city and we've got the three headsets on display and i'm gonna go through my favorite first this is the hs55 stereo and you guys know why it's my favorite because it's got the best price and it's also coming in with such a comfortable feel now this is the white model on display here they do run the pleather on the ear cups as well as inside the headband and not only that they've got 50 mil drivers behind that on both sides left and right and you've got a microphone that is retractable so when you turn that up it'll actually mute the microphone for you so very handy feature you've also got your volume knob on the side there so you can change the volume on the fly they are a little bit flexible as well if you like flexible headphones and also the hs55 stereo that we have on display here i would say the clamping force is sort of a medium to lightweight so they're going to be very comfortable at least from what i was trying on here very comfortable headsets but we'll get on to the differences between the hs65 and the hs80 soon where i like the hs55 stereo because it's just that basic 3.5 mil connector you've got the microphone connection point there you've also got the headphone plug-in port there too just goes into your analog speaker out so you can run this on any of your motherboards or any of your own sound dac's amp solutions and it'll give you a really good sound and i actually quickly tested these on the computers here before because we're at this whole massive gaming center called uh red in tokyo tower and we trying this playing apex legends absolutely amazing sound quality coming out of the hs 55 stereo but if you guys know me i like when it comes to audio i like to hear it as close to the source as possible plus the manufacturer's flare on top so i don't do a whole lot of personal software myself so that's why the hs55s with that price point they're coming in around 8 000 yen a little bit under that and then in usd terms i guess with the current exchange rates that would be around 6 000 6 000 us dollars sorry 60 us dollars and plus the whatever the taxes are in your local area though we'll say at this price point it is hitting in hard you've got that two meter flexible rubber cable which will return to its original position it won't kink up which they've done their research on these headsets they feel really good and they're really comfortable and everything at least from the standpoint of looking at it now i don't see any flaws except for maybe one thing and that is that the hs 65 and the 55s don't have replaceable ear pads now we're done with the hs55 we're looking at the hs65 and this is pretty much identical to the hs 55 except on the side of the ear cups you've got sort of like a bit of a mesh see-through versus the hs 55s which just looks like it's closed off but i do think this really didn't make a difference to the sound quality at least when i tested both of them but you may be wondering well it's surround brian it's got to be better right and that's where it comes down to personal preference with the surround you will be paying a little bit more money but at the same time you will get this usb connector where you can plug in the two analog connectors and then plug that into your computer and then you can also connect that up to the iq software and so within the iq software you can then get the surround eq which goes out to the headphones but also you can then customize a different sort of eq to your headphones to whatever you like so that's the biggest difference between the hs65s and the hs55s is that you get the included usb adapter and in fact i just quickly tried testing the hs55 with the usb adapter from the hs65 and it recognized them as an hs65 then we're on to the last headset here and this is the hs 80s these are a usb connected headset so they won't need any on-board audio or they won't need a separate dac and amp solution so if you say for instance have really bad on-board audio from say an old motherboard or especially a laptop i know some of the laptops i've seen in the past they have terrible audio coming out of them then this might be the solution for you which just circumvents all that all together but also with the hs 80s you get a slightly better microphone plus you get all the benefits of the hs65 surround built in as well as hs55 so they're using all on these headsets they're using 50 mil drivers on both sides so nothing really changes there except there's also another feature with the hs 80s that you get and that is the ability to have a mic mute button on the side instead of retracing the mic up and down to mute it even though you obviously get the option to retrace the microphone on the hs 80s as well but the hs 80s uses a plush velvet sort of material on the ear cups and i am told that they have replaceable ear cups on the sides so you can replace them at a later date and also the headband itself is a bit different to the inside of the hs65s and the hs50s in that they've got that pleather bit inside and then you've also got the band on the hs 80s which just makes the comfort feel a little bit different but the good news is is that in terms of weight you probably want to know how much all these headsets weigh and they come in at under 300 grams for all uh three of them individually the hs65s and the hs55s being slightly lighter than the hs 80s and also we'll get onto a microphone test on the three different headsets right now to give you a feel of how they sound versus say the lavalier microphone that i'm using in this video so here is now a sound test of the corsair hs 55 microphone headset and let me know in the comments what do you guys think of the sound quality coming out of this microphone compared to say my lavalier microphone which is this one that we've been using for the whole video the next test we're running now is the hs65 and this one looks like it's got a very similar microphone i actually won't know until i get it back to the studio and listen to it via feedback so now we're on a test with the hs 80s and i'm actually on a computer with the usb plugged into the computer to test out this microphone and test that against the other two and of course back against the lavalier microphone so do let us know what you guys think of this microphone versus the other two as well i'll also even uh put some keyboard noise in the background clicky clicky clicky and there we have it guys for the three brand new headsets coming out from corsair i'll put some links in the description below if you want to know more about these also the analog hs 55 and hs 60s they use a splitter so you won't have to go buy your own splitter to split the four pin to the two three pin uh mic and headphone adapters which is always a common complaint especially if you're selling a gaming pc and someone wants to use that headphone or headset for say a traditional 3.5 mil or they want to use it on the playstation 5 or an xbox series x this always comes in handy to make sure you don't have any audio problems anyway guys with that aside do let us know in the comment section below what you think of these new headsets are you digging the looks and also do you want to get one for yourselves i'll try and organize with corsair perhaps a giveaway from some of these headsets for you guys so do stay tuned for that and as always if you've enjoyed this content and you watch till the end be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell for us maybe even in the future with some brand new corsair headsets on if you're a lucky winner and also for the question of the day sorry guys i'm out in tokyo at the moment i will be bringing the question of the day back in the next video so with that aside i'll see you in the next one peace out for now from japan bye [Music] you
