in 2021 the graphics card is now on the endangered species list facing extinction from cryptocurrency miners if you want to make one of these your pets then you unfortunately will be met with exorbitantly high prices from scalpers on ebay if you want to get one of these as your pets for cheap in 2021 what must you do let's discuss the gpu aka the gravis card in 2020 we saw the prices of graphics cards start slowly going up until the last month of the year in december where it just started getting ridiculous now we're in the new year for 2021 and this is meant to be the year that's pegged as things will get better but when we go and look on ebay and we go and look at our local markets and even retailers they're all sold out of graphics cards pretty much and in fact the prices are going up all around the world for these parts because they're in such high demand but we've already covered in the previous video where this extra demand is coming from and that is from a lot of it from crypto miners looking to cash in on the recent ethereum boom but besides that we're probably all wondering well if i'm just a gamer when can i actually buy one of these graphics cards let's take a look at three key factors as to when graphics cards might return to a more normal price today's video is brought to you by intel zeus and mwave bringing you the ultimate gaming pc at the thunderous core of this system is an intel core i7 10700 kf 8 and 16 threaded overclockable cpu that already goes to 5.1 gigahertz out of the box powered by the rog strix z490-g gaming wi-fi motherboard which helps you get the most out of your gaming pc with upgraded power delivery and optimized cooling for smooth fps and cool operating temperatures intelligent controls let you manage overclocking cooling and networking settings easily giving you everything you need to harness the full potential of your build for top tier gaming performance links in description below if you're interested in getting a pc like this let's try and give you guys some answers because if you're like me you're probably a bit anxious about this whole situation because i love looking at prices and price performance within computers and the price performance previously in the past to what we're getting right now is a lot better in the past that is right now it's abysmal price performance especially on one front and that's the graphics card now the first reason and this reason right now is we're going to go into this a little bit more because there's actually like three little spirals from this first reason that is demand for gpus now the first and obvious one is uh the demand from the covered situation where we've seen with uh covet 19 we've seen everyone pretty much staying indoors a lot more than they otherwise would and since then international flights for example they've pretty much stepped down a lot where it went from a projected 4.7 billion people flying every year down to uh 1.7 billion people so the amount of people traveling is a lot less and with that of course a lot of people staying indoors is a lot higher and so the demand for things like a graphics card like a tv like all those communication devices like webcams for example they've all gone through the roof and now this is one thing that that artificial demand that doesn't look like it's going away anytime quickly where we've seen with the flights for example in australia there's a company called qantas they're an airliner they've said from 2021 july they're going to be reopening international flights so that's kind of like an optimistic look on when international travel will kind of start up for australia i'm hoping that is the case where some people are saying oh it's too soon to be making these kinds of promises but at least in ways it's kind of like an optimistic look on when um a lot of us could get back to more sense of a normal life or at least what we're used to previous uh covered conditions so then we've got the second reason within the first reason and that is uh of course the actual demand on the cards themselves so we've seen a shift over the last couple of years and it's been getting more and more where people are coming over from console gaming to pc gaming and we've seen this with games like fortnite especially that's been a huge catalyst for the reason why people are jumping over to pc and now within that we've got that second wave of demand because more people want to jump on pc they're going to want to get a better graphics card and ultimately get a better experience but the funny thing is about that the ironic thing is the ps5 and also the xbox series x have just been released and they're suffering uh big supply issues just like pc parts or especially graphics cards in general now the demand on gpus you're probably wondering why just the demand on gpus why isn't the demand on say cpus not as bad or ssds or ram and that's because the used market is definitely helping supplement that and it's taking care of that and a lot of people are reusing older pcs and just putting newer graphics cards in and that is definitely helping alleviate the situation on other parts so in ways i guess i'm kind of thankful that at least all the parts for pcs haven't gone up in price it's just the gpus though now the third reason within this first category of demand is the fact that the rtx 3000 for example and also the rx 6000 series from both nvidia and amd they're providing really big gains and if you look at say a 6800 xt or a rtx 3060 ti for example these cards are giving very solid not just performance in that higher end a gaming realm they're also giving pretty solid value for money and that's one thing that typically hasn't been in the high end before or at least uh in the upper mid range and so a 400 card or a card if you can get it at msrp of 400 bucks that's really in offering pretty solid value to the point where demand for that card is a lot higher than it otherwise would be say for instance rtx 2000 series cards they weren't offering anywhere near the value that the rtx 3000 series cards are offering same with in ways the 5700 xt versus the 6800 xt i mean it's nearly pretty much double the performance or over double the performance of the 6800 xt versus 5700xt but the price isn't double at msrp as opposed to that 5700 xt so that's one way of looking at things too so we've seen better products being released we've seen pretty much gamers coming to pc versus console and then we've also seen uh covered which is just making the demand at an all-time peak high so there's that first whole world of demand out the way and if you guys are enjoying this new background here as well let me know because i repainted the whole setup here where it used to be like a dark red i was kind of like man with all this anxiety and stuff going on with the pc market i kind of gotta at least focus on all the other things that i can make um potentially more positive and more vibrant and so that's what i'm trying to do here with this whole setup so hopefully if you guys are enjoying this one then be sure to let us know in the comments section below if you like this new setup here which i've also added a bit more rgb in but let's go into this uh second world here where i've made a heap of points here um and that is called the crypto boom where we're looking at ethereum mainly being the culprit now we did make a video on this talking about uh mainly how to deal with this whole crypto boom and how you can get a graphics card that isn't being targeted by miners so much as opposed to what the miners are actually targeting i'll put the link up here where it's mainly the four gigabyte cards if you can find them they're going to offer i guess not as big as a premium as say a 3060 ti where people are scalping that on ebay and they're giving you hard value for money based on what we've seen with the msrps but at least if you're paying an absolute premium of say 40 on an rx 570 where it used to be 80 now it's 120 versus say a 30 60 ti being 400 now it's like 650 absolute terms we're paying 40 dollars versus 250 so really we're getting a lot better percentage in terms of the forty dollars versus two hundred fifty dollars so i'm trying to help you guys out here with a little bit of math on what the best course of action to take is through this roller coaster and so that's just my thoughts on that but we're seeing with crypto essentially what's happening is ethereum mainly it's an asic resistant cryptocurrency where people are otherwise using what would typically be intended for gaming or the gaming graphics cards and they're using them for mining and the problem here is it's not just uh mom and dad's or average guys like you and me going out and buying a couple maybe three or four even or maybe 10. it's actual corporations and people with big pockets who are going out and spending a lot of money and making massive mining farms and so when they do that they're taking a lot of gpus off the shelves that otherwise would go to gamers and they're using them just for simply making profits and this is going to tie in perfectly uh with the next section that we're going to talk about soon because i believe reason 2 and reason 3 are going hand in hand here and creating much more of a bloated market than we otherwise would get if we didn't have reason three but uh one thing i will say about this is this crypto boom will it go bust in the next six months and this time around it feels like it's a lot different than it was in 2018 like in 2018 i was confident that it was going to go down and i was telling people on my channel look sell your crypto now this time around i just i don't know the variables i'm not used to them i haven't seen them before i don't think we've ever seen a bubble or a market like this and would you even call it a bubble because this time around we've got really poor economic conditions worldwide yet we're seeing the highest levels we've seen in terms of stock valuations we're seeing governments just handing out money despite stock valuations being super high the way the economy is being handled this time i have no idea how to interpret it as opposed to 2018 where i just saw okay a lot of people are getting into crypto it's going to be simply a boom and bust cycle and prices will drop and naturally gpu prices will drop with that because the demand for gpus versus crypto will go down too and so lo and behold in 2018 things did come crashing down and rx 570s 470s 480s all those cars that were used for crypto just flooded the market even gtx 1070s 1060s it was just a flood of gpus on the market this time around it feels like this run could as opposed to crashing in 2018 it could crash a lot more slower and that would make it really a crash would it in turns it could just go down slowly as people mine up and sell crypto or it could if the government slowly put the brakes on stimulus it could go down slowly as opposed to crashing and i mean on that note of gravis cards the funny thing about this was i'll never forget 2017 the end of that and the start of 2018. i had a vega 56 in a gaming pc and i was putting the car i think i put the gaming pc up for sale for it was like 1400 aussie dollars or something which at the time would have been maybe a thousand usd or something like that and um someone sent me a message and they said uh look i'll give you a thousand bucks for your vega 56 just pull it out and give it straight to me and i was like i was scratching my head i'm like wow that's a lot just for a gpu so i just quickly took the gpu out and sold it to the guy and never heard back from him again but that was kind of like the crazy demand for crypto at that time where people were just messaging people with gaming pcs and just paying stupid amounts of money for those graphics cards and lo and behold i mean in hindsight i'm guessing a lot of people that were in that crypto boom went bust just with the bus came around so do remember this and don't forget this one thing i'll tell you guys about all this crypto stuff and all these prices is there's always a loser for every winner and don't forget that and someone wins big say for instance someone bought a bitcoin at a hundred bucks and they sold it for fifty thousand dollars uh that's australian i think it went up to like forty thousand us or something so if they did that they took thirty nine thousand dollars off someone else or thirty nine thousand nine hundred dollars and so that money has come from somewhere and now people are essentially buying that crypto based on the fact that someone else is going to buy it later on for a higher price now if that higher price dictates the value of a us dollar for example or an aussie dollar that remains to be seen where that value will go so that's the hardest part people are pretty much buying these cryptocurrencies directly based on the fact that they think that the value of the dollar essentially will uh devalue faster than their price of the bitcoin or the cryptocurrency they're holding will outpace that so that's the trade-off that they're making and it's a logical one if governments keep doing and then we're going to segue into the third reason here printing money and that's where the money printer goes bro in australia alone the government in 2020 i believe they printed over 10 percent of gdp and that's gross domestic product that's all money changing hands and exchanges in 2020 the government accounted for over 10 of that it's a record in history for our country and since the a lot of that money was borrowed from the federal reserve or the australian federal reserve bank of australia that money essentially is owned by the government because the government owns the federal reserve banks they're essentially borrowing themselves money and so this is this is one of the complications that people are coming into now is where is this money going now historically if we look back to say 1871 and france there was a stimulus that went through the economy and a lot of that money went to miners of silver and gold first and so they were the people who benefited a lot more than others in society because they got the money first now in 2020 and 2021 we know that the money is going mainly to institutional banks first and a lot of other big players in the money market and so since they're getting the money first they have an advantage and that's why in turn i believe now you're seeing the prices of crypto go up as well as stock markets because these two investment vehicles are heavily favored by those who are receiving this money first now you may be wondering the last point here and that is what's printing money from government's got to do with gpu prices directly brian and this is where the part of cheaper money comes into effect essentially when governments are creating more and more money than they've ever created in history out of essentially thin air that's flowing into the economy one way or the other and the argument here is the easier that money flows in the easier prices of things will go up including graphics cards and especially gravis guards since they are a very highly desired product for people right now due to demand and the code 19 factors surrounding what's going on in the world right now and so there it all is out on the table for you guys i like to always be straight up with you guys in terms of my recommendations and what i information i provide here at tech yes city and this one just really does uh bother me like it's never bothered me before in the history of my life actually to the point where i just don't know exactly how this is going to pan out because there's two sides of the fence and the scary thing was before all this uh 2020 stuff went down there was a signs of deflation happening in the economies worldwide this wasn't just exclusive to america was in australia and all sort of countries were following what japan experienced post 1989 and so is this a new trend right are we looking at trends here because i do like to look at trends and what we see is is that perhaps over the last 100 years people are comfortable with a car they're comfortable driving so cars are sort of a staple in our economy people are happy with a house of a certain size people are happy with certain diets and certain ways of living that perhaps they don't want to progress like gdp and economic growth models would suggest and so that's maybe something that the i guess governments and also planners of financial institutions haven't really thought about in depth because when you look at those trends you look at what's going on printing money isn't the solution to everything and so essentially when we look at what's going on around the world and we look at prices of commodities as well metals they're all going up in price we can then say okay is these gpu prices the artificial high gpu prices that we're seeing are they here to stay and how long are they here to stay for and my gut says that unfortunately as long as the in prices of pretty much everything is artificially high right now is that going to transverse into a new norm is government spending and stimulus going to catch up to those new norm prices and that's one thing you just can't predict if i had a crystal ball i'd tell you guys straight out but for what it stands this time around is is a terms to previous years this time around this one really bothers me as to the future of i guess gpu prices in general too because we've seen the likes of a zeus for example they've said that they're raising prices of components not just gpus but other things like motherboards indefinitely due to higher taxes being imposed on american imports but i believe there's other factors as well rising costs of materials and everything else which does affect businesses and then does push up prices so it's all a cycle that's linked to one another and in the end will spell higher prices of gpus for you and i and so with the gpu prices and making a prediction this time around i can say that it's only going to deal down the gpu prices that is when this demand goes down and also the demand that's being driven by cryptocurrency as well as government stimulus and so all these three factors that we talked about here today only when they go down can we see prices of gpus go down and so how long that's going to stay for i mean look it could be six months before we realistically see uh prices of gpus come back to what would be considered normal compared to uh previous years pre-2020 though on the bright side we can hope for a crypto bus fingers crossed that a crypto bus comes and if that comes we could see a flood of gpus on the market again just like we did in 2018 anyhow hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to slap that like button for us also if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell because we are back in action here i've got this whole new setup i've done this uh background right here this backdrop i've reinvigorated it i've also added rgb to my main setup with like opal acrylic panels i've also made two new setups for filming b-roll so even though i had a big break and i scheduled out videos for you guys i have been busy kind of uh making a new revamp for 2021 where the good news is out of all this is that we're going to be going anti-crypto in what we build in terms of pcs because one thing's for sure as we said before the crypto mining is the way to get around it is to pay the least premium we have to if you want a pc game at the moment and so that is looking like four gigabytes of vram and under and you just have to make those sacrifices that is if you don't want to get ripped off anyhow i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon the next one's going to be pretty spicy so stay tuned and peace out for now bye [Music]
