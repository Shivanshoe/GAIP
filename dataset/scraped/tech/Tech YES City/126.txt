if you are looking to build an i9 pc for under 
1 000 then today's build is going to serve   as i guess a bit of excitement considering all 
the rip-off prices that we're seeing in the new   market right now especially when it comes to 
graphics cards looking at this titan x this is   going to be one of the stars of the show today 
where i got this for 350 aussie dollars while i   was deal hunting now it always didn't look this 
good i've had to clean this thing up and spend a   bit of time giving it some tender loving care aka 
tech yes loving then there's the motherboard right   here gigabyte z370 got this used off ebay for 
100 aussie dollars which makes it around 75 usd   right inside that is an i9 99 80 hk laptop cpu 
equivalent where it's kind of a weird thing but   you can get these for around 150 off of aliexpress 
where they've already got an adapter which   then you have to update the bios on a particular 
motherboard i'll put some links in the description   below but after you do this you essentially have 
eight cores 16 threads with all the latest and   greatest features that you would even get on 
something like a 9900k which costs a lot more   than this cpu right here then for the memory we're 
using 32 gigabytes of generic stuff we're going to   be spending a little bit of time trying to clock 
this as high as we can but since we're dealing   with a laptop cpu the speeds don't go that high 
this would be the only drawback of today's build   but then for storage we've got a three terabyte 
hard drive you can pick these up if you look   hard enough on the used market for about 30 usd i 
managed to pull this out of a previous build that   came in that i've already flipped for the uh pc 
ultra clean series i'll put the link up here if   you want to see that then we've got an ssd right 
here 480 gigabytes which is going to serve as our   main boot drive and scratch drive since today's pc 
will not only hopefully be a really good gaming pc   but it's also going to serve as an awesome video 
editing pc too then we got the power supply picked   this up for 50 aussie dollars locally here top 
power 750 watt gold rated power supply modular and   this thing was pretty much like brand new i didn't 
really need to clean it up that much besides   some data backing but i'll quickly show you some 
b-roll of how that went down together with this   motherboard right here which was actually a little 
bit dirty but that came up now like brand new then   the last two components right here to talk about 
is this corsair h115i cooler this is not the rgb   stuff this is the og h-159 with the massive thick 
tubes now we did have to clean this up we got this   for 50 aussie dollars but it came in a little 
bit scuffed where all these tubes had the uh   i like to call it the wig maker we took off the 
wig maker and now it looks a lot more cleaner and   then lastly for the case we're putting in the 
only brand new part in today's build and that   is a gamdius rgb tower which we paid 89 aussie 
dollars for and with that all aside let's put   this thing together and see what we come up with 
do you feel like this when you see this well if so   you can get rid of that windows activation message 
with today's video sponsor scd keys for as little   as 12 usd after you use that coupon bftyc you can 
get activated today links in description below there is the pc and here is my cup of tea 
which i am going to raise a toast to you guys   and give you a cheers this one's got cinnamon 
and honey in it and that's how i like my tea and   how i like my pcs is just what we've got right 
here we've got a good amount of rgb well i mean   i like rgb i don't love it but you need rgb in a 
pc nowadays especially if you want to have some   street cred amongst the other fellow pc gamers 
but for me most importantly especially if i want   to re-flip this thing i'm definitely going to need 
rgb now we've got the three ring fans at the front   and we can change the colors of those through 
different modes rgb and we've got this subtle   g-force gtx glow coming in which i've matched it 
to the green fans because hopefully when we go to   resell this thing some nvidia fanboy comes along 
and they're just going to fall in love with it but   i mean what we've got right here all 
the used parts they ended up working   absolutely fine this build is really quiet at 
least for now i haven't stress tested it just   yet but what we're going to do from here on in is 
we're going to be running a couple of benchmarks   to compare it to the recent rtx 3060 build that 
i built here and that one was coming in around   2400 aussie dollars this one coming just a 
little bit over a thousand aussie dollars   i want to compare the performance numbers and 
show you guys what used price performance can   do especially if you're on a budget but you 
still want to get rgb bling and you still   want to have something that's pretty contemporary 
and it's going to do a good job let's get into it   and after all the benchmarking is done the numbers 
are in some people probably going to find the   remote and the rgb the most interesting thing but 
for me and a lot of others the performance numbers   are going to be the best thing going so 
what we got right here was when we loaded up   dota 2 i was finding that the performance was very 
similar to the rtx 3060 build that we recently did   in fact the 1080p numbers and the 1440p 
numbers were slightly better than the 11400f   build with the 3060 the rtx 360. and it was only 
a slight difference but it goes to show the i9   even the laptop version that we used in today's 
build is doing a little bit better than the 11400f   i'd say mainly due to its higher clock speeds this 
thing was clocking in at 4.5 gigahertz now you can   get a little bit higher but since i'm going to 
be re-flipping this pc 4.5 gigahertz is going   to be a safe level versus the power consumed now 
quickly interluding with the power consumption   we were getting up to around 370 watts from the 
walls so that gold rated power supply is helping   bring down those numbers slightly but overall the 
i9 and this titan x isn't juicing a whole lot of   power when we're gaming and we did test this in 
cyberpunk where the gpu is getting maxed out and   the cpu is kind of chugging along and burning up a 
bit of power though another thing to look at just   besides power consumption is the temperatures and 
they were really well controlled where that h115i   of course even though it's one of the earlier 
editions without all those fancy improvements   it still kept that cpu under 70 degrees it did 
spike on some of the cores to 70 degrees but this   is direct die cooling with this i9 laptop part but 
i thought it did a phenomenal job especially since   all we paid for it was 50 aussie dollars and then 
we're moving down now to that titan x where this   was kind of the earlier models where they went 
for the fancy look on that reference edition   i don't know if they called it the founders 
edition just yet with the titan x but it did   perform pretty poorly in my opinion it was going 
to uh 83 degrees and this is in a 23c environment   but they did keep the noise profile really low and 
this is pretty much the constant noise that you're   going to hear even when you're gaming so if you 
do get an older titan card whether it's a titan   or a titan x or titan xp i would look at maybe 
perhaps tuning a custom fan profile to bring down   those temperatures so continue on with those dota 
2 numbers we've got a victory at 1080p and 1440p   but setting things up to 4k was when we're getting 
much more gpu bound especially in dota 2 and this   is where that 60 rig was getting around 120 fps 
with this uh right here in a really intensive sort   of match this is where i'm starting to benchmark 
now in dota 2 because that's what you guys request   we were getting around 105 average fps so it was a 
little bit behind the rtx 3060 but when we look at   the price of a new rtx 3060 at least in australia 
they're going for around thousand aussie dollars   off the shelves this coming at 350 dollars is 
certainly offering really good price performance   though the next game we're going to pull up here 
is cyberpunk where this kind of paints a bit of   a different story but it goes to show that if the 
game manufacturers in conjunction with nvidia do   focus on optimizing for only their newer cards 
and not the older cards and this is where in   1080p we're getting around 57 average fps and this 
was on the low settings preset and then stepping   things up to medium we were getting in the 40s and 
then moving on to high it was 39 and then going to   ultra was 32 so it was significantly lower than 
the 30 60 and of course we didn't have any of   the other features like dlss or ray tracing though 
in the case of cyberpunk if i wanted to play this   game they're still going to give out a playable 
experience at low settings it's just a shame that   we don't get more optimizations from nvidia with 
this game for the older hardware anyway the last   benchmark to go over is one that we can all load 
up and all compare our numbers and that is the   fire strike benchmark this is the og fire strike 
which i like to definitely calculate in my head   when i'm buying things for price performance 
so i look at the graphics score on the physics   score here as it's a very reliable indicator and 
it doesn't include all the latest stuff like ray   tracing in it or newer features but it does give 
you that raw performance figure to see how good   the raw value is on a particular card and here's 
where on the graphics score we're getting over 17   000 and then on the cpu score the physics score 
this was very impressive coming over 21 000.   if you can get a cheap z370 i'd go for the 
gigabyte boards because they're easy to sort   of put the custom bios in then getting one of 
these i9s off aliexpress is a really good option   and a really good path to consider if you want 
to get eight core 16 threads that's very relevant   and can definitely give you a good gaming 
experience now in terms of the memory we   managed to tune that to 2 900 megahertz and that 
was across four sticks and we got that at cl 16.   so the memory wasn't that great but the i9 the 
engineering samples and the laptop cpus that   are converted to desktops they to begin with they 
can't really extract high memory clocks so i think   matching that with budget memory on a budget z370 
does really get the most out of this whole combo   and in the end we're left with a pc that looks 
really nice and it does have that performance   to match so do let us know in the comment section 
below what you're thinking about this build right   here i am definitely digging the gambias cases 
even though they're a little bit more pricey   than say the 50 rgb bangers that i'm rolling 
around here at tech yeah city they do definitely   look like you're getting a bit more worth when 
it comes to the final product anyhow guys i hope   you enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to 
smash that like button also i'll put some links   in the description below for some of the 
stuff that you can easily get off the internet   i think the hardest part of today's build is 
going to be that graphics card at least while the   crypto profitability is still pretty high that's 
going to be pretty much the sole factor dictating   the prices of gpus so when you look at that 
profitability and it's still pretty high on the   newer graphics cards that's pretty much going to 
span through the whole industry where people are   going to keep buying up those graphics cards and 
putting them in mining benches and pressing play   and that's going to affect the prices for the 
gamers to want to pick them up at lower prices so   unfortunately the mining profitability is 
still high i'm hoping that it will come down   and significantly come down in the next month 
or two and i'm waiting for that but until then   i think picking up some of these older cards is 
a much better play especially when we look at   the price that i paid for this titan x versus 
say a new rtx 3060 and we just hold the line   don't buy them new gravis cars just let them sit 
there and the prices will come down and also on   that note if we do hold the line at some point 
the miners are going to run out of space where   they're then going to have to purchase more real 
estate more power boards more this more that and   perhaps they'll run out of juice faster than 
the profitabilities will sink who knows though   i do long for that day and i will catch you guys 
in another tech video very soon if you've stayed   this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content 
then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell   to get the videos as soon as they drop and i'll 
see you in the next one peace out for now bye you
