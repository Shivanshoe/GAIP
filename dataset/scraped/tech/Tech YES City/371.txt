over the last few months graphics card prices have increased both on the use and the new market over a few months ago we made a video talking about some of those initial trends that were coming into play and why I thought GPU prices were going to go up back then but fast forward a few months later and we've seen prices increase but a lot of people are messaging me lately asking if prices are going to increase yet again and now I've spoken to a few industry reps I've even asked Nvidia directly and let's find out all the factors of play and whether I think GPU prices are yet again going to possibly increase with the upcoming launch of Intel's new 10th gen desktop CPUs brings yet another motherboard release and if you're after the best c4 90 out there in the market then as rocks velocity' phantom gaming has you covered with 12 phase BRM which is actively cooled by three separate fans as well as having 2.5 Gigabit LAN PCIe 4.0 for your grabs guard and nvme drives links in description below to find out more so these problems with graphics card prices stemmed before even 2020 began where we saw articles coming out warning of potential price increases in GPUs themselves were all circulated around GDD are six memory and basically Nvidia was switching their whole lineup over to GT r6 AMD as well and then of course we had the new pressure being brought in by the upcoming consoles which are going to use G DDR six exclusively so we've got this massive pent up demand for GR six video memory before CV itself even broke out worldwide now after this we saw of course in February and massive shutdown of factories in China and this had ongoing effects to supply especially in electronics for instance if we look at camera shipments they drop the most out of basically any electronic gear that I know however in terms of GPUs shipments and this is where I'm talking to people inside the industry whether it be reps at companies and also retails who I'm not going to name because they want to remain anonymous but what I'm hearing is that there's actually no issues in terms of supply lanes on GPUs except for one rep that did tell me that 20 atti shipments were slowing down quite a bit and that's of course possibly due to the upcoming r-tx 3000 series however do keep this in mind what I've also heard from retailers is that GPU demand is up through the roof and we could potentially see things like our TX 2060 Super's increase yet again another 20% so why is all this happening exactly well it has to do with not only that supply drop that we talked about happening in February but it also has to do with the massive and I mean absolutely massive pent-up demand that's coming in to gaming PCs and everything associated with them what we're seeing worldwide is lockdowns everywhere and so with that we're seeing the demand for gaming pcs rise naturally for that but also on top of that we've seen what's known as helicopter money being thrown out across a lot of different economies for instance what we've seen in Australia is two separate payments of 750 dollars Aussie each and that money when we look at that is perfect for either a GPU upgrade over someone to go out and buy a gaming PC so the fact that a lot of these handouts match that of graphics card prices and gaming pcs makes that a natural pent-up demand where people are going to get that money and just go out and get something that they can enjoy here and now the further exacerbate the problem in 2020 global shipments of PCs themselves are actually already down 8% when we look at shipments from all the major suppliers like Lenovo Dell HP and then we compare that from 2019 to 2020 the shipments are down and this of course is directly related to C V and the shutting down of those factories so what we're seeing is when you have supply going down and demand up naturally you're going to see increases in prices now as for the news market what we've seen here especially with GT X 10 70s which is one of the most popular used graphics cards and even still is we've seen prices go for instance in Australia from 300 ozzie dollars to now the new norm of 400 ozzie dollars so that's a 33% increase in prices and there's still yet no end in sight for how much prices could rise yet again they're switching back to the new market we're seeing prices of 20 60 supers and 20 70 supers especially those two cards are going up in price quite a bit we've even seen cars like 16 50 supers go up in accordance to this same percentage roughly however those price increases may not look as big as some of the higher-end cards and that's mainly because the prices were cheap to begin with say for instance we have a price increase of 33% on $150 that then becomes $200 so it's 50 dollars in total value versus say $300 going up to $400 that's a total value of $100 essentially double the total value of a lower-end card and so on that I am going to provide a bit of a suggestion right here in the middle of the video and that is if you are looking to build a gaming PC right now in terms of value it would be a much better choice to go with entry or mid-level that hasn't been affected by that total value $50 saved is $50 made that's how economics works around here in tech yes City so with the rules of supply and demand dictating our graphics card prices there is of course always that willingness to pay as prices start to increase people are less willing to buy that particular pot because it's too high hence then the supply matches out the demand so what we're going to see is as prices increase less people will actually buy the PC parts in question so naturally what you may see is a new norm and that is people moving towards the entry level and mid-range gear so basically if you are very bored right now and you have to get a gaming PC or your old gaming PC is just not cutting it then you may wish to go get a mid-range gaming PC right now some of my favorite picks would be the rx 580 also the gtx 1650 super these cards will do a really good job of 1080p gaming and the good thing is on top of that is that motherboards and CPU prices especially ddr4 and SSDs those things haven't gone up at least as much as graphics cards have so if you want to enter the market you still got a good chance to do it right now so of course the big question that remains to be seen is if graphics card prices go up even more how much are they going to be set to go up by now I have been told here in Australia by retailers that graphics card prices could go up even by another 33 cent which is a very scary scenario how much of this is true I don't know take it with a grain of salt however one thing I can tell you is that I did ask in video directly about supply and they told me quite simply there are no issues with supply so for what it seems is it's just this massive pent-up demand at the moment which is increasing prices now I don't know exactly where you are in the world but at least where I am at the moment there are still lockdowns in place and that's still affecting supply for instance I live in a place called Queensland and we're locked with the borders to interstate and that's just over a half an hour drive from me so I can't even get across the border to the next state down which I've never seen in my life so basically with things being locked down still that is definitely going to affect supply especially when it comes to small businesses and their ability to supply especially use PC pots so for instance I for one have taken a big hit in terms of what I can source locally here for use PC prices and naturally of course that includes use grabbers cards though the last thing I'm going to point out there is that good old curveball you guys love it here when I throw in a curveball and that is if there was a supply issue from the likes of Nvidia or AMD they would not let any of this news come out it would be very tight-lipped and the reason being for that is something of that big of a scale of news has the ability to affect their stock prices which if we're looking at Nvidia stock price for example it's a two hundred and ninety four dollars it's pretty much up near the higher side of things so if there was news to get out like this then it could have a serious effect on investors and stock prices so that's just some food for thought before we close this video down though that being said do let us know in the comment section below what you think of GPU prices at the moment where you are in the world our GPU price is going up or are they going down love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which is a pretty interesting topic and it's a throwback to what we originally talked about over a year ago when we made a video on D ddr5 memory and the person says hb3 w they ask who else is here in 2020 waiting impatiently for DD five and 2022 and the interesting thing about this is I think ddr5 will actually come at the end of 2021 when Intel and AMD both introduced their next next-generation products and that of course is some fantastic news because it means good deals on Xen 3/10 and 9th gen Intel maybe I'm just thinking too far ahead here so to quickly recap this video I do feel like yes there are some strong indicators that GPU prices could go up even more and my advice personally would be if you want to get into PC gaming the best play at the moment would be to get into the entry or mid range and wait it out anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's
