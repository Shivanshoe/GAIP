intel have finally launched a mainstream gaming graphics card into the wild except they're only launching it in china and from what i gather the price is around 150 us dollars now for this price you get a card that does have an encoder and a decoder and it also has six gigabytes of vram it does require an eight pin power connector but upon looking online i managed to find one review from a chinese reviewer here on youtube and they did a pretty good job of breaking down everything you need to know about this gpu so in today's video we'll talk about why i think intel only decided to launch this in china and also talk about whether this card would be a good buy or not if you want to get yourself a cheap legit windows 10 pro key license then today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as 14 when you use that coupon code bftyc you can get windows activated right now link's in the description below so when it comes to intel's a380 graviscard the performance is similar to that of the gtx 1650 in a weird kind of way and that is it beats it in synthetic benchmarks so if we're looking at different 3d mark fire strike benchmark or time spy benchmarks you can see here it actually gains a comfortable lead over the gtx 1650 however when it comes to actual gaming that in my opinion does require a lot more driver optimizations this is where intel actually starts to fall behind and in fact it looks like they're falling behind in older apis as opposed to dx12 titles and so when we look at this cs go result right here you can see that the performance still has a lot more to be desired where games like this not only require the gpu brunt but of course require the driver optimizations and this is in fact where i think intel is having a really tough time is they're getting their drivers right but i think the market is going to go leaning on them i mean me personally i'm going lenient on them because nvidia and amd have been in this game for decades so they've had a long time to perfect not only their drivers on older titles and older apis they've also got very well oiled machines when it comes to producing new drivers and getting things right from the get-go so intel do have to play a lot of catch up against amd and nvidia when it comes to getting the drivers right however when we look at this card itself the power consumption is coming a little bit over a gtx 1650 and the card is being brought to market by a third party not intel directly though i have also seen some other comparisons being made here on youtube where the a380 is beating the gtx 1650 in almost every title but that seems to be a little bit weird because this person actually has the gpu on hand they're doing their tests so i'm more inclined to go with the original uh chinese reviewer who states that it's actually falling a little bit behind the gtx 1650 in general so people want to know then okay how will it perform versus the rx 6400 and the obvious answer is the rx 6400 will perform better in games than the a380 in its current state now what i'm curious to see is if intel will be getting more driver optimizations out asap to reverse these scores and then have say for instance in cs go have the a380 come out ahead of the gtx 1650 and also if we look at a game like dota 2 very popular multiplayer title the same reviewer had the gtx 1650 edging out the a380 so the performance is looking like intel do have to do a lot more work to get the full potential out of the a380 but then this leaves the question of okay why did they launch this card in china only i mean at 150 us dollars this actually doesn't seem like too bad of a buy in fact if prices are really bad on other graphics cards say for instance where you live a gtx 1650 brand you might be going for over 200 this could be a decent stop gap or a decent solution and this is where we relate back to those drivers where i know for a fact in australia if you buy a graphics card and the drivers don't perform as you would expect they would or they're not essentially as australian consumer law states fit for purpose then you are entitled to a refund this is the same laws in japan as well and i'm sure they would carry on in america and the uk i'm not entirely sure what consumer laws are like in china the last i heard they revamped them in 2013 but i would love to know if anyone out there is a chinese consumer on whether they could weigh in on if a bad driver experience could be clause for a refund because that in itself may be the biggest deciding factor as to why intel chose to launch the card only in china for example that's only one possible scenario another scenario would be that intel perhaps doesn't want their brand image with their graphics cards straight away to be in the shadows of nvidia and amd where i certainly think they'd want to make a bigger splash on the scene and perhaps even be in front in terms of price performance though in terms of me criticizing what we've currently got from intel i'm on the fence of okay let's see what they continue to bring to the market i'm not going to be too critical of them because it definitely looks like making proper drivers and optimizing them for games is a lot harder of a task than intel thought it would be and nvidia and amd do have decades of experience so i think as a tech enthusiast we can't see intel just jump straight into the gpu deep end and start competing on the high end with amd and nvidia i think that's something that's going to have to wait even a year or even two years for them to really play catch up with these drivers and also not only that they're now going to have to navigate with a massive flood of crypto gpus which is going to come to the market as well so after watching this reviewer i thought they actually nailed their review everything they stated in the review was pretty much what i agreed with is that i too feel like intel's launching their gpu at perhaps one of the worst times in the market in general where cryptocurrencies on the way down miners are dumping their old cards which is really going to create competition in itself for people wanting to buy a new graphics card because why go out and buy an rx 6700 xt for nearly 500 when you can go get one for nearly three hundred dollars so that is going to bring a lot of pressure to not only the new gpus but also all the current existing used gpus on the market so in terms of another player coming into the game very welcome addition but in terms of the timing i feel like it's one of the worst for intel in terms of getting into this market though i am very curious to see what they can do with the a380 i mean they've definitely hit the mark right in terms of not gimping the card it's got pci express 4.0 x8 which will still run absolutely fine on pci express 2 and 3 they've also got the encoder and the decoder 6 gigabytes of vram feels like it's very balanced for a card at 1080p on the entry level of a hundred and fifty dollars so to wrap up my thoughts and conclude the a380 at its current point in time i feel like for the specifications versus the price it's actually decent it's not the best we've seen certainly but it's far from the worst though the drivers do leave something to be desired and i feel like intel definitely know that so they're going to have to play catch up in order to get at least a bit of market share from amd and nvidia mainly nvidia who currently has a really dominant market share on the steam surveys but also when we look at the raw sales numbers which we've broken down in a previous live stream they're definitely running ahead of the race and i'd love it if amd and intel could start to take that market share away which of course brings in better competition and ultimately better choice for the consumer so in terms of getting my hands on one few you guys have asked me if i could get one and take a look at it i'll see what i can do but i'm actually very curious to get one perhaps in a month or two months and then test it a long time to see how those drivers improve over the next few months i think that's the most interesting thing that will come out of the a380 review to see if intel's really working their hardest to get those numbers up in games how and when they can do this i hope they do it sooner than later and do let us know in the comment section below what you think of this launch and also what you think of the price and the specs love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from zero rsa got an i3 7100 with a gigabyte mds2 mini itx all for a hundred dollars good deal or nah and i'm gonna go with the gnar on that one because it's i3 two course four threads and the gigabyte motherboard is an entry level motherboard the ds2 it's a pretty inexpensive motherboard so i wouldn't be paying 100 usd and even 100 aussie dollars for that combo i'd at least be trying to get a 4 core 8 threaded cpu in that budget with the motherboard hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes
