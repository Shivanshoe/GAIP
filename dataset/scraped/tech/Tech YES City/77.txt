today we've got the final z690 motherboard review on the channel and it is the most expensive motherboard for z690 i've had come through this is the asrock tai chi and this is coming in at a whopping 509 us dollars so the z690e strix gaming and the aorus master they were coming in around 500 this one's taking it a step higher with another 100 usd slapped on top now for the aussie pricing i haven't got a price in for this board yet but i must say before we move on with the review i don't know about you guys but i remember when x370 dropped and the tai chi was released back with the first ryzen cpus and that was a phenomenal board and that tai chi motherboard was coming in the 200 region it just seems like these z6 90 boards in general have really put a new level of higher pricing one which is very hard to stomach i'm sure for a lot of enthusiasts though at 590 usd you'd probably expect this thing to not only cook your breakfast but also clean the toilets as well when you wake up in the morning but unfortunately it doesn't clean the toilets and it might cook your breakfast if you want to use the 12 900k with no cooler on top that might do a good job of that because it can go close to 100 degrees if you overclock it high enough but let's get on with the good and then the mediocre and there isn't really anything bad with this motherboard but first of all the good the vrm we've got a 20 phase 19 plus one solution and this is coming in with 105 amp raa mosfets and 90 amp chokes as well as an raa digital pwm controller and out of the box this took the i9 12 900 k to around 4.9 to 5 gigahertz it was hovering in between those levels and did score out a pretty good score on cinebench it was also using around 235 watts out of the box and at these levels it did beat the aorus master out of the box but it did lose only by a couple of watts to the 690e strix gaming but when it came to overclocking it did score the best score in terms of cinebench i got over 29k points and this was at 5.1 gigahertz where it was juicing a little over 260 watts but pulling up the vrm temperatures we got a heat sink temperature of 47 degrees and then a pcb temperature of 66 degrees and the lower temperatures on the heatsink and ultimately the pcb at 25 degrees ambient is mainly due to the fact that it has an active cooling solution on the heatsink and this does help keep the temperatures lower than the other higher end boards that we have taken a look at here and then continuing on with temperatures for the m.2 slot we've got an mp600 pca 4x4 scoring 50 degrees in software and then 45 on the pcb and then 41 on the heatsink so no problems there the speeds are absolutely fine though there's only three m.2 slots on this board and two of those are pca four by four and then the other one is pca three by two so you will get lower speeds even if you have a pca three device on the bottom slot as opposed to the competing boards around this price range in the urs master that had five m.2 slots and the strix had four and they were all pcie four by four but asrock decided to cut down on the m.2 lanes and drive that towards a pca 5.0 x8 on the second x16 slot and then at top of course you get that pca 5 x 16 slot and then down the bottom you've got a pca 4x4 even though it looks like a 16x slot then in the middle you've got a 1x slot so asrock have decided to do a trade-off when it comes to the pcie configuration and do let us know in the comments so you think this is a better design or a worse design than the aorus and rog solutions they're moving through the onboard audio here's where we've got the realtek 1220 and featuring the sabre ess9218 dac coupling that down with wema audio capacitors and here's where we saw a frequency response curve pretty much rivaling that of the aorus master scoring incredible results where you've only got a minus 1.5 decibel drop off from 10 hertz and under and then after that pretty much a flat frequency response curve so you get a really rich listening experience off the onboard audio then when it came to the crosstalk we had the rear port scoring minus 87 decibels and then the front port scoring minus 90. so you will want to use the front port just for a better listening experience especially since the rear port when you take the volume over 91 to 100 it does then start to bump up and have a bit of leakage coming through from left and right so the front didn't have this problem you could take it all the way up to a volume of a hundred then moving on to the mic import they haven't used noise suppression there will be noise creeping in once you go over a volume level of 50 at plus 30 db so i would keep this at volume level 50 plus 30 db and under if you wanted to reliably use it for streaming and talking to people with the mic import but now we're moving on to the rear input and output here is where i'm going to critique asrock certainly in the number of usb type a's provided where there's only six ports in total two of those of course featuring their lightning game ports which separates the usb ports individually and does pull them higher than the standard 125 hertz i would like to see at least eight on the rear here and they've also got two type c's which support thunderbolt 4 then you've got a one gig intel i219v nick as well as an additional 2.5 g neck and then wi-fi 6e and then a bios flashback button the audio ports are also located in the middle of the board and they do have their own individual led colors that light up speaking of rgb you get diffused lighting on the side of the board underneath and then underneath the chipset hub heatsink and then also on the main vrm heatsink which also has a fancy taichi clock that moves whenever the cpu varies in its speeds though going over the layout of the board here's where i feel azeroth have done the best job out of the high-end motherboard makers where they've located the power and reset button down the bottom as well as your clear cmos and your bios decode led readout then you've also got nine pwm fan handles you can control these in the bios but then you've got two usb 3 outs one being a right angle one being a straight angle and then of course your type c out at the front then there's four rgb headers two up the top two down the bottom and only one of them is the 12 volt then the rest are addressable rgb where the 12 volt is located down the bottom then for the 5 volt addressable rgb you can control this in the bios and here is where we're going to give asrock props over all the other motherboard manufacturers because i feel like they do the best job when it comes to getting a bios right not only can you control that rgb with 13 different patterns in the bios itself so you don't need to install bloatware and windows but then you've also got the ability to update your bias fly internet flash and the great thing about this was it did give out a warning and i will interlude here and say if you're installing windows 11 on a z690 then i would like if especially if you're like me and you do change drives and use different equipment on your motherboard manage to do a windows 10 install and then put the windows wim file on the windows 10 installer and then turn off trusted computing as that won't give you any problems with your windows 11 install changing it from pc to pc but if by default you install windows 11 and then you update the bios you will brick your windows 11 install and the good thing about the bios update is it actually gives you a warning about this before you update your bias and trust me i had to find out the hard way i've literally in the last week in store windows over 15 times just trying to figure this out it's been an absolute headache but i'm finally at a good place so continuing through the bias everything is extremely easy to navigate the settings for overclocking they've got simple settings advanced settings i found just overclocking 5.1 gigahertz was extremely easy on this motherboard just change a few different settings and you're good to go then locking in xmp profiles on the ddr5 dominator had absolutely no problems doing that as well though i have been critiqued for not overclocking ddr5 yet but i'm going to do a dedicated video on that and get the run down and see what the difference is not only between the motherboard manufacturers but also between the sticks themselves though i do want to do more research on that but what is worth asrock do tell me this board supports up to 6400 megahertz xmp if you are into advanced overclocking anyhow it's time for a conclusion and i'll now give you guys my thoughts and opinions on the z6 90 asrock tai chi and this board honestly it's coming in with that monster price tag and i just feel like just like the strix just like the oris master these are hard prices for a lot of people to swallow i'd like to see this board ideally come in under 400 usd then i think it'd be a solid buy i do get that inflation is a thing i do know that producer prices are going up but again going back to an x 370 tai chi and looking at the stark contrast between the pricing then and now surely inflation hasn't come up 200 percent on motherboards i mean it's just it is extremely expensive and i think someone spending this kind of money would want perfection now i will admit this board is as close to perfection as i've seen out of the z690 motherboards that have come through here but that said at 590 usd i would like to see a 10 gigabit nick on board which the aorus master has done that for under 500 usd though other than that the vr ram the bios the audio they are all fantastic giving out really good numbers though personally i would like to see more usb ports at the rear azroc have tried to alleviate this by including a usb add-in so overall very solid board but that price tag the 590 usd but do let us know what you guys think in the comment section below love reading those thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day which comes from brandon and it's quite a long question they basically the gist of it is i'll put the question up on the screen you guys can read it their friend has an i7 9700k a b365 d3sh and also a 750 watt gold power supply and their rtx 2080 is essentially not functioning properly it's dropping frames and they've also tried their 2080ti on this rig and it's also doing the same thing but then they've also tried all the different parts out except for the motherboard and the power supply and they want to know do you think it's the motherboard or do you think it's the power supply and i'm going to be straight up i do think it's the motherboard i just don't think this entry level b365 board because that's what it is i just don't think it was designed to handle the i7 9700k and so i think that is your problem where it's actually putting in these power limits that's throttling the cpu especially after say a minute or two minutes of gaming especially if the game is intense and it's using up all those eight cores and eight threads then you will see throttling and that's exactly what it will do so my advice would be to change the motherboard over and actually since the 9th gen cpus aren't so hot right now you may be able to pick up a really good deal on a decent z390 motherboard hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content we've got a very juicy video coming up next it's going to be basically putting an old dell into a gaming pc it's going to be a transplant so stay tuned for that one and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
