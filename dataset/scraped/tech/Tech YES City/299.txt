i was walking through kmart the other
day and bang a keyboard full mechanical gaming
keyboard came out to me with a price tag of 25 aussie dollars
and when i went to the register they said this is actually 39 aussie dollars
and then i said no you guys had this advertised with the price tag at 25.
so they actually misplaced it on the shelves and i ended up getting
this keyboard for 25 bucks so i got three of them and then i used my mates
staff discount and we got it for 71 aussie dollars but
apparently this keyboard usually costs 39 which is about 28 usd
and upon clicking the buttons they do indeed have a mechanical style
switch and it's known as a mechanical blue with tactile feedback in that
you'll actually feel the feedback and you will hear it upon clicking the keys
and this is a box style switch with led lighting that's set to one color but
since they've changed the colors along the rows
it does give off that rgb effect however in today's video we're gonna be testing
this budget mechanical keyboard and comparing it against a corsair
gaming keyboard with silver switches and a thousand hertz polling to see not
only the input latency that could be incurred
from the actuation distance on the keys but also the differences between the
keyboard and the hardware that they use and see if that introduces input lag too
especially the polling rates because i do suspect this keyboard right
here is going to carry the default 125 hz and of course we'll be
checking out the build quality on this keyboard and seeing if it holds
up just with standard typing tests and what the consistencies of the keys
are like let's roll that intro and get it on have you built a pc
recently only to be met with a windows needs
activation message in the bottom right hand corner
even whilst you're playing games well if you want to get rid of this message and
you don't want to spend 200 plus on a key then today's video sponsor
scd keys has you covered for as little as 15
bucks after using the coupon code tyc you can
get yourself a single end user license quickly and
easily then you get the key paste that key in there click next and
you're good to go links in description below to get your
key today so quickly analyzing the input latency for you guys we can see here
that the keyboard the anco mechanical budget
banger from kmart does have a little bit of input delay
but i feel like most of this is due to the actual switch and the height that
it actuates at as well as the cheaper hardware
inside the keyboard itself so this keyboard is
naturally going to pull at 125 hertz if we've got the k70 to compare it to
here this polls at different ratios you can set it on the
back of the keyboard from a thousand hertz
to 125 but basically the difference between 125 hertz and a thousand hertz
was that they can be similar or there's a little bit more
variance on 125 hertz especially comparing this to the logitech
g102 which i know has virtually zero input delay
we can see that at 125 hertz we were getting slightly higher times
on some of the numbers but then coming really close a lot of the other times
and this is because when you're within that realm of 125
hertz you're basically polling 125 times a
second so that does leave you to the worst time
that you can pull that at eight milliseconds versus a thousand
times which is the worst time you can pull it at one millisecond so
it is going to be beneficial for you to have your keyboard at a higher refresh
rate or higher polling rate at least from the testing i've done here
today anyway i'll throw up some quick input latency figures for you on this
cheap budget banger let's get now on to a typing test and
we'll talk about whether you should think about buying
this keyboard or not when you get a keyboard like this you
are going right into the deep end like that is where you're going with this
thing right so let's go typing tests that's right boom yeah
132 baby that's where i smoked the competition
smoked him first place all right so six keys will make this
keyboard spasm out so there's five key rollover really that is actually the worst i've seen
on a keyboard to date so with those tests out of the way
i'm going to look at the build quality now and then give you guys a
recommendation on this keyboard and so with the build
quality you've got an all plastic construction on this keyboard it does
feel a little bit cheap but it is far from the cheapest feeling keyboard i've
tried and trust me i've tried some real bangers that i would recommend
staying far away from this build quality for me personally it
it does just cut it like i'm gonna say it cuts it it does
make the cut but i would recommend getting your own
wrist rest and even on high-end keyboards i'd recommend going out and
buying your own wrist rest because a latex
wrist rest it does make a big world of a difference in my
opinion however one thing i found with the typing test was this thing was
pretty good the keys were consistent and the mechanical blues had good
feedback so whatever switches they've used
uh the unknown brands they did do a fairly good job and the keycaps
themselves are double shot plastic and they
actually feel quite decent so the area where they really needed to
get it right on a keyboard they actually did get it right and that's the switches
and the keycaps however there are some things that they
have missed and that of course is that five key roll over where on the
box i'm pretty sure it said something about like 26 key
which is like completely false as we saw in those tests
another thing as well as the rgb is really
like basic it's extremely basic to the point where you just press this one
key and you've just got these different effects that cycle through and i will
say that the lights are actually extremely weak it's some of
the weakest lighting or backlighting i've seen on a keyboard
yet so i wouldn't be buying this for the rgb
effect i'd be simply if i wanted to buy it i'd be buying it
for the mechanical blues and also the decent typing experience you can get on
it so for a quick recommendation with this keyboard i'm not blown away by it
but at the same time i'm not gonna bash it especially at its price point
it did the job i think it'd be great for someone who say
wants to get someone a present for their birthday and maybe they forgot until the
last minute they just need to pop down at kmart it'd
be a good little starter keyboard in the world of mechanical keyboards and
then if they really like the blue switch they can maybe
get something with better polling rates and higher actuation points but
that being said it doesn't take away from the fact that this little keyboard
does the job however one thing i will critique about the
unco brand in kmart is that its packaging is
really bad i'd like to see them at least put some foam
around the keyboard so it doesn't get damaged i mean if you get one of these
keyboards and it's not working out of the box or
one of the keys stuffed it's probably because the packaging was
packed so poorly and that it's just got a piece of
cardboard covering the outside world and the keyboard i mean they're really
placing a lot of faith in the plastic though lastly there is no
included software the cable is quite sturdy and decent
and the bottom of the keyboard has one level of adjustment for height
and then at the front it has two little sticky feet to make it stick to the desk
which does stick quite well it's not going to
stick the best i've seen of keyboards but it will hold its position if you're
just typing and using it like a normal keyboard
and with all that aside if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to

section below what is your favorite budget mechanical keyboard
or in general just your favorite mechanical keyboard
love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the
day here which comes from lindelus lowry and they
ask how long until zen 3 should i buy a 3600 now
while i wait and what i've heard is is that zen 3 is coming out at the end
of this year though i haven't heard anything concrete
at this point in time so i mean honestly it could be two
months it could be three months it could even be longer if they don't release it
at the end of this year so i mean a 3600 is a good buy man you
might not even need to upgrade to zen 3 if all you're doing is gaming on a
mid-range gpu so i'd say getting a 3600 now you're not
going to be disappointed hope that answers that question and if
you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying
that tech yes content and you want to see it the moment it drops
then be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
