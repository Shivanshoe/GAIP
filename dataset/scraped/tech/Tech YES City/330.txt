so right here we've got a tech yes
delivery that is on the back of another two pcs that got hokked earlier today
now you guys want some behind-the-scenes stuff you want more content this is the
only thing I can think of to bridge the two together because I am flat out and I
made a flaw with prices recently I predict they will go down but again
you've got to be accustomed to the market and certain special times here in
Australia it's currently a tax return time because our financial year ticks
over from July not the start of the year in January like most other countries so
that means people have cashed up that's going to pretty much collide with
another thing that's going on right now and that is the government's gonna hand
out another round of stimulus is so this is all gearing up for a pretty good
month in July at least until the 20th so the next 10 days is going to be full-on
but damn this stuff is going out super quick I've gotta head to brisbane as
well because there's some parts that I have to collect before 4 p.m. for a
competition that I'm doing upcoming competition and I also just finished a
tech s workout so I got to go freshen up and then we're going to hit the road [Music]
[Applause] [Music] so we just got up to Brisbane in those
heaps of traffic's so we missed out on getting our stuff so we're gonna see if
we can drop these keyboards off now to someone that needs them up in this area
so hopefully this trip wasn't all for nothing but it's always a way when
you're in kind of in a rush things just go wrong we're now back at the tech yes
studio with another bill that's complete and this one you can change the LEDs on
the fly from the front panel which the front panel is also got RGB on it this
is a Vegas 64 build I've got the Vegas 64 off a friend who was upgrading his PC
and so now we've got a 3300 X 16 gigabytes of RAM into Vegas he's for now
we're trading this for a PC for 500 bucks bought I mean sorry I'm getting
$800 and they're giving me a PC with a risin five thirty six hundred thirty two
gigabytes of RAM and a GTX heaven TTI so I would say overall I guess they just
want a PC that's a ready G game that's why they're trading what they've got
even though it'd be fairly easy for them to get some really good performance out
of what they have already some people just like to have a brand new build and
it looks bling-bling so yeah we'll see how this trade goes
and we'll see what comes in this thing's place so we can see this PC that got
traded in does need some check yes loving it's good just all these stickers
that I want to remove and then the inside is very dirty so we're gonna get
to a little bit of work here and see what we can do
[Music] so now we've pulled out the raisin five
thirty six hundred thirty two gigabytes of RAM x4 70 or a soldier I think this
one is and AVS 450 power supply and we've finished off the build so that's
all done now and the windows I've got to see what this is the screens flicking so
I might have got hosed on the 1050 ti who knows but this deal right here is
really good so far because we're gonna reef lip this box right here once we get
it 100% working we'll flip that off and hopefully recoup all the cost back so
that we get a free rise by 3600 X 470 32 ounce RAM and we've changed over the
power supply for something just a basic power supply cuz the tempered ETI really
doesn't need that much so you can pull out those old FSP power supplies and
they work really well on low 200 what builds so that we can use for a
mid-range build and we've got here I guess a lot of hustle value out of that
trade in so we've now replaced the motherboard and this motherboard here
ended up actually being faulty in a really rare way in that once you install
Windows and boot up to Windows the PCIe port doesn't work properly and because
it's only one 16x slot on this board we need that slot for our graphics cards so
what we're gonna do here is take the cooler off take the CPU out and replace
it to a different board and we should be still good to go should be able to make
another budget combo out of these parts right here so unfortunate but that's the
way things go I mean with with pcs and stuff like that when you test through
things and you get your build ready and your stress tested if something's wrong
you just quickly trial and error what's wrong and then yeah throw the part out
like this part I mean I really I haven't seen this problem before I actually
haven't seen this problem before where PCIe port is cutting out when you're
installing Windows of all things and not when you're in the BIOS or anytime
sooner because we tried a different power supply that wasn't it tried
different memory even that wasn't it so could I mean there is a small chance
it could be the CPU but I guess we'll find that out - we won't Chuck the board
out until we've changed it over to this board right here and then we've only via
a trial and error process of elimination made it sure that the board was the last
factor at faults so yeah weird problem that's what happens I guess just another
day in the life of tech yes and another thing too it could also be the
motherboard BIOS but I read the bass notes for this board and there was
nothing about PCIe compatibility so yeah we'll try it out on this and if this is
all working absolutely fine then we can try BIOS update later but yeah I don't
know let us know if you have seen or heard of a similar problem with this
motherboard or or maybe an A and three plus motherboard for that matter and now
after all that we have here an empty table well kind of we've got to build it
I can kind of piece together but I still want to go get my order from yesterday
which I missed out on and I ordered a 20 70s super for this build plus a 240
gigabyte SSD so if we do all this right we can turn this hustle into a big flip
so that's what I'm kind of thinking here depending on how good the memory is to
sort of try and chew in the memory up but it's looking pretty good so far
let's see if we can finally make it to this store without hitting traffic and
getting missing out by the Buzzle but also since I needed a 20 70 super and
they've got it for a really good price I guess it all works out in the end I'll
uh I'll see you soon mate I just I'll be about I'll be about probably yeah
probably about now I'm guessing so gotta stop into you man so yeah I'll see I'll
see you soon less all right catch you mate right bye mate so we actually made
it on time - you might today and we've got there 27 Suva 20 HCI for this
competition and the i7 10700 so this competitions going to be pretty cool now
that I'm seeing all the parts here and I think hopefully after doing the testing
in the recent videos that we've done - with grounded I think I can win me this
competition against these other youtubers but what we did right now is
we called up Liz because we're in Brisbane we Wisel see what he's got
cracking and he's got three one terabyte hard drives so we are going to hit the
boot switch and we're get on the road and get crack-a-lackin'
this is the tech yes stinger - a few guys are wondering there's a new slogan
here and that is tech yes stinging [Music] [Applause]
[Music] and so we just got back from Lazer's
place now we just picked up two cosmetically blemished i 5:45 90s they
were 90 a pop and they came with a gigabytes of RAM and I do like these for
low powered GPUs like a 1650 Super goes in here perfectly fine then we've got
six hard drives three of those worth 500 gigabyte three of those with one
terabyte and so that was a good deal I mean I always need hard drives he also
had two four gigabyte sticks of RAM this time around he's like ddr3 has gone up
in price so I had to pay 30 Ozzie dollar story from 8 gigabytes of RAM that's how
bad Ram prices are the mo but I mean if you need it sometimes if you need that
one component and everything else is cheap you got to cuff up the piper for
it unfortunately then les chucked in a few of these adapters always find these
come in handy especially if you run out of ports or there's limited GPU ports or
a port could be even rusted or something like that and then we've got 2 24 inch
monitors here which we got for 55 a pop they're in really good condition so I
was like you know what I kind of need some monitors so all up we got here 440
total Ozzie dollar II dues for this combo but we got over here this upcoming
project for this Honey I Shrunk the Kids build and so I'm really looking forward
to this competition but of course we've got the 2017 super that managed to get
thrown in there and I did get a couple of spares so that is going to be this L
do three I've heard some really good things about it
apparently it's a really nice case to work with which on mini ITX is always a
hard thing to work with that but now we've got the 2017 super we've got a
power supply hard drive and an SSD for this - because I ran out of - 40s so we
now got that we can now build ourselves up something quickly and see how it
turns out why not [Music]
and now here's the build fully finished and it took us about 10 or 15 minutes to
build this up it's a really easy case to build in and I gotta say I'm really
shocked at gam dias at least in Australia that value for money is
through the roof I mean I do like this RGB IO panel up the top and you've got
the LED control and you don't have to worry about any LED headers on the
motherboard which I really do like that you've got simple RGB control but thing
is this thing cost 99 ozzie dollars and the airflow is actually pretty good in
it the noise is pretty low and you get four fans so I think they've nailed it
like this is my favorite case in terms of value out there easily by far at the
moment but with that out of the way this build is ready to go let's sit down and
talk about what has come out of this weekend's random tech yes vlog so there
we have it basically a hustle vlog over the last two days where I'm basically
cleaning out my whole studio of all this stuff because I want to start fresh in
my head about what prices I've paid for stuff and sort of just clear out all
this other stuff that I don't know where I intend to use it and so part of that
of course is just putting gaming PC's together picking out the cream of the
crop on that stuff putting it all together and then making a value there
but another thing is to is you sort with that trade in right never turn down a
trade in especially even if something may be even slightly faulty in this case
we've got that trade in in and it just looked terrible at first there was all
these stickers the case was very cheap but inside we had like a hidden treasure
trove an X 470 ultra and then this rise about 3,600 30 gigabytes of RAM a decent
power supply a 1050 Ti and so and one terabyte hard drive and so that to me
was was easily worth the $500 dollars they want to trade in value for it plus
that enabled me to sell my gaming PC for asking price which was awesome so that
is I guess trade-ins can really work in
your favor but another thing is sewers we then get that build and we're like
okay what can we quickly do with this because it seems like an Australian this
is what I said in my previous video when I said prices will go down you got to
look for hiccups in the market and I think in the next month in Australia's
gonna be great because there's a thing called tax return time here because I
financially is different people are getting all their tax returns and
they're buying PCs but also there's the very soon there's gonna be government
money flowing through the economy so July is gonna be a very healthy month
for PC sales if you're gonna stray of it after that you'll probably again see
that those trends will come into effect that's how I feel but in the meantime
take advantage of it when it rains it pours and that's you should have your
buckets out in the in the outside and just collecting all the rain you can it
so that's what tech yes doing behind the scenes and I recommend doing the same
don't worry I preach what I do so yeah that's I forgot the saying it's
like do as I say and do sort of thing I don't think that was important to me was
that RT X 2070 super price in Australia that is easily the best price on an RT X
2070 super I can find the gallic smaadahl is quite big it's quite healthy
another good thing about the gallic smaadahl is that the power consumption
is quite low compared to some of the overclocked r-tx 2070 supers out there
on the market so that means you even if you use a cheaper case than we did today
not that I recommend it you'll still not have to worry too much about thermals
though the Gambia's case that we used here today is just that 99 Ossie dollar
sweet spot case I still can't get over how good that value for money that case
is like Gambia's came from making these mediocre keyboards and headsets now
they're bringing out some quality cases so if you do get the chance to try one I
do recommend giving them a whirl because anyway that's at least what I'm rocking
here at the moment go back onto that RT x 2070 super price we go that's the 75
Aussie dollars that's ready to go at the brand new you might shop you got
warranty on that there's no haggling there's no hustling involved it's such a
good price but at the same time you're seeing RT x 27 TS non supers used for
like $700 plus and it's kind of like the use market is
in ways it's just so up and down at the moment you can of course get really good
deals but then you see all these items on there and it's just like people
actually buying these and I scratch my head because yeah what's the point when
the new market is offering even better value than the use market and that
should not be happening so basically a nutshell find the best prices whether
it's new or used and piece it together and create good value basically back in
the day of eBay when I was doing that my nickname from family and friends was buy
low that's the first four letters of my last name and people would call me up
they say buy low not be my reply would be sell high and basically that is the
name of the game and the biggest commodity you've got just like the guy
who came around with that trade in he just said I hate computers like in terms
of building him I just want something that's ready to go
it's all new it's working fine and he just couldn't be bothered upgrading his
system and so that's the kind of business that people pay for you have a
talent and that is you can quickly whip up pcs install Windows tune them up get
them all ready and if there are any problems or compatibility issues you can
iron that out so people who get these pcs don't have any problems because a
lot of people who don't know how to build a PC will get stuck on something
they'll waste days and days trying to do it or they could potentially bend pins
or something like that you're taking all that hassle of waste
I mean basically at the end of the day that is the service you're offering and
I do see a lot of comments especially locally where people sell PCs and people
say aw you're charging more money than it costs to build and it's late of
course because you are offering a service and in this world at least in
Australia you get paid for a service that is I mean go ask a builder if he's
gonna build you a house for free or just cost of the parts because at least from
what I remember what building is there's a contract called cost plus and the
pluses with the builders fee anyway with that aside keep on rockin and don't stop
stalking just like this question of the day here which comes from dexters 56 I
don't know why I'm trying to tie that in like a smooth transition it was a
terrible segue that made no sense but we got here we'll the x58 ud5 work with an
ex 5650 or an x 56 75 xeon i currently a i7 930 I need to know if it
can handle the six core because of the support list that only shows four cores
in six core i7s basically just go look on some forums and see or if there's
some results out there with this ud5 working with the xeon then it'll
definitely work but I do recommend before taking that i7 out update to the
latest bios and then put the xeon in and it should be all good to go at least
what i quickly checked when i did a google search the ud5 does indeed work
with the xeon x50 650 so you should be good to go x 56 75 is gonna give you a
bit more Headroom a bit more overclocking it's a better bin and
that's about it and if you guys enjoyed today's video
