in 2020 Asus and I usually call it aZeus (because you can now buy the god of thunder on a motherboard) but you guys are telling me look Bryan you've got to get with the times
it's Asus and they have sent in two motherboards here the top gaming Z490 plus Wi-Fi which is coming in at $200 USD and includes at this price point 14
phases but we'll get onto that soon as OOOs like to call it 14 power stages but
it's also coming in with an option to not have the Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 on
it for 20 dollars cheaper 180 then we've got the Maximus 7 formula which is
pretty much a hybrid between people who want the latest and greatest highest end
motherboard and also potentially want to put water cooling on not just their CPU
but also their motherboards vrm where they're using what they call a cross
chill design where EK have given the option to insert water cooling if you
want to cool that VR em down and coming at a half a thousand dollars this thing
definitely better perform for the money and if there's anything wrong with these
boards I'm gonna let you know in today's review but without a side let's go
through the vrm details the most important part of any motherboard with
the tough gaming Wi-Fi where as a 12 plus two-stage design here using vishay
si c63 9 50 amp solutions on the MOSFETs and then for the chokes we've got 45 amp
chokes and then we've got 5 K capacitors and the PWM controller is the asp 1 9 0
0 b and all that leads us to the testing now with this vr m and i use a 10 900k
and out of the box this thing was boosting up to 4.9 gigahertz all cause
the temperatures were absolutely fine here coming in with 36 degrees on the
heatsink and 50 degrees on the vrm itself though keep in mind this was in
19 degree ambience and I am used to testing in 22 degree a minutes so I will
Delta adjust these for the graph and then once we started overclocking the
10900 K it did fall a hundred megahertz shy of what I'm used to getting with
this ten nine hundred K and that's 5.2 gigas this could only take it up to five
point one gigahertz no matter how much extra voltage I gave it it just would
not respond it and will crash out so the V R M is D
and the temperatures are very good coming in with 48 degrees on the heating
and 78 degrees on the vrm but we will a delta adjust them again just mainly
because if you watch a heap of my other z4 90 motherboard reviews then that way
you'll get an apples to apples comparison but for what it's worth the
power consumption was absolutely fine testing out a hundred ninety five watts
on the ten nine hundred k out of the box which is very high but that's normal for
this ten core at four point nine key gets all core when we did take it a five
point one gigahertz it did start to ramp up roughly around 250 watts and that is
pretty high again but if you want to overclock this thing it will start using
a lot more power though that being said out of the box there is one critiquing
point with the tough gaming Wi-Fi and that is out of the box with the bios
automatic settings even if you lock in XMP profiles i found even after a BIOS
update that I had to change the auto optimizer Zeus setting down to the
unrestricted limit setting and that then enabled us to get the results that we've
got in these graphs here because if you leave it on the auto optimize setting it
did drop the CPU down to 125 watts power usage and with that unfortunately it
dropped the CPU down to 4.4 gigahertz all core so I'd like to see a sous
optimize that with another BIOS update and fix that little problem I came in to
of course it's easy to fix if you've got this board then you just go into the
BIOS and change it to the third setting and you can lock in your XMP profiles
and you get really good performance off this motherboard there continuing on
with the tough gaming Wi-Fi and it's onboard audio they're using the realtek
1200 DAC here and this has a -3 decibel roll-off on 0 to 10 Hertz and then from
I found the higher frequencies and onwards there was a very slight bit of
shake there but the crosstalk was also really good at - 89 decibels the mic
input did show that this is best suited at a volume level of 50 plus 30 dB so
the onboard audio is decent I've definitely seen better I've seen worse
I mean the good points are about it that the crosstalk is really good however the
frequency response curve could use a little bit of work having that slight
shake in there not the best option when I have seen
cheaper boards come in with better onboard audio here at the studio that
the mic import it will do the job if you are a gamer and you want to get a budget
set of headphones there testing out everything else on this motherboard the
USB 3 speeds will find the one gigabit per second Nick was also fine too and
the m2 shield did a really good job of cooling down the m2 and I was stress
testing that an nvme drive and going through the tough gaming Wi-Fi bias it's
got everything there you would want and then some especially if you're
overclocking on air or water and you've also got your cue fan control where you
can individually control the five different PWM fan headers on this board
to the fan speeds you want you've also got two 12-volt RGB head as one at the
top and one at the bottom and then in the middle of the board you have an
addressable RGB controller which you can in the bias turn the RGB on and off but
you will have to install software if you want to calibrate the RGB with different
components on your system the moving over now to the ROG Maximus 7
formula this here has an OLED display which you can use to readout CPU
temperatures and also put your own logo on if you want that but it's also got
RGB on the bottom which comes in a sort of subtle styling which I will say is a
really cool design but you would expect this to be a design like this on a 500
USD board and the surface of this motherboard has highly reflective bits
coupled in with semi-gloss bits coupled in with matte bits especially on the
heatsink you do get a power and reset button up at the top as well as a BIOS
debug code readout as well to 12 volt and also to 5 volt addressable RGB
headers you've also got 8 PWM fan headers which you can control just like
the tough gaming in the bass itself now quickly speaking about the BIOS it is
absolutely fine I didn't come into any problems when I was tuning the 10900 K
on this board even leaving it on the auto zeus optimized or changing it to
the no limits we got the same results here and also overclocking the memory
240 400 megahertz on both the tough gaming and the Maximus formula presented
no problems however moving over to the VR m 16 power stages and this one
definitely has a high quality vrm the pedo and controller here is the asp one
4:05 and then for those MOSFETs we've got the
Infineon TD a 2 1 4 7 2 7 TM MOSFETs and then for the chokes they're using
micro-fine 45 amp all alloy chokes and then for the cap so we've got 10k
Japanese made solid caps derivative the temperatures here we had 49 degrees in
software 52 degrees on the PCB and 34 degrees on the heatsink clocking that to
5.2 gigahertz which presented absolutely no problems even on the auto settings
and this is one good thing that I've seen with the Maximus formula verse all
the other z4 90 boards I've tested I whacked in 5.2 gigahertz and this board
did the rest on everything else and it did so very well scoring 58 degrees in
software on the vrm 62 degrees on the PCB and 58 degrees on the heatsink so
that heat sink is definitely starting to soak up a lot of that heat and speaking
of the heatsink itself it weighs 380 grams and on the tough side of things
it's got 132 grams on the heatsink that's mainly cooling the power stages
that supply voltage to the CPU but in total you get two different heats things
on the tough gaming totalling 226 grams so the vrm on the Maximus 7 formula is
doing an extremely good job though I will critique this is the only critique
I have for the Maximus 7 formula and that is the power consumption even
though it's looking really good in hardware info from the wall it is
starting to juice a bit more power both on the 4.9 and the 5.2 gigahertz and now
what this gives me an indication of is everything else on the board is juicing
a bit of power so that OLED screen we've got all that extra RGB lighting that is
starting to add to your power consumption as opposed to a board with
none of these features on board but a really good vrm that will give you the
same effect but it will use less power at both out-of-the-box settings and
overclock settings there moving through the audio on the Maximus 7 formula azuz
call this the supreme FX solution and it did do a supreme job on the numbers with
the roll-off being only 1.7 decibels from 0 to 10 Hertz and then the
crosstalk was negative 91 decibels which is a really good number right there at
the top of the chart and for that frequency response curve after that 10
Hertz that was pretty much flat perfectly flat
the whole way through and then for the mic import you'd want to keep this at a
level of 80 volume and plus 30 DB max though keep in mind they're not using
any noise suppression on this mic input as opposed to the tough gaming solution
so that means if you've got a good mic that doesn't need a whole lot of power
from a separate solution you could use this for professional recordings they're
going through some of the other features here on the board the m2 heat shield
does a very good job of cooling down your mo to drive though testing out USB
3 speeds and also the NIC speeds they were absolutely fine as those include a
10 G NIC and a 2.5 g NIC as well as Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 now testing out
the Wi-Fi 6 signal that was I have seen stronger here in the studio but it is
doing a pretty good job I mean this is going through 20 centimeter thick
concrete to my router upstairs and it's still giving out a three signal sign
which is doing a good job but as for m2 temperatures they were also really good
and one thing I will point out is I do like how they've got the readout here on
this board to tell you what compatibility that m2 slot will support
whether it's nvme or solder itself though that being said the last feature
to go through here is the input and output and the tough gaming has only on
the back 6 USB ports and one of those being a Type C and then you've got your
display in HDMI outs then your Wi-Fi 6 connections that you get at the antenna
included in the box then you've got 5.1 manual and optical out so if anything I
would like to see two more USB ports you'll also need to install your own IO
shield as opposed to the Maximus 7 formula here which has a phenomenal
input/output design with your BIOS flashback in the nuclear CMOS buttons at
the top followed by a healthy 10 USB ports one of those being a Type C and
then you get 10 and 2.5 g NICs ps2 support combo if you want to hook up a
ps2 mouse or keyboard your Wi-Fi six connections 5.1 manual out and your
optical output as well and the i/o shield is integrated into the
motherboard and with all that out of the way it's now time for a conclusion and
of course the big question you will want answered is are these
boards worth the money and the first one we're going to start off here with is
the tough gaming plus and this has the Wi-Fi so if you need
the Wi-Fi 6 in the Bluetooth 5 then that extra $20 over the tough gaming non
Wi-Fi is a no-brainer in my opinion but at $180 for just the board without the
Wi-Fi it is giving some really good value in the Z 490 realm especially
since it could handle a 10 900k both out of the box absolutely fine but even
overclocked and the vrm temperatures were really good of course they haven't
used the best of the best components and you can't expect them to at this budget
and so that only enables it to take a 10 900k to 5.1 gigahertz there that being
said everything else checked out on this motherboard except that BIOS setting
which if you get this board you will want to change that in my opinion the
onboard audio was decent the m-dot to shield worked fine memory overclocks
were fine on this board so overall they've done a really good job of
offering a good value board for Z 490 mainstream and lastly what about the
formula the 500 USD monster in Australia it is 999 ozzie so we would like to see
the Aussie pricing come down but with that said if you're after the best of
the best for a motherboard you want the best overclock so you want to add water
and you want that vrm giving you the best results supplying voltage to that
CPU you want really good onboard audio tangi nic Wi-Fi six all the bells and
whistles and even an OLED screen on your motherboard then this is going to be one
to get it passed all the tests here there was really nothing wrong with this
board except for the extra power consumption for the RGB the OLED screen
the debug light and also all the extra sensors on board but I'm sure you're
going to want that if you want the best of the best of the best of the best of
the best motherboard out there for z4 90s so
overall these two boards here in today's review as zeus have done a really good
job I couldn't find anything glaringly wrong with these motherboards and
without a sight if you guys enjoyed today's double review then be sure to
hit that like button for us and let us know in the comments section below what
you think of in 2020 love reading your thoughts and
opinions just like this question of the day here which comes from marshmallow
wolf and they ask you never really explained why 18 amps in 12 volt was a
bad thing but 37 emp'd and 12 volt is a good thing what is a good number to look
for what's the relationship between them in terms of power supplies so basically
the relationship between those two is the wattage the power supply can put out
and a good number to look for would be around at least 37 MP and higher if you
are building a gaming PC with a decent graphics card but the 18 amps and 12
volt isn't always a bad thing it's not always a bad thing it's just most of the
time especially on power supplies from brands you've never heard of before it
is a bad thing because they don't put good components in and that's why the
amp rating is very low however that being said if you've got a delta in a
small business form-factor power supply that can actually be a decent power
supply it's just not rated to go and power a gaming computer with higher
wattage requirements anyway hope that answers that question and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're
