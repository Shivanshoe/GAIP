this right here is the LDAT aka the latency display analysis tool and we're going to be using this device to test out input latency on budget monitors now i picked up these monitors for around 25 us dollars and under and we've got one monitor from each of the brands that is samsung phillips lg hp dell and acer you may be wondering what is total system input latency that has to do with the moment you click the button and something appears on your screen so the higher this number is the worse you're going to be playing games the better this number is the more of a competitive advantage you're going to have so with that aside let's go through all these monitors right here and give you guys some results on which is the winner let me tell you a story it's a story of tragedy hope victory it's the story of today's video sponsor world of tanks what's that you want a free-to-play action-packed game with over 100 million players worldwide that's not just key spamming well world of tanks gives you intense battles that are extremely strategical so you find yourself punished for rushing into a battle without your platoon for backup so you're going to have a realistic tank experience and over 550 tanks in total for you to choose from personally i'm developing out my ussr troop and i've chosen mainly lighter tanks for their maneuverability you can choose from light medium heavy artillery or destroyer to add variety to your gameplay as each class carries a completely different set of strategies whether you want to play a sneaky sniper with concealments and long range optics in a forest roll heavy through a city or a light agile tank like mine and go for some hillclimb flanking action having over 40 battle arenas lets the environment shape your playstyle to get you started if you use code tank mania you'll get 7 days of premium the tier 5 excelsior tank free rental tier 6 tank and 250 000 credits those credits will also help unlock your upgrades and tune your tank's dynamics no matter if you want to play competitively in ranked mode casually in a battle or playing through a campaign there's plenty of fun to be had in world of tanks so first up here guys we've got the hp monitor and we can see here by the results that the minimum and maximum aren't that bad like i was expecting a little bit worse from this monitor considering it's age and it's also the good thing about it is it is a tn panel so if you're gaming on a budget tn panels will usually give you decent response times in the grand scheme of things so let's now now that we've got these results we can jot these down and ends our number of samples we've taken 100 samples and from here we've got our numbers where the average input latency here from click to getting a picture out on the monitor is 23.7 milliseconds also one quick test i am throwing in for you guys before we move into the other monitors is testing with vsync on versus off now vsync is the original technology to sync up a full frame output so there's no tearing but the problem with this old tech is that it pretty much gives you ridiculously high input lag we've seen an increase here of 36 milliseconds on average and the best frame that we got was 49 milliseconds which was over 40 milliseconds higher than that of having vsync off then the maximum went over 70 as well so really if you guys are serious about competitive play do not turn on v-sync leave it off but in terms of g-sync i've actually tested this in the past and g-sync and freesync these are much better technologies which are actually on a lot of the newer monitors coming out but if you're on an older monitor i would just stick to the vanilla leaving v-sync off but besides v-sync you guys probably want to know about having just a manual frame limiter set with v-sync off and this is where we scored about three milliseconds on average higher input delay than that of the original test so just having your frames uncapped and having vsync off on budget monitors will give you the best results at least for valerian so next up here we've got the v246hl from acer similar to the hp model in that it's both a tn panel with white led backlighting and at 60 hertz but they're claiming it's a five millisecond response time versus the hp's three milliseconds let's put that to the test and just like that our acer has taken pole position over the hp by 1.6 milliseconds on average so next up is the odd duckling of the bunch mainly because of its size and resolution it's a 4x3 monitor with a resolution of 1600 by 1200 though just because it's got the weird size and the weird resolution doesn't mean it will necessarily get some weird results [Music] and here we've got the lg flattron e2340v another 1080p special here with the tn panel and white led backlighting so pretty much all these panels in today's comparison are tn panels with white led backlighting but of course we want to see manufacturer manufacturer if there is any funny buggers introduced and which one you should avoid but so far i mean so far so good [Music] next up here we've got the philips 200v and this is a 20 inch monitor but it's still 1080p white led backlit tn so let's see what philips can bring to the table on a budget i think this one's actually the cheapest i got out of the bunch i think i got this for 10 bucks off memory and the last monitor we've got up here is the samsung bx2 440 this is a tn paddle with white led backlighting just like the others so let's finally now with all this aside see what the results show us of all these monitors and with all that testing out of the way we now answer the question of which brand is the best budget monitor brand if you're looking around the under 30 used bangers on the used market well the results here show that the input lag on all these models were coming in a similar ballpark so if you're going out and buying an acer versus a hp versus a delvers lg philips or samsung all the monitors that we had tested here today showed a worst case scenario from best case scenario of a difference of around four milliseconds so the worst average time that clocked in was the lg e2340v with 25.3 average milliseconds and then the best case scenario that we saw was actually the dell monitor which came in with an average of 21.7 so that was impressive that the dell had the best time but that being said the dell also had some of the worst response times where that was a pva panel so basically va and it's not as fast to respond as a tn panel and so that got 10 milliseconds on average response times and the funny thing about that was the fade time with those response times there's also another negative six milliseconds so it's very weird to analyze the response times on the dell monitor but in terms of the other tn panels they all scored around three to four milliseconds real response times the best panel i thought overall if i had to pick one would be this acer a v246hl this came in with a on average three milliseconds response time but it did have a black frame insertion it's actually quite funny because the lg as well as the samsung they also had black frame insertion as well and so what this does is it turns off the leds in the monitor and that makes it appear as if it's a sharper picture in technical terms it's called strobing and it helps reduce ghosting then now it's time to answer that question of was there one that i would avoid and at this money when it comes down to it all these monitors here i picked them up dirt cheap and i was actually impressed with all six of them they are all decent panels in that if you wanted to get in to gaming and you had the skill set then you could get good on any of these six monitors that i've shown in today's video 21 to 25 milliseconds input lag is not going to be too much of a detriment keep in mind you can shave this down 15 milliseconds by going from 60hz to 360hz but that's going to set you back a lot of money you can put together something budget and get a real cheap rig put together and still be able to compete with other players at a competitive level now besides the monitor one of the other most important things if you're getting into pc gaming of course is your mouse selection i'm going to say if you're on a budget i would look at two different choices and that is the logitech g203 or i think in other parts of the world it's known as the g102 or if you've got a bigger hand and you like palm gripping i would go for the razer death adder both those mice are very cheap even worldwide shipped on aliexpress they both have extremely low input latency and coupled with even a 60hz monitor you should be able to play at a very good level until of course your men making money and then you can upgrade your gear if you need be now that being said my two favorite picks here today was the acer and then the hp the 2 301 believe it or not you're probably like why did you like the hp monitor and that's because it's got the gloss screen with out the matte coating on it i'm actually personally a big fan of the gloss i think it just takes away that matte layer which i feel is like almost like you're putting a blur over the monitor it just allows me personally to see the image a lot clearer and it's a lot more crisp especially coupled with tn technology if you're on a budget you're going to get some real sharp pictures out of this type of monitor anyway guys with that aside if you enjoyed today's video be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comment section below which of these six monitors did you like or if you've got your own favorite pick on a budget monitor do drop a comment in the comment section below or if you've got any questions about today's testing and how we got all these numbers then i'll be happy to answer that as well but we've also got the question of the day which comes from ascender and they ask when will the 21 h1 edition come waiting and they're talking about the windows 10 update and we do a custom iso here at tech air city i'm actually waiting for this to be mass adopted i have seen some people are getting the update some people aren't i like it when it's available to everyone then we can do our video and we'll actually make a v2 of the tech yes custom windows 10i so i'll put the link that video up here if you're into taking out all the bloatware out of your os anyway guys if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content you know what to do hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] you
