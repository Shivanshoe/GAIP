[Applause] and you've got nothing to lose probably this graph Scott right here have failed because so there's a problem number three and this is faulty VRAM [Music] [Music] I'll tell you what we're gonna do we're gonna give them some tech yes loving aftercare this is gonna be some extended hosing these things in multi-purpose spray now this is something to look out for with GPUs because I got given this gtx 980 i was told it wasn't working they tried everything to it and then i just looked at it and it had a bit of rust on it and I decided to just hose it down with multi-purpose spray like give it a lot of this stuff and it eventually ended up giving out a signal off the display port and the DVI port so the HDMI port doesn't work properly but one thing I did try with this card is that I got a display port cable DVI cable and essentially an HDMI cable and just reinserted the cable so many times are you taking off any rust or dirt in the actual ports themselves another thing too was on the PCIe finger here it also had a bit of rust which I got off as well so this card ended up coming back to life and I essentially got it for free so that makes for I guess another three tries as something that you can do if you don't have a heat gun for example and you're trying to use that method which I consider that a last resort method I do get some success out of cards in the past but it's usually around a 10% chance that the card will come back this however is just seeing this method I'm doing here today is just giving it the best chance that's got before you do go over and apply a lot of heat and so what we're looking at here is this GTX 780 this here doesn't give out a signal I've tried booting it up it's got a lot of version and rust on it inside the fins and also on the back plate itself which the back plate is also exhibiting signs of it's been hit somewhere and banged onto something so that is gonna get first up on the block and then we've got this one here which just gives out a b2 error code now one thing is if you're diagnosing GPUs you can quickly tell if it's a hardware problem straight away because it gives out a b2 signal that means it generally can't even initiate the V BIOS to get the graphics card working from the get-go but regardless will still give it a try and see if it maybe is something just clogging up the GPU maybe a bit of metal dust has fallen off the cooler and it's connecting with something on the actual GPU board itself which I have seen in the past then we got this last one here which decides it kind of wants to boot when it wants to boot and then once it makes it to Windows the driver just clunks out and you get a black screen with no signal so we're going to get into giving these GPUs a nice hosing one by one and talking about everything we can do to not only make it look really good from its current state but also more importantly see if we can get these GPUs working again if you're in the market for more cores and threads that you can handle on its end to thread Ripper then you need a motherboard from the best as rocks TRX 40 Taichi motherboard has a 16 phase power design with 90 amp chokes and MOSFETs it also includes a hyper MDOT 2 quad card on top of that you've got Wi-Fi 6 addressable RGB and an active cooling heatsink solution to keep even 64 cores under wraps legs in description below to find out more [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and here we are with the four most common problems now I face when I'm trying to fix up GPUs and unfortunately one of these problems I have never been able to fix in the history here of the channel we're gonna go over that problem first and that is when the card shows out a signal initially but after you install drivers the screen just goes black now this can sometimes be accompanied by the fans just simply going full-speed and pretty much yet you got to turn your PC off take the GPU out and sometimes you'll be trying to reinsert the GPU in different PCIe slots thinking you're going out of your mind trying different display ports but to no avail now I have seen this happen on both Nvidia cards and AMD cards in the past I actually find it is a bit more common on AMD cards than it is on the Nvidia cards and so what I think it is is I just think it's actually a faulty GPU inherently where once the drive is installed something inside the GPU just doesn't work properly and the whole thing goes Kabong cos now let's move over now to the second problem which I actually have the most success fixing this one you guys can easily do you don't need a heat gun to do this and that is just taking off either surface rust or debris or conductive thermal paste on the GPU now you see me clean up the GPUs a lot this is easily in the past when I've cleaned up GPUs I've had the most success bringing cards back to life whether it be just plugging inserting a cable in and out of the connection ports here like probably like 30 or 40 times just to get that surface rust off whether it's finding surface rust on the back or it's a faulty back plate or you take the cooler off in someone's use conductive thermal paste then you know if they've used conductive thermal paste because it'll be very shiny that's usually a good indication that it's got metals inside and then hence it reflects the light so the easiest way to do this is just clean down the whole GPU now I do prefer to use multi-purpose spray here if you do use brake cleaner it's usually only on the actual GPU dye itself if you've got that conductive thermal paste and so that will remove all that and then you blow it down with say a data back or something make sure the cards dry but with multipurpose spray I've found or that's wd-40 I found that you can just spray this stuff all over and if it's still wet it doesn't matter the card boots up and that's because it's got no capacitive or conductive materials in it and so it keeps working absolutely fine so the second problem that I come into here as we saw with this card right here the GTX 980 I brought this back from the brink and so I believe it was the actual connection ports and some surface rust on the PCIe contact bridge and so that was a card that's now working gtx 980 i got it for free and the person who actually gave us this 780 as well thought that this 780 worked fine but this 980 was a dud so the irony of it is this 780 and we'll get on to the next problem here ended up not working out for me now this gave out a signal so there's a problem number 3 and this is faulty vram and i have seen this in the past most notably you probably noticed when I did the RT X xx atti video that had some faulty vram on it now I managed to down clock the card enough without even flashing the bias and it managed to work still so this one works in that either the memory has degraded so much that it doesn't work at the default speeds or it's a faulty chip where it just doesn't work at those speeds either now unfortunately this card right here this is the GTX 780 this has fall TV room on board I can tell when I started down clocking the memory it started actually running the benchmark for a I guess a few more seconds than it otherwise would but as soon as it had default memory speeds just clocked out straightaway now I tried actually making a custom bios for this card right here first I started off with lowering the clocks a good 30% then after that I dropped it down to 50% less vram clock speeds and it still conked out even though this time around it would display higher resolutions and it would still probably it was just in the end it had faulty vram that we're gonna try soon with the heat gun to try and just bring it back so you know if it's a VRAM problem or even a GPU core problem if you start seeing artifacting or weird glitching on the screen and so the easiest way to get around this is to install a program called msi afterburner and once you've got this installed in your cards installed in your just idling you can then down clock both the core and the memory and then see if the card works probably after that if it does work probably after that you've got then two options you can either save the profile and boot up Windows every time and it'll load up that profile that's under clocked or of course you can try putting on a custom by us with those under clock settings so you don't have to worry in the future about having to install afterburner and have it running the speeds but unfortunately for this card here it is the one of the few that can't work with faulty vram of course the other option is if it's got faulty varium it may just give us the next sign here which is problem number four and that's completely no signal this is known as a b2 error so if you've got a bios read out code on your motherboard it'll usually say b2 we saw this with this card here the r9 270 so this one just gave out of b2 we cleaned it up still gave out a bit to basically that means that the actual card itself is not even initializing with the computer so it doesn't work something's really faulty to the point where this card can't even boot up it's VGA BIOS to get a signal out and so the only two methods that I know is that something's missing on the back of the GPU or chips rusted out to the point where it no longer works properly and you've got a resole to something on to fix it which in this case I am terrible at so luring especially when it comes to micro soldering like I can solder two wires together but that's about it that's as far as my soldiering skills go when it comes to Microsoft when you need some really good hands for that and yeah I've never actually brought a card back from micro Sol during the next problem you can try here is using a heat gun which I've done in the past I've done like Shi a full video on this I'll put the link up here to that where it's a controversial one some people say that it doesn't work I've actually done it myself and it's worked I've had a GPU come back and then it's worked after that for actually to this day I think over a good year and a half now it basically at least for me can work in rare circumstances I find when I do the heat gun method it's about a 10 percent hit ratio so it's got a very low success rate but that being said it's a last resort you've got nothing else to lose with it just like these three GPUs on the table here so that's said let's pull out this heat gun and then see if we can get these cards back and then move over to a conclusion for you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now returning with the heat gun method we've got some really good news and that is this a nine to seventy is back to life and it appears to be working absolutely fine though one thing I will say about this cooler here I don't know how coolers like this were okay for a card like this as you saw I just started running a benchmark and it was already getting near 80 degrees in like a minute so I probably replace this cooler right here with something a lot better because it's just not going to work in the long run and in fact this probably this grab Scot right here failed because of insufficient cooling which I did notice in a previous card that I tested years ago with a nine to 70 as well it had a similar kind of really weak cooler and that was displaying some really hot temperatures so that's good news that one is fixed surprisingly this is what we're talking about when you've just got completely no signal in the problems before the b2 now this was passing b2 and drivers are installing fine and it's good to go but this rx 580 here is one of the most interesting because I've never seen this come back to life it had that driver problem where installed the drivers and then the fans started spinning up full speed but it installed the drivers this time it started kind of semi working and that when we pulled up the heaven benchmark the frames were just constantly like up and down dipping like a yo-yo I then tried to put in a very conservative rx 470 BIOS on this and it's still giving out the same problem so this guide here is kind of like semi working I'd have to look at it closer to see what exactly is wrong with it but I believe it's just a car that's not going to work it might be good for say a display card where it's got five display outs and maybe it's good for an office PC going forward but this gtx 780 here this one unfortunately nothing really changed after the heat gun method it didn't work beforehand probably and it still doesn't work afterwards so basically with faulty GPUs the bottom line is if you've tried everything and you've got nothing to lose then definitely give it a go I'd say my heat gun methodology has improved over time where I feel the sweet spot is around six to eight minutes on just pretty much heating up the card make sure you wear a mask because it's going to be really weird smell coming off these things and they do get pretty hot so you have to let them cool down for a good 20 minutes after you do this then just reapply the cooler and give it a go so basically if you have problems with the GPU you can try and identify what the problem is and then go through some of the steps that we did here today and if you've got nothing to lose you've got nothing to lose so these four cards were just donated to me people just thought they would have no chance of working again and then I applied some of the tackiest loving methodology here and we got two or four working which honestly is a bit of a higher success rate than I'm used to but that being said if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comments section below have you come into some other problems also what are some other fixes that you guys use if you fix the graphics card in the past love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and speaking of thoughts and opinions we have the question of the day which comes from miss the night poner and it ties in perfectly with today's video they say I want to fix my vague of fifty-six I updated the BIOS went Cod warfare released and now Rainbow six siege stutters even if I roll back or System Restore it was fine before I messed with the BIOS also coil wine from the GC times up with the stuttering so basically if you guys have tinkered with the v bosse especially then just reflash it back to the original v bosse i'll put the link to a video up here where I show you guys how to flash especially with an AMD card via ATI flash also on that note after you've done the reflash you can also try doing a DD you which is a direct driver on installer and then completely installing the drivers again or if that doesn't work you can try reinstalling your OS just to give it the best chance it has after that something may have gone faulty on the GPU in which case you can try the steps outlined in today's video especially in this case at the Vega 56 I just try under clocking at first if you've tried those things beforehand and no notes might have that GPU working absolutely fine again with that said I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the content then you know what to do and I'll catch it in another tech video very he's out for now BAE [Music]
