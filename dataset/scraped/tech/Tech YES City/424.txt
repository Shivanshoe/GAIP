if you were looking to get into pc gaming then this is going to be one of the cheapest and also easiest ways that you can get really good fps for your dollar and the most important piece for this build to happen is this right here called the dell precision t3600 i picked this up in a recent used pc parts hunt that i did on the channel here for a hundred aussie dollars and for this price i got an extremely good deal where the cpu ended up being a sandy bridge xeon e5 1650 which is a 6 core 12 threaded processor clocked at 3.2 gigahertz all cores though this model here the dell precision it was released in 2012 and came in with a price starting from eleven hundred dollars they also had the precision t5600 and t7600s which supported two cpus via the e2000 series xeons i believe the most cores you could get on this socket was 16 cores 32 threads by utilizing the e2687w which on its own is an 8 core 16 threaded processor however impressively enough the flagship t7600 even back in its day could support up to 512 gigabytes of ddr3 ecc registered memory however what we've got right here is 16 gigabytes of memory installed and this is via two sticks even though this is a quad channel system dual channel should be fine especially with the graphics card we are coupling it with which is an rx 480. these graphics cards can be had on the market for very cheap i managed to pick one up for 80 australian dollars though if you look on the internet especially at places like aliexpress you can pick up an rx470 480 570 or 580 from anywhere from 60 to 120 usd shipped used of course the used part of today's video is a risk that you do take but you can minimize this greatly if you do ask the sellers or you do check the parts to see if they're working before you purchase them in the case of buying graphics cards off the internet they're usually tested and working before you buy them so you shouldn't have much bad luck even if you do you've usually got seller protections however back to this model here it came with a quadro fx 580 installed now this is going to be a terrible graphics card for gaming in 2020 however once we remove it we've then got a spare gpu though this thing i doubt would be worth any more than a pack of peanuts on today's current market however the great thing even about this entry level t3600 is that it's got two additional pci connectors which we can utilize for our rx 480 and speaking of the power supplies even the lowest model like this one here has a 425 watt gold rated power supply even though it's a proprietary power supply to dell it can be upgraded if you have enough funds or you want to go with a dual socket system for example the funny thing about these power supplies is they go up to 1300 watts and even on today's market they can still cost a very hefty sum though since this was made for enterprise workstations it does already have two fans cooling in the front and quite a big cpu cooler so temperatures shouldn't be a problem the build quality and also the feature set is also quite impressive sporting six usb ports at the rear also onboard audio which spans to the front and also having an additional four usb ports as well as a mini dvd drive so in order to make this system fast by modern day standards we're also going to be adding in a 120 gigabyte ssd and a one terabyte hard drive for backup since this system here did include no drives and most likely when you find a system like this on the used market it's most likely going to either have very minimal drives installed or it's going to have no drives at all that's simply because the businesses that resell these do usually have contracts with the places that they source them from to secure erase the data and so even if you manage to find a whole system like this chances are it's going to have no os installed from the get go though what we're going to do from here on in since most of the components here on the desk are used except the ssd is we're going to clean this system up quickly and then also change the thermal paste on the cpu cooler and the graphics card and then finish off our system now that all our components are clean and looking really smick it's time to put this thing back together which will only take a couple of minutes since all we're going to do is put the gravis card in that blue slot there and then install the drives down there in the included drive bays which one of them perfectly fit for the ssd and one of them was made for a 3.5 inch drive bay uploading all the games it's all finished and ready to go but there's one problem and that is we've got this annoying windows is not activated message in the bottom right hand corner and all you guys have to do if you want to solve something like this is use the link in the

sk and then click apply and you'll get yourself 12 percent off they've also got heaps of different payment options i use paypal personally and i've never had a problem using this website link's in description below let's get back to the video so the first title we get up here is warhammer chaos bane and this is a role-playing game you can change your skills and you can see here on the mage and going through it all but the fps is really smooth in this title we're getting over 110 to around about 150 average fps depending on the scene during this title with the rx 480 so see here the rx 480 is being stressed at 100 in this title pretty much all the time and i'm actually recording now too and the one percent and 0.1 percent lows are very smooth as well so this is a total win for this setup in the first title but it's also a win in the fact that the temperatures are still under control even though you may think oh they're getting a little bit hot at 76 degrees that's not too much a problem considering we are stuffing this inside a case that was never really intended for this type of gpu but also it is somewhere where i'm at so as long as it's going under 80 degrees it's fine so of course you could probably lower the temperatures by just taking off the side panel and leaving that off for a few minutes that was a little bit harder than i thought and uh gpu dropped down four degrees already in the matter of 20 seconds just by taking that side battle off so we're now playing gta 5 and this is pretty much a similar story to warhammer chaos bane the gpu is pretty much getting maxed at 100 at all times and also another thing about this game is too i've decided to play it on high settings at 1080p and the reason for doing this is you guys have requested in a recent few videos that i play on high settings rather than testing on low settings or epic settings and i agree because this is a setting that i personally play at with all my titles and the reason being is i'm either doing one of two things i'm either pushing my hardware to the max which is either going to be saving me a bit of power or i'm getting the best visual experience for my current gear that's how i feel about high settings anyway gta 5 runs absolutely fine 1080p high settings blend here getting over 80 average fps and one set and 0.1 lows that are pretty smooth too so now we've got apex legends this is a sort of high and medium settings here at 1080p and uh fps is already looking good we've just landed i'll hit the benchmark so we can start seeing the 17.1 percent lows but uh let's roll around and uh see what fp let's see if we can find a gun first i just heard some gunshots i haven't played this game in a long time but one thing i know is fps is smooth there's a guy there okay i got wrecked let's go derek and derek got direct as well the looks of it all right anyway fps is smooth on apex let's move over now so we're now playing fortnite at 1080p high settings and it's actually a really smooth experience uh the 0.1 lows do occasionally dip here and there but i believe that's probably because we got it at a high settings though the game looks really good it plays really nicely you can see here we're averaging around 100 uh frames per second though one thing that does worry me is that there's this artifacting going on this is in dx12 but also when i opened it up in our dx11 it was doing it too so there must be something wrong at the moment with the game install in particular to this gpu because sometimes it just won't do it at all then other times it would just do it all over the place and i've tried down clocking the gpu and also uh down clocking the memory because sometimes if your graphics card is too aggressively clocked even out of the box it can cause this exact problem where it's artifacting but i'm guessing that's not the case because the other three games that we played were running perfectly fine really smooth it's just this one seems to be having a problem so if anyone knows this problem or they've seen it before then i do let us know how you fixed it or should i just wait for an update from fortnite itself because i'll try this graphics card on another computer to see if it does it on another computer and now we're at the finish line with the precision t3600 i did check the gpu out on my test rig and that was absolutely fine so it must have just been the fact that i installed a driver that was two days old versus the latest driver which came out two days later so i installed that one on the other rig tested out absolutely fine so the gpu was fine and those fortnite numbers will be pretty much the same as what you saw and to that degree every single title we put on this thing at 1080p high settings was smooth both with the one percent and the 0.1 percent lows except for fortnite they did go down a little bit but that's to be expected on dx12 which is what i ran it on when i was playing but it still didn't take away the fact that i could get some easy frags and still make some good plays with this pc right here and when we look at it the precision 3600 something like this there's also things like that hp elite desk where you can just buy these pcs and add in a graphics card add in your drives and you've got one of the cheapest entries into pc gaming as well as it being hassle free so for those people like oh you've got to go out and build your own computer pc gaming is really expensive this is the counter argument to that where it's not that expensive at all to get into pc gaming in fact it's cheaper to get into pc gaming than console gaming if you're willing to buy some used parts the funny thing is this is actually a lot easier to do than it is to go out and build your new computer and the reason for doing that is that we only had to add in a few small components and the extra step that you saw with the cleaning that i did here today really wasn't necessary the gpu was already clean the insides of this rig were already pretty clean as well and most likely if you pick up these enterprise solutions there's also like the hp elite desk and things like that that'll work perfectly fine you can get these and also get good power consumption what i was reading from the wall was about 250 watts while we were playing with this combination right here so super power efficient considering it's an 80 plus gold rated power supply which was a bonus that is going to be more efficient too so overall really impressive rig the one thing in the case of the precisions that you have to worry about is that side panel if you want to put it back on and you've got a bigger graphics card like the rx 480 that we used here today unfortunately you will need to do something about that handle inside the panel of course if you want to take care of your rig and you don't mind a little bit extra noise you just leave the side panel off as we saw in those games as soon as we took it off the temperatures dropped down instantly by 4 degrees i'm sure if i left that off for 10 minutes we would have got low 70s possibly into the 60 degree mark which is really good in the case of this whole rig so longevity i'd keep the side panel off anyway your mileage may vary but entry point into pc gaming it's done right here this is the easiest way in 2020 to get into pc gaming hassle free we did have to add that scd keys as well but what i've tallied up here is about 240 aussie dollars or 160 usd to get in to pc gaming with really good performance at 1080p and smooth performance too as we saw with those one percent and 0.1 percent lows the games were running really fine except when we tested fortnite in dx12 the 0.1 percent lows did go a little bit low but that did not stop me from getting frags and another thing too is with this price point it's great for a lot of people because if you don't want to invest too much in pc gaming say for instance you're like well i'm uncertain if i want to get into pc gaming and i don't want to spend too much money on it then this solution will be perfect as well because if you decide that pc gaming is not for you you can easily turn around and sell something like this for what you paid for it in a click of a finger though another thing too with this fps that you've got here on the table you can choose to lower it as well get more fps so if you want to get a cheap 1080p 120hz monitor then you can do that as well and you'll get even more of a smooth experience now funny thing is about pc gaming me personally i've always said in the past if you give me a 1080p monitor i'll be happy gaming on something this cheap even though i've got something like a 2080 ti in my main desktop which i use for editing videos i still have a passion for 1080p gaming i think once you step it up to 27 inch where you go to 4k 32 inch or you go to ultra wides that are 34 inch wide those uh start to give you sure a better visual experience the one thing about pc gaming is that a few years ago i stepped it up from a 120hz 1080p monitor to then a 1440p monitor and then to a 4k and then i tried an ultra wide as well and i noticed that although the visual experience sure was better i didn't particularly enjoy pc gaming that much more like i actually kind of enjoyed having that 24 inch monitor i thought it was a perfect size for pc games especially in the case of mobas like dota 2 i could see everything on the screen easy and i found especially when you went up to a 32-inch monitor things started to get too big and you'd miss things in battles and you'd actually start performing worse on a bigger monitor than you were on a smaller monitor so do let us know in the comments section below what your feelings are about pc gaming and different budgets and how you feel about different monitor sizes because i love reading your thoughts and opinions on that but speaking of thoughts and opinions we do have the question of the day which comes from hudson jackson ii and they asked just curious is bluetooth audio better than the cheap on-board audio this is coming off the back of the creative g3 review we did which was a portable usb add-in which i recommended for people who had really bad onboard audio or if they got laptop audio and basically bluetooth audio can either be better or it could even be worse than bad on-board audio as we saw those statistics what you're measuring when you measure audio objectively is you're measuring the end points what is going to go to your ears after that point and so as we saw with the laptop audio that was horrible i wouldn't recommend people listening to music on that particular device we tested and so bluetooth audio you have to test each individual piece i'm assuming that real cheap bluetooth audio could be just as bad as cheap on-board audio but ultimately it all depends on that last piece of gear and what's hitting your ears and the funny thing is some of these pieces of gear can be so bad for your ears and it's funny because if you put on a pair of glasses and it's way too blurry your natural reaction is to take those glasses off because you know that's going to damage your eyes the difference between sound is sometimes we're in situations where we've got to keep playing the game or we're with friends at a concert and we know that audio is bad that's coming into our ears but we choose not to get away from it and we keep being exposed to it but one thing i've learned to do is that when i walk into these situations i quickly walk out and so for instance when we go to a live concert if i walk into a live concert and they're using terrible speakers and you can hear it straight away you just know cheap audio after you've listened to it a heap of times and they're using real cheap gear and it's really loud i'll just walk away from that source and be like literally 10 meters away at least from that live concert as opposed to walking into a good live concert where they're using really good speakers you'll notice it straight away and that won't actually damage your ears a lot of the times it's actually not the loudness level that damages your ears but rather the distortion and the inequalization of those frequencies and that they have the tendency to spike and those spikes can really hurt your ears really quickly anyway guys do be careful with audio that's one thing i'll let you know but generally the more you spend on audio gear just like anything else in this world the better it's going to be generally anyway guys i've ranted on enough about audio do let us know what you think of this budget dell setup that we've got here on the desk 6 cores 12 threads rx 480 16 giga ram ssd hard drive all for around 160 usd in the comment section
