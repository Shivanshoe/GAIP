[Music] with christmas being only a few days away i've got a few tech yes pre-orders to get through as well as i'm going to be building up a couple of pcs for friends and family as well so today we're going to hit the road a little bit and vlog behind the scenes on all this stuff that has to get done here because it is a busy month but i've been trying to also relax too with cyberpunk 2077 released i mean it's hard to stay away from that game it's very good in terms of the storyline and all that stuff but if you're on ps4 my condolences if you want all the rgb you can't handle and more then the asrock x570 taichi razer edition is the motherboard for you with the 14 phase digital power design 7.1 channel audio wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5. this time rgb won't be the compromise links in description below to find out more so i just picked up a rampage xtreme x79 motherboard and they're saying this one was still brand new in the box i checked it out it looked like it was in really good nick if it had been open before and having the box still being 150 aussie dollars i had to get this because in the past i've sold one of these motherboards to a collector the rampage boards they're pretty much the only x79 boards or x58 and x99 rampage boards are pretty much the only models that if they're in the box they're worth a bit of extra because they're pretty much the elite models that the serious ln2 overclockers use so they're still in demand from ln to overclockers they're also still in demand from collectors so picking this up for 150 in the box i definitely scored here where i've sold one in the past and made quite a bit of profit on that uh for some reason it was yet again out in a little bit of a rural area as opposed to being in the city so maybe that's got to do with it but who knows tech yes on the road let's go to the computer store and see what they've got so we just got back now and i managed to pick up this last night it's a 1660 super i got that for 300 aussie and also scored a gtx 1070 for 150 so i'm starting to sort of any chance i get to get graphics cards at decent prices i will i've also heard as of yesterday 1660 supers have stopped production so that's going to be very interesting to see how the gpu market turns out i mean is there the is that rtx 3050 is that coming very soon if it isn't then man the gpu market's going to get even worse so this card right here was kind of a savior for the in australia there was a 300 price point in america 200 usd this thing stopped production and there better be an answer for it but we got this case right here we've done a building i picked up a 30-70 for it it's got four argb 140 mil fans and it's called the ar-140 and it's a little bit over 100 dollars but the airflow is amazing comes with three different ways to route rgb in terms of you've got a remote front panel led and you can wire it into the board if you wish to so i've sort of been just trying some new stuff experimenting a little bit and it definitely is looking really good so far but that's sort of what i got stockpiled here and then we just got that rampage bought on the desk and uh then we've got this right here this is the pc i put together and we just got the parts for it now it's a white case got a bit of rgb in it it's got a 10 100 f 16 gig of ram and a g gtx 1660 super as well so they're pretty popular now one thing we had to do with this build we got it all ready because it's coming with a aoc monitor i'm doing a little combo for them and uh this is this is the interesting thing here i didn't realize with this budget motherboard here the h410 you actually have no xmp profiles here so what we do if you've come into this situation where you've got no xmp profiles just grab your smartphone and or a camera if you don't have a smartphone and just go to the memory information and it'll actually tell you the xmp profile so then you can go from there especially with these sub timings they're very important for locking in a stable oc on your memory and uh since we're going with a 2666 megahertz limit here on the h410 we can then drop these timings down roughly by two notches and you'll still get very good performance out of this motherboard with a 10 100 f so we see here we've locked in all those timings from the memory information and -2 on each of them and then we've left all these sub timings pretty much the same and we've even dropped the command rate down to one because we've only got two sticks of memory so this here has enabled us to lock in a solid memory profile even off a board that doesn't have xmp support or any other features like that so there's that little work around there and of course the person who buys going to get absolutely amazing price performance and they're going to get a very good gaming experience it's smooth as well but what we're gonna do right now is there's a gtx 970 that's come up for a hundred aussie dollars so i'm gonna go pick that up right now but also there is four ssds i've got to go collect just little 120 gigabytes and they're going to go into four budget pcs i'm going to put together with those four budget graphics cards that we got on the previous parts hunt so if we can whack all those budget graphs cards in there we'll have like these entry level roblox gaming pcs if we include a monitor keyboard and mouse it's a good little combo sometimes that's all people want especially if they're on a budget so let's go hit the road yet again so we just got this gtx 970 right here for 100 bucks and it's time to go get those ssds and do we at the next day where i've got the four ssds and i had a pc that came through here and i had to quickly fix it up where it was only like i sold it a week ago and then it came back with a ram stick literally just like down the bottom of the case i sometimes you sell pcs and you just scratch your head put it that way but anyway on to finishing off the next four builds that we got here so we've lined them up where i'm going to be just giving them some techies loving cleaning them up and then putting in these four potato gpus and then just uh also four 500 gigabyte hard drives and the ssds and eight gigabytes of ram just to make out four little combos in preparation for christmas and over the holidays so it's kind of like at the moment i'm kind of doing two things at once and that is just getting stuff ready and then i also want to have a little bit of a break over christmas because i've been going all year on this like it's just been nuts 2020 has just been insane in terms of pcs and everything computer where i think we got that i guess everyone's just staying home now a lot more than they were used to and it's just caused this massive massive pent-up demand even for roadblocks gaming pcs let's get that techies loving underway [Music] and now we've gone through four computers they're all ready to go and this is going to be the final pc put together before christmas i am just going to show you my feeling right now and what's going on inside my head i'm at the finish line i've finished up all this stuff we've got these pc builds that have all happened here today with low end and high end and i'm completely burnt out i'm probably the most burnt out man on youtube in 2020 i've been going all year and i guess this last week as sort of like all the videos have just wound down i've been really just like my whole adrenaline has just been dropping off heaps and i'm it's good for me because i need to really rethink what is going on in the market at the moment and it's definitely i'm going to tell you guys straight away it's definitely a two speed market right now there's we're going to make it probably make this before the end of the year as well some dedicated pieces on used versus new and what's going on but i'm basically starting to sell more new pcs now that i'm selling used which is scary because i came in years ago when i came back to australia from japan and in japan i was just doing a lot of use price performance and there was always the used parts there but i'm finding now people are actually paying more on the used market for the same performance that they're getting new so things are really not making any sense for a guy like me who loves pure price performance and so that's one thing i've just had a hard time and the biggest one i'm going to just uh talk to you guys about is the i7 700 for example that one really baffles me as to why and you go on ebay completed listings for example you see the price of these cpus and it's just like wow the the pc market was never like this in the history of pc parts another thing we're seeing too is the gtx 1660 super i'm told that production has been cut on that model now that in australia that's a 300 aussie dollar card it's pretty much a staple card that's selling really well at the moment a lot of people go for it it's a good card solid value solid power efficiency and that card being cut off means what are we getting in its place in the us i think it's a 230 dollar card what do we have as an answer for that replacement is there going to be an rtx 3050 but is it going to be a bit more is it going to cost 260 us or 300 u.s and is it in australia is that going to cost 400 aussie dollars because now we're being priced into a different category with that and then there's the other factor that i've been looking at lately and that is the rx 570 and 580s 575.80 why are these cards still selling extremely well on the new market they've been out for ages like years and years and this is the first time for me since i started building pcs way back in the day this is the first time and this is a scary thing right i think a lot of tech other tech channels should look at this too is when we instead of being i guess a lot of us have been just being boggled and bamboozled by the amount of newer products coming out on the high end to stop and really have a think of what's been going on in the entry level and what i'm seeing here is it's just a complete stagnation and almost like a push into the higher end and don't get me wrong the higher end stuff like the 3060 ti that's good value right you're getting really good price performance in its category but in australia it's still a 700 aussie dollar card in america it's still a 400 usd card and so there seems like there's this push away from your used parts and your new stuff that's been on the cheaper end into this higher end segment and there's like no answer for it and we're still seeing rx570s and 580s and gtx 1060s on the news market for example still remain with their relatively high prices for how long they've been out on the market so coming into the latter half of this year these are all the questions that have been in the back of my mind and now that things are winding down i can finally start to focus on them and really start to stop and think and just give you guys my thoughts in a video and a vlog type content because you guys have really liked this vlog style content in the past and it's it's good for me i mean as my adrenaline goes down i really just i realize how burnt out i am i'm like damn i need to sleep a lot more but i've been doing well in terms of health and all that stuff don't worry about that but i've now started to take a real laid back and critical view of the market and what's really going on and that's one thing i've noticed now is the budget end is is going into a real haywire state where there is those two speeds and so with that we're going to be if the used market continues to be overpriced the way that i'm seeing it be overpriced where look you might be like well gtx 1070 for 150 brand that's an extremely good deal and yes that's a good deal but that's generally like what two years ago three years ago that's what you were generally just getting hit after hit on the used market a gtx 1070 now for 150 dollars that is rare in australia that does not come up like at all now because people know that they get 250 at least for it so that's kind of what's going on with the used market it's really been confusing me but at the same time it's because we haven't seen a push from the new market in this category to really make these cards where they should be at and that's 150 aussie bucks for a 1070. and in america 100 maybe 20 usd for a 1070 because that's where it should be in my opinion but that's not where it is and there it all is out on the table and it really feels good for me to get all these thoughts out because i've been sort of keeping them in the back of my mind but i do want to know what you guys think of the whole market in the last year it just has been a complete roller coaster for me personally trying to look at parts and stuff to the point where i got people now messaging me on an aliexpress video we did a over a year ago an all-out express build they're like damn i wish the prices were still like this and then they're messaging me now they're like well prices have changed and it's mainly on graphics cards and that's what we're going to notice the ddr4 ram and the ssds and the cpus they're all fine for prices it's just the one big thing and that's the gpus are setting everyone back now in terms of their costs and that's because we desperately need now more than ever a new answer to all these rx 570s and rx 580s that are still in fashion years later and without a slide i hope you guys enjoyed today's christmas whip up and vlog on just pct tech in general it's been definitely something i just like well i'll take the viewers with me what i'm doing behind the scenes what i'm thinking and if you guys enjoyed that one be sure to hit the like button for us and we've also got the question of the day here what's not it's kind of like in between a question and a comment and it's from mito and they ask can you try exploring the windows modded version like the ghost spectre i have it and it's amazing and it may help getting more fps and stability so i did notice a few of you guys commented on the recent windows 10 performance video we did where we tested the 2015 og just didn't really mod it at all then we tested a 2020 and we just did some quick like inspector disabled inspector and i think i did a few other quick things but you guys were talking about a youtuber called ghost spectre and he's doing some great work from what i've quickly checked out on his windows 10 guides so i'll have to check that out more and perhaps if it all works out we can do a collab for you guys and get you getting the most fps especially if you're on a potato or something like that who knows but i've looked it up and my first impressions do look pretty good anyway thanks for letting me know in the comments guys and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit that sub button ring i can do it again ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one very soon peace out for now bye [Music] you
