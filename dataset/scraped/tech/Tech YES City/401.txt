for a while here at Tech yes City you
guys have been requesting that I trade my way up to a high-end gaming PC, and
today marks the first episode of just that. Wwhere I'm going to be starting with
a 100 Aussie dollar budget... that's right if you guys are in the u.s. that's
roughly 65 USD, and what I intend to do in this series is try and get the best
deals possible and then flip whatever I come into and try eventually to have
enough money from this endeavor to get a high-end gaming PC now this will take
however long it takes and I may fail during the way and if I fail then this
series will come to an abrupt end, but if I do succeed and I do get that high-end
gaming PC then I'll be giving it away to one of you guys out there in the
audience so strap on in and put your used price performance capes on because
this is gonna get juicy and who knows by the time this series is finished we can
have an RTX 3080 inside this potential gaming PC [Music]
so straightaway if we need to make this work we need to make it work properly so
I have to give myself the best chance I have at turning this $100 into more
money so it's crucial for me to go with what I feel is a lot of Gamble's
straight away because the more chances we have and the more chances we have of
flipping up and what I mean by this is I've got five pcs that I bargained for
that we'll all untested and so when they're untested I'm pretty sure I'm
going to be able to pull out components like power supplies Ram motherboards and
CPUs and then be able to use those individual components to trade my weight
up to more money so ultimately the theory behind this is by getting a PC at
20 Ozzie dollars a pop that's untested yes I could run into faulty parts but I
feel like statistics is gonna average out in my favor
where overall I'm gonna be getting a lot more than I bargained for and also if
you guys remember dad man he wanted to come along for the ride and here we are
now back after picking up five PCs unfortunately I don't have any drives
with these systems so what I'm gonna have to do is if they work I'm gonna
have to advertise them as a PC or maybe if I can get like two or three pieces
together I can advertise them as working with no
drives so I've really hit the limit here and this is it this is what I'm left
with this case for example right here it's even got glass shattered inside it
like that's how that sounds sort of like untested some of this stuff is the case
is completely gone is as well I'm gonna have to remove all the stuff in here and
hope that some of it works but I did see that I 7 logo on the front so
automatically I thought yes that's a no-brainer I have to take that up for 20
bucks this one here I don't even know what's inside it we'll pull it apart
when we start testing it and find out what's inside though the rust on the
back there doesn't look like it's a good indicator but still hopefully be able to
pull out some parts but what we got here is three systems these are AMD systems I
believe older am-3 motherboards they got ddr3 which is good
the again the RAM might not work why not but one thing I'll point out is these
blue cables here I've never seen this on a power supply before and it's pretty
cool some of the stuff that came in on these older pcs for instance a little
while back I got this cooler on an X 79 HP motherboard it was like a water
cooler but it was a standalone unit it didn't have any sort of extended
external mounts you had to do and I believe coolermaster try to bring this
back with a water cooler of their own but it's funny to say that this stuff
was made years and years ago and yeah that's just another cool thing I came
into but these pcs here let's start booting them up individually and going
through piece by piece and seeing what we can restore them to and what they're
all about [Music] so the first PC could have not worked
out any better for us we have a phenom ii x4 945 so I believe that's a four
core processor eight gigabytes of memory even though it's missing one megabyte
there it's like 8 1 9 2 vs 8 191 that's pretty cool and then we've got the blue
cables and blue everything so I'm thinking I'll just try and touch this up
and that will be a sale in itself since it already has a graphics card too so
maybe we'll get away with like a $100 on this PC alone for a flip and get it back
our investment and we've got four more pcs to play with since the good thing is
the noise is really low like at least on boots so that's a good sign there's no
nothing rattling and have to replace anything and we've even got a DVD drive
that's like yep that's it done and we've got one down four to go and I'm gonna
let Megatron tell you how easy this is [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] so we're taking the motherboard out
clean the thermal paste off put some new thermal paste on cleaned pretty much the
cooler as well which was extremely dirty and we've got a signal so that is some
really good news considering we got an i7 2670 cooler 420 RZ dollars absolute
bargain and of course the RAM is not included that's just a test stick used
to test out things and make sure it all boots so now it's confirmed working I
can sell it and make a decent profit now the case and even the power supply from
this build I'm not gonna be touching that the power supply unfortunately had
glass in it as well and it's really hard to get all that glass out and have to
pull that whole power supply a pot and even then if there's just shattered
glass inside still it's just a risk that I don't want to place on someone else
considering it's a mediocre and random palace blight anyway I'm just gonna
leave those two things aside because we pulled out the cream of this deal anyway
and that is now two for two we've got three more to go
let's get this show on the road [Music] [Applause]
[Music] here is the mystery box now and it is
working absolutely fine we've got a core i5 2400 and 4 gigabytes of RAM at least
we've got a power supply working motherboard and cooler included so I
think we could kind of patch this up as a office PC but we're gonna have to tell
someone look you're gonna have to install your hard drive and they should
take it I mean maybe I'm thinking around $80 if we could get that for this PC
that would be pretty good because then we're turning that 20 into 80 not as
good as the other two before it but again I'm still happy because it works
that is three for three now I am on an absolute roll we've got two more to go I
could not be happier with how this first part is turning out so far because I
mean this is the hardest part episode 1 if things go wrong we could fail this
whole experiment but things are going really well I'm getting more confident
by the second this is what you're gonna be calling tech yes confidence [Music] [Music] and here we are now at four four four
this is an AMD Phenom x2 945 with eight gigabytes of memory and this time that
extra one megabyte is showing up the graphics card is a I think it's a 58 31
gigabyte and I had good memories in the past with the 5850 so big thing to see
how well this would run fortnight or something like that a 720p maybe I got a
feeling it could give out decent performance at that so what I'm thinking
with this one is like the other 100 Aussie dollars it's quiet
everything's decent the power supply is not like that bad should run this spec
but since it's getting a bit dark outside I'm gonna photo this latex I
want to get this clean before it gets too dark and see if this works
[Music] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
and here we have the last PC which is an FX 4100 and it's got 8 gigabytes of ddr3
memory it's got a GTX 460 as well and we did what we've never done really in the
past and that is just give us some tech yes loving light and we're gonna
trademark that now it's just a little quick and easy some people prefer it
quick and easy with their tech yes loving so this one definitely was
appreciative of a tech yes love and light and I just I can't believe we got
now since we're in Australia I mean if we're in America we might have to
advertise this is a a to call but since we're in Australia we can advertise this
as a true quad-core FX 4100 and we're gonna try for I'd see we're gonna go for
$100 you with this - I mean the cases are pretty clean and there's no noise
going on inside like the other three builds which is a really good thing I
can this is literally the best case scenario I could have imagined well
actually not the best I mean if I had hard drives in it that would be amazing
- but still we just got five four five here in terms of hits and this is going
to be photo time then we're gonna sit down and talk about the plan going
forward [Music]
and now we are at the conclusion of episode 1 where I honestly haven't been
this excited in doing any kind of content here on the channel in a while
it's sort of like the main thing is just these mystery boxes where you don't know
what's going to be inside you don't know what's going to happen there could be
any amount of problems but this is the thing we came out of this with the best
case scenario which I guess is why I'm even more excited than I should be
because like all these five builds just were quick and easy to get results out
of and nothing went wrong in the process so I'm absolutely loving what we've got
here on the table I'm hoping to turn this $100 into I'd say like if all
things go well in the sales around about $500 so we could 5 times our money on
this and if we then get that amount of money will then be able to juggle and
have a lot more wiggle room to start leveling up and trading up to that
high-end gaming PC so this marks Episode one the pilot episode if you guys
enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button but also going into
episode 2 we're gonna come back with what the results were in terms of
flipping this stuff and then we're gonna strategize for the next move that we're
going to make but another thing too is starting off we really don't have a lot
of wiggle room and going in with five untested PCs and coming out with these
results is there is that element of luck there definitely we got lucky and that's
a great thing because that this low like price points starting out on that
hundred dollars we've really got to make the most of this going forward I mean if
we come into problems which I'm sure we will when we've got a bit more money in
our pocket then that's really not going to be as much as a problem as it could
have been here in this first episode so that is just I don't know the tech gods
are looking down on me and they're obviously loving the tank yes loving but
I guess they want you guys as well to be getting in with a chance when this
high-end PC happens because I'm pretty confident coming out of this now that
this is going to happen and it's going to be really successful I shouldn't get
too far ahead of myself though because we still have to sell this gear
here and it is a pretty tough market at the moment for selling PCs it's a bit of
a downturn not just locally but also globally and with that aside do let us
know in the comments below what was your favorite deal out of these five pickups
today I'm gonna say for me personally looking at this even though it's not the
PC package and it probably doesn't look the best from the b-roll I'm going with
the i7 2600 mAh the boarding cooler I think it'll sell like that as opposed
to the other i5 box and the other three AMD boxes which aren't as popular I know
a lot of people are really hungry for even a 2600 when it comes to even brief
lipping gaming pcs so I'm hoping that some of the people that buy this will be
reflected themselves so I do see the demand for this stuff I got here today
as having some much higher demand than the $20 that I've paid for it though I
look forward to reading your thoughts and opinions and speaking of thoughts
and opinions we have the question of the day which comes from music daily one two
three and they asked is it a good idea to get a xeon e5 26 89 plus chinese
motherboard + RX 580 will it run the latest games in VR like half-life alex
and emulate legends of Zelda breath of the wild I think Bo TW I think it'll
emulate breath of the wild it's a pretty powerful CPU but the VR thinks since you
specifically mentioned that there you will want to go for 4th gen and higher
so even though the 2680 9 is more than capable especially it's a great combo
with a rx 580 if you want to play most modern titles in 2020 at 1080p for
example the CPU itself for VR I don't think 2nd gen officially supports VR in
that case you need native USB on three onboard so you want to get something
like if you're looking for a Z on budget choice you might want to take a look at
the recent coverage I did on the v3 haswell's which can be had with a cheap
motherboard as well and they can both be had on Aliexpress and then you can turbo
unlock them and just get so much more performance out of those CPUs especially
for the dollar but also on top of that the boards have native USB 3 and they'll
be VR ready hope that answers that question and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video and if you stayed this fought and you're
enjoying this new fresh content here at Tech es city then you know what to do
and I'll catch in the next one peace out for now buddy
