before we get into today's video first of 
all thank each and every one of you guys   for the 500k sub mark here at tech yes city it's a 
big milestone for me personally and thank each and   every one of you guys for hitting that sub button 
and supporting us over the years though that said   that's the positive news let's get into what is 
going to be the most awkward product review i   have done up until this date because in my opinion 
there's now external forces outside of the tech   scene that's really messing up the prices and that 
is of course i've spoken about this in the last   few months a thing known as inflation and to break 
that down for you guys in a very simple manner   that is is when there's so much money being 
created especially out of thin air that then   devalues the currency that we use which is dollars 
in australia be aussie dollars in america it's   american dollars and then in the uk it'd be our 
great british pounds so when there's a massive   creation of money especially when it's backed by 
nothing and it starts circulating into the economy   suddenly everyone has more money to buy products 
and the price of those products in nominal terms   goes up and i believe we're now starting to see 
this effect come out in front of our very eyes   and that is with the 1199 usd msrp of the 3080ti 
especially when we compare that to the 699 msrp   that we got with the 3080 last year and in fact 
these cards in terms of their size and also   their weight and the cooler being used are almost 
identical in that they share the same footprint   i'll put the dimensions and also the weight of the 
30 ti up on the screen for you guys but now back   to the pricing which we're going to be talking 
about this before we get into the numbers so if   you guys want to skip ahead to the gaming numbers 
i'll put the chapter in the description below but   i feel like pricing and supply is a huge factor 
here considering the little sibling the rtx 3080   is actually coming back into stock here locally 
where i am but it's pretty much double the msrp   of what it was when it's first released now nvidia 
are directly trying to address the pricing issue   themselves and they're putting on the 3080 ti 
what's known as a low hash rate limiter and this   is affecting the dagger hashimoto mining algorithm 
if you want to mine on a ethereum miner or if   you want a mine with nice hash then the rates of 
ethereum on this card have dropped significantly   versus that of even a 30 80. however the other 
algorithms are still available and they will mine   at quite profitable levels but as i've said in the 
past i'll put a link to a video up here the mining   profitability of these other cards if they were 
to get flooded by the sheer hashing power from the   ethereum market it would drop the profitability 
down significantly so i think that's why nvidia   have really only bothered to target ethereum 
mining with the release of their low hash rate   limiter which i'm also told is a hardware level 
solution so the low hash rate limiter imposed by   nvidia will help curb the problem but the problem 
will still exist regardless because miners will   pretty much target anything as long as mining 
profitability is profitable now there's another   group added in there of course that's the scalpers 
as long as supply is low scalpers will be doing   everything they can to secure a card especially 
close to that msrp price if they can get them   from retailers who are trying their best to keep 
prices low then they'll just go on ebay and resell   them too so now we know on these graphics 
cards there's three different types of buyers   that is the gamer the crypto miner and the scalper 
we can easily see that at current msrp levels   there is not enough supply to meet that demand 
so what this traditionally means would be either   two things and that is the buyer either gives up 
trying to buy one of these cards or there's supply   to alleviate the problem but then if we throw 
in the third problem that we spoke about before   and that is inflation we can see that we're 
met with a third external force that no one   seems to be talking about are these two and a 
half thousand dollar prices going to become a   new norm and that is really only something that 
the central bank themselves would know but in the   meantime i am holding on to my little friend 
who will protect me against that third factor though let's get on to the 3080 ti finally and 
talk about the performance where this card will   come very close to that of an rtx 3090 looking 
at the 1080p gaming numbers we can see here this   card is nearly chart topping only slightly 
bested by that at the 30 90. moving through 1080p   the nvidia and amd cards do trade blows but that 
3080 ti is coming out near the top and then over   to call of duty cold war this was more of a title 
for amd at 1080p in terms of its relative price   point versus the other price point of the cards at 
least at msrp and then on to f1 2020 i decided to   test this game at dx11 for nvidia because they get 
more fps and then dx12 for amd where they get more   fps over dx11 a bit of a weird dilemma with this 
game but the 3080ti yet again performs very close   to that of the 3090. and then the last title will 
go up here is shadow the tomb raider and i'm sure   at 1080p there are some cpu limitations starting 
to come into play especially at the highest   graphical settings though under 1440p we are at an 
in between here of course in between 1080p and 4k   and you can start to see that the memory 
bandwidth on especially the 380ti and 3090   does start to stretch its legs a little bit 
versus the amd counterparts as well as even   something like the 3080 which is where this 
car does have the same bandwidth available   as its big brother the 3090 also f1 2020 the 
performance is really solid especially if you're   playing at 144 hertz or 165 hertz and you want 
to leave the detail absolutely maxed though 4k   is easily where the party is happening on the 
3080 ti now at the back of the card you've got   that hdmi 2.1 it's going to support full rgb 444 
120 hertz 4k with that extra bandwidth and this is   where this card really does shine as well as the 
amd counterparts the 6800 xt and the 6900 xt they   do a great job of 4k 120 hertz too they're going 
through these four titles this is where the gddr6x   and the bandwidth on the 3080ti and the 3090 do 
start to pull ahead of the amd counterparts and   even that of the 3080 and what i'm going to show 
you guys here with the shadow of the tomb raider   was i'm going to include the overclocked numbers 
and the underclocked figures where the overclocked   numbers on this card were really impressive if 
you're into dabbling into overclocking a little   bit especially if you get a water cooled 3080 
ti then you can really extract some really high   fps and in fact it was comfortably beating the 
30 90 by a lot and if we contrast that to the   power consumption that you're going to use we can 
see here that the under volt is one to consider   two if you like to save power but you still want 
to get really high fps of 4k and of course that   overclock uses up a little bit more power but it's 
definitely going to give you some of the best fps   you can get period on pc gaming though we'll pull 
up some dlss numbers here as well as ray trace   numbers where in fortnite if we look at the ray 
tracing the 3080 ti does struggle a little bit if   it was one test i could pull up that does start 
to show that perhaps the 12 gigabytes of vram   is a limitation on the 38 ti versus the 3090 this 
would be the test where i did start to notice a   little bit more choppiness versus the 3090 but 
if we then turn on dlss both at the 4k native   and the 4k with ray tracing on we can see here 
the performance boost especially with the ray   tracing on is significant and it does push it into 
the realm of a smooth experience even with epic   settings and then moving on to call of duty 
this is with ray tracing on you can get a   smooth experience as well if you're happy playing 
at 4k 60 but if we're looking at 4k uh 120 hertz   or 144 hertz having the dlss on balance gave us 
a really nice picture but gave us fluid fps at 4k   so at the moment with ray tracing and dlss 
it does depend on the title for me personally   i really liked dlss and ray tracing in cyberpunk 
2077 i thought that was when the two came together   but most the time i will leave ray tracing off and 
i use dlss on the balanced order quality profile   at 4k to get that extra detail but still get 
smooth fps now amd have recently announced their   fsr technology we'll have to wait and see how 
that performs in relation to dlss but hopefully   amd can get that out soon because at the moment 
when you turn the dlss on it does give nvidia a   massive advantage at 4k so now that we are done 
with the performance figures it's time for a   few critiquing points on the graphics card itself 
now the weight of the card is coming over 1300   grams but i feel like a card of a flagship of 
this nature you would want a bigger cooler where   i thought the 3080 was just cutting it but since 
this does use up a bit more power the noise and   i'll pull up the noise and temps the temperatures 
were getting a little bit high here going into 74   degrees and the noise was quite noticeable at 43 
decibels so if you're paying a premium for a card   like the 3080ti i would like to see something in 
between the 3080 and the 3090 in terms of cooling   and the size of that cooler that's adopted because 
the 3090s cooling performance as well as the sheer   size that thing worked extremely well it was one 
of the best coolers i've seen on a graphics card   period and then the 3080 was okay but however 
this does use up a little bit more power and the   two 90mm fans even though the design does work as 
proof with the 3090 versus some other really big   3090 cards the 3080 does i feel need a bit more 
metal as witnessed with the 100 fan speed versus   80 fan speed as we can see a big drop there and 
basically if that drop from 80 percent versus 100   fan speeds isn't as big as it is here then that 
means the cooler doesn't need the faster fan   speeds which basically means there's enough metal 
on board to do the job also included in the 3080ti   founders is the 12 pin to 2 8 pin connectors 
and that's located in the middle of the card   and it goes on as such but it does 
block out your side profile a little bit   if you were to try and mount the 3080 ti i would 
suggest vertically mounting it and that would look   the best where the inside of cart has some slight 
led glow as well as the geforce logo lighting up   with a glow of its own ultimately the founder's 
card it does provide the fps and now it is time   to give you guys a conclusion and my thoughts on 
this card right here and if we're looking at the   1199 msrp you're going to see that versus the 
3080 the 3080 at 699 msrp was a much better buy   and so the 3080ti it leaves it in that field of 
well we've just now got to look at street pricing   because i feel like nvidia have just said okay 
1199 is what you can expect it to come in from   but we've got no idea when it will come in from 
that and i believe the 1199 usd price point we   all know the card is going to come in much higher 
than that and the market is going to pretty much   price this thing at possibly around 2 000 usd and 
in australia i'm predicting it to come in stock   around two and a half thousand aussie dollars 
and that's just being realistic based on what   i'm seeing especially in relation to the pricing 
of the rtx 3080. now industry insiders say   with the amount of current demand that basically 
you can expect this to go on even another year   if the supply isn't increased to match the massive 
amount of demand but i'm predicting prices could   go even higher if the money printing continues 
and as long as these massive six trillion dollar   stimulus bills are announced and interest rates 
stay near zero we're all going to be feeling   the pain of higher prices and i'm starting to 
witness this from anything from my local bakery   to things like bananas and gasoline prices 
here locally everything is going up and the   graphics card going up as well is just another 
side effect of that so what can one then do   in this environment and the answer to that would 
probably what i'm doing anyway if you want to save   that is save in something other than dollars and 
that's what i've been doing recently and actually   in the last four months i've been educating myself 
heavily on the topic because as a person who likes   to save rather than borrow i have been called 
out in a weird predicament during this whole   inflationary cycle that i feel is coming and is 
being especially under-reported by news outlets   anyway before i get on out of here i'm not going 
to sugarcoat anything this card right here the   pricing is just going to be completely messed up 
but if you can get one and i'd say if you can get   one closer to that msrp and you can afford it and 
that's what you really want then i would go for it   because who knows when all this madness will end i 
have no idea i don't have a crystal ball and again   i think the only people that can give you that 
answer are the central banks hope you've enjoyed   today's review if you did then be sure to hit that 
like button for us and if you've got any questions   or comments about today's review be sure to drop 
them in the comments section below but with that   said we do have here the question of the day which 
comes from jordan stride and they ask hey mate   how do you find these pcs so cheap i'm in brisbane 
and can't find any deals and answer this one   directly if you see a good deal especially in 
the current climate we're in in 2021 then you   have to be quicker than you've ever been before so 
when i see a good deal i pretty much sweep it up   as quick as i can and speaking of sweeping up a 
deal do you guys think if this card was priced   at say 1500 aussie dollars or 1200 usd would you 
sweep it up at that price point versus what it   realistically is going to go on to the market for
