hey man I'm looking for a piece saying it's gonna have four cores eight threads 24 threads that's how many cores and threads tech yes citizens you are going to be getting in today's used meets new PC now we're using the TD 500 mesh from coolermaster they're coming into the game with the RGB fans pre-installed into a case that it supposedly has good air flows we'll be putting that to the test later on in this video let's talk about some of the parts that's going in this wall you use amazing gaming PC that's also going to be a workstation PC since we've got 32 gigabytes of RAM we're putting in a 2 terabyte nvme SSD and we got a 2060 subha let's get this party started you just filled a new pastry board a motherboard of Amazon now Express eBay doesn't matter where you bought the board if you're looking for a cheap Windows 10 single and x64 user license then today's video sponsor s CD case has you covered for as little as 15 USD using the coupon code to ICS K in the description below you can save 12 percent in all you do is once you get that key bang it in click activate and you're good to go links in description below this right here is the 2060 super 8 gigabyte now the good thing about the RTX series at least with this one in particular is it's the cheapest card coming into the r-tx lineup with 8 gigabytes of vram in a straight you can currently pick these up for 650 Aussie dollars in the u.s. they're about 399 USD and honestly given the circumstances in the world right now this isn't too bad a price though going through some of the other components here of course the 12 core being the 26 78 v3 we took a look at this in a separate video put the link up here where you're getting 12 course 24 threads of Haswell IPC which supports all the latest and greatest functions but it's coming in at a price point that practically everyone can afford and the gaming performance as well as the workstation performance is really good now another good thing about this CPU is that the motherboard for it is only 76 bucks and also the RAM we can get away with using 2133 megahertz which is coming in at 120 dollars for thirty two gigabytes of this stuff so everything from the start to finish in this build just screams budget workstation but we're still using the quality since we will be using a V 650 watt doll powers play as well as using a low-profile Noctua cooler which has downdraft air to blow air over the vrm to keep the motherboard cool as well as the CPU so in terms of how much this thing costs I'll put the Aussie and the US dollar pricing I'll appear on the screen for you guys with outside we've got a build to quickly finish and then test the temperatures and see how it performs let's get this party started for the second time now though I do wudu party said the RT X 2060 super and his lazy dopey and confused voice [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now here is the final build completed and I gotta say this case is a looker in itself and what we decided to do here is put in a Redux knock shoe or fan just to match this silver cooler here sort of give it a bit of a stealthy kind of look in the process and there's another reason for that and that is if we added another argb fan in this case unfortunately we've only got the three prong included with this case which hooks up to the three front RGB fans in the controller so if you want to hook it in a fourth additional a RGB fan then you're gonna need either a splitter or another control unit which is just gonna add to the cost really isn't gonna give you a whole lot extra in terms of bling so what we've done here is since it's a value orientated sort of bling worthy case we're essentially doubling down on that value orientated bling and using the Nakia Redux as the outtake now because this is a v3z on build we're going to want to set this boot option 1 to UEFI we're going to have to do a UEFI install in order to unlock all our turbo multipliers and then after that we're gonna have to do a few additional steps which I've done in a complete two tour and I'll put the link up here we're essentially we load in our own custom by us and then we insert our own code into this UEFI install and then we're good to go in terms of getting 3.3 gigahertz on all 12 424 [Music] so now this build is all finito damn Dido we've done the temperature tests on both the GPU and the CPU and I've got to say I am blown away by these numbers because what we've got here is a case that's on the CPU stress test we're getting one degree lower with the side glass on and then on the GPU test we're getting the same temperatures with tempered glass on versus off and so what this means basically is that this case is really well designed in that the mesh at the front allows air to breathe in easily you also got that fractured mesh design which is I guess it's coming in in 2020 it's a new look depending on which angle you look at it you're gonna get the light sort of scattering off the mesh in different ways but the noise is also extremely quiet in this case now keep in mind we are using a knock Shore exhaust fan here which does make a big difference in my opinion but that being said you're getting a case with an enclosed power supply shroud and pull cable management at the back you have the ability to mount at 280 or 360 mil right at the front and the top and on top of all that there's no sharp edges and building in this thing is just extremely easy to do anyone can build in this thing you have no problems whatsoever so there really is nothing to critique about this except you'd want to go out and get a good exhaust fan but that being said it'll work with pretty much any high-end system and the price for this case is coming in at a really good target so basically summing up the TD 500 this thing is an absolute winner at its price point you also get that RGB remote included so if you don't have an RGB header on your motherboard then you can use that to control your RGB the problem with that is though is that you will have to be able to access the switch but as you can see I've just got it on color cycling and I've just put the remote at the back of the case with the side of cable and another thing is too is it doesn't have native support for a vertical mount on the side here on the PCIe but most vertical mount kits that you get anyway can utilize the existing PCIe brackets to vertically mount up that waste so a massive w here from coolermaster on this case right here but that being said let's get some games installed and see some FPS on this banger right heel [Music] [Music] and we just finished testing out all those games in in fortnight and also Call of Duty I even just left the capturing on walls benchmarking and so the FPS here over a hundred and forty in cod war zone so if you're gone with a 144 Hertz monitor it's gonna pair really nicely with this combo and then we step it up to fortnight we've got over 240 FPS we're seeing there on average 270 FPS on competitive settings and I've tested fortnight in the past and what you want to do is even if you're playing for big money you'll get a 240 who it's monitor and then cap the game as in frame setting at 240 and then from there you'll be getting the best input lag coupled with DX 12 then I stepped across to dota 2 and we're getting around 185 FPS and the 1% in point one percent loads across all these three games are also really good too so really smooth experience with this 12 core and also the RT X 2060 super so of course keep in mind if you want to go with a build like this then you will have to do that v3 unlock hack which takes about 10 minutes once you know what you're doing but of course if it's your first time it could take you about an hour even two hours to get your head around the whole process but that said we've got now a build that looks really good it's got the 12 core 24 thread advertisement so if I go to resell this thing it's not only going to look really good with that 12 cores it's also gonna have a 32 gigabyte branded option there as well as a 2 terabyte nvme SSD someone is gonna lose it when they see this adult for sale and the best thing about this whole thing is it really didn't break the bank a whole lot we came over in US dollar terms just over a thousand bucks in Australia were coming under that 2k mark and I do feel the pain right now like prices of hardware's going up but if we sort of circumnavigate the murky waters then we can find out what good deals are still out there and pick them up and really make some magic happen because I'll tell you guys something about SSDs at the very least I'm speaking to some direct contacts in China about prices and SSD prices as well as ddr4 memory that stuff's going to be pretty much normal very soon it looks like the supply chains are absolutely fine there but the funniest thing is the oddest thing out of it all is that ddr3 RAM prices have gone up in price and they don't look like they're coming down to prices that will say we saw four months ago anytime soon so that's the most interesting thing so that's why in today's build we went with that ddr4 memory combo because it really doesn't cost a whole lot more than ddr3 at this point in time if you're buying some brand new Ram speaking of that x99 atomizer board that we used however that thing's ok you'll definitely want to use like we did here a downdraft cooler get some cooling on the vrm if you're using a 12 core but that being said it did an okay job I mean it supports MDOT too as well which was a big bonus for a $76 motherboard and of course you've got eight solder ports on there you've got USB three if you want to do VR with this thing and you've also got the Haswell avx2 instructions and all that latest jazz to go with this thing so it ended up checking out B okay and I do say be because the onboard audio does leave a little bit more to be desired there in that it was very tinny so if you do pick up this motherboard you're serious about gaming or doing anything else for that matter and you're not using the HDMI or DisplayPort audio then do you get yourself either an external DAC or a sound card and with all that out of the way we've got another tech yes special here that is we've got the bling we've got the price performance and we've got these solid deets on the spec sheet honestly this thing even smells good they do let us know in the comment section below what you think of this thing is I love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and I mean would you improve something would you change something of course would you go with the cliche rise an option I want to hear it all in the comments and speaking of hearing at all we've got the question of the day which comes from saying it Tran and they asked Windows 7 can use this guide I use one and zx9 90 fe5 2670 83 and they're a friend of the v3z on unlock tutorial and basically with Windows 7 I have no idea because I've been using Windows 10 for quite a long time now if it was to work on Windows 7 you're gonna have to do a Windows UEFI install that's the most important thing if you can't do that then it's not gonna work on Windows 7 but if you can then you can try our booting up into shell from your boot disk and then use that update the micro code and go from there and it could possibly work I just haven't tried it personally maybe someone who has used it in the past and got it to work with Windows 7 can help you out in the comments and with all that out of the way if you guys have been enjoying this content and you stayed this far and you're not yet subscribed you want to see the videos as soon as they drop here at Tech yet City and then the sub button ring that Bell if down there and before I get on L er do you go to apologize I have been in a little bit of a hiatus lately basically you haven't seen me and that's because I've went through the proverbial Tech yes down on now we're coming on the way back up fellas so get ready for the awesome content and I'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] you
