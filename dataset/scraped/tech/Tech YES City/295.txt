recently i'm scrolling through twitter and i'm seeing these notifications pop up about amd announcing a bike and that's right this is their response to nvidia is to just say hey guys just go outside like stop stop playing on pc games all together we've got the solution for you with a bicycle and uh that's our response to nvidia we also have the announcement of an announcement they're going to talk about these gpus at the end of october and this still links into that end of november rumor that we've been hearing about so september 2020 could easily be described as the month of jensen so far and the announcement of the rtx 3000 series the mp announcement just rattled through all of the internet and it has really made waves to the point where i'm pretty sure everyone cannot wait to get these results for rtx 3080. but after looking around on twitter and on youtube i see that no one's really touching on this topic of the bike it's almost like people just in 2020 they don't want to touch on amd they're like whoa amd we do not want anything to do with those fanboys out there they're they are pretty relentless i'm going to say that so besides the announcements if you go to amd's website where they've uh put on their store a mountain bike which looks like 26 inch and it's retailing at 299 and you've got a few different colors which uh they look i gotta say like look they look pretty cool but when we look closer because i used to be into bmx's and uh bikes pretty hardcore there is something quite a bit wrong with this 299 price tag in my opinion to the point where you can get something which at least on the spec sheet looks better at 177 bucks so straight away looking at this bicycle right here there's a few things that strike out as being not just like mediocre but actually quite cheap on this bicycle and that is v brakes so you can see them here the old school v brakes these are very dated nowadays most bikes use at least value bikes we'll use disc brakes on both front and rear and so we can see here that they're using the cheaper brakes and also when we look up here on the handle we can see that they've got the quill style stem and most bikes nowadays will have a threadless stem even at 299 bucks so kind of surprising why they've done these two options but if we go through as well more on the bike we can see that they've used twist grip shifters these are very old school as well and then the component and the gearing just looks like it's outdated as well and then if we look closely at the frame we see here if you've ever worked on bikes before it's kind of got a nickname at least where i am locally it's called plumber's pipe basically a cheaper grade of steel that's hollow so this bicycle at 299 bucks is basically looking like to put it quite simply garbage so first of all why release something to your fans so it is this is the amd fanstore.com why release something to your fans that is really not worth 299 bucks i mean should do a little bit better of a job at least putting in some of the more modern components on this bike to sell to your fans like your fans of all people right people who it's like me um selling my subscribers like not even doing like over charging them for pcs that i'd regularly sell on facebook i kind of don't get the message there it's something that i wouldn't do personally so i mean why are you guys doing this to your fans and i mean look i love the message i love the message don't get me wrong i think we definitely gotta focus on your health and try and make a healthier lifestyle but it comes at a little bit of a weird time when uh the competitor is definitely making strides in terms of what they've announced and the price performance that their new cards are going to be coming in at and so that leads us to segway into rdna 2 and what is amd going to do here because all we've got so far really is a heap of rumors and we've also got in fortnite 6000. that's like i saw some articles on this and i'm like watching it i'm like yeah obviously their next generation of gpus is going to have a higher number than the previous generation look i can read some numbers but i'm really hanging out here for some kind of performance tease or something in how these cards are going to perform because all we've got so far is just nvidia just completely wiping the floor in the gpu market where it looks like even intel which were going to talk about their gpus have suddenly gone all quiet we've also got the announcement where they're going to talk about zen 3 cpus which is going to be awesome in its own right but today we're looking at the gpus where we've got the radeon gpus being talked about at the end of october which does give strong credibility towards the end of november launch of the new rdna 2 gpus but as a pc gaming enthusiast we need something we need a taste of these new gpus nvidia's just wiping the floor and so i'm sitting here like thinking to myself what is amd going to do about this and from all's we know right now is that rdna 2 is coming at the end of november that's what i've been told it's coming in late november and apparently board partners haven't even got the cards to make custom coolers yet so with that said it looks like it's going to be quite a rushed release which i hope it isn't because rushed releases mean that you can have potential driver problems there could be issues with coolers and if we remember the r9 290 days those things were getting extremely loud and extremely hot so when it comes down to it amd sure there's the argument of amd is behind in terms of r d versus nvidia but at the end of the day it's still not our problems as individuals we are just the customers who work hard make money and we want to buy stuff to enjoy ourselves in our free time and if amd isn't pulling up just like intel isn't pulling up in the cbu market then they're going to fall behind and it's not up to you guys as consumers to buy the underdogs part because they can't get their shit together for me personally i just buy whatever's going to work best for me at the time and i don't look back i make that decision and i'm happy with it no regrets so with amd at the moment i think they're in a tough spot like sure they have the console market but the console market is already starting to get overshadowed by the pc gaming market big time and that's why i feel nvidia did make this big preemptive step with ampere i feel like they wanted to take away from all the thunder that was going to come later in the year with consoles i feel like they've really hit two birds with one stone with this earlier announcement and so what is going to come through the next year with amd it remains to be seen but it's kind of like nvidia always seemed to be one step ahead of amd in terms of what they're doing in the gpu market and so i'd really like to see amd make a comeback but i just feel at this point in time their retaliation and how they've responded to nvidia does say a lot more than what we're talking about and that is they haven't really got a response because perhaps they don't really have a counter to the ampere and the rtx 3000 that's just my thoughts and what i'm seeing at the moment because if you had something you would try and at least tease something to at least lure people away who are going to be buying the upcoming rtx 3000 and lure them over to your camp saying hey we've got this and it's ready to go and it's going to perform like this instead we're just saying nothing so that's what actually worries me is what's not being said as opposed to what's being said in response to ampere anyhow guys with all that aside we've got the question of the day here which comes from neon genesis and they asked what would happen if you put both ddr3 and ddr4 in at the same time and they're referring to uh the video we did on the one and x99 board and i'm looking at this question i'm like i'm curious as well let's go quickly do it so there's the ddr3 there is the ddr4 let's hit the uh turn on button see what happens watching the postcode carefully well um okay so just an error message that was like really uneventful i was hoping for like either fireworks or we get some kind of signal nope hopefully that answers that question and if you guys are enjoying that content then be sure to hit that like button and also if you stayed this far be sure to smash that sub button ring that bell and i'll catch you in the next one but also let us know in the comment section below what do you think about the whole nvidia versus amd thing right now i mean i've said it in previous videos i just think the gpu market is getting really exciting now hopefully amd has a big answer for ampere but i mean i've just got to call it as it is at this point in time i'm just calling it as it is so it doesn't look too promising that's all i'm gonna say anyhow i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] yes
