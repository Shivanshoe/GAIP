so if you want to get into the PC reselling business there's been a few videos coming out lately from my channel I also another few tech tubers have done some videos of their own and one in particular you guys were telling me about in the last 24 hours that was random gaming in HD where he sold 4 pcs over three weeks and his profits were really bad now honestly me personally I watched the video and I appreciate the way he's marketing things I think a lot of people in the tech tubing space would appreciate his ad and the honesty in there though you can still be honest and put your product in show it in the best kind of way possible so today we're gonna go through this ad and also go through the PC itself and I'm just gonna give my opinion on the ad and also the PC itself and things that I would do differently on both of these so let's get into this juicy video and see what's up and also for the record I like RG and HD a lot and make sure you like his video too [Music] so firstly we're gonna go through the PC itself and things that I would do differently and he's basically got a budget of two hundred and fifty pounds which would be close to around 300 USD give or take and so what you're looking at here is a dual core ask lon three thousand G now this has the GPU portion built-in but the problem is is that it doesn't have that stronger graphics performance even something like a gtx 750ti which you could get in on this budget would beat this GPU by quite a bit and the next thing that they've done in this PC that I would do differently would be they've used the dual core which we should be using a full core even if it's an older i5 people like that fact that it's got four cores over to cause even though it's got four threads it's only got two cause and people think of that and especially in 2020 as a real big negative now I'll go over to the RAM a gigabytes of ddr4 memory is actually really good at this price point three thousand mega Hertz if anything will get onto the ad soon but that should be a strong point that our G is really focusing on in the ad though for what it's worth he's also put it in dual channel which is really good and you want that on an Athlon 3000 G now of course the Vega 3i GPU graphics that's tied in with the CPU itself making it an APU that's nothing special but he also does show the FPS performance of this at the end of the video and it does do around 60 fps at 720p the next thing is done here that I would do different I did a lot different personally he's out of it in quite a good power supply this is a big quiet system power 9 500 what IPS you now these power supplies themselves they're great for things like ITX 2070 supers Verizon 5 3600 combos but on this budget you can really get away with a budget 350 watt power supply and people really aren't gonna care a whole lot so you could have saved yourself some money there and also the next thing here is he put it in a 480 gigabyte SSD now these are a little bit expensive and you can definitely get away with even like a 120 gigabyte SSD and a secondhand five during you buy hard drive this is a very popular combo for something say at least in Australia under 500 Aussie dollars around to 300 us this is absolutely fine people are gonna look at four hundred eighty gigabyte SSD and they're probably not even going to know a lot of the times what an SSD is versus a standard hard drive and I know you guys watching out there in the audience you're gonna be like what's scratching your head but we'll talk about that soon when it comes to the marketing side of things but the next thing is done here is used a sigma tech arrows RGB mid-tower case this is really nice I like this case I think this is the probably the best component of the whole build and that's because it's I know for a fact Xigmatek over in the UK I deliver some hard value when it comes for cases so it's got a bit of RGB bling it's got that rear exhaust fan all included I'm guessing the price point of this case is really good too so for the case is absolutely nailed it and also for the motherboard at this price point if you're going with the budget AMD build you can definitely go with an a320 and they're going to do absolutely fine and I've already tested even the likes of horizon 530 600 on an a320 and it does perfectly fine now the build cost of this PC was around 250 pounds but the build cost is actually kind of irrelevant as opposed to the final sale price what people are prepared to pay for a gaming PC that performs at X level so what we're looking at here is something that'll perform better for example that I know off the top of my head will perform better but cost me less to put together so for instance I'd put together something like maybe an i-5 3470 we've now got four cores we can market that a little bit harder I'd also leave the RAM at 8 gigabytes in dual-channel and then also look at something like an h-60 one motherboard and then for the GPU go with the gtx 960 and something like a 350 watt power supply never the drives as we said before go with a 120 gigabyte Estate 500 gigabyte hard drive if you can't find a 120 gigabyte SSD or they're too expensive at the moment this is a special thing related to CV I would go with just maybe a 1 terabyte hard drive so now something like this from my experience would cost under 200 pounds to put together and we can sell it for around the same price point of 300 pounds our profit over a hundred pounds per pop so if he sold four of these pieces he would then have made four hundred pound at least that's just my recommendation and what I'd have in experience two reselling pcs he also said in the video that he had to sell online and pay online fees as well as shipping costs and that brought his profits down dramatically where he was only making around seven pounds a PC which is roughly ten US dollars of PC which really isn't worth the time especially if you've got a guarantee that and go through the risk of having that getting returned if the buyer gets it and there's a problem the loss PC almost sold at a ten percent discount but still made much more profit of twenty six pounds versus the seven because he didn't have to pay any shipping fees or he didn't have to pay any online sell a website fees so before we move on to the ad the best thing you can do here is sell locally if you can you're going to maximize your profits as well as minimize your headaches on top of that you've got control of everything going on as opposed to eBay you don't know who you're selling to and you don't know what kind of stuff they could make up and when it comes to online selling I've definitely seen my fair share of over the years so get the best deals sell locally let's get on to the next pot and that is advertising this PC that I quickly wrote up and we'll go over this and some of the strong points of everything that I feel makes this ad much better than the original and let's go first off are you after a PC that comes in at a very good price point so straight away we're saying that this 200 or 300 pound price point that random gaming is advertising at is a very good price point so straight away we're staying off the bat with positivity we then move on to and can play games 60fps on HD graphics now believe it or not HD is actually 720p and 1080p is Full HD though of course HD graphics sounds amazing 60fps sounds solid too especially this price point and then we put in the brackets games like fortnight and csgo so we have excluded overwatch and that's because people who generally play blizzard games know how to build a PC so there's no point even advertising that most people are gonna come for see us go on fortnight much more than they would come in for overwatch so we're just gonna stick with those two games and again we're gonna keep the clutter in this ad to a minimal that's another thing too we don't want to confuse the buyer sometimes less is more but let's continue on are you also after a PC with all new components and a solid upgrade path so again we're focusing on the advantages here from what I see in the video it is all in your components I don't think random gaming touched on this whether or not it did touch on this but we're also saying look it's got that solid upgrade path and which it does and if so then this is the PC for you and Windows is pre-installed ready to go so you just come pick it up and plug the PC up and you were gaming instantly again focusing on that commodity that we talked about before this PC is just ready to go everything's good comes with Windows pre-installed now let's quickly just move over to the specs here we've got CPU and GPU Athlon 3000 G it's authentic AMD 2 C 4 thread so basically what we've done here we've added the adjective authentic and makes people think like oh wow this is this is authentic right so yeah that's what AMD called SCP is I think Intel say genuine Intel so we're saying authentic AMD 2 C notice how we're not saying 2 cores or we're not focusing too much on the negative here which is keeping it to a minimal 2 C and then the big capital T for T with Vega 3 graphics on board so we're just telling you what it is this isn't the strong point of the ad so we're just pretty much quickly blazing over it we're not missing out any details but again we're focusing on the strengths in our ad rather than the negatives moving on to the RAM we've got 8 gigabytes ddr4 3000 mega notes this is nice stuff we've got it in dual channel for smooth gaming so that's another point that's strong about this build we're going on to the KC at Xigmatek RGB case with RGB rear exhaust fan and clear side panel bang we're hitting the mark with that SSD huge and we're using that adjective huge 480 gigabyte SSD for loading up your systems and games lightning-fast spec after spec we're just positive positive positive focusing on what this can do rather than what it can't do but here let's go pounce play true 500 watt be quiet 80 + power play with connectors for powerful graphics card upgrades we don't even have to give any examples we're just saying look it can upgrade with this power supply you've got options motherboard seems you a 320 M gigabyte motherboard with the latest BIOS so you can upgrade to even a risin 5 3606 core 12 thread if you wish to and that's that's the truth you can then we move over to the OS Windows 10 x64 Pro activated I don't know if you used home or probably didn't really state that in the video but we'll just go with that and then we've got here loss if you have any questions then be sure to send me a message I also guarantee my systems for 3 months this is super important guaranteeing your systems is really important because people then feel safe with you they know you're good to go with as opposed to other people they don't want to risk getting hosed or losing their money so this is important this is why I do three months guarantees really sets the buyer at ease and just make sure that they're gonna get a good gaming experience though lastly if you have any problems just send me a message you're in safe hands prices firm trade ins on your old desktop also be considered please send some photos first contact me here or on the phone number for more information done and with all that out of the way I hope you guys enjoyed today's video and also random gaming I wish you all the best and reselling PCs in the future love to watch the update videos and keep them coming good stuff just like this question of the day here which comes from Jacob but Leishman and they asked what do you do when old motherboards don't have USB 3 headers and this is a good one because even some 881 motherboards don't come with USB 3 headers so if it's a CH 81 and and you are I usually use a us 2 2 USB 3 adapter they're pretty cheap you can get them for like a dollar if it's a really old PC build and it's a really budget PC building there's already two USB twos on the front then I just go with leaving the USB 3 connect it out and no one seems to care I just tell them look one of the front three USB ports doesn't work and they don't care either so one of those things just like tying back to this video if you're transparent about things but you just focus on the positive then you will have some good success so I think random gaming with starting out this business sort of focused on the negative straightaway and that's thing you just don't do remember if you don't back yourself and your product then who else will so you've got to be your biggest backer you've got to believe in yourself and if you do that then you're destined for some better profits and the very least hope you guys enjoyed this one and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that content and the sub buttons down there don't forget to ring that Bell to see the content as soon as it drops and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
