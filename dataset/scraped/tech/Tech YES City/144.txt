please sir can i get a gpu now please 
put together a pc please sir please welcome back to tech yes city and today we've got this pc marks a first 
here at tech yeah city because the first time i   found a pc on the side of the road that i would 
actually turn into a gaming pc in the past i have   found pcs whether it's on the side of the road or 
it's at a tip but they've just been so far gone   or they've just been way too old that i couldn't 
turn them into an actual gaming pc that could play   titles of today but when i saw this pc right here 
as soon as i saw the x58 motherboard inside i knew   i had to pick it up put it in the boot and get 
it back to the tech yeah studio where what we're   going to do right here is we're going to take out 
now the parts that are could be possibly working   so i'm going to remove the motherboard the cpu 
and the cooler and also the power supply and also   test this two gigabyte stick of memory that was 
literally just sitting inside the computer like   like such so we're gonna see if we can turn trash 
into treasure and make something that can play   some of those latest and greatest titles do 
you feel like this when you see this well if   so you can get rid of that windows activation 
message with today's video sponsored lcd keys   for as little as 12 usd after you use that 
coupon bftyc you can get activated today   so pulled all the important pieces out of 
the tower and as for that tower i'm just not   even going to bother with it because it's just so 
dinged up and damaged that it's not going to make   for any decent gaming pc per se and i'd rather 
just have an open-air test bed if i couldn't   afford a case but what we've got right here is the 
motherboard this is the most important piece of   this puzzle if this ends up working then i'm going 
to be super happy because this one here is the   price of this whole pickup and also if the power 
supply if this works too then i'm going to be   really happy because that saves a lot of 
money when putting together a gaming pc now   this card right here is a gts 250 i mean 
it's a little bit no actually a lot it's   really lackluster for gaming in 2021 but i mean 
some sellers nowadays they might just put one of   these cards in and call it an ultra fast gaming pc 
so do be aware of that but essentially we're going   to pull this one up away and we're left now and 
and the blu-ray drive i mean i'm not really into   i haven't used a cd or a dvd i think for maybe 
six or seven years now it's for me personally i   just never use it but of course we might be able 
to sell one of these on ebay or something and get   some money for it uh for essentially nothing 
but now we're left with two gigabytes of ram   motherboard and a power supply and we're gonna 
clean these up now and then we're gonna test   if they work so we're gonna do a quick clean 
nothing super nothing crazy but just a quick   clean to get all the dust and dirt off and 
then just see if either of these parts work so we've got some good news coming out of this 
very good news and that is the motherboard the   cpu and even the two gigabyte stick of ram are 
working absolutely fine though the power supply   it's for starters the power supply i'm not 
going to use the power supply even though it did   turn on and the power supply tester was saying 
it was okay there was some coil wine evident and   also the 5 volt line was displaying a weird 
readout there so those two things coupled   together plus coupled in with the fact that it 
is a very cheap and nasty power supply means   i'm going to use something different which that 
could have been the reason why the whole build   failed on the person beforehand they just decided 
to chuck it out because maybe one of their hard   drives dropped out or something they're like oh 
this whole pc is an absolute mess i'm just getting   rid of it even though the motherboard is actually 
still in really good condition though we're gonna   be supplementing that with an antec power supply 
now these two parts i'm gonna give them a thorough   clean right now and then we're gonna start 
putting together a gaming pc for everyone so so so we've now just finished cleaning up all 
these pc parts and you may notice i started   cleaning up an rx 570 four gig and that's 
the graphics card we're gonna be adding in to   complete this build we've also got a 500 gigabyte 
hard drive and a 120 gigabyte ssd this seems to   be the budget meta combo right now now probably 
thinking what's with the ram we're going to be   adding in since that 2 gigabyte stick works 
we're just going to be adding a ddr3 mash   of ram here to make 12 gigabytes in total 
so we've got all these two gigabyte sticks   just sitting around here we add them in and 
hope and pray that they all work together   but that's one beauty about x58 generally you put 
all those two gigabyte sticks and even if they're   dual rank and single rank and a lot of times 
they work that's what i found with this uh combo   and now power supply is all cleaned up ready to 
go and we've got an rgb case here that i picked up   for 50 aussie dollars so in total we're a little 
bit above 200 dollars in our costs and how much   this pc is going to cost to put together but of 
course having a free x58 motherboard and an i7 950   that works absolutely fine is a big 
advantage in this situation it's going to   bring the price performance of this rig up through 
the roof so let's put this thing together and get building and now ladies and gentlemen we have a pc that is 
ready to go and finishing off this video we've got   from trash to treasure it's one thing that i 
personally love doing and that is just giving   these parts a clean especially one that's been 
left on the side of the road someone's abandoned   that they just said look i don't want this anymore 
it's garbage it doesn't work and i've come in and   picked it up and look at what we've turned it 
into now granted we've added new parts to this   especially the case and we've changed the power 
supply over but these parts at the moment they're   very cheap besides the graphics card we'll 
talk about the graphics card very soon but   adding a new case right now that's the cheapest 
i've ever seen cases this case here is rgb   timber glass i got this for 50 aussie dollars 120 
gigabyte ssds they're very cheap at the moment and   i'm sure if you look locally you'll be able to 
find ddr3 memory especially two gigabyte sticks   and possibly even an x58 board or something 
similar for very cheap also but of course the   builds like this here on the channel take your 
city you guys have been requesting that i do   more builds like this these use bangers but i'm 
just having a tough time um doing them a lot more   than i would usually do because of graphics card 
prices and so when i make these pcs at the moment   it's sort of only realistically catering towards 
people who can get good deals locally because that   is pretty much the only good graphics card deals 
i'm getting personally is where i pick them up   local and it's not going through sites like ebay 
or aliexpress and when i go on ebay or all express   i've got zero chance of getting a solid deal on 
a graphics card and that's just reality and even   though i'm getting solid gpu deals here locally 
i'm still not getting them at the pace that i was   getting them and they're also still not readily 
available like they used to be where i could   jump on gumtree or facebook and i could pretty 
much find five different graphics card deals   that were ready to go now i've sort of got to sit 
on there and really like just maneuver through all   these obstacles and i'm like okay this looks 
like a decent deal on a gpu let's try and get   it and that's how i've been getting my graphics 
card deals lately so it is getting tougher to   put together these price performance pcs but 
we are definitely doing it here at tacya city   but hopefully hopefully that crypto price just 
keeps dropping and those mining profitabilities   keep dropping and then we're going to see some 
graphics card availability come back into play and   that day i feel is coming pretty soon sooner than 
you think the only thing left that us gamers need   is the infamous rug pool and that's and that is 
whoever's put all this cheap money into crypto   gets the rug and they just pull it out and then 
suddenly the price collapses and uh we already   saw one example of that so if we have one more of 
those type events in the crypto field then i feel   like that is going to be party time if you've been 
looking for a cheap gpu but in the meantime we're   starving out here guys it's like please sir can 
i get a gpu please put together a pc please sir   please no boy you got to put together a console 
but you don't put together a console sir   yeah back to the video but on the note of this 
pc right here before we get on out of here   if you guys find it pcs that people no longer want 
and they just think that maybe it doesn't work it   doesn't boot up and they just chuck it out or 
your friend has an old pc lying around that   they no longer want might be worth your time just 
to check it out and especially if you're new to   building pcs you can definitely use those older 
rigs to test out parts and sort of build up your   portfolio of used pc parts and then that's the 
that's the beauty of building pcs is once you   get a few parts in and you've got different parts 
that you know work you can mix and match and you   can quickly and easily test which pc parts are 
the problem versus which ones are going to work   and so that's what i've set up here at my studio 
it's easy for me to put together pcs now and find   out faulty parts and quickly diagnose them and of 
course clean up the parts and make them look like   they're brand new with that said i hope you guys 
enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit   that like button for us and also let us know in 
the comment section below what you think of this   side road pickup pc but finding a pc on the side 
of the road i mean how how long before someone   else comes and picks that up i don't know maybe i 
gotta do an experiment but speaking of experiments   we've got the question of the day which comes from 
aaron and they ask you could buy a ps4 that will   run fortnite better than this and it is cheaper 
can't these fools be sued for false advertising   so they're referring to yesterday's video that 
we did on the gt710 gaming pcs that people are   selling on ebay it's an absolute joke especially 
when they're saying it's a fast gaming pc or an   ultra fast gaming pc and yes to be honest a ps4 
will run fortnite better than these pcs will run   fortnite and i think that's a sad thing because 
you can pick up a ps4 at least locally here you   can pick them up for really cheap right now so 
that that's a much better option like if you want   to get into gaming and you don't know anything 
about pcs and you want to buy one of these rgb   ultra fast gaming pcs just don't you're better off 
just going with a console and that's i thought i'd   never see the day where i'd recommend a console 
over a pc but that's how bad the crypto market has   uh driven up gpu prices to the point where you've 
got these real i just think they're scummy people   and they're misleading and they're trying to sell 
a graphics card that was never intended for gaming   and they're putting it in and now that's that was 
seven years ago like this card wasn't intended for   gaming seven years ago and now they're putting 
it in gaming pcs and saying they're gaming pcs   in 2021 really it boggles the mind but answer the 
last part of the question i can't these fools be   sued for false advertising i mean perhaps but 
i think a lot of people aren't really going to   bother suing them because they're probably i 
mean if they're selling 400 gaming pcs they're   probably not going to have a mad like crazy 
profitable business going on and even then if   you sued them are you going to get your money back 
because they'll probably just say they're bankrupt   even if you win the court case and so that's why 
a lot of the times a lot of people a lot of even   corporations and stuff they don't bother small uh 
suing the smaller guy because the smaller guys is   gonna be like well what are you gonna sue me for a 
gt 710 gaming pc but ultimately in terms of being   sued in australia even then i think there's a 
certain threshold for the value of an item and   what you can sue for in a small claims court and 
it's just really not going to be worth your time   doing that especially i know in australia 
it's not gonna be worth your time and so   i get a lot of these guys know that and so they 
get away with it but anyway i hope that answers   that question and if you stayed this far and 
you're enjoying that tech yes content you want   to see at the moment it drops and uh then got a 
message that threw me off now be sure to hit that   sub button and ring that bell and i'll catch you 
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
