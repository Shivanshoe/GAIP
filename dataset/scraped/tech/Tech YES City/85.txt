yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you guys want the cheapest gaming pc possible and you want to play age of empires 4 on pc then you have come to the right place today we'll be building a used gaming pc that's centered around this particular game released from microsoft studios now for the minimum requirements microsoft states that you need a 4 core 4 threaded 6 gen i5 6300u or a ryzen 2400 g but then after that in small print they say that you need a cpu that supports avx instruction sets now the avx instruction sets were introduced to cpus from 2011 in the form of sandy bridge on intel's second gen think a cpu like an i7 2600 for example and then on amd's side with the fx bulldozer cpus think a cpu like an fx6100 or an fx8100 so these cpus even though they're old will still play age of empires four so for the build that we're going with today we've got a build that comes in at 224 dollars now the majority of these parts are used parts and in fact the motherboard i pulled this out of the dumpster and this is where you can get so much value when it comes to pc gaming if you find either cheap used parts or free used parts you can make them work in your favor then for the cpu we're going with the i7 4770 four cores eight threads and still extremely relevant in today's modern titles where it supports avx2 that's a generation above what age of empires four requires then for the graphics card we got an hd 79 73 gigabyte this was the first generation of graphics cards from amd that officially supported dx12 and actually even to this date i'm pretty sure that this graphics card will be able to give you a good experience in age of empires 4 though we will find out a little bit later however since the core components of today's build are all used components what i'm going to do is i'm going to give them a quick clean down change the thermal paste on the graphics card for example and then also clean up the motherboard and give this the best chance it has of working before we try to turn it on and then if we get it working we're then going to put the build together let's get that b-roll and music crack-a-lacking [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] come on [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now we have everything officially working fine on this build so it's finally time to put it together and then of course install age of empires 4. [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and there we have it with age of empires 4 and this budget gaming pc right behind me i was just so impressed with what this thing could pull off now i did play two games however the first game i played it was a map on water where you have to build up a navy and unfortunately even though i turned v-sync off in the first game that i played it was still enabled because we're in borderless window mode so i wanted to turn that off and in order to do that truly turn it off i had to go to exclusive full screen mode and when we did this we then unlocked unlimited fps and at 1080p at low settings 100 screen resolution we're getting over and twenty average fps throughout the whole game not just at the start even when we're in a battle towards the end of the game we're getting very smooth fps the one percent and point one percent lows also impressed me a lot on this gaming pc now for the hd 7973 gigabyte that is a phenomenal card it's actually probably one of the best value graphics cards you can get if you want to play age of empires so do keep that in mind if you are looking to build a pc just to play age then this is definitely going to deliver and the funny thing about this game is i've already had people asking me for dedicated builds to build up for them on the cheap for this particular game so for me personally i'm absolutely loving age of empires 4. for me it's one of the best games that's been released in a long time that's because i love rts and i'm a big fan of the genre and i think age of empires 4 delivers so hard and it's already got pretty good balance out of the gate some would say the french are too strong but if you're getting into the game i would recommend actually starting off with the french because they're very beginner friendly and just as they've got strong early game as you saw with the calvary and some of the b-roll footage i put up they've also got very strong late game as well so very cool race to get into i'm definitely still in the beginner phase i haven't spent a whole lot of time on age of empires 4 but i used to play age of empires 2 and 3 back in the day so i'm quite familiar with the mechanics of the game though back to this build right behind me the temperatures and noise were very good the temperatures in this case were in a 25 degree ambient environment and the graphics card was under 70 degrees the whole time and also the cpu was traveling under 70 degrees the whole time too so in other words this pc is going to be absolutely fine even during the heat of summer now i did use two new components in today's build and that was a case as well as a power supply so for the case generally when i'm building a lot of different pcs regardless of the budget i always try to put in an rgb case that's simply because i usually resell my builds after i'm finished with them and make a little bit of profit and for the power supply if i don't have any quality used power supplies on hand i'll then use a new power supply and in this case we had the gamdius 500 watt power supply which was doing a pretty good job from what i could see and the max power consumption we got out of the build was around 285 watts and this was also during a fire strike combined benchmark which stresses the cpu and the gpu and impressively enough we got 55 watts on idle so this build here does deliver pretty well when it comes to even 2021 gaming and it also does do pretty decent when it comes to power savings believe it or not the final thing to talk about is that fire strike extreme score i'm going to pull this up on the screen for you guys where if you're building a budget pc you can then compare your score to mine where we've got a graphic score here of over 4 000 a physics score of over 10 000 and then you can relate that to the budget that we paid here today which is 224 us dollars so if you can come under that budget you are getting one of the best value gaming pcs to this date if you're going over that then you're still going to be getting good value but i wouldn't try to spend a whole lot if you were going used where for instance if you had a graphic score of 2 000 physics score of 5 000 but you're spending about 500 on that pc i'd say you weren't getting a good deal so basically with the fire strike extreme score i want to put that in pretty much every build i do and comparison that way you guys have a baseline to compare your systems to and also your value too anyhow with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed today's age of empires for gaming pc i had a lot of fun building this thing and the game itself really makes me happy it's bringing a smile to my face when unfortunately in 2021 there's not many smiles that have been brought to my face but this game is definitely a winner i'd recommend playing it if you haven't checked it out already and i actually purchased it on steam it was around 65 aussie dollars so you should be able to get it for around 45 us dollars and the good thing about steam is it's actually a much smaller install than it is on the microsoft store some reason on microsoft store it's like not over 90 gigabytes and then on steam it's like 34 gigabytes and another good thing about steam is you can transfer from another pc to another pc and you won't have to re-download the game again so i wish microsoft would fix that on their xbox game pass app on pc anyhow guys with that aside i'm gonna get on out of here if you enjoyed this one be sure to hit that like button and also let us know in the comment section below what do you think of today's gaming pc and also let us know what you think of age of empires 4 and if you are playing this game what race are you playing love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from glenn herron and they asked question was your 5800x cinebench result with hardware info open and was the 5800x overclocked why i'm asking that's lower than my results with the same cpu so when i do cinebench results on cpus especially in cpu comparisons i don't overclock the cpus and the reason for that is because a lot of people buy these cpus and then just install them into their pcs they might lock in xmp profiles and i definitely recommend locking in xmp profiles and then they just play games or do whatever productivity they do and the thing about the cpu out of the box and also about the xmp profiles is they are guaranteed speeds if i'm overclocking the cpu it's then not guaranteed so that's why i don't really like to include overclocked results and if anything i will talk about the sample i had and how well it overclocks but i won't make the whole review about an overclocked cpu versus a standard bunch of cpus hope that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music] oh
