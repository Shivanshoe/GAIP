yep all right I think we should be good in yep there you go okay is anybody out there [Applause] welcome to tech something this is a new stream that I'm starting with my man Gregory Salazar from side studio now it has been such a long time since I've been live streaming for you guys I got a new setup in everything we've got the Panasonic g7 now for the lens attached to the camera so we got the ball care while I think broke it yeah I think you're just using like a webcam yeah yes just c920 yeah I gotta get my my cables I'll plug them in so they can run them not off of battery because those cameras would last probably 20 minutes on its dreams so do not fear we'll fix that up ladies and gentlemen with a future reiteration we'll get Greg a g7 Japanese tradition you know I've got the g7 yeah cuz I've got the g7 Japanese right and it doesn't have the option to change to English so yeah I've got to navigate through all these kanji and I'm terrible at reading kanji but I got there in the end but the thing is the g7 in Japanese is like half the price I had the g85 which is basically the g7 just with internal in-body stabilization but I sold that I basically switched full Sony like a couple years ago and I have the a 6400 which would be good for the widescreen because it's a smaller camera you know it's not super heavy yeah but yeah that's the one I'm gonna get the adapter for so I can just plug it into the wall and I'll have to worry about power okay so we've got the we're going with tech news this is what's gonna be about tech something is the new stream name hope you guys are enjoying this live stream so far even though we haven't done much of it it's been so low so I've got to get back into actually streaming really really actually now you know I look around and I've been seeing these titles lately on YouTube and it's mainly from like small youtubers relate youtubers who are just trying to make some videos and stuff I'm not going to mention any names of the channels and but I look around and you're like intel is finished they are done like over and I'm like reading these titles in these thumbnails and I'm thinking man like sounds like Intel's going bankrupt tomorrow like what what's the case here so I go and check the ballot there that balance sheets the financial results the quarterly financials and Intel is doing better than ever so I'm sitting here scratching my head like okay I'm seeing these videos and then I go and check the financial results and they're two completely different things so what we got right here we're gonna actually go through two well should I say let me restate that great we're gonna really actually really really really really really go through these sheets right here and my accounting classes yes so that's it you got your counting glasses on we're gonna go through some of these ballade not balanced you just quarterly results so first off we'll start off with Intel right there they've done the best quarter they've ever reported apparently and when we look at the breakdown of it right there up 8% versus last year's quarter and then year-over-year they're not doing too well year-over-year is up like two percent so they've only grown a little bit but this is the thing despite them having an inferior product like with the CPUs to AMD right they're still doing pretty well like that's I was actually surprised yeah there's a disconnect I think between what the consumer what the end consumer sees and what actually goes on in the you know and when you start digging through the deep heavy financial data of a company the size of Intel nonetheless so you know it's something that a lot of people won't be able to grasp because people don't take the time to go through you know quarterly reports and annual reports and things like that we're just seeing snapshots of stuff like that here like you can see snapshots of the income statement on this this link and they're trying to give you an overview of performance from quarter to quarter 2018 quarter the same quarter in 2019 2020 yeah just people just don't realize that these companies have so much more invest in so many other places that they'll never see because they're not in those spaces where anywhere the end consumer were you know we're a part of the pie if it were a piece of it nonetheless yes oh look at this so we've got mobile I this was something that was interesting when I looked at these results I was like okay what is mobile I it's like AI that's Intel's AI division now look at the growth there that is huge right versus 2018 so there are big so that's where they're focusing a lot of this stuff on like that's the real in my opinion that's the real reason why they're doing GPUs because they want that compute from the GPUs they don't really care about gamers and like I've seen some news and reports about Intel's first GPU was going to be mediocre I even heard that way last year before they even released it it was more like a just a test pilot but you can just see like Intel's just gonna take that Tech and go all AI because that already 880 million and what you're seeing there that's a huge market that's already like once you start growing that enough it's just going to transcend gamers and so the other markets let's have a look data centers like still up a little bit I think from DSG's that Donna said a group and that's yeah that's looked like it's doing well and then Internet of Things the Internet of Things group is apparently up as well so it looks like all that data is pretty much up despite them from what I'm seeing with these YouTube videos despite them being finished tomorrow and I'm worried because they lost the all those old BIOS updates that was so like that really really did it for me hey like when they took off all these BIOS updates on their website bloom and yeah like that's sucked and this is the thing some of their x58 boards especially the DSO - and also their x79 boards that'll pretty nice like the problem with Intel's motherboards back in the past was they released these really crap models and they got it so wrong and so that sort of like ruined the image of the higher end stuff and so that's why when I said it creative writer came on board as a sponsor I said guys you've got to get your budget stuff right from the get-go as soon as you get the budget stuff right spreads good word of mouth then you can work on the high-end stuff but Intel sort of didn't wrong on the motherboards they're like yeah it will release these really nice high-end boards and just forget about the budget market and so people are getting these low-end boards and yeah I tried updating the BIOS for art for one it just bricked completely good like yeah good yeah yeah and I was like well actually maybe it maybe they did people a favor by taking that BIOS off the internet so okay so you couldn't break them so you couldn't break your boss anymore yeah so in speak the person yeah so anyway that's a look the intel financials though they're looking pretty fine I don't think Intel's going anywhere anytime soon and so basically let's not yeah you see all the the high in all the hype and all the fanboys and running around and I just you look at the numbers and you're like yeah they don't fine so we'll go to AMD which has reported a pretty big quarter and we'll pull this up on the big screen so you guys can have a look here but aim DS aim DS up so their revenues up quite a bit and of course that's for Zen too right and that they're doing pretty well and the one thing though that does worry me when I look at these like it's great to see AMD's growing the seep I'd say a lot of that came from the CPU market right because when I looked at in in depth their mobile said like they've they've got or way much all this text here right so much text and you scroll down to the the arm scroll down to the breakdown at the numbers right and okay must have got lost somewhere basically they broke it down into divisions right and what we saw here was here it is here computing in graphics so they they actually like their computing their graphics division went down I believe so their graphics isn't doing too well but their CPUs are they're embedded in semi-custom as well you can see the drops here like on the right hand side one game that was the CPUs and so the other one dropped and so of course people can say okay console sales slowed down maybe they just didn't get a me anymore semi custom orders in but their balance sheet was actually surprisingly was looking really good but their stock price have you seen AMD stock price lately not lately no I have not been following it'll pull it up for you anyway it's like 50 bucks and the p/e ratio that's the price to earnings ratio that is through the roof like that is higher than Nvidia way higher than Nvidia and Intel so people are basically the market has priced in AMD to have like growth like you've never seen before for a tech stock and so whether they're gonna deliver that is actually it's it's the thing that worries me because their CPUs are definitely getting the growth but all their GPUs getting the growth so that that's like one thing you sayin you're like well ok what do you think about that so with nd what do you think like when we put looking yeah go ahead yeah ok where we pull aside all like the fanboy ISM and stuff do you think Amy's graphics cards are going to come in and make a bang do you think they're going to come back and take that because that you check those steam surveys yeah and I mean yeah the Nvidia cards are just like wow like just I was gonna do a hurricane but I got a headset on so that's what's going like that is really that's legit what's going it was the case three four years ago when the only thing competing with mid-range market was right the rx for a TRX 580 cards the 5500 NX cheese I don't expect will upset that balance much just because the outlook from reviewers in general wasn't splendid and and this actually something I don't know if I've talked about in a video before but when I had my meeting with him at CES this year 2020 RG where Santa did wear a suit and tie dude I was in Slough sand like a like sweat pants okay and just this rugged shirt like I met the CEO in video in sweat pants like I just don't okay cuz I've got like I've got like a chameleon or whatever suit it's a flashy walk yes I was gonna get an RT X logo on it and next time I went to an Nvidia event it's gonna be like RT x own you should wear that to the AMD press event that would be all with RT x on logo hey what do you get naughty X on guys I'm wait I will pay I will personally pay you $1,000 if you can get a picture with an archaic shirt on with Lisa sue if you don't do that for me I'm thigh wall I will hand you a thousand dollars like a chat you've heard this a chats hurt it I'm putting great on the spot and I'm gonna go take it basically done already hey you with thousand dollars I already got a selfie with a man it was pretty hard actually like she she has born I know so she has bodyguards and stuff at all the times yeah like I think it's easier to get a shot with Jensen than it is with yeah he was he was just walking around his we visited their headquarters and pop off it was Silicon Valley and he was just walking around he's wearing the same leather jacket he always wears he walking around he might have hands he must have 120 copies of that he has to but the entire closet is just that same leather jacket don't has to be it was a scratch on this one better change it what's funny is like you know it's it's it's crazy because these people are worth he's worth hundreds of millions if not billions I think in last time I looked at my I mean we check him in the stock price I sure he was I am pretty over a billion yeah pretty sure yeah and so he you know you meet this guy and you're like okay in the back of your head he's running this multi-billion dollar company and he himself specifically is worth billions and you're just talking to him like any other human being like I did its I did get that it's really weird it's like you know there's nothing really I mean yeah the guy obviously made really smart moves in life to get where he got but he's just a human being you know like we subconsciously like idolized and like memorializes people who are worth so much money because the things they've done in life or maybe the things that were handed to them in life but at the end of the day you know they're just normal that they're a person yeah they're person man and I'm it was funny with him like I go to admit me up into all different types of press conferences that he's like when you go to a Nvidia press conference like you can feel his energy man like I gotta admit that guy's a boss on stage like Jensen is top presenter Lisa Sue's but Lisa's Lisa's like right up there second she's pretty good yeah yeah and I think they I mean they have more to prove right AMD want maybe not now or but but they especially when they were first announcing this stuff like when you know when Xen first came out and now listen to it you know they're making a new name for themselves AMD is no longer the they're still more affordable option but you're not really compromising much by forgoing the Intel chip instead a few caveats they're arguably like having a iGPS one of the only differences but yeah I mean they they had something to prove and they did and that I think in and of itself is building their confidence as a brand it for the end consumer at least you know I well that's the thing I got down to testing out the CPUs and this was what struck me it was like the 90 400 F this is the 3500 X if you bought either of those CPUs you didn't make a bad choice at all and so it was it just struck me as like it's getting so tight now the competition's getting really good it's already that way in the graphics card market yeah and that's what I was getting at when I was talking about meeting them at CES so one of the managers whatever directors of the radon division he was was talking about the pricing straw and how they were trying to compete one-on-one with what the green team is offering course they never say nvidia at these little meetings and this is literally just me and my brother and the two directors like that's it that's the meeting it's just us two and they'll go through multiple media outlets and do the same kind of spiel but I asked them specifically I said why are you choosing to not undercut from a price perspective your competitor much in the same way you are in the CPU division and his response in a nutshell I think he would agree with this is we don't need to there's no reason to undercut because we're almost on par with them in every aspect we're on par with them and a performance perspective in the mid-range and lower range markets and we're almost on par in the efficiency department we're not quite there yet but we're we're close enough that people aren't going to bat an eye to it so we don't need to be cheaper we can be you know competitive on a price at a certain price point and that's all we need to do and we're happy with sales as they like yeah I do and don't agree like the actions are kind of contradictory towards that what do you do like yeah what's what really is your goal here are you just trying to compete or you trying to undercut because you're really competing when you do both but your approach to it is affecting the end user ultimately and it's not really making sense how you guys are competing because you're not releasing the high-end cards according to them they could and they're just not doing it yet because the vast majority people don't buy the high where's the first which is the opposite of what Nvidia does but yeah it's kind of a it's weird it is that's like that's what I was gonna say is there's fifty six hundred XT that was the desperation on that via bias update was real like yeah oh yeah the day before I did my review and I did all my testing and now I'm making the video and I get the email and it's like hey we got a B BIOS update I'm like okay like probably just a couple of percent here and there won't really matter and then yeah you're getting 12 percent uplift and then it smashing yeah but then it's matching all my overclocked numbers and I'm like yeah where's your overclocking headroom it's all gone now and that's true the power efficiency goes down because you're maxing out card kind of thing and I just like this is not this is not a good look if you're not trying to beat your competitor in price performance right that was like a desperate move debating video at price I think they're they're really emphasize I don't know I mean I know why but at a certain point you have to ask yourself if it's worth compromising raw performance for the sake of being more power efficient and at the end of the day if you pulled a thousand people and asked them which they would prefer a card that was ten percent more powerful or ten percent more efficient i guarante for the same price I guarantee you 999 of them at least are gonna pick the 10 percent power bump or a performance bump yeah because that's what you actually see you know you might see a few bucks here and there increase in your power bill but that's gonna be so whitewashed with all the other crap going on in your house or your business no one's gonna you know no one's gonna bat an eye to that stuff so I'm throwing you the curveball right now you know the curveball is I love this man I could throw curve balls hanging throw a match at - okay okay so here's that here's the curve ball right would you prefer an RX 480 or an RX 580 for the same price ah well yeah even for the same price yeah I mean at the end of like just be yourself no resale no we're not gonna put the resale like 'mom yeah it's just for your own personal use 24/7 like you are a hermit you are playing World of Warcraft 13 no 16 hours a day KFC on the desk which yeah I would I would I would want the 580 that's what I would look like it I'd go with the 480 because it's gonna use it uses it's like 10% performance difference but you uses also much less power like it's ridiculous how much power less power it uses all and so that's why I know that I prefer the arts 400 series over the 500 series because of its it's been it was tuned better in terms of its power efficiency curves and you see that with the like I did the recent video with the 9900 t versus the 9900 K its own a three-fold the power consumption oh yeah but that's because the frequencies are totally I mean they're there the tea is like in the three it's like the mid threes I think oh geez Oh the taste is doing this all day yeah but I mean that's wrong anything which you rather have a car that's more fuel economic or a car that's way faster I mean like it's it's subjective but I think that when you buy a graphics card yeah you want it to be as good as it can be from a performance perspective and I mean just like raw frame rates more so than a efficiency you don't buy a graphics card because it's efficient I mean yeah it's it's a nice trend but ultimately what sold Pascal despite it being way more efficient than Maxwell was the price to performance yeah I didn't buy a 1070 because it saved me 10 bucks a month on my power bill you know because at the end of the day I was paying 250 bucks more for a 980ti two years ago yeah that was already consuming more power so the money I'm saving by getting the newer architecture that's more efficient you know what I mean like it just to me it's kind of a catch-22 like here's the kicker - I've thrown another like man I just don't cuz just call this tech tech curveball just tech curveball man just throw them all day so here's the thing with efficiency it actually is King and I've spoke about this in the past the reason efficiency is king is because it spans everywhere right guys like me can then use cheaper power splice cheaper cases you name it in builds we can then save money their consumer can save money but Nvidia or AMD if they're making the more efficient graphics card that means they're making the cheaper GPU so the more efficient that is and they can price it the same as a competitor more profit James does say you can always under bolt though I know you can't undergo what was under vaulting Headroom on the 580 not much right now compared to Vega and is it was which one the our excavator you can the five yeah you can live it but the but the margins weren't anywhere near as good as a Vega day yeah it was Vega and also if you get under for what 20 30 percent on Vega yeah you were you would save heaps of power of doing that but I never thought twice - under Volta 580 just because I didn't I didn't look at the 480 and say well I could be saving 20 watts you know but like at you know it's just going through the motions to do that it's it's to me not something that most people are even gonna bother calculating because you have to even you have to decide if it's even worth the investment of time yeah and the first place to do and yeah efficiency is everything right like like you said if you have something that's going to consume hundreds of times more power for a ten percent performance bump then obviously that would be a terrible trade-off but when we're talking give and take a dollar here dollar there 10 watts more power 10 percent performance bump or if you factor in like okay I'm gonna be saving 10 bucks a month on my Powerball so I can spend 10 dollars more now on better components like nobody's doing that nobody is like shopping on Amazon and saying okay all of these efficiencies add up to this so I'm saving this much money here so I can buy a better CPU cooler like nobody's doing I'm frankly the general consumer about probably the tech yes any viewer is for the general public I love this is the thing when I was teenager knows building pcs I would always weigh up everything man I'd spend like a day two days even researching my next gaming rig and it was like calculated on spreadsheet and then I realized dude you could have probably just gone out and worked two days straight and just made up all the differences and bought whatever Yolo and that's why now it's just life a measly work work work work work do ever just keep going keep going and then when Jensen releases the next fix I would just go buy it no but he's the thing I was gonna add on the GPUs right this is the true thing I had a computer come back with an Rx for 70 and this is like with AMD versus Nvidia on the GPU section it's a big thing game is Nexus actually I like that he talked about it a lot in depth where he's pointing out all the driver issues I had a guy bring a PC back man as iris 470 is working fine I always test my rigs before I sell them I show the person them up and running he brought it home and he's like dude the monitors flicking him like what's going on it sounds weird is I hooked two monitors up and it's flicking and I'm like what can you show us a video showed me a video brings it back we'll check it all out I went through every single setting this thing would just not work with two monitors properly and I was like oh it had to change it to an nvidia card guy was happy went home that's like you got to understand though that all that time I've wasted now and so as me as a seller what do you think that's gonna do do you think I'm going to be suddenly inclined to go yeah I can't wait to put an AMD card in this machine and if someone has problems I got to go and fix it and it's not my problem it's not my fault I haven't done anything so there is these driver issues and they do exist and I'd say it's mainly with the multi monitors there's a problem I have with the capture cards have you used AMD cards on over capture cards no okay so and for the reasons of encoding there's been a problem for the life of these cards I mean for the life of AMD drivers has been this card where if your capture card Seifert's you've got a 4k capture but it sports 120 Hertz 1080p it'll in videos drivers will automatically detect the monitor is not capable of 120 Hertz this monitors of 4k 60 and I use it for benchmarking the AMD card AMD graphics will be like the drivers will be like oh this capture card supports 120 Hertz it will boost 120 Hertz out to your monitor so I'm in the middle of get and it automatically do it and so I'm in the games trying to benchmark and I'll drop it from 4k or 1440p to 1080p and then it'll my screen will go black and I'm like oh no so then I gotta go back to the other computer navigate through the menu to change it to 60 Hertz from 120 and just all that stuff like that there's little things that don't get mentioned and and even in my recent video where I took a look at the RX 480 it was having these artifacts and people are like yeah that's just the problem at the moment with fortnight but if I sold a PC with that are X 480 as it stands is probably gonna come back people like arts artifacting one pay playing fortnight mmm and that's not my fault I done nothing wrong legit I yeah I'm thrown curveballs but this one the dude hit it and it's come back and smacked me in the face and that shouldn't be happening that's your reputation and I don't even have don't even have a helmet on yeah so I'm getting Kayode here I'm getting Kayode so that's the that's the reality of it man and I've actually got a really good video coming up - I've got this ASA P see how this is just completely on the other side of the fence though and I'm actually gonna message AMD Nvidia directly and say why are you allowing this crap I've got this ASA Nitro and I got it traded in the guys like telling me his FPS is suddenly dropping in fortnight and he didn't buy this PC of us he bought it from JB hi-fi I think it was and it had one stick of ddr4 like 21 33 megahertz memories like why is the FPS dipping I'm like that's probably why but actually I got it in and you know the problem actually was is that a saw at least on this nitro are doing their own proprietary drivers and they haven't updated them for like four months five months through Nvidia cards so I've put an RT X 2060 in this thing and I can't even install the drivers it is yeah it's I'm trying to force it in so if anyone in chat knows how to get around that let me know because I'm making a video on it now I'm gonna be like look don't buy an ace a desktop gaming PC it's I've noticed that with a lot of I mean what Acer not specific pacer laptops monitors they're all good but I said but I've noticed that laptop vendors will do stuff like that they will they'll use their own proprietary proprietary drivers to restrict hardware configurations and I'm pretty sure what's going on eyes are cutting deals with certain companies and limiting compatibility so that they can have more you know exclusivity in that particular product and that's what happened to my dealt my XPS when I tried to upgrade my ram do do you think it's just it's just loud memory right no power ddr4 whatever swap out the dims it's good to go it would not even detect it wouldn't even boot with with a ram stick that was not one of their ordained holier-than-thou modules usually it's from HyperX or Corsair this is really the vast majority the ones there I tried using a team group module no doesn't matter if it's SK Hynix Samsung whatever it's just the vendor itself and they'll do that just to restrict what you know what consumers shop for and it's just that the deals they cut with the with the hardware vendors to build these laptops and I guess that extends to a degree into desktops and they're using software to block yeah those updates and and and compatibilities it's ridiculous oh this is pretty bad like yeah this this asa nitros almost a dud like I'm at the stage where I'm probably gonna change them on the board and that's just like it's I just it's it's a headache like it's a big headache I can go get a h3 ten for like 70 Aussie and just not have any of these troubles but I'll make the video and tell people look don't buy an ace a desktop gaming PC here's why ya know the same thing yeah I know I didn't know you know I was thinking you could just pop any whatever ddr4 into a laptop it's true but it should work if we're doing desktops why would it not work in a laptop but because it's got a freaking Dell logo on it insert your favorite you know restrictive brand here they're just they're not gonna support it well here's the thing this guy's this guy's fortnight probably wasn't playing properly because they've done a massive update and he's got drivers at a five months old so yep buddy and that's up to a certain age those drivers and Acer what a stir could give a crap like the companies that are actively rolling out software updates yeah those are the same companies that are selling these big bulky hardware I'd like this is this it's not there's a disconnect there and then they're never gonna address it you know you Dells never gonna do it in a BIOS update or whatever like that just they're not there's no need to like you said there's they've already sold it they've already made their money what it ain't coming back is it's not faulty apparently I'd love you to find the lines I'd loved someone to define the lines on what's classified as faulty my opinion is it doesn't work as you intended it to work simple whether its software hi wait if it doesn't work as you've intended it when you bought it actually yeah that's a good thing because software changes over time oh brother I'm ready for him gonna catch it doesn't working as intended okay so hmm do you expect the average consumer to know if his or her laptop let's say is performing the way it should in games yeah have you know yeah where's the lines how would you know I mean like unless you actively looked at YouTube videos like ours or got a friend by the same laptop or whatever a different laptop with the same specs like how would you know if you're getting the true performance you should how would you know then if your software limited or if there is something some kind of hardware conflict I don't know why that would pass R&D but whatever you see but you know how would you know and and then to what extent would you allow performance degradation to the point where it would still be deemed acceptable and okay and yeah we're not gonna refund your money and you know you brought your business idea dude I'm making the company is chat with me as well are you with me hardware check dot exe Bank push it through the ringer and see how it does and if you're not getting what you should the numbers don't add up I mean you can toss like we're just like all in one performance suite and idle to a refund after that yeah hardware check who's with me that's it so I was going to actual we're gonna go back to the Nvidia financials now these are down like these are down big-time like down 30% I mean it is as they estimated and that's why their stock is still fine people like well these numbers came out and they're terrible why is invidious stock still up like there's a down 24% yeah and revenue their stock is like the stocks resale it's like hey if anything's gonna start going up again what's going on here basically people probably wondering the basically is they estimated it so it's basically right around where they estimated it so they said look it's going to be down etc etc and that's when they said look things are going to get messy and that's when they start crashed is when they estimated it to be messy and so what we're looking at here is actually yeah the reality of and the good thing I like these notes like this is probably actually the least amount of clutter and financial notes I've ever seen it's just like yep this is why it's down encrypted currency GPUs essentially flooding the market that's how much of an impact the use scene is making and people think used hardware's a joke take a look at these quarterly results right here used hardware is not a joke this is out real it is yes which would you say which would you say is is making a bigger impact on things just in the consumer space because I know Nvidia does a ton of other stuff with AI and whatever and those those divisions really aren't pertinent to this discussion but yeah would you say that the they used the the used market from the influx of mining cards made a bigger impact on sales or the fact that RTX cards were quote-unquote overpriced or just pricier than previous Paschal offerings which would you say made a bigger there's a combination of both like they say their recent deteriorating and market conditions that would be the market not adopting r-tx as well as they did the GTX 10 series like there's a bit of both but I remember speaking to some board vendors and yeah the crypto boss was doing some proper damage and that was huge man like you've got guys selling 5100 GPUs at a time that's just all colliding out in the market stopping someone going from going to a retailer and buying a new card which is then yeah giving these companies profits but they used market when you buy that used carts taking away from a new sale and that's the reality of companies yeah people don't realize that but that's it they're not making a single dime I mean you're probably you're not even really proliferating yeah but could a brand image because it's the same car you're not adding more to the market you're you're just kind of reallocating it you're moving it from one place to another and they're not making a dime off of that and whether or not you're see they portend the sale tried to do with our government isn't either well r-tx was there way around of saying look we're not ready to offer seven nanometer not ready to offer more vram on the cards etc here's what we're going to offer you our TX and they didn't do that good of a job like as I said in the past man if they introduced our TX to like csgo and and all these games that people are actively playing a multiplayer they would have done so much better with their sales but they didn't and I mean I chest it I tested out the Minecraft thing that was impressive but I'm not even sure if it's out yet like he's like Wednesday's beta coming out so our TX has the potential to be really good but they didn't do a proper job of it they did it just a bang job like that's what we call a bang job that's what they did I will say bad so the metrics the metrics that were looking at because I'm looking I didn't actually look this deep into in Phidias in particular I was looking over at AMD's and didn't tell us but so if you see at the top where it sits Nvidia today reported revenue for fourth quarter ended January 27 yeah 2.7 billion down 24% from 2.9 billion a year earlier yeah so they're comparing quarter to quarter yeah right but if you scroll down so where it says fiscal 2019 summary instead of Q for fiscal 2019 summary of the whole school 2019 summary 12-month says revenue year-over-year up 21% so we're looking we're looking at a quarter here and extrapolating that over the entire well years also they're just comparing end of year sales essentially I mean whatever you want to call core 4 because their fiscal year ends at the end of January but yeah yeah so revenue for the year technically went up from from the previous year from 2018 up 21% operating expenses also went up will become went up 19% net income went up 36% yes so what happened was in those creating that crypto mining phase it was the opposite it was over inflated numbers coming in so they did these massive years and the stock was growing like all crazy people thought the mining boom was just going to continue forever I remember that but then it went all of a sudden bossed so yeah they're going to be up versus 2018 for a lot of reasons being that 2018 was the year when it all went down was the year when a bloody DRT on going affects of all this stuff is still flowing out there so it's just been an absolute mess it's been an absolute mess graphics cards we had multiple years to see here instead of just 18 and 19 yeah well we're like if chat wants us we can go and the next episode will go more in depth if we want to have a real good discussion but I think everyone knows the underlying figure here is that they basically created their own mess with the cryptocurrency boom and now they're now they're basically pulling off the band-aid they've got to deal with the consequences and that's all these quarterlies are AMD as well that's why we saw their graphics cards we're doing as well as well this is the same thing and that's the GPU market right now of course I think 7 nanometer what we see with our TX third 3080 and stuff and that is really gonna breathe some new life back into the GPU market better efficiency more power more vram that's going to span down hopefully that spans down through all their SKUs then they're going to be back on top again people now have a reason to want to buy a new GPU but see that that's the thing though like when I asked I asked AMD Point Blank I said yeah why like why not drop why not lower MSRP for your mid-range cards so that you can better under and they kept saying that we're content with what we're what we're at you know if we if we saw a problem with pushing inventory or moving inventory we would lower prices according like any other company would right if they wanted to still be profitable or at least get rid of the inventory they're sitting on so it even though AMD sales for those cards might be lower than projected or to us on the outside might not look as good yeah obviously to them their can they're ok with it because otherwise we'd be seeing pretty heavy price cuts or we'd be seeing more PR or something like they would do something to get it going these companies have billions of dollars and in resources for reasons they've they've done right things in the past to get where they are yeah so there there can I mean even though these numbers are what they are they're content to any sent to an extent with sales at least in the consumer graphics card markets because there changing anything about the current market conditions apart from the immediate response is like when Intel or excuse me when Nvidia launched the RT X 2060 price drop of 30 bucks or 50 bucks you know these are impulse changes but here's the thing about that like if people like all is they've dropped to 50 bucks I'd say like that's the RT X 2060 dropping my $50 obviously was a good thing for the market but if you bought an RT X 20 64 350 as soon as it came out all you've lost is 50 bucks in a year like that's really not bad on a new product you still gotta get know yeah yeah I know I and that's something I never even addressed in my review when I talked about that that price drop when the yeah you want I never even mention that because to me 50 bucks I mean yeah in a 300 dollar card 50 bucks goes a lot further than in an 800 dollar card right and no one's gonna really blink over 750 verse 800 yeah I shouldn't say that but you know it's it's a smaller percentage but I never had the option if you had the option to lease a pretty powerful GPU for $50 a year would you I would because you're gonna because if you use the card let's say that the projected lifespan of the card is two years before it becomes obsolete a new card comes out if your ceased at fifty bucks a year so you're spending a hundred bucks if you bought the card at $500 by the time the new stuff comes out the cards only worth $300 then you actually saved a hundred bucks by choosing to lease yeah right so it's all about what the car depreciates to and that's why most of the time leasing like a car is not good because it's all sunk money but it depends on how much you drive it as well and if you get an accident a lot of different variables but there are cases where leases make sense especially for business but yeah I agree if it was if it was that cheap that would make way more sense to me there's a first off there's you're not gonna get you know your graphics car is not gonna get in a car wreck it's not gonna depreciate more than you know is projected to do so like it's not as risky my sense is the car I had it right yeah I I actually had a computer like unless it blows apples gonna say on the skids and yeah I actually had yeah I had an old elk I didn't mention this in the last week I had an LGA 775 literally go up in smoke like the MOSFET just started catching fire it was an LG seven seven five and so I had to pull the power cable out straight away like instantly I just wish I I was thinking I had to camera pretty close I was thinking about just grabbing the camera being like whoo going Yolo but I'm like yeah you know not much to do like I can't risk this burning down or whatever so I haven't seen that in a long time man proper fire in a computer this was like fire it was Sparks and it ain't like burning and I'll smell that's that everything like your smell of before you see it yeah I've got the board still here I might try and boot it up again and see if it wants to start firing up and get on video but it's still pretty risky not too comfortable doing it yeah there's that so hey back to GPUs quickly the I think one of the best cards of all time is going down as the 1070 because that was like super the resale value of its in its in still insane man like you bought one of those but it's a 2016 when was the 10th semi looks in 15 or 16 yeah it's like yeah four years later it's still worth a lot of money and so the tensor yeah well but it has depreciated I noticed and someone else but I think of a scatter hole he pointed this out but I had talked about it in my 1660 super video about how that card because it performs so close to a 1070 already and that the efficiency differences aren't staggeringly different you know there's there's not a big enough argument there I think to forego one over the other other than the fact that the 1070 would likely be used but because the 1660 super now exists at a 220 230 dollar price tag which was already what the ten SEVIS were going for used around 200 bucks those 10 seventies are gonna have to go down further in price to make sense for shoppers who were considering both used and new cards because why would you spend $200 on a used car that performs almost the same as a $220 new car that's slight more efficient yeah yeah and so they have to go down and and sellers are adjusting you know people are saying why would I buy this instead of this okay well I'll give you $30 off there you go that's literally market that's that's like the micro economic market correction but this is the big thing it's it's always been the case man like in the history of GPUs vram and the number attached to that yeah so 1070 has 8 gigabytes of vram so therefore people think it's better than a 1660 super automatically and so that's why the 1070 is still commanding such a big premium is because it's officially at its new price point yes the first 10 series car bytes of vram and people say that no I 80 qubit severe Nvidia 10 series card like oh my god I gotta get this like somebody yes I need my temper have you if you if you could save let's let's say Nvidia offered to has this wouldn't surprise me because it's Nvidia let's say they offered to 1660 super skews they offered one with six gigs of VRAM at let's just say 230 and then they offered another one with a gigs of VRAM at 250 let's make it let's make it really like would you pay the 20 to $30 premium for an extra two gigs of vram and a card that is really only good for 1080 to 1440p gaming anyway I wouldn't personally but I would for the very cell yeah okay okay because because of the seller or the buyer tendencies okay so that's yeah I struggle to saturate six gigs like it's tough especially in 1080p but people buy these cards for 1440p - granted the resolution jumped from if you just counting raw pixels from 1080 or 1440 nowhere near as big as from 1440 to 4k when you're playing games in 4k you're gonna use a lot more vram on average because of just how much more graphically you're having to drive way more pixels to drive and and when you're talking about adding all these different game settings into the mix it's just gonna compound the issue so it's it's what the cards are really marketed for what resolution what games its user base yes but I think that argument if you really look into the fine details six eight for that caliber of card not as big an issue as I think some people make it out to be III don't think chats pointed it out yet they like I just noticed now like you got a green wall so lay your Loki and Vidya shielded like that that's like the Furious shilling right there you got a green back there dude that's oh yeah they sent the paint they sent the paint and they they sent a stack of hundred stack of BAM geez man I didn't even bother counting cuz I mean way more than ya next topic up we gotta talk about the next I think we'll probably just break it at this last topic because we've been rambling on if people ensure people are enjoying these live streams and then we'll go to chat as well is the coronavirus right this is something that's come in people are talking about it and here's the thing I wasn't as we talked about this a little bit before the stream started I got no idea how this is going to impact the tech scene I was talking to Marco over in Taiwan he said copy Tex could be delayed because of this which is like oh damn because I love Computex I think it's so good yeah and they say yeah like all these things like tech products could be the production of them could be slowed down this could force up prices on the retailers sides I mean we're getting use of Apple already expecting a I've got all these different our articles up which I didn't really sift through I was going to say that we'd mentioned this before we started streaming that the there are certain companies in in our space in the PC hardware space that have and I won't bother to name them because I think it's really affecting most of them who were importing from China let's say or developing in China is the coronavirus is extending into those sectors as well where I'm getting emails from these companies that case manufacturers especially and notice yeah where they're saying yeah we're gonna have to delay this because of the the one coronavirus and we're looking at maybe a month out so where it was we would have already been here now I have to wait till March because I'm not sure what's going on at the border but they're not letting Goods be exported as easily or maybe the workers aren't there to even export them themselves be because of how serious it isn't some parts of the country now but it is it's also Chinese New Year like this break it depends on the companies and stuff I heard some people can take like a month off around this period - so like yeah things can slow down around this period anyway but the apparently it's not there specifically citing this I mean they're citing like they're saying it's because of current like if it's Chinese New Year they could just say it I just say see and why you know whatever we always expect in our industry to not really hear from many companies during this like - yeah exactly but I got tired yeah they're like screw up we want to have our big yeah in one vacation they get a year a lot of yes it's like we want to take six months off instead of that but here's the thing the saws is apparently worse the mentality rate was like nine point six percent on size that's crazy so saws was really bad Coronas looking like it's five percent which is still pretty bad so it doesn't look like yeah and all does but it depends on what the government's reporting like if because I know there was a big discrepancy apparently between what the government was reporting with and with the infection rate yeah versus what I forget was it independent I don't know if it was some other World Health Organization whoever was saying that upwards of ninety thousand people apparently have already contracted or have been diagnosed with having it so the government might be under reporting these and and that's this has happened a lot like this is you know government's always do this because I don't wanna make their countries look bad you know so it's probably worse than it appears to be on the news although there is quite a bit of fear mongering around this is not like this is not the Black Plague or anything like that but it's affecting many industries right now I mean we're taking care of our viewers right now keeping them indoors making sure they're watching this live stream and that's what when SARS was around I didn't even know about it because I was too busy playing World of Warcraft yeah like this is truth man it was I didn't even go outside I'm like yeah I got nothing very bad here just just eight-day just stop for a few days or whatever it's not a problem no I didn't starve it like it just went down - yeah I'd go down to my local grocery store that was it like play video games go to work that was it so I wasn't in the tech scene so to know how this impacts things but I can see how it's going to impact things in in a great way for the use market - this is the other side of things because prices go up on the new parts due to supply whatever use price market suddenly becomes more attract is it a good thing or a bad thing or it depends on who you are - if you're a buyer then you would look that it's a bad thing at least bad timing but if you're a seller yeah so marketing get rid of offload some parts there's always gonna be somebody willing to pay the higher price because they don't want to wait six months for the prices to go back down it's why Ram companies still sold RAM when ddr4 and even ddr3 to an extent was extremely expensive during the price-fixing era so and they were multiple not just the most recent one so I think I think with the ratio I think with the race one you gotta say alleged price fixing okay Oh class-action lawsuit kind like it's one yeah you're right I mean legally you have to say that but no I wouldn't close yes most who's watching this live stream tech boy I don't want to get sued again so yeah so yes coronavirus it's bad but if you're an introvert you generally don't have much to worry about to stay indoors and do what you keep doing playing video games and you'll be fine and never go outside this is where we can rejoice in being windows closed we can rejoice think about that I mean you're gonna if you don't expose your immune system to things that they can build immunity over time like you're not around a lot of people who have colds and stuff your risk of contracting the same cold that they have goes up because you haven't exposed yourself and train your body to to respond effectively to those those environmental stimuli you know so yeah okay so we got here AMD's big navvy GPU launch we'll quickly go over some of these titles there's certainly room is so I'm not even bothering pulling up on the big screen because it's just rumors is basically spanning from apparently there was a certification of an unreleased GPU not known to the database people think it's the big navvy Gordon from PC world he did get like you can expect a high-end Navi at CES he got that so from Lisa sue that was really good have you met you met Gordon yeah yeah yeah toplink is really well he's really smart guy yeah it's really cool I love talking to him all the time and so he got that answer out of him so what what do you think's gonna happen I hope this is not the case like is this what I see happening AMD releases big navvy and then NVIDIA comes in with 30 80 and they're just instantly like steals the show again that's what I foresee happening with this and sure maybe they'll maybe they'll compete on a price level as well I just 60 wait well this is the thing right we look at those financials we know for a fact seven nanometer Nvidia cards have to come soon they have to anyway it's checkmate they have to so when can you expect them the sooner the better basically I think that March outlook for 3080 is the possibility 30 17 30 a to get launched in March or April I think it April is looking like solid date so you'll see RTX 3000 series in April that's my guess just putting that out there and when you see that that's going to come in with big performance gains new architecture 7 nanometre more vram bang bang bang the whole nine yards and a curve ball on top but I hope that more big navvy I mean with what we got two more months really for this to come out before it just gets squashed by Nvidia again so it releasing a GPU with the two month life essentially in its competitive scene is not a good move RTS 2080 TI's been out for so long already it's crazy still over $1000 yeah exactly right so is this card even going to launch the launch could be very close now what's like why do IND keep doing this to themselves they need to really get the CPU money put into the GPUs and make the GPU super competitive again they knew they'd tried dude I tried asking that I'm true like I really I put them on the spot more than once I did to the point where they might not even ask me to come back maybe here's the thing anyway but here's the thing sorry to cut you off here's the thing with it so we look at the CPU market if AMD gone and been stagnant for a couple of years it doesn't matter Intel's not Intel's been stagnant for five years so they could just use that now they can use that profit off the CPUs pull it into the GPUs hard core and start micromanaging their company if they want tech yes to come into AMD I can sort things out for them and say look let's Mack micromanager company properly just a re-release Rison 4000 5000 6000 series for the next three years same thing just clock bumps and then we call it money calls me I mean they told me that they they're doing it this way on purpose and that they're not having I asked them also very point-blank are you having any manufacturing issue are you running in any manufacturing constraints with respect to better you know the higher-end natty cards and their answer was no and that they're doing this essentially the way that they projected to do it what they intend to do it which is the complete opposite of how Nvidia does it which i think is also interesting it's two different market approaches here Nvidia always releases the best cards first with the exception of usually the upper end TI card and then they trickle down they'll start with like the 1080 and then they'll work that 1070 then the 1060 then a 1050 year you know they'll kind of marshallers up but they always start from the top and work their way down the reason why they do that it's smart because less people are gonna buy the more expensive cards but if it's the only card out you might be able to persuade some of the people interested in the lower end cards to buy into the higher end cards so they can get it sooner so you're trying to you know it makes sense companies do this all the time AMD is doing it the opposite way AMD saying okay well we know a vast majority of our market prefers the cheaper more affordable frankly better value cards like the 50/50 600 XT I think it's a pretty good value 5500 XT you could argue that yes or no but the 480 and 5 it you're still really compelling in a used market so I'm not sure the viability of those but at the end of the day they're choosing to approach this the other way around from the bottom up and I think they're waiting one of two things I think they're waiting either for Nvidia to do something first which we don't know how soon that's gonna be but AMD's content as it is so maybe they don't even do it until you know long after whatever and what's the name in architecture that invidious IGN a are not that Nvidia know any Nvidia ampere yeah yeah thinking Full Tilt yeah but they are they gonna wait for before or after because they know that those are on the same plane for from a node perspective right this is the thing this is the proofs always right in front of your eyes man it's always simpler than you think the GPU division is pushed to the brink dude they they keep being on an edge and this is that that V BIOS thing proves that right aimed he's always on this edge and they make these rash sudden decisions and I mean look at Radeon seven why did that even come out let's be real like why was Radeon 7 even released it was it was just the people were complaining that there was a lack of competition in that space honestly man they would have lost money on that they would have lost money yeah lopa odd releasing it it was a poor decision you just period and so just are they doing it for a statement or are they doing it to get competitive because if they get competitive then they need to pull a lot more R&D into their company they need to get real talented figures they need to get signed ready because Nvidia the reason why they're able to do RTX 2080 and then 2070 first or and they did it a little bit different with r-tx but say for instance 10 10 17 10 80 and then the 1080 TI later and then all the other cards trickled down the reason they're able to do that is because they've got things ready in advance it's ready to go they can plan it all out in a way that's going to make them the most money and that's a just seems like they're on an edge they've got to get this out otherwise all that are Indies wasted all that tax wasted did they'd put in it and it's also approved concept though I mean because you have many factory constraints on a node level right because your yields are gonna naturally increase over time yeah and with most things and that's why the CP market is the way it is usually when AMD releases you know like they release the the horizon 7 processor is great but then when you're talking about yields for two different chip lids then you your your yields are slashed heavy because now you have to worry about two instead of one and so you work your way up to those bigger ones because you have to sort those things out before you start selling them and NVIDIA has those kinks like you said worked out so they can offer the higher end cards first but arguably the exception of the really high end stuff like that usually that one that the atti cards or the the titan equivalents come a bit later but the the whole thing is yeah it's it's it really all comes down to manufacturing constraints and how quickly you can get on top of things to get those products to market the fastest without horrible yields because you don't want to pull an Intel and not have product and have your freakin prices skyrocket as a result but nobody wants to stake a man like it's like look if things are gone they get they're probably just gonna point people to the quarterly revenue and be like yeah we don't care because they stuff so much more invested in the in the server space and AMD's been trying to penetrate that market so much lately and I think a report came out recently saying that they hadn't been able to do that with the the threads thread Ripper out with with the with with their chips and that is wonderful news for Intel because Intel makes a boatload of money in that space people I mean you ask people how much what kind of CPUs are running their servers almost all of them are gonna say Intel and that's just how it is it's not like there's a reason for that - like I've spoken to a lot of businesses and something I've been doing my own research behind the scenes and the businesses the reason they do that is because platform stability man it's so underrated people don't talk about it enough if something works you don't need to fix it that's the bottom line and so sorry keep it's worked for them over the light their business is going healthy everything's going well for them they just like oK we've used Intel for the last five years we're gonna keep using it and that because they just don't care like things are going smoothly why change to another architecture and another manufacturer even though you could get better value for money things could improve they probably see it as a risk and so that is a big thing at the market and at the moment in the b2b sector is platform stability I know in how many data centers are still using the older chip older Zeon's right I mean do they even see that you need to upgrade given what they're doing you know it's the thing of them if you have once in a blue moon crash that will cost you a lot more business then you're having whatever 10% 20% more power consumption but the thing is once you clock down those eons to those lower levels they're much more power efficient as we saw with the 9900 t the differences that we see is enthusiasm 7:30 700 X versus 9900 K days those differences are so minimal in the server industry that it's getting to a stage now where people just don't care a whole lot that's the bottom line yes you're getting more bang for buck out of AMD but when we when we put it to the server level in power efficiency it's a lot less of a difference especially power efficiency and that's a big still a big driving force and something we pointed out to you that a lot of software suites were built around Intel architectures back in the day when Intel had almost complete control of that space and they arguably still do it's yeah why would you overhaul your entire you know set up for the sake of switching to a company that is kind of the underdog in that space right now just to support them like nobody in their right mind would do that it would make that kind of financial decision just to just to do it just to be a good guy yes plus we go back I mean plus you can go back to all the other like things as well like Intel is now branching out into ram into SSD they're getting this whole ecosystem going on so that's something that they're really that that trip to Korea that I did that really opened my eyes to the point where Intel didn't really care about the cpu too much they were focused on everything else but the cpu and that's what I was finding when I arm went to Korea that was the bottom line with that vlog that was people loved that vlog too it's just so different and that's uh what we're gonna go through with this live stream now Tek something let us know guys in chat what you think of this new live stream I got my man main man Greg and coz what I need a co-host dude I can't do this solo I can't livestream solo man I just it's tough you know you're gonna be able to give and take yeah exactly you need to have a bit of time to bounce off each other get different ideas I don't see everything straight like sometimes I mean oh I I love it when you challenge me and vice versa I like that because it not not enough people disagree in this industry and there are several ways to approach PC builds suffer ways to to approach articles that we even the ones that we've gone through to explain the things that we see usually if we're pointing out different ways of seeing things they're both kind of right because there are several factors that go into why yeah I think a lot of my viewers as well they love the straight opinion they're just the down-to-earth what's going on on the streets too I was always gonna give that opinion too regardless of all the theoretical Zand stuff so let's go to chat now we'll answer questions for a couple of minutes and then we will see you in the next tech videos what have you got planned next - what's your next video you got planned next video is gonna be it's actually a guy who is trying to sell a system he's got it listed on Craigslist and Facebook and a few other places and he messaged me on our Facebook page and asked hey what's wrong with my ad why is it not selling yeah and I took a look at it took a few notes and I told him I said you know what I'll make a video on it and I'll break it down for you because I bet a lot of people are in your boat or have been in your boat or potentially will be in your boat down the line yeah so just kind of like a been informative how to sell a PC type video but it follows a similar trend to what the scams and ripoffs videos do so with the green screen at all yeah good though i'll definitely hit that up man I wanted I want to see your opinions have you been flipping some pcs or I have not recently there is the one that we built for the ebay blitz video that I'm gonna get this I want to sell oh this what phone is that what if it's my wall dude I've had this for years I gotta get an you I was gonna say oh you can see the ad you can see the ad for the pixel 3 I'm looking for a pixel 3 Ike I want to buy used I want to buy a used phone so I'll show you my pixel for can you give me a discount I give you I gave you that lined up I'll bring it with me to Taiwan or whatever we meet again I'll bring her you know I'm gonna blast the brightness of these are jeebies oh no you see yeah ok it's just I got my RGB lights I'm doing a video on it it's like these tiles and they covered up gyproc like I told ya you see my ultrawide monitor back there and I should we'll go to chat we'll stop talking about my ultrawide monitor because yeah we said posted that on Twitter though right that was the video we said we'd answer some questions so I got a GTX 1080 Strix for 600 New Zealand dollars is that worth it and know what the conversion area say it's always 400 Ozzie a New Zealand Dollars like almost one-to-one so you probably could have picked up a card off eBay for cheaper New Zealand dollar to US Dollars point six its 0.65 to one yeah so if you put that in it's probably like 350 USD or something it's not that good I know be straight up and honest so yeah yeah okay so I'll go through some of the other questions if you see one that you really want to answer is Vega 56 and 64 still good for 220 to 300 euro I'm guessing the 56 to 20 euro yeah it depends on what country you live in with Europe right because sometimes the GPUs are a lot more expensive than they are in Australia or us so 2 20 euro could be good depending on where you live if you live in a country has got good GPU prices already then no I've never been a big fan of a go I'm gonna put that out there I think it was a power-hungry card that just didn't really deliver less you're wonderful yeah even then you're losing performance like you gotta lose performance young to vote yeah a little bit but you're saving you're like this goes back to our efficiency versus performance argument I think the trade-offs there arguably worth it because you're only losing what maybe 5% performance that's true for the sake of saving 15 to 20 percent depending on the card in power so and and temper got me remember the TDP ties into that as well how hot your cards get under load so scroll back chat I'm losing the chat hold on sir am I going to LTX this year I haven't been contacted me to join floatplane and then just ghosted me it seems to be a thing I get contacted for things from numerous people and then I just get ghost it's probably hey there's a second choice we got the first choice over here he sees come back to us see you later but why would the air but that doesn't make any sense I don't know man like I'd go to where the exit file is invited yeah that'd be really if you want me to set up an email with a my thing okay I mean you're gonna yeah okay so is the 59 30k worth retiring no it's still a good CPU man that's a really good CPU and there's a good question here someone's asking about sorry were you doing with your question I didn't know if you know that's a really good CPU that'll thank you overclock that thing it's gonna handle even like a 20 atti at 1440p and stuff I know that for certain eight that's a 650 930 ks8 cause I think oh it was it was it was a six core but it had more PCIe lanes it was 40 yeah it's for TP sadly someone asked about why the general question was why are used core i7s sometimes more expensive than their new whether than what they were new what I think that the gist of that question if we'd summarize it is why do Intel CPUs not depreciate as much as they probably should it's because they using that i7 sticker right you go to it you go to a retail reason behind it is they go to a retailer like I'm gonna give some examples in Australia and I'll try I'll convert them into American terms so you go to Best Buy we got Harvey Norman and JB hi-fi here you go to Best Buy you see that i7 sticker then you see the price attached to that people just don't know like a lot of people don't know tech dude they don't know tech period they don't care what's inside like I fixed this chick's laptop up the other day she just did not know anything dude and it had malware galore on it so she was just like so thankful for that she's like oh my laptop six years old it's so bad I said no it's actually still a quick laptop look what I do to it and I literally just made it gave it new life and she was like whoa and she bought me a burrito as well as a thank you I got that burrito and I was happy what's your what's your Taco Bell equivalent in Australia what do you have Taco Bell [Laughter] okay back to the topic at hand right they go to Best Buy oh they go to JB hi-fi and they see the prices associated with i7 then they go on the marketplace or they go on gumtree or Craigslist they see an i7 machine with the same graphics card they don't even care about what comes after the i7 they see i7 that graphics card half the price bang please give it to me they see i-5 they're gonna take a step back they can take a step back is they see that i-5 and that's gonna be associated with the lower end GPU even at the retailers so they're gonna see a 1050 with an i-5 usually right and that's how it's all working out so you get a cheap i7 off the use mark a couple of with a new GPU winning yeah and now that is especially that's especially the case I've seen personally with Apple products because typically when you list like a MacBook Air like I got 2015 MacBook Air core i3 Core i5 core i7 okay that's it the core i3 had what it was a dual core hyper threaded I think and the ultra-low power the five was four cores that i7 was four cores eight threads I think I think that's how it went yeah no it's no it's all different but anyway yeah so you see the i7 it could be a freaking 2012 MacBook Air and it's probably pulling almost the same price as a much newer MacBook Air with the same i7 and it has the same everything else in it same storage same Ram whatever yeah it could have a freaking hard drive nobody knows the difference either between hard drives and solid state drive so they just see one terabyte of storage and they think that's magnificent but it's a freaking moving disk ok so when you see these ads these guys using adjectives it's not just of one yeah good titles extreme you know it's got a it's not just a one terabyte drive it's got a huge one tariff dude they'll use they'll use words like budget as as adjectives in the sense that like you know it's a you know much more affordable option like it's a it's a budget gaming PC whatever but though they'll use that as like a scapegoat to put the trashiest hardware in their systems with like no cable management whatsoever the case like I could have made a better case out of crap in this dumpster down the street like yeah it's just not a good system even for that price even though you put the word budget in front of it you know it just doesn't it's not doing it the service that it frankly deserves which is to demean itself again I mean I do that video on how to sell the PCs people wanted to know what goes on how much do you press up your PC I thought all those pieces are gone dude like there's six pieces bang they're gone man ddr budget ddr for gaming pc that thing sold the next day like straight like straight up someone's miss Judy I want this ddr for gaming pc that's all they care that I knew because that's what the selling point do you look at the event one of the things that I put in the in the video that you'll see Fridays he was the first picture was him with the RTP remote and then RGB in the background and I said okay this is great keep this picture people want to know they can customize it how they want that's a huge selling point but I would also put in the title RGB because people like seeing that when they come from they come from a freakin you know POS Optiplex or whatever that has nothing in it not even a discrete cord they see RGB and that's already a huge step in the right direction for them because now they can customise it a bit more granted they're buying use so that's the way they rationalize it right they can at least make it look somewhat the way they want to do you know so man we got some crazy good content coming soon and I'm gonna actually now that I've talked to you about this I'm gonna be adding more adjectives into these upcoming see on videos guys this has a mind-boggling eight cause sixteen threats had to take a step back I had to take a step that's my favorite dude mind-boggling is like mine you see ads with mind-boggling in it they've copied me man they've copied me straight off this same tech yes advertising piece yes yeah I when I put a two terabyte hard drive in a build it's got a mind-boggling two terabyte hard drive enough to last you a lifetime you know you know when I used to sell this is the way that I taught this in a few older videos the way that I used to finance the channel when I was buying parts myself so I wasn't getting [__] free no is all saying companies I would sell the the systems at a slight premium usually it'd be like 10% of the build cost so if it's a 500 I build I'll profit fifty bucks off of there right yeah and I'll take all that money I'll roll into something completely different so I built a 93 4150 system with a gtx 750ti one of my first personal systems one that i could actually afford when i was in college and i sold that for 550 bucks so i made 50 bucks I built an FX 6300 system and made videos on that sold that first well actually that was kind of difficult to sell for reasons that I that was my fault I was kind of a noob still but um yeah I would I would move through inventory by slightly marking up sometimes I had to take a small loss 20 30 bucks but you know what I got to move on to something else it was more content from my channel I can do a review on the cooler I could do a review on the mother but I could do a review on the case and it was ways for me to produce content that seemed as though I already had these company connections when in reality I was just selling stuff on Craigslist telling people look fake it till you make it it works guys no one at the end of the day is gonna really know how I mean you have to like when a company sends you stuff legally here in the states you're supposed to disclose that it's sent that you didn't pay for it because depending on how you depreciate inventory or even count inventory it's some people look at it as payment it should be irrelevant it should be like it depends like yeah I guess you need those protections in place but I mean for my viewers they know like I just review start I don't care even if well you know even even if even if like people were to pay me for for whatever I wouldn't care I would never let my you're giving out people recommendations how do you sleep at night if you're misleading people and you're great I know that's your reputation yeah I think I can't your integrity in five seconds I can't I can't deal with it personally mint so that's the whole reasoning is behind this it's amazing I can't miss Li I hate it it's because I would never want someone to do that to me so it's treat others how you treat yourself sort of thing and it always comes around man it always does oh what guys I don't know why there's no scientific explanation for it but that always come I'll just get that Corsair logo on while I'm reading this last question let us know if they let us know if this Mike's any good because I told Corsair I'd check out the virtuoso on your dream yeah I'd say look I'll chest down live stream if people like it then we'll keep using it so if it's good I like I mean I like I move around and my voice is consistent wherever I go we got a question if you had the option to pick a ninety nine hundred K or a thirty nine hundred X which would you pick it depends on depends on why I was building the system if I was building the system for content creation because I still I'm still in the transition period between premiere and something else most likely to Vinci resolved I would choose a ninety nine hundred K because it's still the best gaming CPU granted to the margin and serve definitely shrinking depending on the luck with silicon lottery could run decently cool with the big cooler and the IGP goes a long way in premiere but if I was building the system to be strictly gaming and streaming I'd much rather have the 3900 bags I honestly I'm indifferent they're both pretty good man I'd say I got actually late for me percent lean towards Premiere Pro Utley towards 9900 K ah but if I was reselling it I'd go 3,900 X because it's actually more in demand than the 900k I feel for like average dude wanting to build a gaming PC he sees the 12 course 24 threads it's like yeah I want that that's that's 8 core 16 threats don't really care about anything else they sealed a game cache they like game cache what whoa what is this this has game cache and you know people will like people at the AMD event where was sort of critiquing AMD for using game cache and I said no that's brilliant like the fact that they just call it game it's the same thing it doesn't matter it's the same thing they call it game cache misses sales so I really came I think that the real comparison though like we were talking about a bit earlier in 90 100 K to 3700 X because that's where you save money by not really forgoing much so yeah if you spent what's the 3900 axis for 7480 around 500 bucks with 3900 K is usually around that price too and you're you're I understand why the question was worded that way it makes total sense to me but I think most people are looking at okay how much money am I actually spending to get said performance and when the 3700 X and I hurricane are pre darn close in almost everything then saving money makes more sense to me so I would choose 3,700 X most people are gonna be perfectly content with 8 cores 16 threads most people will not even know what to download to fully saturate 12 cores let 11 24 threads so the use case also there's also a use case argument in the sense that most people are general consumers aren't even gonna know the difference you know if you're just running chrome tabs and even streaming and gaming and you had to like somehow subliminally figure out if the CPU and your system was at 3900 X or 3700 X which is it they're not gonna know it's gonna be a freaking wild shot in the dark guess I did I'm video idea I've got this I called it okay gonna change out someone's AMD rig with the 30s like 3,600 for their 3900 X and we're gonna see after a month if they notice a difference I'm just yeah like you know clickbait it as well I covert idli like swapped out and I'll put what and we covert idli changed his seat down you to a 3600 did he notice anything guarantee y notice nothing no they won't know it's because most most people don't do things to make to make to justified the higher core gunship so yeah no that's that's what I've been preaching for a good while ever since risin started pushing the higher court count game and it's good but is it really feasible for a lot of people know they're gonna be just happy which is just as happy with a risin 5 system spend the extra money on a better graphics card well you where you will see an actual performance jump in the games that you play and you'll be much more happy so even even streaming so yeah that's about it we're gonna close this down and thanks for tuning in everybody this is tech something and yeah let us say that we're back live streaming basically I promised for a long time we're gonna get live streaming people have been like yo you gotta start live streaming again oh yeah we've been talking about this from ons dude yeah this is months and work yeah so you had a kid and yes it's been really busy and hectic I've been trying to just get back on track man like New Year's I got back into it hit me hard dude like after this empty symbol was a massive month massive and it hit me really hard as well first few days of that month I was just days and like dude just dawdling around this studio just not knowing what I was doing I was like oh I need to just jump on the couch watch some Star Wars and what I did so straight up watch some Star Wars and then just yet chilled out back on track now though things are firing up again the tech yes rhythm is firing up a hundred cents so I stay tuned for that content sub to my boy Greg he's back on track he's going for new heights everyone's everyone's jumping to new heights so 2020s the year to make it all happen and yeah yeah that was a beautiful soliloquy I love that you need to end every live stream ya with something like that just off the cuff alright there we go alright guys thanks for tuning in we'll catch you next time - episode 2 of text something and thanks Greg for coming on and yeah thanks for having me man appreciate it peace out for now do you want to take it away do you want to say peace out for now boy oh yeah I'll try it my Aussie accent peace out for now boy
