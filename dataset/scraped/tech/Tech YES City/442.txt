before I start today's tech yes loving an overhaul session my beautiful country of Australia we are in a disaster at the moment it's an emergency bushfires are really destroying people's lives at the moment you guys have a spare dollar in you're feeling charitable then I'll put a link or a couple links in the description below where you can help out some charities and just help those in need who have been affected by these disasters welcome to a new decade for 2020 here at Tech yes City and I've got a special right behind me here for you guys this is an fx-8150 machine has 16 gigabytes of RAM has a liquid cooler but it is ridiculously rusty and filthy and we're going to be giving this thing some tech yes loving and cleaning it up we're in the last part on that I did I got this PC in a deal with three other pcs for a hundred and fifty Ozzie dollars so if I had to pro-rider this thing it'd be coming in at 50 Aussie dollars however what's inside it we've got an an tech 620 what high current gamer power supply and now although it's filthy it's pretty much one of those power supplies that we love in this situation which will go perfect with like an HD 7950 which I'm actually curious about to see the performance of this graphics card in 2020 so with all that aside let's see what we've got to do here where it looks like we're actually gonna have to add in some drives as well both the neccessity and a hard drive and bring this thing up to perfection where perfection in this case since we're gonna be flipping it we'll be adding some LED strips one dollar LED strips to bring up the bling [Music] so after cleaning it down initially so much dirt and grime came off and now what we're doing is we're localizing all the parts basically taking out each piece bit by bit so I can give it even more thorough cleaning and these fans at the front here you can even just see through the mesh there's just dirt all inside it's easily the most disgusting part of this build but everything's gonna be a lot easier to clean now I should get through this in about 10-15 minutes and we'll have something that's ready to put back together and start playing games so my friends gave me one of the best Christmas presents I could ever ask for and that is to protect my lungs for 2020 and the new decade so let's strap this thing on [Music] [Music] and here we are with the build it's all finished it's working first go I didn't have to do anything this time around there's no problems no diagnosing and the build we've taken most of the rust off there's still some really hard spots in there that are ingrained into this build but for what it's worth we added that $1 LED strip and everything went really smoothly this PC is running nicely there's no odd noises coming out of it I'm really shocked so this thing is ready to game we're installing Windows we've got that SSD in there now the 120 gigabyte the one terabyte hard drive but there's still is one scary possibility and that is after we've installed Windows 10 Pro there could be that Windows needs activation message in the bottom right hand corner that's a possibility for today's video sponsor s cd-keys has you covered if that message appears up in your bottom right-hand corner then for as little as 13 USD you can get a single and Windows 10 Pro user license just go use the link in the description below put in the coupon code TYC SK to save yourself 12% get that CD key by using PayPal or any other payment method I then get that product code copy paste it put it into Windows 10 click activate and I'm now good to go and speaking of good to go let's boot those games off and get into the benchmark [Music] so we've just finished the first benchmark here and that's f1 2019 and the numbers are actually pretty decent already at 61 average FPS 17.1% loaders actually look decent too however since we have a liquid cooler on the cpu and the temperatures are already really good and we've got a fancy triple slot cooler on the graphics card - you guys wouldn't forgive me if I didn't overclock this setup though there's just one little problem and that is the motherboard itself hasn't got any heat sinks over the vrm and it's only a mediocre board at best so we're gonna remedy that right now by adding some little heat sinks and also a cooling solution over our heat sinks and then come back and see what overclocks numbers we can come up with [Music] [Music] so with all that gaming out of the way I decided to run two different tests here just to see how much of an impact overclocking made in this particular case or in this build and we saw with the overclock results we're getting around 10% extra performance over the out-of-the-box settings on both GPU and CPU versus the non overclocked at vs. overclocked figures and so this was the scariest part was the power consumption and we refer to this when we're running a heav'n benchmark and we're getting around 500 watts overclocked from the wall as opposed to not overclocking around they're getting 380 what's well I shouldn't say only 380 what's is still a pretty high figure considering the results we're getting here today but the most frustrating part of this bill would easily be that motherboard where everything else the power supply the GPU the liquid cooler and also we had an SSD and there was geared up towards running a faster system but in the end the motherboard was letting it down even after we added heat sinks on we're getting a very shaky 4.6 gigahertz and of course even if we dropped it down to completely 100% stable and even the most strenuous benchmarks we're only able to get a 4.4 gigahertz and this is the funny thing the extra powerful sumption in my opinion just isn't worth it in this particular build this is the first time I've done a build where I've overclocked it and actually wouldn't recommend overclocking this configuration even though we got better performance results and that's clearly because those power consumption results are up around over 25% and the performance isn't really getting a big boost from that also in relation to this motherboard I came into a couple of complications when I was overclocking and that is going into the BIOS I was able to see that sometimes it was going really weird where it would say 1.3 volt instead of the default 1.41 and then also when I was overclocking too I was pressing the minus key and it was adding voltage instead of me pressing the plus key on the numpad which is the first time I've seen this so the BIOS in the way they programmed it really needed an update it was just one of those times where I've seen a board that was just really rushed out there even though was a 990 FX it was still not really designed for overclocking which in this of fx-8150 s and also 8358 cause you definitely wanted to get a good motherboard if you wanted to overclock them so there are some of these boards that were released on this 990 FX chipset and they just didn't overclock and even though that added heat sinks in here today is something that I wouldn't recommend in the long term despite us having a good power supply good liquid cooler and also a decent GPU the good thing though about the HD 7950 even in 2020 to this date it can still get up and boogie and the 3d back frame buffer is definitely decent for playing games at 1080p medium or low settings and in the case of fortnight we had that at high settings with post-processing turned off and also the shadows set to off to and we've got a smooth experience where was the first time where I got this lightsaber and I was running around I just had a lot of fun with it and it still played some smooth FPS which is great and then you guys probably thinking Brian your test fortnight too much there's actually a reason that I do that and that's mainly because when I go to flip it people always ask can this PC play for nine and now that I can comfortably say yes it'll play over 60 FPS at 1080p high settings and if the price is right they get to come and snatch it up but lastly in relation to this build the cleaning did take a while but it was definitely rewarding whether before and after was just a night and day difference and adding that LED strip and definitely added some good contrast between the blue and red lighting it made something that would look rather dull now look actually decent especially at a low price point and another trend that I'm seeing here especially on the channel is that recently I've come into quite a few FX pcs lately whether it be a motherboard CPU combo or a whole build with either an 8 core a 6 core in it and the funny thing is is that you'll probably see a lot more of this in 2020 where people who had those older FX systems are now ready to upgrade to Zen 2 and since they go on the AMD architecture which does represent especially good value for money on Zen - you're gonna see a lot more of these systems in the wild which means that they'll probably be a lot more AMD FX budget systems coming on the channel but that being said let us know in the comment section below how you guys feel about these old affects processes and also motherboards me personally of course I prefer the Zeon's but if one comes up at the right price especially in today's build where we picked up all the components and we've finished the build off for a hundred and thirty ozzie dollars which is roughly ninety US dollars and it can still play games at 1080p I'd say that's a pretty good win in my books there was always I love reading your thoughts and opinions and we've got a question of the day from prac and they asked can I replace it with an i3 540 and get 60fps and csgo he's referring to an older build that I did a long time ago that I built for roughly a hundred Aussie dollars and the i3 540 when we look at that CPU that will play csgo at 60fps it's definitely a CPU that is not really geared towards gaming in 2020 but if you want to play a title like League of Legends or csgo and you're on a real strict budget then this CPU will get the job done and the last good thing about that I three is you still got an upgrade path to a very inexpensive Xeon X 30 for 40 or X 30 for 70 which is for cos 8 threads and you can overclock it and I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button and if you've been watching and you're not subscribing you enjoying the content and you're still watching then the subscribe button and ring that bells down there if you want to see the videos the moment they drop here at Tech yes City and before I get on out of here also I was lucky in that this build did have Windows already activated but if you want to get a cheap license and I'll put the link in the description below for air CD keys and also if you're feeling charitable and you have a spare dollar then I'll put some links for some support causes in Australia where you can help victims of the bush fires which is a really bad emergency at the moment I've done it a couple of hundred dollars as I said in the intro and it just goes towards people who are in desperate need at the moment they've lost their homes and whatnot and I love it when all of us band together and help one another out and with that aside I'll catch you in the next Tech video very soon peace out for now bye you [Music]
