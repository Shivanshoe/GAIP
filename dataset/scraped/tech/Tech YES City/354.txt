this PC on the desk behind me is a
recent unit that I picked up in a deals hunt for roughly 300 Aussie dollars or a
little over 200 United States big ones and it has an RX 470 inside of it and it also has
an Athlon 3000G, a single stick of ddr4 memory and it was untuned and it also
had the case, the power supply, the a320 motherboard and a 2 terabyte hard drive. So at this price I could really only see one thing and that was potential, and
so my objective with this build here today is to what I call spruce it up (for a cheap budget fortnite gaming PC) now
you're probably thinking what is a spruce Prime what's a sprucing what is
this new term that you've been thrown around lately
well it's a combination of spicing it up so we're gonna be cleaning it up and
making it look better since got a lot of dust on it and we're also gonna be
juicing it up in that we're gonna be adding some components onboard and so
that makes it a sprucing and trying to confuse your friend Bruce with spruce
anyhow in terms of those upgrades they're all pretty important to get
better performance so the first thing we're going to be doing is adding a
risin 5 1600 AF 6 cores 12 threads and performs pretty much the same as a risin
5 2,600 now we're also going to be throwing in a 120 gigabyte SSD so this
thing can boot up and use Windows 10 a lot quicker the next thing we're gonna
be doing is upgrading the graphics card 5600 XT pretty good price performance
and will perform a lot better than an rx 470 then the last component we're
throwing in of course and I believe one of the most important is to make this
thing dual channel so we're gonna be adding in another 8 gigabyte stick of
memory for ddr4 there with all that aside I'm gonna test out this thing
right now in its current state and then do the upgrades and see how much
performance we gain check yes citizens I have negotiated a new 18 percent off
coupon code on a Windows 10 Pro single end user
licensed with today's video sponsor s cd-keys for as little as 13 bucks using
the coupon and the link in the description below characters not even
getting displayed [Music]
see the trees what is going on
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so we've now just finished benchmarking
this PC and it was a really weird experience what we've got right here is
the best case scenario for honor actually ran with no stuttering it ran
pretty smooth 75 average FPS 1080p high settings 45 minimum but for tonight I it
was doing some really weird stuff in fortnight none of the things would
displaying properly there was like trees going through my character and I
couldn't get a proper reading in that game I couldn't even like hit the
benchmark key which I can do right now on this paper game to get an accurate
benchmark number so that was really weird and then doom that was stuttering
as well and that's really weird for doom to stutter
this was 1080p high settings as well for doom as opposed to fortnight where we
use competitive settings so doom and fortnight were really bad experience but
of course that single channel untuned memory is probably most likely the
biggest culprit for those two games not running properly the other side it's
finally time to give this thing some check yes love and change the video card
over put the extra RAM in and that 1600 F we also may have to update the BIOS
just as a precautionary measure [Music]
so now we've finished up the sprucing of this piece see it is so much cleaner
before it was so dirty to the point where the cloth that we were using to
clean it with did pick up a lot of dirt and also the dust filter under the
powerplay that was filthy and another problem we came into was at the rear of
the build one of the USB ports had the i/o shield protect a bit going into the
USB port which is really not a good thing you can't really use that but it
could also cause some problems but now that we've fixed up everything we've
tuned the memory to twenty eight hundred megahertz since it is using and
originally like a twenty four hundred mega stick and we've added in another
2666 stick this is pretty much budget memory but we can still clock it to
twenty eight hundred megahertz and get some good frames but it's also in dual
channel now so that's that with this bill but another good thing we did was
we pulled out an RX 470 and also that dual core 3000 G so we can use that for
an office PC later and then this graphics card right here we can use that
in a separate build at a later date but finally with all that aside it's now
time to test this thing out in games and see how much performance we shall gain
[Music] and we've just finished up now
benchmarking this PC right here the spruce ax and I was just blown away by
how much smoother things were for starters but also it's such a good path
to consider if you don't mind buying someone else's PC that they have and
they just really had a bad configuration from the get-go because what we saw here
was dooms suddenly lifted to over a hundred and seventy fps 180 FPS when it
originally was at around forty four fps now the rx 470 is going to go a lot
harder than 44 fps in this game at 1080p high settings it was just being let down
by the single channel untuned memory in the 3000 G now adding in the Rison v
1600 F made a huge difference in Doom it also made a huge and this was the
biggest difference in fortnight the game was completely playable and we're
getting around like 200 FPS on average it was working absolutely fine
everything was smooth so that may be a problem if you guys are playing
fortnight and your system isn't configured properly especially if it's
running in single channel memory and you've got say a dual-core you may come
into this issue where things are not appearing properly on your screen and so
that's something to be a guest aware of with fortnight where I've actually never
run into that problem and I initially thought maybe it could have been the
hard drive but here's the scary thing is that is I actually tested all these
games out and redid it with the hard drive because all the games were already
installed I didn't have to reload anything and so now I'm gonna go back
after this video and reinstall the whole OS on the SSD and make things even
better because I think in fortnight it was dipping the point 1% Louis because
that hard drive was having a hard time loading up background process in Windows
while it's trying to load up some of the stuff in the game so that's definitely
something you can be aware of if you're diagnosing problems for your friends say
in fortnight in there running with potatoes they might want to put in some
dual channel memory or upgrade to at least
true quad-core the last game actually surprised me the most and that was for
honor where this game is clearly extremely well optimized for PC where it
was running absolutely fine beforehand and then after we still got a massive
boost in fps we're running it like 166 FPS average and the minimums were
incredible too but it didn't give us in respects to the other two games were
running the same amount of gain if that makes any sense even though we've got
over double the FPS it still ran kind of smooth beforehand so that was impressive
to see with for honor I do like it when these PC games are really well optimised
and that's one title I can think of off the top of my head but another title as
well would be strange Brigade they're probably like after doing this testing
they probably the top two games on PC that you can even run in single channel
and you probably won't notice a huge difference to your FPS it then becomes
GPU bound where you'd have to upgrade you grab a scar to get more FPS that
being said the RX 470 is capable of more FPS and that game and with all that out
of the way I hope you guys enjoyed today's video definitely on the AMD site
I like the a320 motherboards they go really well with six core 12 threads
especially the Rison 5 1600 AF even though we can't have a clock it on this
build it still runs absolutely fine out of the box at 3.7 gigahertz all core and
we change that budget memory to 2800 megatons now something about that budget
memory right if you come into this real cheap 2400 no heat sinks and no XMP
profile memory you can still get more out of it and I found twenty eight
hundred megahertz around like what we've got here seal 17 is still a decent speed
and it will give you a lot more FPS than the previous config on that memory and
of course we didn't break the bank in sprucing this thing up and the FPS was
really smooth so this is an option to consider if you're in the market and you
want to get really good FPS for the dollar and the story behind this PC was
apparently the guy I bought it off he like I don't even know because I've been
asking for more details and I just haven't really followed up on the
situation properly to get both sides of the story yet but one thing you guys
send the previous video in the comments this is the most important thing to come
out of stuff like this and the previous story where I got this PC was that when
you're buying used parts always make sure you check it out and it's working
and you're getting what you pay for before you buy it and so I think that's
the most important thing rather than the actual story itself it's the message
involved and that is when you buy stuff in the PC world especially if it's got
that use price tagging this is a funny thing even when it's new and you buy it
from some Amazon stores and the price is too good to be true just double check
and ask around I mean sometimes with a good deal you
don't have time to ask around so it's kind of the main thing with use parts if
the seller has no reputation no feedback definitely go make sure that part is
working before you purchase it that's the most important thing and without
side I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below
what you would have done differently if you had got this streaming PC which
couldn't even play fortnight without streaming so that streaming thing that
when I originally bought it that way if this wasn't a stream PC now it's a
streaming PC you can definitely stream but what you would have done differently
love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the
day which comes from Super Kahuna and they asked do you have a life and if you
guys keep watching the tech yes city around here I think you know the answer
and that is no I don't have a life and when RT X 3000 hits in August yeah like
if I even if I had a little bit of a life it's gone if you guys have stayed
this spot and you're enjoying that content around tech yes city and you
know what to do here that sub button ring that bell to get this content the
moment it drops in this sub box and I'll catch on the next one very soon peace
out for now wait [Music]
