When Aorus decided to make an rtx 3080 they didn't just decide to make a standard two slot design they decided to go over the top and then over the top again because this thing is the biggest graphics card i've seen and i said that in the rtx 3090 review when that thing came through and that was huge this thing is even taller and it features two 1100 mil fans and a 100ml fan and i've rarely seen bigger than 100 mil fans so Aorus are definitely serious about the cooling performance of this behemoth right here however speaking of behemoth the price tag is also going to be pretty behemoth too coming in at 899 usd or in australia 1749 AUD and in the US that's a 200 over msrp price though for that extra 200 are you getting your money's worth let's roll those gaming benchmarks and get back to the verdict [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] so there it is with the gaming benchmarks the rtx 3080 aorus extreme was pulling some pretty impressive numbers it was coming that echelon over that of a standard 3080 even that of the founders and that of the previous vulcan that i've tested here at the channel but it was using more power and this is one thing that's important to note the power consumption numbers from the wall i had to double check them because they were pretty high they're the highest i've seen for a card out of the box here at the studio though on the flip side when i did manually overclock this gpu i got even yet more performance out of it to the point where i was coming close to that of an rtx 3090 and if you are into under vaulting and dropping the temperatures and the noise then this thing did undervolt exceptionally well dropping over 130 watts and then from the wall roughly about 140 watts from the wall when we did indeed under vaulted however the performance did drop to around six to seven percent in the gaming benchmark numbers though temperatures and noise this thing right here you can put it on your shoulder because it's that big when we look at the out of the box noises this thing was generating in 29 degrees c ambient environment here it was spinning up to 79 auto fan speeds out of the box getting 66 degrees and this was i'm going to say this is the quietest 79 i've ever heard from any graphics card in my life i was surprised the noise was quite low 40 decibels for this fan speed then if we dropped it down to uh 60 percent the car did start thermal throttling however it did drop the noise down to 31 decibels so if you do want to undervolt your graphics card and you do love very low amounts of noise and say for instance you're getting like h115i rgb platinum and you want a super quiet pc then this card will do the job if you want to undervolt it so i was kind of surprised at that out of the box if you manually set it to 60 it's going to thermal throttle and then if you up it to 80 you're going to get one degree less and similar noise then 100 the noise does ramp up significantly into the 50 decibel zone but it does drop the temperatures down quite a bit but what you will see here is when i do test these temperatures i do delta adjust them to compare them to all the other cars that i've got around here so the cooling the performance and the numbers they all check out though something else that the aurus does and something that i've liked about i guess the auris lineup of graphics cards in general is that they add a heap of extra outputs here for the cards and you've got here three displayport 1.4s and then two hdmi 2.1s those being the outer two then the middle one is an hdmi two so auras do an excellent job and they always have done an excellent job in terms of giving more outputs on their graphics cards moving over to the side of the card we got three pcie eight pin ins then below that we've got an lcd screen or also calling this lcd edge view and you can program this with a custom image custom text you can make the text smaller bigger and they've also got six different rgb zones throughout the card which you can all customize in their software and i will say that i do like the custom text that auris have introduced here i thought it didn't look tacky at all and it looked quite neat and it matched the rest of the text on the card that was hard printed however if you are feeling a little bit adventurous then you can also upload animated gifs and display them on the screen too and then at the rear the last thing to go over is they've got the drill holes here if you want to install a bracket to stop gpu sag too though on that note of back plates and gpu sag i noticed when i was mounting this into a case that it was actually holding up very well it wasn't sagging from the get-go so they've put a really good back plate that is sturdy and isn't going to sag at least not as quickly over time as some graphics cards that you get in i've seen some cards in the past as soon as you put them in they just start to wobble down and you like it does sort of if you're a little bit ocd like me with symmetry it does sort of like it just looks a little bit off but this doesn't have that so it's a good thing though with all that out of the way it's finally conclusion time where this card right here you also get a toy angel bios and also a four-year warranty so they've come in with this card at the premium end of the market and the funny thing is is it's also 50 more expensive than the strix and is it a better choice than the strix well that depends if you need the lcd screen but i will say one thing the performance here was pretty much maximum for an rtx 3080. i don't think i haven't tested the strix personally but i don't think it's going to get much more better than this but it's not going to get much more power hungry too because this thing does use up extra power and we're going to stop that right now and say look if you're going to buy this thing and get it out of the box because you want the best performing 3080 out there then this thing will juice more power so you will want to have really good airflow inside your case to accommodate for that extra heat so in a nutshell when it comes to cards like this rtx 3080s that come over that msrp i look for is there anything wrong with this card and to be fair it's not going to be the best value for money play but i think aorus have definitely nailed the design of this card everything from top to bottom is simply premium my only critique however of this aorus extreme edition is that silent bios when i started testing it i went through a few different numbers and the performance was quite low especially versus the power consumption and especially versus that of under vaulting so if it's any feedback to gigabyte i'd like to see them rework this silent bios and then maybe re-release a firmware update because i know a lot of people out there will appreciate the lower noise profile especially since this card is more than capable of providing that and really utilize the behemoth cooler for making less noise the extra outputs are also really handy if you're going with an office set up off of one graphics card but you do everything on that one gpu and then your game in your free time so aorus rtx 3080 extreme edition this is that card for someone who wants the best but at the same time they're also prepared to pay for it and whether you're prepared to pay for it that's your answer is what i've shown here in the video worth it for you hope this has helped out in making that decision and if you guys enjoyed today's video hit that like button orris for us and let us know in the comment section below what you think of this behemoth right here love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here and it comes from leandro martin peralta and they ask i got a gtx 750 for 10 new zealand is it a good deal xd and i think from the xd smiley face you know that that was a good deal gtx 750 for 9.50 aussie cents and seven dollars us you're sure and a good deal do you want to sell that deal to me perhaps and then i can get the xd face on as well hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell on the way out and i'll see you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye we are going to have to act if we want to live in a different world you
