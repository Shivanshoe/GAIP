WD have just released that new SN 550 line of PCIe nvme SSDs these come in a 250 gigabyte 500 gigabyte or one terabyte flavor right here we've got the one terabyte solution which is a PCIe 3m vm e m2 2280 solution so if your board has this slot what you have to do to install is simply put the drive in screw it down and you're good to go so in today's video we're gonna put this drive to the test looking at a speeds and consistency and comparing it against an SSD though a quick disclaimer today's video is sponsored by WD however I decided I wanted to take a look at the blue line of drives because traditionally the blue lineup has always given in my opinion the best value for money where you're still getting that nvme PCI solution but you're not breaking the bank so let's get into it [Music] so the best thing about the WD lineup is not only the price but also the five-year warranty included now on the box their advertising 2400 megabytes per second I've seen when testing other SSDs in the past that sometimes you can come under these speeds or sometimes even come severely under these appetite speeds which is not what you want so it's a great thing to see that the SN 550 is delivering over these advertised speeds now comparing it against a traditional SSD you're going to get roughly sometimes up to five times the performance out of the read speeds and then over five times again on the right speeds now another thing about the SM 550 model is that the temperatures we're really good we did put it both on and heatsink and off the heatsink and running a stress test loading up the SSD to 100% so the temperatures go up to 58 degrees with that heatsink on and then without a heatsink on source go up to 77 degrees which both these temperatures are absolutely fine for an nvme SSD now lastly in terms of the hardware itself it is a 20 to 80 drive so it is very small very easy to install as we said before but they're also using Western Digital in-house controller on this particular SSD itself they've also kept the cost down by using 3d net and coupling that with a burst bank drive which is where you see the highest speeds coming out on this particular drive now of course the last point to touch on is why would you want to go with an nvme drive over a typical sada 3 SSD and this is a question that comes down to what you intend to do with these SSDs now the Blues coming into their current price point are very competitive even to that of typical standard SSDs where they used to come in a bit cheaper than PCIe nvme drives but the one big benefit not just with the speeds is that we also get to use this drive in an environment like Adobe Premiere Pro so if you're a content creator things like snapping in video files that are of large sizes say 100 megabits plus will be a bit faster on an nvme drive versus say a sawed a3 drive if you're a content creator this is otherwise referred to as a scratch drive where in this case these drives double down as good scratch drives but they also come in with great value for money for doing so and that about does it for today's video if you guys enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button for us also if you're interested in getting AWD blue SM 550 then I'll put some links in the description below for you guys where as I said in the intro these come in three different flavors 250 gigabyte 500 gigabyte and one terabyte I particularly really liked this one terabyte it's definitely a good Drive if you're on a budget but still want really good buy for money the warranty and also the performance and without a side I'll catch you guys in a nother tech video very soon and also lastly again thanks for WD for sponsoring out this video and I'll see you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
