today we are going to be taking a look at the i7 wait i9 11 900k with eight cores and this is intel's rick wait what does that sound d covery intel's first discovery now it's time to roll the benchmark wait wait wait don't do no don't roll the benchmarks don't no don't roll the benchmarks intel's i9 11900k cpu is finally here and you probably hear by the tone on my voice that i'm not too excited about this cpu and in fact in the intro and i hope you guys enjoyed that intro we call this a d covery because it just seems like intel's gone backwards with the 11th gen rocket lake launch and the reasons being we'll discuss all that in today's video but let's get on straight away into the gaming benchmarks and this is where intel put it out there before this launch that the 11900k is going to be the new gaming king it's going to be the one to get if you want the most fps so we decided to pit it against the 5800x which in the past i've tested this and this was the new gaming king in terms of getting the most fps and they're both eight core 16 threats so today's review is going to be focused really on pitting these two cpus against each other though we will show other benchmarks but let's look at first of all cs go a competitive multiplayer title extremely competitive to the point where you want the highest fps especially at 1080p so we've decided to test 1080p low settings and here's where in csgo the 5800x scored a victory over the 11 900k and then moving over now to fortnite where we got the competitive multiplayer settings up at dx12 we saw the 5800x again score another victory over that of the 11900k though moving over to dota 2 this is where the 11900k scored its only victory in today's gaming benchmarks beating the 5800x by only a slight margin at least compared to the other games and especially f1 2020 which will pull up next where the 5800x scored a sizable victory in this game and this was again dx12 on ultra low settings and also for the graphics card we use the rtx 3090 in today's comparison to max out the fps of course at 1080p ultra low settings you'll still be getting these same fps results on a variety of different gpus though the last game we decided to test before i threw in the towel on the 11900k was call of duty black ops cold war where the 5800x again pulled off a victory now i was using the same apples to apples memory clocks 3600 megahertz over four eight gigabyte dimms on both setups and on the 11900k i did use the gear one ratio for these tests which essentially puts the imc clock at the same clock as the memory and if you guys are wondering what the key difference between the i7 and the i9 is it's not just clock speeds it's also this gear ratio though in terms of value both the i7 11 700 ga and the 11 900k i'm gonna make a argument against both these cpus for any sort of value and even then for a premium pick too but let's basically sum up gaming in a nutshell for you guys before we move on to productivity numbers and here is where you pick the title intel is losing and they're losing by quite a big margin here especially considering amd was behind with the 3000 series ryzen ships and then they came out on top with their 5000 series chips and i think what this spells for intel is something of dire straights especially for the retail consumers of their chips and whether they want to go with intel versus amd for a future pick of cpus whether they're a competitive gamer or whether they just want the best value and even with the ryzen 5000 chips this is the biggest problem i had with those chips was that they weren't as good as a raw value for money in terms of the raw cpu value versus the 3000 series chips that amd launched this time around the 11th gen even distorts that ratio even more where if you look at the prices of 10th gen intel cpus right now especially for gaming and especially if you're gonna couple these things with a say for instance rtx 3070 fingers crossed when they actually come back in stock but if you're going to couple the mid-range gpus you're going to get far better value especially on intel's side by going with the 10th gen cpu especially the current prices these 11th gen chips at least from what i've tested here and i'm looking directly at the i9 11 900k it makes no sense whatsoever at least from these numbers furthermore we did have a bit of stability issues with getting the gaming numbers a hundred percent before this i had gaming numbers that were even lower and then i got contacted by intel as well as the board vendors and they're like please update the bios so literally the numbers i'm showing you here are only a few days old where i actually had the 11900k now on hand for nearly two months that's how long it's been i've had this chip for so this is really one of those launches that i'm just sitting here confused and it makes no sense to me at all not just in the value term but also on the build up towards this launch right now but let's get on to some productivity numbers here with 7-zip showing the compressed and decompressed numbers here comparing it directly to the 5800x i do see the 5800x scoring a sizeable victory here moving over to the corona benchmark pits these two cpus at pretty much the same score getting one minute and 26 seconds moving over to v-ray showed that these two eight cores were pretty much uh neck and neck in this particular benchmark and then next up here we had cinebench r20 where initially i got around 5400 points but when i did the re-test with these bios updates i was scoring a now bigger score on the multi-core score than that of the 5800x so the bios updates perhaps they're pushing these chips a little bit too hard though i will come back and look at that in a couple of weeks because i'm told this is what you're going to get uh in terms of a retail experience out of the 11 900k if you couple it with say for instance the board that we used here today which is the z590 tai chi though the power consumption was around 210 watts out of the box for an 8 16 thread that is pretty huge and in fact the power efficiency here is a lot worse than that of the 5800x which if we look at the 5800x that was already aggressively clocked out of the box and that was amd's highest clocking chip so i got the best numbers in gaming with the 5800x in terms of overall versus the other amd chips and even versus the intel chips but when it comes to intel's chip that thing's clocked sky high 4.8 gigahertz all core and then it goes to 5.1 gigahertz single core but the power consumption is really high for a cpu out of the box and this is going to 1.4 volt the last few productivity benchmarks to go over here is adobe premiere pro where if you want to edit videos on an 8 core both the 5800 x and also the 11 900 k will do a good job but if you are doing a lot of productivity and you need the extra cores and threads then amd have the 5900x and also the 5950x which are phenomenal options and will cut down productivity times when it comes to using a cpu and cpu utilization in particular benchmarks though the last one we're going to look at is geekbench 5 where we got the highest single core score with the 11 900k this is the highest score i've seen in this benchmark period but we also got a multi-core score that came in a little bit higher than that of the 5800x so intel's really pushing the 11 900k to the limits here to try and make it relevant in productivity scores but the problem here is is that they don't have an answer to the 5900x especially the 5900x which is coming in at a great price point for 12 cause 24 threads so now with those productivity numbers aside and also the gaming benchmarks being done we're left with the cpu that really is just not impressing at all it uses more power than the amd option it actually costs more than the amd option too being what i'm told 540 msrp versus amd's 449 on the 5800x you can also get a 5900x which is going to be pretty much miles better than anything than the 11 900k so i'm left here scratching my head as to looking for even something relatively positive about the 11900k and i just can't find it because it just pretty much is losing in all fields when it comes to being relevant now i understand that intel are stuck on 14 nanometer and they've got 10 nanometer in the pipeline and they couldn't get out the rocket lake cpus on that 10 nanometer because the scores in today's benchmarks would have probably been even worse where they couldn't get the core clocks as high but at the same time people don't want to game on promises they need to game on what's out in the market now and what they can purchase and even that same argument can be said for productivity and working so basically to conclude simply for you guys with the 11900k it's just not a cpu that i would go for personally and in fact i would rather go for the 10900k or some of the f options out there which are coming in extremely cheap on the 10th gen at the moment for instance the 10700f great value play especially in australia that thing was coming in i picked up some recently for 300 aussie dollars that's coming under half the cost of this acor 16 thread and when it comes to gaming especially with mid-range gpus i'm pretty sure i'm not going to see really any relevant difference i'm also going to be using less power i can get a cheaper motherboard to run the cpu on and i even get an included cooler with that cpu so the value proposition of the 11900k just doesn't make any sense at all they're performance figures they're not great i just think intel needed to do more with this launch especially if they're going to charge more than their 10th gen chips which is looking like that is the case anyhow guys this cpu is a miss from me despite what the board partners have done with their new motherboard lineup and the new features like pcie 4.0 especially on the m.2 and also the pc 4.0 on the 16x slot for the graphics card which is now the cpu supports pci4 natively that's really not making a whole lot of a difference especially for gamers it's actually just means more money out of your pocket if you want to go with intel so to be blunt i'd give the 1100k a miss i will be taking a look at the f series cpus when i can get my hands on them and also stay tuned where we're going to be doing a live stream talking about sort of summing up all the other reviews and looking at what the market thinks of the 11900k and also the 11th gen and we'll be doing that tomorrow so stay tuned make sure you hit that sub button ring that bell get the vids as soon as they drop and also if you enjoyed this one then be sure to hit that like button for us and we've also got the question of the day before we get on out of here and it comes from mad kappa 6 and they ask the only question i have and i'm guessing it's probably been asked before will windows update wreck the install and put the bloat back in so we recently did a windows 10 video i'll put the link up here where we changed the iso around a little bit and took out all the bloatware and all the crap that we don't use personally here at the studio and we don't need and we optimized it and basically we've left in the ability to still update the os but we're not entirely sure what will happen when microsoft rolls up a big update so basically when the next feature update happens we'll take a look at that for you guys and if necessary we'll be releasing another tyc version and hopefully with some even more improvements glad you guys are also the feedback on that has been overwhelmingly positive glad you guys are loving it we've been using it here as well and it's been absolutely amazing and without a start it's time for me to get on out of here with my i7 oh wait that's that's right it's a 99 11 900k actually yeah ate anyway i'm going peace out for now you
