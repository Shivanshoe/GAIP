AMD B550 is finally out here in the wild
and I gotta say straight up this is a weird one of sorts and for a few reasons
and we'll go over all those before we get into this board right here but first
of all the delay on B550 versus X570 is huge right it's almost a year later
and then we look at the differences at a chipset level they are sporting some
differences which B550 we've got 12 PCIe lanes versus 16 on X570 but on the
X570 you've got those chipset lanes being all peace a 4.0 whereas opposed to
the be 550 they're actually four PCI 300 lanes and eight PC 800 lanes though of
course the CPU itself gives out 20 PCI 4.0 lanes for for an nvme Drive and then
16 for that top slot before your graphics card and whatnot so B550
essentially does have PCI 4.0 it's just not on the chipset so the benefit of
this is it does allow the chipset heatsink to have no fan and it runs a
lot cooler when we're testing this B550 right here with a graphics card and an
MDOT 2 loaded up over PC a3 it was giving out really good temperatures so
you've got nothing to worry about from here on in on b550s and chipset
heatsink temperatures and worrying about having a fan on them just a simple
heatsink on your b54 motherboard and you're good to go pretty much just like
the b450s out there now in terms of the chipset pricing this is one thing I kind
of don't understand at the moment I've been asking around everywhere to try and
get an idea of how much you're paying for the actual license with B550
versus X570 versus B450 for example and from what I can gather I can only
really guesstimate these costs where I think B550 would be somewhere around
40 to 45 dollars and B450 for example would be somewhere around 20 to 25
dollars and then X570 would be around 50 to $60 so you are getting a discount
on the chipset license versus X570 but that being said continuing through the
differences we no longer have as USB 3.0 ports where we've got up to a
max of 8 3.2 parts on X570 then a max of 2 3.2 and for 3.1 in conjunction to 6
3.1 and two together and then we've got a maximum of 6 USB 2 ports versus 4 on
the X570 so they're given B 550 the max allowance of 6 but this is the weird
thing with the b-52d tied to you've actually got 11 in total USB 3 ports
where the front out you'll get an additional 3.2 which makes it 3 in total
and then you've also got an additional 4 USB 3.1 so that makes it 11 USB 3 ports
in total if you hook up your front I oh so that's the main differences with B550 and X570 but you also get on select X570 boards support for SLI and also
env link where as opposed to b5 do you just get in this case crossfire support
and no NV link or SLI support however the good news all starts to come
together for B550 where there are no limits on what the manufacturers can do
with the vrm and also with that the overclocked ability where the B550 tied
to you with a 3950 X both out of the box 3.95 gigahertz you were just
getting lukewarm on the heatsink in the VR em so it was absolutely no stress at
all even in the hottest climate in the world you'd have no problems with this
motherboard without even needing a fan it's basically that good then we move on
to the 4.3GHz custom OC that I did here which which point around 200
watts directly to the CPU as opposed to the three point nine five gigahertz
that's pulling about 126 Watson and I did cross-references with power from the
wall just to make sure the figures are right in hardware info and what we saw
here was a maximum PCB readout temperature of 74 degrees and then on
the heatsink 65 degrees then the software readout was 69 degrees so vrm
with customer sees the max you can go on a 3950X pretty much you are seeing
this motherboard just handling it absolutely fine this is in a 22 C
ambient - by the way running Cinebench are 20 watts just constantly looped so
we're utilizing that avx2 instruction set as well they're going
through this vrm more specifically we've got here a 14 plus two phase power
designs - 16 phases in total 14 for the CPU - for the SOC and that is rigged up
with vishay si si six five four CD 50 amp direct drive MOSFETs and then
they're using 60 amp inductors and then for the doublers we've got here the
Intersil is l six six one seven eight and the PDR controller is the raw - two
nine zero zero four and for the caps that 12k ninja cons so this vrm is
actually better than the x5 seventy Taichi so it is cool to see as rock and
this is the first time I've seen this where the little brother board is
beating out the big brother and not just phases but also the quality of some of
the components for instance the 60 amp inductors as for the heatsink it's 253
grams so slightly heavier than the x5 70 taichi's heatsink and it's made of all
solid alloy and it's got heat pads on both the inductors and the MOSFETs of a
cooling both those down so for m dot two temperatures and slot edge they've got
two nvme slots on this board the top one being PCI 4.0 X 4 and then the bottom
being PC a 3.0 X 4 and they're both covered by heat sinks and the heatsink
does a pretty good job so taking the temperatures down quite substantially
with both the heatsink temperatures the service temperatures and the software
readouts and then when we take the heatsink off we can see that we're
getting kind of into that uncomfortable level where I wouldn't want to see my
nvme SSD running at those temperatures personally 24/7 especially from editing
videos they'll go through the onboard audio they're using the realtek 1220 LC
it looks like they have kind of copy pasted this from the x5 70 taichi though
the numbers were slightly different so going through the frequency response
curve first we've got a base roll-off with 10 Hertz and under around 2.3
decibels which is absolutely fine after that we've got pretty much a flat line
up until 10 K and above where we've got a 0.1 DB drop-off so basically the
frequency response curve is going to be flat it's gonna be good for your ears
and I even kind of prefer that slight drop off in the treble I'm not a big fan
of treble personally but then we move over to the crosstalk and the numbers
here are actually better than the x5 70 tied she coming with around -
ninety-two decibels all the way up to a volume level of 90 then going from
volume of 91 to 100 does have the crosstalk sort of bumping up on both
left and right hand sides so if you were to use this onboard audio I recommend
keeping the volume at 90 and under then we've run to the mic import they're
using suppression so basically this is gonna be good for chatting to your
friends playing games they're gonna be hearing you clearly no matter what you
do at the same time it's going to give you a voice a little bit of a thinner
tinny sound as opposed to a professional recording so if you want to use this for
professional recordings I would get another solution
anyhow moving through the BIOS it's as rocks typical it can do it bios very
simple yet has all the features you would want to a degree and I will
critique them here with the be 550 Teijin that is they've taken away the
polychrome RGB sync within the BIOS which I really like and I really enjoy
and they've added it so you have to install it in Windows which I'd like to
see them add in an update to configure it from the blouse but they've also
taken away the internet DHCP upgrade so you just connect to the Internet and
then you can download the BIOS ROM so there are two features I'd like to see
them bring back though in terms of the other features fantastic tuning you can
control all the different seven PWM fan headers manually and then you can
overclock with ease for horizon 39 50x getting this overclock at one point four
volts for four point three gigahertz took me literally in half a minute and
the 40 400 megahertz XMP profiles on this Oris memory that I'm using worked
absolutely fine first go-around no hiccups whatsoever they do say you can
go up to 4,000 733 megahertz and that definitely seems like it would be a
possibility if you had memory that good they'll go through the input and output
we've got integrated IO shield Wi-Fi six Bluetooth five BIOS flash back button
and a clear CMOS button display port HDMI out eight USB ports manual 5.1
surround out optical out and also an Intel two point five gigabits per second
Ethernet which does differ from the x5 70 taichi's one gigabit per second
Ethernet so with all that out of the way that now leads us to the most important
part with a motherboard and that is the price so you would think be 550 would be
the value line up like B 450 but this time around we're gonna have a
massive range within B 550 and this board right here is pretty much
top-of-the-line it even goes topper than the x5 70 Taichi so be 550 itself is
kind of like cut-down X 570 but it can be better and it might be better for a
lot of people especially if you just want to get a single nvme Drive a 2
terabyte PC a fall for example and a upcoming r-tx 3000 graphics card or
something like that so it can give you better value within
the realm of what it offers that the price point is pretty high I mean we're
looking at 280 USD for this board in a straight 569 ozzie dollars versus the x5
70 Taichi which was three hundred US dollars and then in Australia 589 ozzie
though in Australia the x5 70 I did see it on sale for 529 Aussie so these price
points I would go with the x5 70 Taichi in Australia of course when something's
on sale and there's not that big of a difference between the two I'd get the
item on sale though as it stands if they're both at MSRP and you want to get
one of these two bullets I would personally go with the B 550 Taichi but
the main reason for me would be actually two things that's the onboard audio
slightly better and then the vrm with that slightly
enhanced 16 phase that does have slightly better components on it than
the x5 70 Taichi and that did show with these results I mean handling that 39 50
X with that OC the way it did with the temperatures no fans on the heatsink at
all with honestly really low temperatures is something that asrock
have done well also the last thing to go over that I forgot to mention was RGB
you've got four headers in total to those being addressable and then two of
those being 12 volt and one each at the top and bottom though I would like to
see as rocking a BIOS update bring the polychrome RGB control back to the boss
as well as the internet update as well those two features I actually really
like them in the BIOS so if they can get them in a BIOS update I'll let you guys
know if they're coming in the BIOS update I'll let you guys know in the
description and with all that other way I hope you guys enjoyed today's review
of the be 550 Taichi for me personally it feels like this one in particular is
an X 550 that the way I would think of this board and
that aside if you guys enjoyed this review be sure to hit that like button
also let us know in the comments section below what you think of B 550 so far I
actually had this motherboard for over a week it's just there was an NDA on
actually lifting to performance figures so I do like to just give you guys
reviews and numbers on motherboards rather than unboxings and showcases so
that's sort of the way I do things with motherboards because when I go to buy a
motherboard I would I love it when there is all that information available and
then I can make a decision so hopefully that answers that
and speaking of answers we've got here the question of the day which comes from
transcendence media and they asked which cooler would you suggest best for risin
530 600 my idle temp is 45 to 65 and gaming temp is 70 to 85 well the stock
cooler is what should be a bit better than that I mean those temperatures do
seem high so if I start as you may want to look at what case you using
especially if there's absolutely no air flow on that case just take off the side
panel to help it breathe a little bit easier but in terms of a value for money
cooler since you are using the Verizon 5 3600 I would go with my main hookup and
that is the Snowman this thing is delivering amazing value for money and
if you get the to fan version that thing was even handling a 10 900k out of the
box which is pushing around 175 watts so incredible cooler for the money and
we'll definitely see your rising 530 600 gets some sweet overclock stew in the
process and lower the temperatures so hopefully that answers that question and
with all that aside if you guys have stated this far and you're enjoying that
content then be sure to stay subscribed or hit that sub button if you haven't
already ring that bell to get the content as soon as it drops because the
next video we've got a be 550 comparison where we're testing out all these be 550
motherboards that were sent in its gonna be a big round robin so hopefully you
guys enjoy that one and i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
