if you currently exist in the magical world of PC gaming then chances are you probably have tried a 60 Hertz monitor before or in fact you may even be using one now and you're thinking what's the best upgrade monitor path that I should go down and this is usually one of those questions that can linger in your mind for days and days before you seal the spec sheets you go around you read all the reviews and then you still after that can't make a decision well if that's the case then you have come to the right video because behind me here we've got anything from a beautiful washed out TN 240 Hertz panel this is the bank you xl2 740 and then behind that we've got the PD 32 20 you which is a 4k designer monitor which is 60 Hertz and it's IPS now you can probably already see behind me the difference in these two panels by just simply looking in the background here I mean I can certainly notice it you've got much better colors on the IPS panel much better blacks much better viewing angles and that's where we're gonna jump over the first hurdle here and that is the panel type there's generally considered four types of panels out there at the moment that a mainstream the first being TN and basically T n stands for twisted nematic and this is a panel essentially that comes in with a cheap buying cost but also it does have really good response times or generally has response times better than VA and IPS however that being said the colors and viewing angles are generally considered worse off than all the other three types of monitors that we're going to talk about here today though one thing I'd like to add there if you are sitting in front of a monitor and you're gaming which most people do on computer monitors then the viewing angles aren't going to matter a whole lot though the last thing to touch on with TN panels is that because they have better response times they also fare better in general with higher refresh rate monitors and that's because if you're a fresh rate is too high and your response rates are too high as well in that they're very slow then what can happen here is is that the next will actually be transitioning in before the previous frame has even transitioned properly and this term is either known as ghosting or if you're talking to a bunch of sleazy marketers they may tell you its cinematic motion blur so TN it does have some good benefits but what about VA which is known as vertical alignment this is a technology that essentially tries to bridge the gap between TN and IPs and then it has better viewing angles generally has better colors however that being said it's not as good as IPs and the response times are actually in general across the industry considered the worst with this type of technology in the past they have had VA panels come through here and some have had pretty good response times around 8 milliseconds though others have had up to 16 milliseconds in response times so before you do go out and buy any monitor it is always good to check the individual specs of that monitor where in the best-case scenario we want the fastest response times and that's the smallest number on those response times and we also want the lowest input lag that is if you're a gamer and also the highest refresh rate with generally the highest resolution available there were those quick explanations out of the way let's talk about this Big Daddy right here and that's what this monitor behind me the 3220 u is it's known in the industry as a Big Daddy because it's 4k because it's IPs because it's got Thunderbolt 3 on board you can daisy-chain up to an additional monitor off the back of this so it does play nicely even with things like laptops so the thing with IPS it's called in plane switching it this has generally got better colors and better viewing angles than the previous 2 texts that we spoke about however the thing with IPS is that has come a long way in recent years where response times actually coming down to pretty good levels I recently took a look at both Bank U and view Sonic's 1440p options 27-inch high refresh rate monitors and they had pretty good response times where I saw around 5 milliseconds on an IPS panel and that's real response times and another thing will quickly interlude here is don't look at those box numbers that you see when they say one millisecond response time or formula seconds response time generally the real-world numbers are bit worse than that take for instance this xl2 740 behind me it's a 240 Hertz monitor and they say on the box it's a one millisecond response time but after doing some in depth 1000 fps testing both with the UFO catcher and also in csgo and even fortnight I found that the response times are around 4 to 5 milliseconds and even when you put on the overdrive feature which bank uses if eclis calls AMA on high or premium it didn't make a difference so in other words for a TN panel this wasn't really giving out the best response times as well as the input lag on this particular monitor wasn't that good to begin with I measured around 5 to 15 milliseconds and also added an extra 8 milliseconds on top if you were to enable g-sync so it is important with those previous tests that we spoke about to analyze them and know if you're getting the best purchase for your money so basically quite simply with this monitor right here the 27:40 it's not my best pick for a 240 Hertz monitor I have seen better out there both here on the channel and also around on the internet there are some other reviewers out there that do really good in death monitor testing and you'll know if they're showing you the right specs you want to see however that being said let's move over to the last technology here and that is OLED and essentially we are not yet sing and I really hope we do Oh LEDs being introduced into high refresh rate computer monitors we're talking 24-inch 27-inch even 32 inch we have yet to see a monitor implement OLED that has a high refresh rate and the thing is it's so perfect for this technology and honestly I can't wait to see the day where we do get OLED in computer monitors and the reason being is because they generally have response times that are the best in the industry we're talking sub 1 millisecond that's right you just go from frame to frame perfect transition no ghosting or no sleazy cinematic motion blur and to top all that off the viewing angles are great the colors are gorgeous the blacks are so deep you wouldn't even know if you're being sucked into a black hole and the best benefit on top of that is it emit detail through green and red a lot more than cheap white LED monitors ever and now that we've got oh let out of the way with and honestly don't ask me when an oled gaming monitors coming out because my guess is as good as yours we've been teased these four years and will probably be teased for a few more years yet though what we've got here is going from one end of the spectrum to the other and that we've got a 1080p 240 Hertz monitor and then over this side we've got a 4k 60 Hertz IPS panel and so if you had to pick one of these two right here it would just come down to what do you do as an individual personally when we look at this 30 to 20 you right here I would be picking this over this and that's simply because the majority of my time spent behind a computer is either doing video or photo work where I need color accuracy and another thing about 4k IPS 60 Hertz monitors is a lot of the time they'll either be perfectly color accurate which this one is out of the box or they will come close to very color accurate so that means when you're editing videos or photos you won't have to worry if your monitor is deceiving you and whether that final products going to be bad another thing that makes monitors like this really good is generally the stands included are phenomenal in this case we've got horizontal and vertical swivel adjustment as well as tilt and height adjustment so you can also use it in portrait mode if you wish to use another 4k monitor to those we spoke about before this does come at a cost and that's generally your response times as well as your 60 Hertz refresh rate what we saw in response times with this monitor in particular was around about 15 milliseconds and this doesn't really change a whole lot if you use the AMA feature aka overdrive now there's three different settings here off high and premium and it's funny to see that there wasn't really a difference on the 30 to 20 you and honestly if you're buying this for photo or video accuracy work it's not gonna make a huge difference but also if you're doubling down with this monitor as a 4k gaming monitor I would like to see those response times improved a little bit but the response times on this 10 panel here the 2740 I wasn't impressed with this we were getting on all three different OverDrive's just like this 4k monitor there was no real difference to the response times in that there are around 4 to 5 milliseconds which honestly for a 240 Hertz TN panel should be a bit better I'd like to see this down to the 2 milliseconds region even if you've got a bit of artifacting or haloing did that being said the input lag on the 30 to 20 you was actually phenomenal where the best frame was 10 milliseconds that's total system input lag and the worst frame was 23 milliseconds with an average of 15 point seven three milliseconds anyhow both monitors here include a really good OSD as well as included external pucks where you can control the settings of the monitor via the controls itself you've got the ability to change the colors brightness contrast levels as well as different preset modes and the black equalizer which in this case the black equalizer is essentially working just like a gamma booster so I have seen better black equalizers on monitors in the past that have come through the channel here don't answer the coding on the screens of cells the 3220 you has the perfect coating on it it's like the semi-gloss that still reflects our sunlight but it still lets those colors come through just in such a rich manner honestly I haven't seen a coating on a monitor this good in my life and being a balance between matte and gloss but still allowing the detail to come through as best as possible this one here is a little bit on the matte side and when we put up an orange background we did get a slight bit of visible cross hatching which also could be due to the 27 inch 1080p pixel density not being anywhere near as good as this 4k 32 inch right here they're continuing on with the differences of course when you're going for a designer monitor that's calibrated out of the factory it is going to cost quite a bit this one here comes in at 1200 USD and this one right here 550 USD if you're in Australia you're looking around a thousand ad and around 2,000 AUD respectively that's due to the Aussie dollar being quite weak right now and whether the difference between the feature set right here is that this one here of course the colors are a little bit off out of the box though you can calibrate them but you still got a 10 panel for editing content as opposed to the 3220 you which has a 10-bit panel built-in and you've got different modes to select from for instance if you're a Mac user you can change it to Mac mode or if your photo editing you change it over to srgb and there's also even a mode designed for CAD users in mind where they've collaborated with the team to get the best factory mode possible for using AutoCAD anyhow the more I use this designer monitor and you're probably starting to be like yo I'm a gamer stop talking about design features here I was actually like getting more impressive this thing but you've got a KVM switch built in which is keyboard video and mouse switch so essentially you can plug in a keyboard and mouse up to this monitor and use that keyboard and mouse for two different systems without having to plug in the keyboard and mouse to the different systems themselves you've also got a picture by picture picture in picture and also split mode where you can have two different color profiles up at the same time if you want to validate work so now we've taken a look at these monitors and seeing what the differences are I can now give you guys a clear-cut recommendation on what you should do if you're in different situations and basically we've got the 240 Hertz monitor there with the TN panel this is generally going to be overall not just cheaper than designer monitors but it's also gonna offer better input lag as well as giving you better response times in general now keep in mind as we saw with this 27:40 back here I've seen better 240 Hertz panels come through the channel with better response times an even better input lag so do make sure you check out individual reviews for that monitor just to make sure it's got the best input lag and it's got really good response times especially the higher the refresh rate so basically 240 Hertz 10 that's if you want the at most competitive advantage and you don't care a whole lot about color accuracy we're not going to be really editing photos or video work on that monitor to begin with then we've got what I would call the in-betweener that is the 1440p IPS or VA and it's 27-inch generally these monitors are coming in in my opinion the best overall monitor and that is because they've got that IPS panel which does give out good colors and if you've got someone or you know someone who can give you a color profile if you want to accurately edit photos or videos on that thing then it's going to offer a good option to do that but at the same time they've generally got really good input lag they've got decent response times where in the case of the recent viewsonic and BenQ monitors I took a look at I'll put the links up there for both of those those came in with some solid response times and really good input lag where I liked both of those monitors even though they were a bit pricey they weren't as pricey as this 32-inch monitor behind me but they were a bit more pricey than this 27 inch 1080p 240 Hertz panel right here so if I had to only pick one monitor I would pick the 1440p 144 Hertz IPS panel just simply because it gives me the options to move into other things other than gaming and it also does gaming very well however now we move over to the one that I use per see a lot in fact I use a 4k monitor so much that I've got two of them and this is my preferred set up when I'm video editing this just simply gives me the most screen real estate and then I've got more pixels to play with but also at the same time I've got a bigger viewing area and I can do a lot more and put a lot more in each of these panels as well as when I'm editing 4k video work I can accurately see if that 4k video work is blurry or if it's in focus or if the colors are accurate as we said before with the 30 to 20 you we've got that color accuracy out of the box so we know that you guys out there when you're watching these YouTube videos behind the scenes we have to make sure that the colors are accurate or I'll end up looking like a lobster which honestly I have been guilty of in the past we all make mistakes and there it all is with gaming monitors I hope this video has helped you decide on which monitor you need for you because at the end of the day it's all about what you need and not what someone else needs so if you're a competitive gamer you need the best competitive edge go for the 240 Hertz if you want the balance the best of both worlds go for the 144 Hertz 1440p IPs if you're a designer or creator like me and you find yourself just editing videos or in content all the time or even making music and stuff like that then definitely go for the 4k 32 inch monitor and in terms of the OLED monitor they're also one more hot tip before I get on out of here if you're currently on a 60 Hertz monitor then definitely keep that monitor around I find that having a second cheap monitor always works as a great stopgap if you need to do extra work or if you say for instance you just want to read the news while you're playing a game and say you got fragged and you're waiting to respawn having a second monitor especially a cheap one it does go a long way in helping your productivity but also making your life just that much better and with all that out of the way if you enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comments section below what monitor are you currently rocking and if you're looking for an upgrade in the monitor market which upgrade would you be looking at and why love reading your thoughts and opinions as always just like this question of the day here which comes from Fernando Ramirez and they ask could you run a 430 white power supply with this setup and they're speaking about our hourly Express video where we made a PC on a box I'll put the link to that video up there but basically if you're using an Rx 470 rx 570 and I'm assuming you're talking about the 430 what Thermaltake power supply because there's not many of these 430 what power supplies out there I would actually say you're a borderline risking it that power supply from memory is quite bad and if you're using maybe a reference rx 470 you should be okay but if you're using say for instance a factory OC rx 570 then you may have problems with that 430 what because it's not essentially a Trude 430 what power supply anyway I hope that answers that question and also before I get on out of here a big thanks to Bank you for sending these monitors out here for testing and review purposes my favorite out of the tube was honestly the 30 to 20 you even though it's the most expensive they have done a phenomenal job in what it's intended for as opposed to the 27 40 which sort of misses the mark a little bit in the response times in the input lag this thing right here just has all the features you would want if you're a video or a content creator or even editing photos or doing whatever you would do the 3220 you just simply nails it and it does even show just by looking at it in the background right here though that aside if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content and you're not yet subbed then you know what to do hit that sub up and ring that Bell and I'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music]
