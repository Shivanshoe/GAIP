today is my birthday and all i want for my birthday is vacuum cleaner well not just any vacuum cleaner an ecovax debot n8 plus with an auto docking station and the ability to mop the floor as well welcome back to tech yes city and today's video is sponsored by ecovax however quick disclaimer when companies offer me sponsorship if the product is crap i simply don't take the sponsorship for instance a particular razer brand comes to mind which means that this little vacuum cleaner i'm featuring in today's video is really solid it has the ability to navigate rooms on its own and return to its station to recharge the debug claims to have 110 minutes of advertised cycle life which in practice it got very close to that at around 104 minutes before needing a recharge though what surprised me was this studio aka the tech yes studio is well messy i have cables screws and crap everywhere and once i mapped out the areas it could go to i was pleasantly surprised to see it plodding along and cleaning everything now it can get caught on thick cables so try to keep the floor surfaces as flat as possible but the sensors on board which feature a lidar laser-based direct time-of-flight navigation system does really well at detecting obstacles and avoiding them and cleaning all the areas which it hasn't been to unlike some cleaners in the past that just suck the same patch 20 plus times before running out of battery and not even returning to their stations i do have a friend that bought an automated vacuum cleaner in the past i forgot the brand but when i checked that one out it absolutely sucked though on that note of sucking here we have a 2 300 mpa system that is surprisingly quiet for its size and power i'll let you guys take a quick listen to it at its max operating loudness on carpet [Music] and the news just gets better setting this system up was so easy just unbox it set the docking station up set the vacuum up install the app then there is a qr code on the d-bot itself and then just let the d-bot do its magic once you've installed the app and programmed it to how you like it and if you couldn't be bothered to map out the room this little d-bot can do it itself that's right it can scan the whole area first giving you an editable map that you can also program no-go zones into in the case of the studio here there are actually quite a few think motherboards on the floor with bird on it unfinished builds etc the app is also very polished and allows you to create multiple rooms which you can set times to when the vacuum cleaner will automatically clean great if you have a regular time where you're not at home that is for example work so if you're at home for the holidays you can have it slow down on the frequency of cleaning now you may have also noticed from some of the b-roll that this has the ability to not just vacuum but also mop now on hard surfaces by default it will suck at half the power then on carpet it will suck at full power with the traditional vacuum also once you have the mop installed it will detect hard surfaces to which the mop will engage at the same time as vacuuming if you want the d-bot to do that and it also claims to have a micro water pump with four levels of water in practice the d-bot did a solid job on hard surfaces with the mopping feature it also has google assistant and alexa support meaning you can activate voice commands even if you're out of home and you've got access to your wi-fi router via your phone so overall very impressed now with the dbot n8 plus versus the standard edition you get the automatic docking station with the plus so it will automatically empty itself out on this particular model though if you can't afford the n8 plus and you want to go with the standard n8 you can always purchase the docking station separately later it also comes in either black or white and the price of the n8 plus is currently going for 599 usd very competitive given the feature set footprint and how well it works in the real world though i am told this month on black friday there will be a particular big discount to this unit so stay prepared if you are looking for a bargain anyhow i hope you guys enjoyed today's different kind of tech video if you did and be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comment section below what do you think of automatic vacuum cleaners versus traditional vacuum cleaners i think something like this is getting very functional and very useful where in the past as i said before i had a friend that had this robot vacuum cleaner and when i watched it i forgot which brand it was but it just sucked it would get stuck not know what it was doing etc but this one is in a whole other league and that is a league of proper function and time saving even in a messy studio like mine anyhow guys i'll catch you in the next one peace out for now bye [Music] world [Music]
