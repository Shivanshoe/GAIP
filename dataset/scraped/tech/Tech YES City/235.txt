december 2020's used pc parts hunt of the month is going to be a little bit different than usual and it's not just because it's the last month of a pretty much a terrible year for everybody but it's also going to be where i'm just going to be hitting the road and finding deals as they come up rather than jumping on gumtree and facebook and checking out the overpriced graphics cards where it's pretty much like come on guys a 1060 used and you're asking more money than the 1650 super costs new i mean the ongoing struggle to get gpus at a decent price on the used market is something that i have seen now for over six months and that's a trend looks like it's going to keep continuing until nvidia and amd bring out something new on that 200 price point to really separate the numbers from these pretty similar numbers between 1060s and 1650 supers for example but that aside let's go hit the road now where our first deal is a gpu here for a 78.50 at 40 bucks it's not too far from where i am i'm gonna go pick that up we've also booked up to go see les he's got a few things for us and hopefully by the time we've done those two things some other deals pop up let's get going [Music] so here's the first deal we've picked up it's a 78.50 they're asking 50 i just said look would you take 30 and then they said well 40 i'm like well 40 is fair for a 2 gigabyte card i mean i really need these at the moment and i'll put the us pricing up there for you guys i'd say just about 28 usd or something like that because although a lot of people are wanting the higher end gaming pcs like the 3080s and stuff like that there's still a market for these little entry-level gaming pc so it's always good to pick up something like that let's go hit the road for the next deal so we're just finishing up at les's place now and we've got a decent score where i've bargained eight monitors some of them i guess are b grade stock in the u scene they've got some little blemishes on them but you can still put them in uh i guess budget rigs so we picked up 140 aussie for these eight monitors here assortment of 19 inch 22 inch and also 124 inch but let's take a look at what's inside the car here because we actually stopped off the computer store quickly i picked up just a couple of brand new cases if i want to put together some say mid and sort of higher end rigs i got two of those i've got those for the flip up challenge which is important two of these water coolers here they're the final components i needed and i'll show you guys what i'll be doing in that uh series episode will be dropping very soon by the way and then we've got inside here six computers i picked these up 52 dollars each and les said if you did him for 52 he'll throw in a bonus one that doesn't boot so it's a little bit dirty doesn't boot but we'll see if we can fix that one up as opposed to the other five of these z towers they work absolutely fine but what we're gonna do right now is jump over to the next deal where we found a gts 450 it's near where i live it's ten dollars we're just gonna quickly snap that up now we just quickly picked up a gt 450 one gigabyte this is just around the corner i mean 10 bucks you can't go wrong i mean something like this is really for someone who just wants to play cs go and believe me there are people who want like really cheap gaming pcs for really low entry level points as long as you advertise it as saying look this thing won't be playing the latest titles but it'll play some older titles with aok frame rates and 19-inch monitor included then it's not a bad deal [Music] so we ended up getting a 10 32 gigabyte and a a gpu with no fan on it so these two came up with just a gpu bundle this is an rx 560 2 gigabyte so this was a really cool deal for 50 bucks but i do have to add a fan on top of this gpu right here so me just searching for random stuff is starting to work out really well for me this month in terms of actually getting graphics cards that i can use it's mainly on low end bangers but that's sometimes how the market goes so let's go finally now get this power supply this 650 watt core set that popped up before and then see what else is coming up [Music] and this next deal just came up out of nowhere as an old 57 70 the person must have been sitting on it for quite a while it was a one gig model they were asking like thirty dollars i just put down ten dollars on it because that's realistically all this thing is worth and when i went over there i just asked them if they had anything else they said they had one of these lying around an old uh fire pro w5000 graphics and i just said how much do they want for it and they said 10 bucks would be fine too so i got two of these cards for 20 aussie dollars so i'm just cleaning up this month with the potatoes on the budget end and to be honest like i'm not expecting too much out of these because a lot of people picking up low end pcs actually just want to play roblox which i've never even played but from what i gather budget cards like these actually do pretty well so i'm going to quickly unload now and try and see if i can pull up some more deals so some good news that's come up is we've got firstly a radeon 200 series graphics card where they're asking 25 but they actually don't know the exact model it just shows up in their windows as a radeon 200 series and it looks to me like it's a radeon r7 250 and so they're asking 25 bucks i just said look would you take 20 cash pickup they said sure so i'm going to go get that gpu now and we're also looking at a ryzen 5 3600 and a b450 motherboard and they said it had bent pins and they bent them back and they put the cpu in and it works absolutely fine but if that's the case i mean if everything's working fine mentioning that it's kind of like is there a problem there so i've put down an offer of 240 aussie they're asking over 300 i mean if everything's working out absolutely fine then there shouldn't be a problem but perhaps there might be a memory channel missing or something like that because that's what can happen when a bent pin comes about especially if it's snapped off so we'll see what they say and we'll keep you guys updated but let's go quickly grab that graphics card and then see what we got on our hands [Music] and it's now the next day and we've got all these pcs here where last month i also i'll put the link to that part time up here where i've got a lot of these budget pcs coming in and some of them don't have gravity actually a lot of them don't have graphics cards and so i need to put in something to match this lower end spec so i was actually really glad that i found a lot of these lower end gpus because now i can put together some low end pcs and have that section of the market kind of filled out because i mean i guess in in a perfect world if you are flipping some pcs and uh you're doing this for a bit of profit you want to have i guess a low end pc a mid-range and high-end for sale whether it's hitting an exact price point or not isn't so important as the fact that you've just got around that sort of say for instance we've got under five hundred dollars then under a thousand dollars then over a thousand dollars as that's what i'm kind of aiming to do with my sort of personal uh flip stack here for christmas but anyway we've got the candidates here this one i am most curious about a w 5000 fire pro where i think this like if this runs fortnite i'll be happy but i know for a fact that all these cards here will run like i think runescape and roblox are pcs that i'm actually getting messaged about especially on the low end so that's actually interesting because i think those both those games will run on uh all the gpus all well should i say all the potatoes that you're seeing here now we picked up a lot of these for cheap and so the gt 450 is probably the weakest of the bunch but i mean these will do the job hd 5770 i'm pretty sure i used this way back in the day like years and years ago but that's how like that's how games or how far games haven't come in the last like 10 years where people are still playing these games and there's still demand for them so if there's demand for them you wise will fill up supply and so this was the last gpu we picked up r7 250 and now moving through the pcs that we picked up off les he had these for 50 bucks i just said sure i'll take the lot and he chucked in one for free that didn't boot and the one that didn't boot looks like it probably won't boot due to it being possibly left out in water where you can just see from the usb slots right here that this one is rusted out versus this one it's got some clean usb ports there though inside these pcs we've got four gigabytes of ram so we'll have to add another four gigabytes in we've got no drives but that's fine because especially in the last part time we did pick up a heap of hard drives as well as me having quite a few ssds so i'll be absolutely fine in terms of filling these pcs out and getting them ready for christmas and the power supply checks out absolutely fine too so here's the last thing we've got here and this is eight monitors where there's just an assortment of different panels so whether it's 22 inch 19 inch or 24 i think we only got 124 inch however and they're all pretty good condition so there is a few little scuffs and stuff like that hence why i got them pretty cheap but usually like especially since a lot of these monitors will be going on the low end gaming pcs a lot of people don't care if a little nick here or there usually only matters when you're going into the higher end bracket and so here it is with the early parts hunt of december 2020 i'll put the tally up on the screen for you guys what we have collected so far and i did check gumtree and facebook and there really wasn't anything worth getting at least putting offers down this morning i was still waiting for that person on the ryzen cpu motherboard combo to get back to me but they haven't even seen my message yet on facebook so hopefully that one might work out i will update in the description below if it does but in the meantime we did pick up some pretty good deals in my opinion and what you may notice is that i'm picking up a lot of stuff that i guess otherwise i usually am not picking up and i think that the market and people in the market aren't really looking for these parts and this is one thing going forward i'm going to have to get you guys your feedback on because it's important in relation to use price performance and which way the market is going and what i've noticed lately is that the market is shifting towards especially on the used marketplace where i'm at lately and if you want to flip a gaming pc and if you want to make profit it's all like it's getting to the point where you're spending a copious amount of money on the aesthetics of the build so like instead of spending 100 on rgb for say a thousand dollar gaming pc you go out and spend 300 on rgb so you're getting like nine rgb ring fans getting a case that supports that many ring fans and then selling a bill that would otherwise be a thousand dollars selling it for thirteen hundred dollars and the thing is from what i'm getting told from people and what i'm seeing is that these bills are actually selling with the more focus on the aesthetic and this is sort of like eliminating what i mean i got into used price performance for the price performance and the fact that it could beat the new price performance and what i'm seeing lately is it's just much more of a shift towards just aesthetics and that's it and people really don't care so much on what's going into the build they just care on how it looks and i mean if that's the case if that's what it takes to keep doing use price performance or should i say used price then i guess maybe i have to go down that route but i just don't believe in it that's all and so would you guys want to see me say delve into this market more and say okay what can we do here brian which way is the market going are you going to adapt to it and play the game even if you don't believe in it and so in any field of discipline sometimes you have to do things that you don't like and i think this is the way the market's going where i'm noticing that for instance people are telling me about these deals that they're getting and it might be like an x79 motherboard with a 3930k and they're like dude i got a deal on this for like 160 aussie dollars and i'm like did you get any ram with it did you get a cooler and they're like no and i'm thinking to myself well that's kind of like as it should be but these so-called deals they're lasting for maybe 10 minutes on the marketplace where i'm at and so i don't have time to constantly check and refresh the browser all day to get what would otherwise be a better deal i feel on the new market which i can just log on to a website purchase a cheap motherboard and a i3 10 100 or a 3100 and i feel like that's a better deal so i'm at this point now where new price performance where i'm at locally is better in terms of price performance and availability and then use price performance is kind of going down this path of okay people are just buying this stuff for the i7 bragging right in the title so someone will go out of their way to get an i7 6700 even though a 10 100 is pretty much better because it's new and they'll use that i7 6700 to say oh it's got a fast i7 in the gaming pc and so this is kind of like the route that the whole used market's going down and people on the used scene who want these parts are paying more for it and i just i mean i don't believe in it but if that's the way it's going then so be it and that's sort of like the predicament i'm in at the moment do you guys want to see more of a shift in new price performance and putting together more cookie cutter deals on the new side or would you guys rather see me go down this route of bling bling do let us know in the comments and this is something that i did talk a bit more in depth in the patron vlog too but i love you guys and your feedback so do let us know what you want to see come out of tech yeah city is traditionally that's what the channel's been about it's been you guys are sending in the requests i'm doing the vids however in terms of what we scored here today we're getting whole rigs power supply motherboard cooler i5 2400 4gb ram 50 aussie dollars that's always really good price performance so everything that i feel that i got in today's parts hunt is always pushing that price performance barrier even though the aesthetics on the builds don't look that great however that said all the deals that we picked up in today's part site i would say that they're offering pretty good price performance especially when you get an i5 2500 or 2400 4 gigabytes of ram motherboard cooler in case for 50 aussie dollars that brings in a value standpoint that the new market just can't match however of course that's really unintended for mainly the low end segment though going forward we do have a very special used price performance segment coming up later in the month i'm not going to spoil it but we've also got the flip up challenge so do stay tuned for those two things i'm just doing this part time sort of like this is the official part time of the month i just don't want to let you guys down because i don't know how the latter half of the month will turn out so in case it doesn't turn out i'm just saying that this is the official part time of the month so if you guys enjoyed today's video then be sure to hit that like button for us and also let us know in the comments section below what was your favorite deal of the month but also let us know what you thought about the stuff that we just discussed before and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon after this question of the day here which comes from mvu and they ask do you think this cpu is worth picking up if you're currently running a 4930k and they're talking about the 1680 v2 that we did in a dedicated video that's eight core 16 threads it's overclockable and it's on the x79 platform the 4930k six scores 12 threads it will overclock pretty well however if you do upgrade to a 1680 v2 the thing is you're still not getting the avx-2 instruction sets which if you're going to waste that kind of money on the 1680v2 i would just recommend perhaps just overclocking your 4930k at the moment and then just saving that money and then upgrading to something later on once you've really got all the value and extracted all the value out of the 4930k because even in a lot of titles and a lot of games that cpu is still going to be absolutely fine and i mean getting an extra two cores and four threads on the same platform it would be okay if you're not paying a whole lot i'd say an extra 50 bucks but in this case your 4930k isn't worth a whole lot of money but the 1680v2 being the best in class for that socket is going to cost you a bit of a premium which i'd rather you save that money so my recommendation at the moment is get the best out of what you've got at the moment with the 4930k and save that money for a different cpu and platform later in the future hope that answers that question and i'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you've stayed this far and you're enjoying that content you want to see the moment it drops be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and i'll see you next time peace out for now bye [Music]
