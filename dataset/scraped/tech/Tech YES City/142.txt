a couple of days ago i got a message from a friend 
and they said brian you gotta check out windows 11   and i'm scratching my head thinking 
windows 11. i haven't even heard about this   and sure enough i went to research what had 
happened and someone had leaked the developer's   copy of windows 11 on the web and i knew this 
was legit when i got a link to download it   and the link had been taken down so microsoft 
isn't going to go around and take down links   if that wasn't the legit thing anyway we ended up 
getting a copy and we ended up trying to install   it and this is where the problems did start 
to happen where you will need a tpm 2.0 module   on your motherboard or you will either need tpm on 
the amd side of things which you can activate in   the bios via the option there with the cpu once 
either of these two conditions are met you can   then start to install windows 11 and i gotta admit 
first impressions are really good it looks like   a windows 10.1 sort of thing but the performance 
feels like it's really good it almost feels like   this developer copy of windows 11 has all the 
crap or most of the crap taken away from the   get-go which is why i'm going to be recommending 
if people can get on this copy as soon as they can   then they do that another thing as well is it 
looks like windows 7 windows 8.1 and windows   10 pro keys they do work absolutely fine on this 
copy of windows 11 however if you guys want to see   a full installation tutorial on how to install 
windows 11 do let us know in the comments section   below but in today's video we are going to be 
looking at the windows 10 versus windows 11   gaming performance and seeing how that stacks 
up and whether you should think about upgrading   to this os let's get on to it right after this 
sponsor spot do you feel like this when you see   this well if so you can get rid of that windows 
activation message with today's video sponsor scd   keys for as little as 12 usd after you use that 
coupon bftyc you can get activated today links in   description below so the testbed that i decided to 
use here today was a 5950x from amd and this is on   the asrock phantom gaming x motherboard with the 
6800 xt taichi now the games that we're testing   here we're going to drop them down to 1080p lower 
settings to really work that cpu and get the   most fps possible and what i found here was with 
windows 10 we'll pull up here first of all f1 2020   was that we're getting 480 average fps and the 
one percent and 0.1 lows were also really good too   and then we stepped over to windows 11 and we were 
getting slightly higher fps it'd be to the tune of   around five percent more fps which was looking 
very promising and even though the os's do feel   similar we'll pull up the next example here that 
shadow of the tomb raider where i'll show you   guys when i got to the end of the benchmark it 
actually shows it as windows 10 as another build   so as i was saying in the intro it does look like 
windows 11 is actually based off of windows 10 but   it's just a re-skin and also the features are 
pretty cool but that being said i believe this   extra performance that you're seeing here 
in today's video could be due to the fact   that it is a bit of a lighter weight version 
from the get-go as i did test on a windows 10   default copy so i just reinstalled both windows 10 
and windows 11 for this video and what we can see   with shadow the tomb raider was a very impressive 
result on windows 11. i haven't actually seen my   fps this high in shadow of the tomb raider before 
we got an average fps on this benchmark of 223 and   then the minimum fps was 147 and then on windows 
10 we got 212 fps and a very similar minimum score   moving things over to fortnite this is the new 
update where you can fly ufos and i gotta say   flying the ufos was actually pretty fun 
while i was benchmarking this i was like   you can fly a ufo i was like cool so i started 
flying ufos i actually want to battle royale   as the tech yes man do you know even if it's again 
bots i'll take that victory and we got here 468   fps on windows 11 versus 455 on windows 10 but on 
both these examples that i'm showing up here today   it's almost like the fps was just too high 
it's breaking this engine where the 1 and   0.1 lows were just actually really bad so i 
wouldn't recommend taking your fps this high on   fortnite especially this new alien update where 
i have seen a lot better numbers in the past on   those one percent and 0.1 percent lows now moving 
over to the final title we decided to test here   and this was cs go where we got the average fps 
was coming in a similar ballpark on both sides we   got a 520 on windows 10 versus 528 on windows 11 
so we're just getting etching out eight more fps   on windows 11 side now there was a trick 
that i had to do in cs go i looked around   everywhere because i was like damn my fps is 
looking pretty low at least when i benchmarked   this game in the past and i couldn't figure out 
why the fps was this low i mean i tried uh this   guy on twitter posted up a fix that he was like 
log address or something in the console i tried   that didn't work but then i found what was working 
in cs go especially on low settings at 1080p   was the fact that the graphics card wasn't running 
its full potential so i had to go into the amd   software and then up that minimum frequency to 
roughly a hundred percent as well and then that   fixed the problem even upping it double the speed 
of what it is normally because what was happening   was the game wasn't demanding much graphical 
power at all so the gpu is like falling asleep and   sometimes when the gpu falls asleep you may notice 
in programs like gpu id that it does show that it   does change from pci 4 down to like pci 2 and pci 
1 sometimes and so i believe that can affect your   fps so this raised the fps up by quite a lot and 
that might be a fix for you guys if you're having   fps problems in cs go and maybe not just cs go for 
that matter maybe other games like minecraft or   valorant for example but that would fix that and 
there it all is with windows 11 versus windows 10   i believe the performance gains we saw here 
today were just due to that developer copy being   an actual better implementation of the os rather 
than the standard windows 10 that just comes with   a lot of crap installed from the get-go i mean 
their latest update of windows 10 they installed   some weather bar which i just was like what is 
microsoft doing why are they including a weather   bar no one asked for this but sure enough they put 
some extra i'd call it bloatware on the os just to   who knows maybe just confuse the end user that's 
all i could take it out because as soon as i saw   this thing i got rid of it but speaking of getting 
rid of things if you guys want to see a windows 11   tutorial guide on how to decrapify windows 11 then 
i can get that done on the channel because windows   10 i feel is going to be at an end of an error and 
then windows 11 i definitely welcome the changes   that they've done to this os it does look very 
polished even with this developer copy and it was   running better for games so i can give you guys 
a heap of content around this if you want to see   that then be sure to smash that like button also 
let us know in the comment section below have you   tried windows 11 yet love reading those thoughts 
and opinions as always just like this question of   the day here which comes from california thrills 
and they ask how do those front fans pull any air   through and they're talking about our custom build 
here that we did with the corsair 500d i did this   with a fellow youtuber designs by rfi does amazing 
work but basically this build right here it pulls   air because there's openings on both sides of the 
glass and then it can pull air through there and   it does keep the build actually surprisingly cool 
for what would be considered a closed front on   the case itself hope that answers that question 
and if you guys have stayed this far and you're   enjoying that tech yes content then be sure to hit 
that sub button ring that bell to get the content   as soon as it drops and i'll catch you guys in 
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
