a couple of months ago here at tech yes
city we said that new parts would be coming down in
price and fast forward to this very date and
that is exactly what is happening where we're going to
be putting together a pc that comes in at around 600 us dollars shipped to your
door and there is even better news if you're
down under in australia and that is this whole build that i put
together here is 819 aussie dollars with tax included and if
we change that to the u.s pricing that's actually cheaper than
what the folks over in the usa can build this pc
for which means that you're getting extraordinarily good value
right now if you decide to build a new pc
however let's take a quick look at these parts in today's build the first of
which is the ryzen 3 3100 this is a four core eight threaded
cpu coming in with a phenomenally good price
tag considering it also has an included cooler so you don't
have to go out and spend any extra money on an
aftermarket solution then we've got the graphics card we've
got the gtx 1660 super which can be had for around 220 us
dollars in australia it's a really good price at
around 320 aussie dollars if you're looking for a little bit more
gaming performance and you have a little bit of extra money
the 5600 xt is also a really good consideration at the moment then for the
motherboard we've got an a320 phenomenal price performance
coupled with this four core eight threaded cpu here and it's got all the
bells and whistles that we're going to need on this budget
without spending more then for the ssd 480 gigabytes for the
memory 16 gigabytes 2x8 sticks for dual channel
with 3200 megahertz cl 16. this is a real sweet spot at this
price point for getting the best price performance possible then for the
power supply we're going with a 405 watt solution don't be worried if
there's higher power supplies out there that cost more
for this budget this is more than we need considering this whole build in
total while it's maxed out in games we'll only
be using around 200 watts then our last component is the case
we're going with a budget solution here from deepcool this is their matrix
30 solution fan in the back to exhaust all that hot air
it's the most important system fan you can have in a
case and we've also got a clear side panel to see
our build once it's completed i'll put the tally up here for the build in us
and aussie dollars for you guys and with that aside if you do need a windows 10
pro key i'll also put my sponsor scd keys
in the description below for you guys where you can use the coupon code
tyc and get an 18 discount on check out i've been using these personally for a
long time here at tech yes city and they've always delivered on time
with single and user licenses and with that aside let's put this thing
together and then see how it performs in games
[Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
[Music] so [Music] [Music]
so after building this gaming pc there's two things that i usually do on a
ryzen system and that is the first thing to install the amd
chipset drivers which you just download from their website directly
and then after that i like to lock in the ryzen high performance
plan just to make sure i'm getting the most fps possible while
gaming and then another thing is is when i restart my computer after installing
everything making sure everything's stable i then
hit delete or f2 key to get into the bios and just enable
those xmp profiles which will help you give a lot
more fps because your memory speeds are now
running a lot higher than they would out of the box and essentially that's
those advertised xmp profiles so with that aside let's jump
into the first game here where we'll play modern warfare
and see what kind of fps we can get here at 1080p
high settings so straight away into modern warfare and this pc
is playing this game extremely smooth and the fps is averaging around 100 at
pretty much all times on these high settings now the
temperatures are getting a little bit hot and that's
usually on budget cases you're going to find
airflow can be a little bit limited but what we're going to do right now
because essentially the temperatures are getting the gpu up around 80 degrees the
cpu at 70 is absolutely fine but the gpu running 80 degrees at all times
especially in the 25 degree ambience that we're in at the moment
is a little bit uncomfortable so what we're going to do is just take off this
glass side panel and then check out what our temperatures
are before and after and then we'll move on to the other two [Music]
games [Music]
and here we are playing strange brigade and this gaming pc is just
smoking that fps we're getting over 150 average fps here at high settings at
1080p which means if you had a 144hz monitor
you would be getting a very good experience
on this resolution and this settings the gpu and also the cpu are running a lot
cooler now that we've taken the side glass panel off
and we're just letting the computer breathe and this is a really good thing
if you're on a budget i do recommend doing this on budget cases it's going to
save you a lot of money but it's also going to save your gear
in the long term from running at high attempts
so overall strange brigade with the 1 and 0.1
lows too is just an absolutely smooth and very playable and enjoyable
experience [Music]
and next up here we've got doom on high settings and we're just benchmarking
this now and the fps is going to around again that magical spot of about 140
which just like the strange brigade shows that this little combo here
is perfect for 1080p 144 hertz gaming now
if you're worried about a four core eight threaded cpu
in 2020 don't be especially at this budget
where we've got the gpu pretty much at all times
being near a hundred percent which really is a good thing
and it means you're getting a lot of value for money
out of the ryzen 3 3 100. and so we've just finished up this little benchmark
right here and it's showing that the one percent and 0.1
lows which is an indicator if it gets really
low that's an indicator of stuttering but since this is 80 and 107
respectively it's showing that this is going to give
out an extremely smooth gaming experience and now closing up
today's video with this new gaming pc right here i am
shocked at the value for money you can get
in this price category the ryzen 3 3100 is a beautiful little cpu and it's great
coupled with a 1660 super and these games at 1080p high settings
they had no problems no stuttering whatsoever and another
really good thing about a build like this
is that from the wall the total power system consumption
was only around 230 watts while we're playing call of duty war zone
which is intensive on not just the graphics card but also the cpu as well
and we saw in some of those benchmarks this was scoring the highest
temperatures on the cpu side so that just shows that if it's using up
230 watts your power supply here even a 400 or 450
watt power supply is going to be absolutely fine for this
combo granted it's from a company that regularly makes power
supplies and has a reputation for making decent power supplies i don't recommend
going out and buying from a brand name that you've never heard of before
and no one's been using these power supplies because you may come into some
troubles and i've used power supplies in the past that have said
700 watts on them and then you even put something as simple as a 1650 on that
with a ryzen cpu or an i7 and the thing just goes toast
so don't go out and buy a no-name brand power supply
but that aside the case itself if i was to change something
i would if i had a bit of extra money i would definitely get a case with better
airflow where i would recommend if you got a
budget case like this just leaving the side panel off it's
something that i've recommended for years
if you're on a budget just leave that side panel off and you'll be tasting
much better temperatures or at least your computer components
will be tasting those better temps and that leads to as we said before
just better longevity on all your computer components in
general though another thing i'm going to talk about is the size of the games
this has to be addressed because we put in a 480 gigabyte ssd here today
and that's a really nice size for an ssd but if you
are playing a lot of different games especially if you're playing call of
duty and you're going to be playing a lot of
other games that are coming with big download sizes
you may wish to invest in something like an eight terabyte hard drive
with a long warranty and just use that over the years to store
all your games on and then change that if you upgrade your computer in the
future you can just take that drive with you
and keep something like a 480 gigabyte ssd
or a one terabyte nvme as your main windows boot drive and then leave your
backup drive with all your games on it the last thing to address is people are
going to say you should get a b450 instead of an a320 with the ryzen 3 3100
it's not going to make too much of a difference
unless of course you want to overclock and you want to upgrade your cpu in the
future but me delving into gaming pcs a lot
here on the channel i'm a big believer in just building the pc
once and then after you've played it for a few years you pretty much re-flip it
on the used market where that's another thing we'll quickly
address and that is the prices of new parts are so good right now
it's actually better in my opinion to be building a new pc where
i got all these pc parts just from my local retailer which was about
15 minute drive from where i live and there was no hassles of finding any
deals on the used market where i feel at the moment they use deals although
they are there and they do come up they just get snagged up
straight away when they're actually a pretty good deal on the used market so
on the flip side of things the availability of the new parts
is definitely there and it's definitely time if you're thinking about buying a
gaming pc and you want some of the best price
performance then the pc we built here in today's video
is definitely going to give you that and with that aside i hope you guys enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to hit that like
button for us also let us know in the comment section below
what do you think of today's build love reading your thoughts and opinions as
always just like this question of the day here
which comes from shoops and they ask i just updated my graphics drivers and
now my monitor has no signal can someone help me out and
basically if your computer updates a graphics card
driver and this monitor then says no signal as
soon as it's updated the graphics card driver
unfortunately that is usually a faulty graphics card
and as much as i don't like to be the bearer of bad news that usually isn't a
good sign however there is another possibility and that is
that the graphs card you bought if you especially if you got on the used
market it could have a mining bios on it and if someone's essentially installed a
patch with that previous driver and then
you've gone and installed a new graphics card driver
that can cause that issue too but usually that doesn't cause your display
to go black and actually if you go to device manager
it will just show an exclamation mark next to that graphics card itself hope
that answers that question and with that aside i'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon and also if you're keen to build something like
this then i'll put some links in the
description below for you as well as a great monitor
to pair with this pc right here and i'll see you next time
peace out for now bye [Music]
