welcome back to another episode of potato hunter there's only one thing you can do when supply starts drying up and that is you've got to lower your standards and jump on the potato hypetrain and now there seems to be a little bit of confusion recently in the comment section people are like dude core to juice that's proper potato and we've got to clarify a few things that is a rotten potato what we're going for here is a good potato the one that you eat the one that you chopped up into chips you're put in the oven and then you eat it and you say hey I just got some really good value for money that's what we're gonna be doing today where we go on good old gam tree and Facebook and there's only one thing that we can really do right now and honestly that's just cross our fingers and hope we get lucky [Music] so we put out a few feelers here on Facebook marketplace and also Gumtree going through the deals right now first off was the gtx 660 I offered fifty Aussie dollars they're asking a hundred bucks it's been sitting up there for a while so it looks like they've had no interest and they said yes they would accept that office straight up next up is a cougar gem and I am a GB mini Taylor case I've actually used one of these before and they look decent and that's what you want when you're flipping a PC so I've offered them 70 cash pickup for that so they still yet to respond then we've got an r9 270 which I'm offering 60 cash pickup for and they say it's 100% working which is always a good thing then last up on face book marketplace is a CPU plus motherboard plus RAM so we've got the whole lot there all's we really have to do is put in a little bit of a lower offer because it is an i5 750 so asking a hundred Aussie dollars I've dropped in 80 ozzie dollars we'll see if they take that because that coupled with saying GTX 660 is still gonna give you a half-decent experience in fortnight I believe off the top of my head you can get on low settings epic distance I understand screen resolutions still get a hundred frames per second they're going across the good old gam tree we've got a cheap gaming PC that's all they've listed this thing as there's no specs nothing like it but they do say that the performance in fortnight is pretty bad with the power cable plugged in so what I'm thinking is they might have just plugged this whole computer off the CPU and then saying they're getting bad fps so it's interesting regardless I'm keen to actually take a gamble on this where I've offered them $200 dollars --ax they've accepted and they say come pick it up so we're gonna get picked that off on the way up to Brisbane which is where all these deals are currently at then the next deal was really interesting - it's just been listed someone else has put an offer down they're asking $380 for an i3 system but the case power supply water cooler and 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory on an h1 70 motherboard does make this more more appealing so hopefully they'll get back to us on that one because you're just pretty much add an i7 in the good graphics card you get yourself a really decent gaming PC something in the mid-range then next up we've got a 7970 with a water block and it's going for $70 but I've spare cooler on and older sort of gone 7970 which I can take the cooler off and put it on this so I've often done 50 Ozzie dolls I said negotiable hopefully they get back and we'll score a bargain there and then next up is an i7 see 700 put down $158 everybody gotten back to us and said 2 to 5 it's pretty expensive man like you're going into like I 590 400 F Territory there as well as even going past the horizon 520 600 so that's way too much for 6700 then last up we've got the most interesting deal and that is a crypto rig with 16 Rx for 60s and 6 RS for 70s they're asking 1,600 I said to him look 1400 if all the GPUs are working and they check out especially if they've already got gaming biases loaded into them so what's happening with the theorem I was gonna make a separate video for you guys there's something interesting that's going on in that world but we can talk about it a bit later because we've got to get up before the Sun goes too far down and I've also noticed that les has listed some HP's up on gumtree so I'm gonna track him down and see if we can go clean him out as well [Music] so we just went to this shopping center and it's got a computer store there and we managed to buy quite a bit of stuff even though it's a little bit more pricey than what I'm used to getting it's still decent prices due to the fact that there's a lot of shortages in stocks so we picked up like I think in total like 10 1 terabyte hard drives 5 500 gigabyte hard drives a few they had actually a few potato graphics cards on hand which I ended up getting to like r7 260x --is and also a on 7 3 or r9 sorry all this terminology and naming r9 370 X and also a gtx 1066 gigabytes so of what the price is quickly up on the screen for you guys but now we've got a head to msy and go get a few cases to [Music] so going through msy looking for cases even like LED ring fans and stuff like that they had absolutely nothing like we've got five cases that's all they had left so we got a few of them for builds but other than that it's looking pretty dry so we're trying to pick up what we can when we can but now since we're about 15 minutes from leza's place we're gonna go pay him a visit since he had an ad up on gumtree and i 3 HP 4th gen so quickly see what he's got see what he's all about and it's worth a try have you got anyone have you got any more of those or yeah have you got any ddr3 as well that's right also quick update on the office while we're on the road some of the people have gotten back to us the r9 270 they were firm on $80 and so that's really a no-go for me since that place even in that shopping center had better prices and better GPUs so we leave that one sitting there was also the GTX 645 they wanted $30 for it so I'm gonna leave that sitting and then leave Gemini a case we put an offer on this for 70 they said 75 so I'm like sure I'll take that 75 seems decent since I do need RGB cases that have a bit of good bling worthy bling on them at this point in time and then stepping over the gum tree we've got that gaming PC that we're still gonna go get so if we would get that on the way back it's got to make it two lasers before he closes up shops he always gets annoyed when I go there too late [Music] so after going through lasers uh I guess the last of his stash he only we had that HP on gumtree the i3 which he gave us for a hundred bucks and then he had some dirty keyboards which I always asked for really dirty so we're gonna give them some tackiest lovin and there's no monitors there's no RAM there's no SSDs no hard drives everything is just running dry so even less is getting cleaned out where he can't get any more stock so whatever it's chaotic times let's go get a chaotic deal which is this gem and I and it's only about ten minutes away which is great so it's still sunlight I'm getting through today's potato hunt extremely quickly [Music] so picking up that Gemini case that was 75 bucks and we're in this open area farm right now it's actually kind of beautiful so this place called Rocha Dale it's really close to Brisbane but it's also got a lot of farmland so I mean what can I say I'm a scenic kind of guy so I'm just checking out this last add here the gaming PC ad and why they brought the computer over and like had this LED controller just sticking out of it I'm like wow that's like actually a fire hazard but then I saw like the g-41 I'm like wow Core 2 Duo and then there was some potato graphics card in there so I was like you know what I'll just keep my 200 bucks and I told him like as you know the main excuse was to dangerous device so I left the disease and so yeah we're gonna get on back to the tech yes to do from here on in so we now got the cream of the crop here lined up on the desk it wasn't a massive hole here today but I did get some new cases from the EMS Y store and so as I've got some motherboards lying around and I'm just piecing together some RAM and some hard drives here I'll be able to piece together some builds where it's getting to the stage where you might be seeing a trend or any first and second episode but pretty good third episode now I'm just like trickling in parts and getting whatever I can and so we've got here the r7 370 X this is an interesting little card because there's a small form-factor yet it still packs a punch and then only needs a 6 pin so that's not a bad pickup then of course we've got these two sixty acres which will be great I mean for 50 Aussie dollars I can't complain too much considering it will play fortnight which is the most important thing people are so hungry for these budget fortnight pcs right now so I bought the other one that they had there too then this was a 1066 gigabyte which only needed a 6-pin so it's gonna go pretty well considering the power supplies I have on hand at the moment are really Ivan got like 450 watt power supplies and 400 watt power supplies so all these cards here are going to go perfectly with that and then we've got two four gigabyte sticks around we had to pay 15 Aussie dollars each a stick because a little bit everywhere I'm going now Rams getting sold out and then behind that we've got 500 gigabyte hard drives these are great for say coupling with the 260 X on a budget bill then we've got the one terabyte hard drives even though they say $30 on them I got all these for 26 a pop and these here for 15 Ozzie dollars a pop so things are getting a little bit more expensive and I am paying a little bit more than I'm used to paying the thing about those prices increasing is that that's also flowing on to the final price of the PC builds where it's anything from like 20 to 30% more than you used to selling a PC for that's how much prices have gone up all of the sudden and they probably will go up even more if this situation isn't alleviated any time soon but this was the HP Protess 400 let's have this laying around this literally all he had and so I'm going to I've got an i5 4th gen so I'm going to put that with the i-5 and another four gigabytes of RAM take the 250g you buy hard drive out you can use that in an office PC put in a one terabyte hard drive and now we've got a fourth gen gaming PC with say this 370 X right here now we've got these keyboards they're gonna get some tech yes lemon tomorrow morning bit late to do that tickets living right now and now we're at the finish line where I think the total hole here today was eleven hundred and ninety eight Aussie dollars so we did get a heap of cases we also got that Gemini case which I think so roughly a twenty five percent discount but thing is with that Gemini cases that right now RGB cases are in demands of the fact that I got cheaper then even the retail price which this is the retail price before the US dollar got stronger in coz dollar I think that's a deal on its own so anytime I think something's a deal I'm gonna take the plunge on it but it is worrying to see what will happen in the next few weeks one thing for sure is I got no idea what's gonna happen but I'm gonna keep staying positive and I'm gonna keep my eyes open because I noticed a lot of the competition out there I think there's people who are just hanging on gumtree and Facebook at least in my area and they're just waiting like they're hitting f5 every five minutes f5 f5 bang f5 for the five minute refresh so they can get on the deals as soon as possible that's what you're seeing and that's just what happens during these times where supply goes to an all-time low and then demand actually increases because more people are staying home and they need either a gaming PC or something to do a hybrid of their schoolwork and doubling down as a gaming PC in their spare time though in terms of deals that we either left sitting or we missed out on there was also the gtx 660 GS the guy got back to me said he would take the 50 Oz he does but this happened like just 10 minutes ago and I'm already now back at the Gold Coast so I'm gonna run all the way up to Brisbane again just to get a gtx 660 there was also the i think we mentioned before there was the guy that wanted $80 for his 217 on X and you can basically get them online cheaper like buy it now before that price and that's delivered to your door so you don't have to do anything so I just mentioned this guy back and said look 60s fair dude and so that one just went and with all that aside I hope you guys enjoyed episode 3 of potato hunter if you did then be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite pick up in today's video we're going low and the good thing is I've sold a lot of these budget builds so far and the feedback that's coming in on them is actually really good they're impressed that it plays for tonight even on low settings at a hundred percent screen resolution it's still enough to give them an enjoyable experience so that's the reason why I didn't pick up that ddr2 system earlier because I just know in the back of my mind that thing is going to be horrible whoever picks it up and tries to game on that thing will just be having a bad experience especially if it's flowing like 4 night or if it's some other titles out there I was done with LGA 775 a couple of years ago and it's just off my radar now but that's because known as the performance actually quite bad it's just too problematic with everything involved in the age of that platform and let's be real I ain't paying $200 the LGA 775 know it before I do get on out of here we got the question of the day which comes from Tanmay and they asked can I use a hair dryer instead of a heat gun and the answer to that one is quite simply no the hair dryer just simply won't get hot enough to make any impact or try and revive any of those parts on board or of course melt the solder down as opposed to a heat gun which actually can get a lot hotter and in fact on my heat gun I have to turn it down two-thirds of the way because if you turn it up the card will start glowing and that's not a good sign I mean it's getting too hot so if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll put the link to that video up here where I bake GPUs as a last resort and I do say this last resort if you've got nothing to lose then you sometimes in rare circumstances can get either a little bit of life or a lot longer of a life out of a graphics card hope that answers that question and I will catch you guys in another tech video very soon if you stay this far and you're enjoying that content then be sure to hit that sub button and ring that Bell on the way out and I'll see you in the next one peace out for now but [Music]
