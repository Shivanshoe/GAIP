it is that time of the month for a used PC parts hunt and you probably already tell that I'm pretty excited but I'm not be too excited because a little while ago and potato hunter I bought some graphics cards which is a gtx 1060 right here and the fan doesn't even spin on for this thing like it just doesn't even spin when you boot it up so there's no signal the thing is like I got completely hosed well I didn't get hose I'm gonna take it back right now before we go get any more parts in this endeavor and also check out what this stores got and they also saw me of faulty gtx 760 so like that's two cards out of five that i bought from them that were faulty anyhow we're gonna go hit the road before they close and then we're gonna call theirs quickly see what's due that little combo wombo jumbo and then also gonna check out some deals while we're on the road because i just finished this 360 degree build and it took like all day to film that but anyway that aside let's get this used pc pots on up the mont underway so you get those price performance capes on and let's see what deals we can snap up [Music] [Applause] hey Liz hey you got man yeah not bad are you up for a visitor like I'm just around the corner kind of thing see say some stuff on dial-up stuff we can I just quickly pop in maybe any monitors 50 15 minutes like oh yeah this is Logan I'm so over so long yeah I'll be there soon I see a most so finishing up at lasers place we ended up picking up three 19-inch monitors which he did for 20th pop and the thing is they were like the last monitors he has I think he got a few more in stock and like really just everything at the moment in this use scene seems to be just dribble its dribble here dribble there dribble everywhere and parts are sort of just come in so slowly so this is gonna be the situation for I don't know how long but hey this is the market we're in at the moment I'm playing ball here and we also picked up a Z 600 series workstation with an e5 1620 and then similar to an i7 38 20 I believe off the top of my head I had 32 gigabytes of ECC registered RAM in it and I try to negotiate a little price and I was like LEDs you can take the memory out of that he's like no it's ECC registered nobody wants it ddr3 and I'm like yeah that's kind of what I was thinking too so I had to pay a little bit more than I'm used to on that but since it does have 32 gigabytes came with a one terabyte hard drive I paid 350 for it again these prices are not that good it's just that everything in the pipeline has gone up I think we said that in the potato hunter but it's getting even worse now so he did chuck in a 120 gigabyte SSD with that so basically the whole system is ready to go I'm just gonna add in a graphics card so I managed to make a little bit of profit on that not too much but before that we went to the CX place and they had some more memory so we picked up to 8 gigabytes tix to 4 gigabyte sticks surprisingly the a gigabyte sticks were cheaper and in Paris and coming in at 22 Aussie a pop first is the full gigabyte 6 with a 15 a pop and I just need ddr3 RAM period so I picked up two sticks of each that's all they had and then I also go to terabyte hard drives from there and my money back on that gtx 1060 because they had nothing to replace it and they also really funded the gtx 760 that I had because I bought a few cards from these guys and that was from a different store though where they post it and they were able to do the refund at that store so that's pretty good service I gotta say CX has some really good service shout out to them so yeah I guess at the moment like you're saying here it's just dribbles here they're everywhere dribbles dribbles dribbles this is the market at the moment and this is the way you've got to play ball so who knows how long this markets gonna go on for but that being said I have scoured Gumtree and Facebook and there's just like the deals are just either non-existent or their way to overpriced so essentially not making it a deal at all and what we've got right now is I'm lining up a 2600 K and also GTX 1060 so possibly getting a GTX 1060 posted to me I just got to negotiate this deal and there's also 2600 K which they wanted 80 Aussie dollars for I said 60 they said 70 and I just had now sixties the max I can pay so we'll see if they get back to us on that and hopefully we can pick that up because they're just around the corner so that's that let's try and pick up a 2600 K and see if we can find some more deals on the way but really doesn't look that promising at the moment it's a it's dribble time [Music] and now we're back in the tech yes studio and it hasn't really brought a whole lot so far but this is what we've got that RAM we've got the drives I also got a 2 terabyte drive and this is that SSD that let shucked in with this Z 620 workstation right here so we'll make some magic happen with this thing but here's these three monitors then I mean for 20 Ozzie dollars they're looking pretty cool they'll go with some combos we've got kind of one ready to go right over there and we've got some cables and this is probably the one thing I'm really happy about a free security camera so that'll that'll make all my worries go away but so far just looking over a gum tree and Facebook the deals are just so dry right now it's it is the driest month that I've ever come into right at least less shocked in this monitor stand right here because I've got sometimes I get monitors that come through with no stands and some people just give them away to me and I'm thinking well maybe I can drill some holes in these and then get them to attach just to a random monitor stand that way you can have a desktop setup going on a real cheap budget but that's practically what's gonna be going on I think at least in the next month is trying to really micro hard this is the age of micro that's coming into effect and to be honest I'm gonna make the most out of it and see what magic I can pull here on the channel for you guys but really it's it's such a different market I'm just not used to this at all and I think a lot of other people out there that are doing the hustle are just not used to this one bit its there's the same amount of people probably more people trying to get into it now that they got free time or maybe they don't have a job anymore and they're like well how can I make some money and then they they trying to look around for PC pots and the supplies just dried up completely but the demand is just through the roof so crazy situation crazy situation but what I'm going to do now is we're gonna quickly like really just leave this on the desk and try and wake up early in the morning and then see what deals there could possibly be out on the market just so we can try and make some magic happen with April 2020s use part time of the month hello mr. one terabyte I miss the two terabyte Oh hello hey mister two terabyte I missed one terabyte nice to meet you let's go on a gaming PC look try to find some ways to entertain myself or you and waking up getting back into it I'm all energized I'm ready to try and find some deals but it's clear to see from yesterday that there's a trend going through and that is you're really gonna just pick up something when you can pick it up and it's usually not going to be a bulk sale that being said let's pull up good old game tree and Facebook and see if we can find some stuff and looking through the market like from tip to toe I'm scouring everything and anything I managed to find five different things on gumtree and going through here we've got an i3 8100 they're asking 100 Ozzy I put in an offer of 80 Aussie dollars because I do believe I have a h3 10 motherboard and if I can find some cheap ddr4 memory that would make for a decent budget build then there was someone else was actually two people selling various parts so I sent them a message one person had three power supplies still available so they'll pretty good actually had four powers wives of one of them was like a 270 white which I've already got some of those real low end power supplies so I asked him how much they'd want for three decent power supply so waiting to get back on that then there was another person selling a risin 7 some keyboards and mice and all that other stuff but I was more focused on the rather than 7 1700 X 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory they had a 256 gigabyte SSD and also an 850 watt power supply so I was just like look if I buy all this stuff could you do us a discount and if so what could you do us on that then there's an online 280x which I put in an offer eighty Aussie dollars see Zeus models it seems to be pretty good if we can get that then that's gonna be a score then the last deal that we've messaged about is just a monitor 22 inch monitor but they're giving it away for free and the thing is it's just around the corner from me so it's not that far of a drive so I've messaged them it was only listed like eight minutes ago hopefully I can pick that up for free but jumping over to Facebook Marketplace I found some 128 gigabyte SSDs now asking for T apart but they had six of them available so I asked them if I come and buy the lot can you do us a better price so I'm waiting to hear back on that then there's a 16 gigabyte to 8 gig sticks of T Falls Delta 32 under making that's memory they're asking $100 I said look I'll pay asking price but can you post it since it is a bit far from me so if we pick that up for a hundred Ozzy it's a pretty good price in this market and then there was someone selling in RTX 20 70 super a galaxy' dition for 800 and I offered them 700 but they said Oh firm on 800 think about this card is it basically goes brand new for 800 so I'd rather buy it new rather than picking it off of someone used and that is one problem I am seeing at the moment especially lately is that I guess because all the good or even decent deals are getting all snapped up is that there's only these deals left that are overpriced and so maybe the sellers are getting some interest in them at these overpriced prices and so they're going to hold firm thinking that they can maybe get a sucker in but if it's one thing you know about tech yes he ain't no sucker anyway it's time to get to the yes 'mobile because the person's messaged is back about the free monitor so we're gonna go pick that up right now and then I might as well head to some of these other CX stores where we only visited one of them and there's actually three of them on the Gold Coast so I'm gonna go see if I can clean them out of maybe some cheap ddr3 memory and also see if they've got some SSDs and possibly even some graphics cards or should I say gravis cards let's get to the yes [Music] so we just got this monitor here it looks pretty good and what's even better is it's free but it's time to sold your own [Music] [Music] so now we've checked out two of these C X's consecutively and the first one ended up being a boss and then the second one also ended up being a boss so we just came into a double boss this is kind of like reminding me of when I used to go around in Japan and would go check out like five places in one day and like two or three of them were just a boss complete boss so they just had like I mean there's got the same 1 terabyte hard drives but I've already stocked up on a heap of those and the other one the third place which we've already been to yesterday and I think we went there in potato Honda that place is a little bit closer to my house than these other two places us so that's all I got to say we started off on a high with that free monitor and that's a problem when you start off on too hot of a run usually bound for I'm not going to say it just yet because we just went to m/s wide to picked up a couple of cases as these antec dark phantom cases so I'm keen to check them out never tried them before they'll 75 vazhi a pop I'm like sure I need some cases for some mid-range builds and they also have I also got two SSDs off them for 42 dollars a pop so things are just like really slow at the moment but what we're gonna do is we're gonna get head back to the tech a studio see if any of those people have messages back and then sort of see what else we can get before we conclude this month's parts on [Music] and we're back here for the second night in a row at the tech ash studio and this is the worst thing I haven't got any replies on Facebook about those two ads I messaged about the free monitor they go back to a straight away which is great that was like really cool but then the four other ads I message about how I got any replies and I'm sitting here for a few hours already kind of like waiting like you know you go on that date with that personally yeah really oh man I really wish you'd messaged me back and she's just never messaged back that's kind of what's going on here my insecurities are creeping up on me mind you that was like the teenager tech yes city that I'm referring to yeah nowadays if she don't message me back yeah anyhow doing a summary of what we've got this month so far and to be honest I saw this coming before I went into this month I think we all saw this coming because where I'm at at the moment it's still strict lockdown and that businesses aren't really operating a lot of the places in Brisbane that do the wholesale this is the thing with the whole system here is that there's a lot of wholesalers in Brisbane it's pretty much the hub of use PC parts in Australia that's all stopped everything so that means all the middlemen have kind of slowed down practically every middleman slowed down in the process and so there's just no flow of use PC parts going around and of course we've got the graphics cards the new graphics card shipments they're slowing down prices are going up USD is getting stronger against AUD so it's just led to the lake worst-case scenario right now for PC pots in general at least in my area and like if you guys are in other parts of the world and you're still bowling please don't write a comment below to tell me how well are you born because I'll get jealous but that being said what we got here on the desk so far we get on doing the tally here we got three and fifty Aussie dollars for an SSD two terabyte hard drive and that Z 620 workstation with 32 gigabytes of RAM all we have to do is add a graphics card into that thing and also had a one terabyte drive inside - so let's hook this up a really good deal not really good but I'd say for these times consider out and get nothing else I'd say it's a decent deal and then we've got three 19-inch newer monitors I'm used to paying a lot less like fifteen or ten dollars sometimes from other suppliers for these monitors I got these for twenty dollars each but I'm happy with that because again everything in the pipeline is getting more expensive but you're also getting more money off the final build price that's just a general trend going through and then of course we had the 2600 K 460 LZ dolls I liked that deal solid the two eight gigabyte six for $22 a pop that's pretty solid as well and then the two four gigabyte Stix is like me I kind of need ddr3 anyway so I was like I'll throw that into the kit and then twenty-six Aussie dollars for two one terabyte hydro-zone 26h so that brought the Tahlia to 596 aussie dolls of 388 USD and again not really like far from not only is it far from the best month in terms of getting stuff the deals themselves are far from the best of what I'm getting and so what you're gonna see is like everywhere you go if you're in Australia where I'm from at the moment is that everything's getting ticked on like even cases have gone up ten fifteen dollars that's teasing out ten fifteen dollars and so all those items you have that ticking over eight times in a build that's going to add around like 100 to 150 bucks to a build and so you got to see that on pretty much every building the pipeline and that's why prices are going up in builds where I'm at at the moment and of course there are other people out there just like hey anything will sell right now so they're going way above the bar and trying to rip people off so you go be careful of that too anyway that being said kind of like if you're gonna see the history of tech yes City you're gonna see me pull out my disappointed face and honestly it's a lot of fun I mean this is how it goes right you've got the the rollercoaster of life and part of that is you guys you get to come along with the journey with me attack your city I'm not gonna really hide anything that goes on behind the scenes it's just it is what it is and this month has just been one of the worst months of apart signing but hey we when it gets it basically as far as I can see it it's not going to get any it kind they get battle and so that's the way you always got a thing I think just the glass is half-full it's not half empty so anyway wherever you are in the world stay positive stay focused but also at that same time let us know what your favorite deal in today's parts hunt was and why and also if you've been picking up some cool deals on different parts let us know what you're getting at the moment and I said before don't write it but do write it I kind of want to get jealous anyways so if you are still getting those news parts and you still go on really strong do write about in the comments love reading each and every one of your opinions and your thoughts just like this question of the day right here and this comes from IRA Foster and they asked does this work with out an older CPU and they're referring to the a320 video that we coupled with the rising 5 3600 and basically if you've got a couple any CPU with an a320 just keep in mind as a rough guesstimate use the CPUs a TDP limit as a guide and basically don't go over 65 watts so if say for instance arisin v 1400 that'll work absolutely fine on an a320 even the upcoming risin 30 130 300 X's they should be fine on an a320 motherboard so just keep in mind that 65 watt TDP limit on CPU matches the I believe it's I don't know if it's official but the a320 s they're designed to work with the 65 watt TDP CPUs and under because the V RMS obviously aren't that good the boards themselves are just real budget options so hopefully that answers that question but also before I get on out here its micro times and I've already used those two stands like I look through my studio and in the garage and I had two monitors without stands on them so I'm kind of getting this ready to make two monitors with stands again so that's kind of like the micro that's going on here but also on that note there's another thing I'm doing too and that is we're gonna be shifting the gears and we're gonna be doing some new metas next month I've definitely looked at the market looked at the situation gonna suss out what's going on and give you guys the best medes to go into May 2020 and with that aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did then be sure to smash that like button for us and if you stayed this far and you're enjoying the con and you know what to do get that sub button ring that bell and I'll catch you another taken beer very soon peace out for now Mike [Music] [Music]
