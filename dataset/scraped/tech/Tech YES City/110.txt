the gtx 1080 a card released on may 27 2016 for 599 usd can be had on the second hand market for still what i would consider reasonable prices versus newer cards why is this well it has to do with the fact that it isn't that desirable for you guessed it crypto miners providing similar hash rates to a 1660 super but using more power it makes for a good option for gamers in 2021. though here is my story of making a pc from the recent gtx 1080 that i picked up in a used pc part-time for 400 aussie dollars which is about 295 usd where this is the main star of the show well actually there's two main stars at the show this first off being here a pickup that we got for 110 aussie dollars 16 gigabytes of ram i7 4th gen dirty gtx 650 crap powers play but we're really only interested in the cpu the motherboard and the ram then we're moving on to the gtx 1080. this right here is a very powerful card because it is the oc water cooled version and we picked this up for 400 aussie dollars making it a pretty decent buy in the current land of graphics guards then we've got a 120 gigabyte ssd 2 terabyte backup drive for games and everything else then a 20 vs 600 power supply that we picked up off the used market then the last component is the rgb case because we got four fans we've got the bling so let's start testing out this graphics card and also this build to see if everything works before we put this pc together are you tired of seeing this annoying activate windows message then if so today's video sponsor scd keys has you covered for as little as fourteen dollars using the coupon code bftyc you can get activated today works for windows 11 pro two links in description below [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so we quickly tested out the power supply and then we dusted off the gpu and the motherboard and the components and we have a working signal here with the i7 4770 now one thing is is the bios is a really early revision so i might update that just for better stability usually you generally don't update your bios if everything's working fine but in this case i just want to do it just to make sure that the gtx 1080 in windows 10 and if someone upgrades to windows 11 for example they come into no problems so that is really good news everything works fine except i also might replace this fan here because it is like it doesn't look like it's working properly it starts to spin up and then it just freezes so i'm gonna replace that fan with the cheap option that will still sort of add to the aesthetics of this build [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] we don't have a memory control in the bios so i can't overclock or tune the ddr3 memory but fortunately it has made the ddr3 memory that it's at 1600 megahertz on both sticks and we are picking up the uh two channels there so we do have at least a baseline here for good performance well hopefully which we will test that out in games the most important thing of course is at 1080p maxing out this gravis card at um 100 while we are playing some of these games so let's boot those games up check out the temperatures and check out the performance remember [Music] them [Music] so finishing up on the benchmarks here with apex legends we can see here pretty much 1080p max settings we're getting around 120 average fps the one percent and 0.1 percent lows were extremely smooth and i was really surprised because we had a 4770s and memory that was untuned and we really couldn't tune it up in the bios and this thing was absolutely fine with that gtx 1080. now this was the star of the show the 1080 is a really good card i'm actually playing on i haven't played on this card in a long time and playing on it really just showed that you don't need a whole lot more than a 1080 and in fact a lot of these gpus even like the rtx 3060 for example and i might do a dedicated video on the 360 versa 1080 but when we look at the 3060 that's going in australia for 800 plus and if we look at something like this i picked it up for four hundred dollars it's representing extremely good value for money now keep in mind i did have to clean it up a little bit but in terms of the temperatures we were under 60 degrees at all times and the cpu that new cooler we did pull that from another build that i did in the past and i had a spare cooler left over and the newer intel all black cooler does a really good job of remaining quiet and in decent temperatures on the 4770s now i was kind of worried that the cpu being a 4770s wouldn't have uh as much grunt as the 4770 especially the gtx 1080 but we saw with that balance between the cpu and the gpu in apex legends monitoring with msi afterburner that it was completely fine and then to top all that off not only were the temperatures really good on both cpu and gpu the noise on this build is really well controlled now this is thanks to this budget case here which is actually not too budget in essence it's actually really good for the money i'd say this is the best case that i've picked up in terms of brand new value for money it actually comes from a friend who runs a business called cisnex on the gold coast here but are still in this environment where crypto currencies are commanding the prices of gpus and you're just seeing this across all the tech industry where there's no doubting it that the gpu prices are just inflated because of crypto miners when all this other stuff like cases ssds ram motherboard cpus are still coming in at really good prices so if you want to build something and you want to build something for decent value for money i would definitely put a gtx 1080 up on the top of your list in terms of cards to get where also the power consumption especially for the performance you're getting is really well controlled now that fire strike extreme score that is in the 11 000 range which isn't that far behind some of the newer rtx 3000 cars in particular the rtx 3060 so this card is looking like it can still do very solid 1080p gaming in 2021 though keep in mind one thing to look out for is a lot of people go for the 1080 ti and so you might think oh well i get the 1080 ti it's got more performance but i found the 1080 ti as the minimum and the absolute minimum i could get one for was 600 aussie dollars versus 400 so that's a 50 increase in the cost but you're not going to be getting 50 more performance out of a 1080 ti over a 1080 so i really think cards like the 1070 and 1080 are really hit home in terms of price performance on the used market even though their prices aren't that great i still think if you can pick up one of these cards for around 450 aussie dollars or if you're in the us say 300 to 350 u.s for a 1080 you are going to be smooth sailing when it comes to pc gaming and the good thing about the 1080 is it's not that desirable and i say this again when we look at the cards that are good for gamers it's the ones that aren't too desirable for the miners that will end up being the better buyers for the gamers so the miners probably thinking and i know this is sad right this is how it is in 2021 at this current point in time the miners are probably thinking well i'm not going to pay extra for the 1080 and get the same revenue every day so that is at least one fortunate thing going for the gtx 1080 anyhow guys this pc right here it ended up coming out really well and this is what i talk about recently you guys probably know that i've had a few fails here on the channel but this one is one of those ones that's just a big victory and actually i've got another couple of victories coming up where you just absolutely win for that price point so that's what it's all about the ups and downs of the used market especially if you are buying stuff that is untested never forget that the untested comes with the wrist but the rewards in my opinion are really worth it as much as i hate getting faulty parts in that you just can't get working again sometimes you get those untested builds that just have everything working and this was one of those examples and i gotta say for the price performance this thing is definitely coming in with the hard-hitting value so if you enjoyed this one be sure to hit that like button also let us know in the comment section below what do you think about this build what do you think about the 1080 what do you think about the i7 4770s i think the s cpus especially when it comes to gaming you're really getting better value than the ks and the non-s's the normal versions because a lot of people don't look for the s's but i really like what they bring to the table so with that aside i do apologize for not making as much content as i would and actually this is going to tie in perfectly with the question of the day here which comes from commando kodiak and they ask how's the new something treating you and this one is one that hits hard for i guess any aussie right now because you guys may have seen all over the world that there's this particular i mean focus on what's going down in australia and from my opinion it's just one of those things when this is a sad thing right about my channel is i can't like this is where this is how crazy it's getting i can't give an opinion because i risk losing my job and this is where i raise the question to youtube it's like youtube guys please let people freely speak about topics and let them express their opinions and views and if people think that's wrong they're not going to follow that person if they think that person's right and they agree with them they're going to follow them and i just think the amount of like censorship going on in 2021 is just really to a new low it's setting the bar really low in terms of what people can and cannot talk about and in my opinion i've i've been i'm pro-choice that's what we like most of the aussies i talk to well actually every aussie i talk to on this topic is pro-choice and so i just feel people should be able to choose what they need to do and then people counter-argue that and say well you know you're this you're that and they'll call you names and they don't get censored there's no censorship for them it's just censorship for the people who defend themselves and then point to statistics and data and and so uh that's all i can say is uh look at some of the people front running some of this stuff and all i can say is that i i um i just i feel sad that's just my opinion on it and anyway guys i hope if you disagree with me then so be it but that's what makes the world or wants what used to make the board what it was now this this is what it is it's just hey how you doing i can't do anything anyway guys that's kind of a crap ending for an otherwise amazing project but that's just how it is and one thing is like i just really it is eating me up know if youtube if people are watching out there that work for youtube know that this is probably eating up a lot of creators not just me this is eating up a lot of creators and eating up their energy eating up their motivation not only that's probably eating up a lot of viewers and their energy too because we all have at the end of the day i feel like we should all be entitled to an opinion at the very least so that one anyway guys hope that hits home with you thanks for staying this far if you stayed this far and you're enjoying that tech yes content and be sure to hit that sub button ring that bell and you'll get the videos as soon as they drop and i'll catch in the next one peace out for now bye [Music]
