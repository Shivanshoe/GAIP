it is finally that time of the month we're gonna jump in the tech yes 'mobile and go look for some used PC parts hunts that are listed on good old gam tree and Facebook but before we do that I will say if you guys are feeling a little bit down this month then hopefully this video brings a smile to your face because I'm gonna be bringing up the energy this month where we're looking for everything under the Sun when it comes to use PC parts because I'm out of stock for pretty much everything so I'll be looking for use graphics cards use cases use power supplies use ddr3 use ddr4 memory use raisin CPUs I've 5s i sevens and also does it have an i-5 in it bro I'll still be going there for desktop machines nothing is off the radar this month so let's get to it and see what deals we can pull up [Music] so what we managed to find on gumtree first up was an i7 2670 gigabytes of ram but the motherboards a little bit questionable a Foxconn h61 and I don't know why someone would pair that with a 2600 2 K to begin with so it is a little bit risky if we go with this system especially at multiple but there's a Wi-Fi card thrown in so I'm gonna drop in an offer of a hundred and 50 Aussie dollars now one thing at the moment is the USD is very strong against the Aussie dollar so I'll put the US prices up for you guys but keep in mind that it's probably going to look really good if you're in the US for some of these deals that I'm trying to get here but next up here we've got a custom PC they're saying it's i7 looking at the end description at saying it's an i7 2600 know what else is inside this PC so I'm taking a blind gamble where I know the only really good thing in it is a 2600 so we'll put in an offer of a hundred and twenty Aussie dollars and then simply go from there next up in the stack there's an i7 2670 op in a smooth offer 50 asean that because going forward for Sandy Bridge for me personally I'm only really interested in the i7 $2,600 for very similar prices as the i5 2400 for example the next up here is a motherboard a be 350 biostar now they said it was coupled with a 3500 X I believe this would have been the tech fast special that we also took a look at in a video so not a bad little motherboard especially if I can get it for $60 which is the offer I'm gonna throw down and then I can maybe get a 3600 coupled up with it and we've got a cheap budget at least for a really good performance for the dollar and speaking of a 3600 there's one right up here for sale we're gonna drop in an offer of 250 I thought 240 initially was a good price but then I realized how many other offers were down on this so I decided to up at 10 bucks then we've got a rx 588 gigabyte pretty good deal if especially we can get it for a hundred and forty Kazi which is the offer that we're going to drop down here for this card scrolling along we've got a GTX 980 Strix and four gigabyte they're saying it's in good condition so I'm going to throw down 100 and beyond that followed by a online 270 act where they're asking $50 and this is a pretty good price already at this point but I'm gonna come in $40 see if they take that because it's also the Zeus model pretty decent card especially for 1080p low gaming even in 2020 and here we have a 20 atti has a gaming extra oh this is one of the better 2080 TI's out there at the moment so we're gonna drop in an offer of 1400 AUD and see if they take that then last up on gumtree we've found ourselves keyboards and mice and they've just got bundled in the ad they're saying they've got so much more stuff available there a computer clearance center so we're gonna give these guys a call and see if they have any maybe second third or fourth gen OMS in stock and if so what could we get but we'll give them a call after we call up less next up here we're moving over to Facebook marketplace then next up we've got an i7 4790 and 16 gig of ram so I mean let's just see if they will take 130 cache pickup because 16 gigabytes of ram is always a nice shabby add-on there with that CPU and it being a hot CPU the next time people got a 90 X 27 supe and will drop in an offer of 650 cash pickup see if they take that and then the last of the deals here is a 650 watt an tech power supply I'll just get an offer in 20 cash pick up because again use power supply I can get brand-new ons for 49 with all black cabling so I think that's a fair offer so we've now put out all those offers and all those feelers and we'll wait for some responses and see what they say so there was a few deals off the sale but I'm noticing a lot of the deals that I'm bidding on have come up only recently so it looks like there is a lot of demand not just for gaming PC's as we've pointed out in yesterday's video but also there is a lot of demand for used parts themselves so what we're gonna do now is give laser call and then we'll give that other number a call that had all the keyboards and see what comes out of it hey les how you go mate it's a it's that time of the month mate what yeah yeah oh good right well kind of I mean as good as can be in this isolation and yeah yeah a chick not at the moment man I've only got used PC parts with me I guess that's as good as a chick yeah that's just just as good you know having use PC parts around here I'm dead so I'll be I'll be heading to brizzy probably the next couple hours are you open the open shop today would you have any just the usual banger crap that I get sounds good to me man I mean nothing's really happening traffic's pretty free today so I proved you about two hours like I'll start heading in the next day I just gotta cuz I'm putting in a heap of offers on all these other stuff on gumtree and Facebook so you just gotta wait for people to get back to you and then you know I can plan out the trip but yeah stop through yours first and then oh you're goin out soon yeah preview at 1:00 yeah 1:32 or something like that alright cool and although I see that made but how's things been anyway so we got some good news there it looks like Liz will have a few parts for us to at least look around and see what we can bargain with so I always enjoy that especially when I don't know what I'm getting on the phone because last time we rocked up we did get a few cool and different kind of deals the mobile service you have cold is currently unavailable please try again later so unfortunately looks like they're closed for the weekend so we'll actually try and see if there's a different number because I did see another ad I believe for the same kind of place but they might be open who knows so it looks like that place is unfortunately closed over the weekend so it looks like we'd have to jump in the yes 'mobile pretty soon and go up and see les [Music] so the first deal we ended up getting was just around the corner from me that was the a 747 90 from Facebook with the 16 of us of RAM I initially offered 130 then they said they also had an i5 4th gen and also a power supply 550 watt and they said they wanted 170 for all that and I said sure thing I'll come pick that up and then when I got there I didn't have any change to get the extra $20 so they ended up just saying look 150 s fine for all that so our first deal ended up being an absolute score but now let's get on to lasers place and then see what he's got for us but also another thing too is the RT X 2070 super got back to us so 650 s fine for that and the r9 270x they're taking the $40 - so looks like we've got some good deals already and also you can see here around tackier City we value safety first even when parts hunting [Music] [Music] so we just finished up at Leslie's place and we picked up a heap of stuff some pretty good deals I'll show you guys everything we got when we get back to the studio and from here on in I'm gonna go get a 20 70 super because that's on the way home but I did win this $20 power supply and also that r9 270x and I checked on Google Maps where I've got to go to get those parts and it's just way too far out of my way so I'm gonna have to message the people and tell them sorry I can't pick this stuff up but I might ask him if they can post it for cheap because once I add up all the time and the gas that's spent getting some of these deals they're just not worth it which is something you have to consider I mean usually if it's like 10 minutes away or 15 minutes away but these are like over 40 minutes like in a triangle so I'm really gonna be spending another two hours on the road just to get sixty dollars of parts [Music] so we just got back to the tech yeah studio we ended up picking this up on the way home that's an RT X 2070 super we got this for 650 Aussie not the best deal I know that but still a decent deal considering it's only been used for a month that even came with the original receipt and it's got the original warranty one thing as well if you're picking up a used graphics cards always make sure if you're getting the box make sure the GPU that you're getting is inside because someone down south australia they messaged me telling me that it got hosed because they didn't check what was inside the box one time so really always check what's inside the box when you pick up a graphics card or any pc part for that matter the this was a pretty important one for me right here was hard drives I pretty much ran out and we got 6 1 terabytes for 150 off letters and then 2 2 terabytes for 70 he also threw in an additional 1 terabyte with one of the builds which we'll get onto later and also threw in a 500 gigabyte with another one of the bills that I bought just cuz I wanted to sweeten up the deals because he had this I 5 650 but we'll talk about it soon because the biggest lie in tech history is the i5 650 which is not even an i5 it's a dual core but this deal right here right beside that is really sweet to me because we got a power supply and I besides just giving it an alcohol wipe to sterilize it and also I had to pretty much wipe all this stuff down so it did take me quite a while and that's just cuz and it's just that time where you have to do it and so this one didn't really come with any extra cables so it's not a problem because what you can do and one really good thing about this is it's actually got the pin out which is really handy so I don't even have to pull out the voltmeter if I have other connectors I can just reroute them easy because I know what the pin outs gonna be like so that was a pretty sweet deal of course we gotta give that some tech s love and really make it look like brand new then we've got 16 gigabytes of ddr3 I 544 40 and an i7 4790 all that for 150 Aussie dollars I was really happy with that deal and then let's also have a twelve hundred and fifty watt power supply hanging around and it's non modular so this thing amen this is going to need a full sized case to just even fit all those cables in I've never seen so many cables in my life on a single power supply although it looks like a really good unit the problem is it needs one of those really massive kettle cables not your standard kettle cable it needs the Superman kettle so I don't actually have one of them on hand at the moment and neither did less but he said the person who sold it to him did show it working with the power supply tester so that's some good news and they're moving over here we got some monitors and then first up here we've got the 19 inch Dell which let Schacht in with the whole deal and also some keyboards and mice because I always always ask for more when you when you're doing a big deal so that was pretty cool to get that and I actually really like these monitors as secondary monitors I think they're really cool if you've got your main monitor set up and you just want something else just up there to have say discord or something these really do a good job and people pretty much just give them away like less did for that though besides that we've got the Zeus 24-inch monitors now I did have to pay a little bit more than I'm used to paying for these but there are these Oost models and people do love a zoo stuff if you guys have sold gaming pcs people always ask for strict stuff Zeus stuff so the fact that they are a Zeus monitors I mean even though like HP and Dell monitors this caliber are pretty much the same thing people see that as OOOs logo and they start doing jumping jacks so we got two of those 455 each so 110 total and then over here this is where the Grand Prizes of this parts on and these are the rigs which lasers already tested for us so I don't have to bother retesting them but this one here was the first one this was just a motherboard and I said are you doing anything with this and he said no you can have it for 20 bucks so a motherboard and cooler is always a good thing especially since it's like u87 I can really put that to use since I'm actually really dry for our fourth gen boards at the moment and then besides that we've got this PC right here which originally had an i-5 650 and it will still does and so let's check in an i5 750 and also a hard drive and that bumped the price up a bit it's also got four gigabytes of ddr3 memory and some random graphics card and a power man power supply you've got to love the good old power man we've had this on the channel a couple of times and honestly I've never come into a problem with the power man power place so I guess they are pretty decent they're moving through the list of pcs we've got the infamous ace of varitone 4th gen these are really good if you want to repurpose them into a bigger and better case with RGB bling all's they need is a adapter to connect to the standard 24 pins so I've actually got to feel those on hand this one has an i-5 in it and a gigabytes of RAM and also have to do is change that over to an i7 add another a gigabytes of RAM put in something like a 1650 subha and we've got ourselves a pretty hefty gaming PC though out the top here is another eye 5 750 rig this is the one we paid 80 Aussie dollars for and less chucked in a one terabyte hard drive to sweeten up the deal because I said dude first gen i-5 really isn't worth a whole lot but it had a pretty good power supply in it so I was pretty happy with that once I saw that power supply so c600 what that's modular I'll take that and also the RAM motherboard and stuff like that it's all pretty decent so that deal checked out especially with a one Tara thrown in though in the middle here I thought I'd save the best till last because this was the most interesting at least for me personally out of all the deals here where Liz was originally asking 350 for this HP desktop and now it's got a Xeon in it it's a 4th gen and it's a 1270 v3 so pretty much similar to an i7 4770k Vitt exactly checked what it would match but it has a 256 gigabyte SSD in it and also had 6 thing gigabytes of RAM originally so I bumped LEDs down to 300 initially which he said he was happy with but then I was like damn 300 still like I'm I'm pushing into my margins here because one thing is you don't really want to repurpose these desktops because of all the power switches and unique proprietary connectors that they've got on them if you don't have to and so I ended up getting this down to 230 Ozzy and that's because he took out the 16 gigabytes of RAM now if you guys saw the recent 12 core Xeon video I did I talked about how I got ECC ddr3 registered memory for very cheap so I'm gonna be putting 32 gigabytes of ECC registered memory in this and I want to see if this board and this CPU will take it because sometimes the motherboards won't actually take it even though the Xeon I know that's good for it if it takes it then I'll have a really good value proposition so what I'm gonna do right now is I'll tally up the prices of everything we paid for you guys hit it and in the deals aren't so far so I think it's telling up to 16 hundred and 50 Aussie dollars and we've got a heap of good parts in this deal so do let us know in the comments what your favorite deal is of the parts aren't so far but what I'm really curious to do right now is see if it takes that memory and I want to take that SSD out put a 120 gigabyte in one terabyte in and also gtx 1060 and see if this thing boots up and then I've got an easy flip Liz please stop putting tissues on motherboard pins you're sincerely everybody [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we've finished off this PC right here but we do have to give it some tacky ass touch-up and that is just changing the thermal paste on the CPU and of course just wiping it down given it that multi-purpose spray brand-new fresh look though we did come into a pretty like a bit of an annoying problem that is the ECC registered memory did not work on this board so I can't get the 32 gigabyte play happening I mean if that worked I would have been like yeah let's get the 64 gigabyte play happening and we could have advertised a 64 gigabyte RAM gaming PC and yeah I just had this play in my head sorted out like in the ad I could say 64 gigabytes of RAM while the competitors only putting in a measly 32 gigabytes of RAM and that would have went down so well but it wasn't meant to be with this PC unfortunately so we've just got 16 gigabytes of ddr3 in here just the standard unbuffered stuff or should I say just a measly 16 gigabytes of ddr3 though let's try and find some more deals on good old gam tree and Facebook even though it's a little bit late but if I do get them from here on in I believe I will have to maybe get the stuff posted because I gotta talk to some of the other guys that I missed out on today as well see if they'll post this stuff because Australia from I think tomorrow the Prime Minister is suggested that you can only go out and meet one other person which I mean I've really only been doing that already with the parts on bud so in situations like these you can really only do one thing and that is be a law-abiding tech yes citizen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so coming off the marketplace we actually found some pretty good deals there was a risin 7 1700 X and now put an offer of 120 but they came back and said thou firm on 150 and I'm thinking to myself yeah 150 is a fair price and I do like the I think it's the Wraith spire LED cooler which was only released on the 1700 X I do actually like that cooler so if I can hopefully get the guy to respond to me then I'll go pick that up when I get the chance I'm thinking it'll probably be tomorrow but I also found on Marketplace 7 one terabyte hard drives and they're just around the corner from my friend so he said it was gonna go pick them up for me and I've just PayPal the guy the money already so that is a good gun deal and then I decided to check a bay as well and I found 120 gigabyte m2 so I snapped all of them up for $25 a pop because I'm gonna start needing some storage because I'm running really low on that and the funny thing about storage is it's really tedious to go by one drive at a time and usually people ask a little bit more than people just bulk selling hard drives and SSDs for example so yours gonna get a better price if you do bulk buy hard drives and SSDs that's at least what I've found from the years of doing this gig anyhow it's gonna have a hard time with you guys right now but it's getting a bit late so I'll probably get some rest and wake up early in the morning and see what deals we've still got out on the table because there was some open-ended questions and feelers out there that people didn't get back to me on so I want to see if they respond to all that and also if that rise in 7 1700 X gets back to us and then I can give you guys a final tally and then we can talk tech though what it's looking so far is I came into this month thinking it was going to be a drought and I'm surprised it's pretty solid like it's been a solid effort this month so far where we've got some pretty good deals so I'm pretty happy about that given the current situation there that being said we're still gonna be safe and hygienic I do not fear this pot it's still [Music] we get that on the lens don't worry this parts hunts not finished yet and here we are now with the next deal that came in in the next morning my friend dropped around these before he went to work that was 7 1 terabyte hard drives and so we got them for 140 which now brings the whole total for this deals hunt up to 1790 so we've got some pretty good deals so far but the Rison 770 100x guy never got back to us the GTX 980 guy we originally did in the yesterday's when we were inquiring about the ads they never got back to us as well as the risin 530 600 so I guess some people just list stuff on gumtree and they don't check the ads that often so maybe we'll still get those deals maybe not who knows but there was also the 20 atti that got sold already so it must have sold that before they even saw my offer and then there was the 2600 case system that we put an offer in they actually just said they wanted a higher price and I mean they're guessing they're hoping to get close to their $220 but as we saw with the deal we got from layers that was a fourth gen seein which is much better than a second gen i7 and that just had an SSD everything so better specs I know what I'm getting there as opposed to this PC I don't know what I'm in for with that Foxconn motherboard so basically I decided to let that one sit and there was also that i7 custom PC which I think sold because the listings no longer available they wanted a hundred and fifty ozzie for it but again you only know that you're getting an i7 twenty six hundred you could be getting a dud motherboard that doesn't support any newer GPUs could have practically no RAM really crappy hard drive really crabby Powers boy and the case didn't look that good as well so that's the gamble you risk when you don't get any of the details in the ad that being said this mods part Hunt has been really good it's mainly thanks to les who always comes through as a regular hookup here on the channel and this month has come more than ever in a time of need so big thanks to les for making this parts hunt juicy and with that aside do let us know in the comment section below what was your favorite deal in today's whole love rating your thoughts and opinions as always but we'll take a quick moment to I guess talk about the outlook now going in because it seems to me like this is a global thing in that pretty much a lot of countries are getting locked down like we are in Australia here and I mean YouTube's made their stance clear on this and this is our career I guess we've we can't really do anything about it otherwise we risk just not being around on YouTube anymore but one thing to come out of it all is do stay safe and do take precautions like we did here on the channel where I putting on gloves and a mask when I go outside even when I'm meeting my friends I'm wearing gloves now so you just got to take the necessary precautions because I don't want any of my family members especially dad man or my mum to get this virus that would be the last thing but that aside what's the stock prognosis looking like because it's starting to but I'm starting to hear news now about even the local use parts dealers they've had to stop work due to their all the restrictions in place so they're running out of stock they're not able to get their regular stock in so it looks like it's both the new and used parts markets are both going to be hit equally as bad so this is a shortage that's going to come into effect and I'm seeing personally like I said I've seen demand being ramped up as well and that can only mean one thing really at least in Australia where I'm at and that's higher prices for tech so I will say it again and that is if you do have the intention of building a gaming PC soon then it's better to do it now than later because the risk of those parts going to a higher price is a lot higher than the price is coming down and I've even got a supplier in China who's messaged me and literally the prices of SSDs and RAM and stuff like that it's doubled at least four Z's anyway hope you guys enjoyed this used pot song of the month of March 2020 if you did then be sure to hit that like and we've got the question of the day here which comes from Ken Wong and they ask if you use the solder to 6-pin adapter how will the GPU perform given the law of power from the sadiq cable it's basically this using that side of the six pin I would only recommend it for low powered GPUs or GPUs that don't use a lot of power so the 1650s super is one of those GPUs it only uses a little bit more than that 75 watt requirement from the PCIe bracket itself and so it doesn't need a lot of juice though one thing with this side of the six pin is don't go using it on high powered GPUs even something like an rx 588 gigabyte which has an eight pin requirement you can still actually power that off a six pin by itself something like that will most likely melt the cable because there's just simply too much power going through those wires and then they get really hot and then they melt so that's the risky run if you do couple those solder to six pin adapters with the wrong GPUs so in this case I would only recommend them for things like gtx 960 SRX 4 60s and in this case of gtx 1650 super where your power supply is still like decent enough to run those GPUs but the power requirement of the GPU itself is just a little bit above that 75 watt no 6 pin requirement I hope that answers that question and if you guys have stayed this far and you're enjoying that content then you know what to do sub buttons down there ring that bell to get the videos as soon as they drop and also stay tuned for tomorrow's video we're gonna be doing a giveaway and we're gonna get all the sponsors on board there's gonna be a pretty big giveaway and I'm gonna bring to you guys so hopefully we can make some goodness out of these bad times and I'll catch you in the next one peace out for now but [Music]
