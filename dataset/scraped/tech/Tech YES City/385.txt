so on the desk here we have a meta box
laptop and I got this in today as a trade-in on a system that I sold and the
value I placed on this when the guy wanted to get rid of it was 200 Aussie
dollars now this has a gtx 1070 in it and it's also got an i7 6700 HQ but the
problem with it is that when it's on battery it works absolutely fine, but as
soon as you plug in the AC adapter it then starts to either reset or switch
off and so what I'm gonna try and do is replicate this problem right now and see
what's actually going on in front of my own two eyes because basically when he
came over and he showed me the problem it was just starting up and I couldn't
really get a proper glimpse of things but basically the history of this laptop
was is that he bought it initially for $900 dollars and then it worked fine for
three months but then when he was playing call of duty warzone it started
to crash and the crashes became more frequent to the point where he had no
idea what was going on with this laptop and of course being the situation that
we're pretty much all in and around the world at the moment he just wants to
play games and basically when it comes to laptops I still really have no idea
what they're worth or how much they cost to fix where I put the worst case
scenario down as the motherboard could be faulty or the GPUs faulty and that
would cost me a lot of money to fix hence why I traded in for $200 dollars
because that is the worst case scenario that I would be able to get my money
back on at least with that value so anyhow this thing I'm looking at it
already and the drivers here from 2017 so that's already one big problem I can
see another problem here is that it's got a hundred gigabytes of SSD storage
just completely unallocated so it looks like it's got a 500 gigabyte SSD in it
that I'd have no idea why this is just 100 gigabytes sitting around there and
we go here Windows is activated it's got all the specs there 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory everything's looking great it except those two things so what I'm
going to do now first and foremost is just quite simply reinstall the OS and
also take this thing apart make sure the thermal paste is fine everything's
intact and the temperatures are fine but before I do that I'll also quickly plug
in the AC adapter and run some stress tests just to see what the temperatures
are like now and just to see if I can actually get it to switch off like the
guy was saying people like to laugh with me for this kind of stuff [Music] so now we've been stress testing this
CPU for over ten minutes and the temperatures are getting pretty hot
especially on core one which could indicate that we do need to change over
the thermal paste but for what it's worth laptops do usually run pretty hot
anyhow this thing is getting moderately loud I have heard laptops get a lot
louder though for what it's worth it's showing here it's using up thirty-eight
watts so it's pretty powerful but the CPU is micro throttling there we can see
with this overheating detected so basically it means that we've got to
change the thermal base but I haven't seen it crashed just yet so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to change over to unity in heaven now and put it on low
settings on low resolution to not only try and stress the graphics card but
also stress the CPU at the same time so we just loaded up UniGene heaven and as
soon as we did that we will almost instantly met with a black screen and
now the system has restarted so the problem is definitely to do with either
the GPU itself or it just can't get enough power so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna quickly install afterburner on this system and then pretty much down
clock the GPU on both the core clock the power limit and the memory and then run
this test again and see if it works so going through some further tests with
this laptop it's clear to see that the GPU is having some sort of issues and
what we saw was not only did it drop out after the heav'n benchmark but it also
dropped out after we installed the latest drivers and I tried loading up
afterburner and changing the core clock speeds and the system would just go one
color even when I try to drop it down fifteen megahertz then I tried dropping
the memory speeds down individually just by itself and that's sort of bugged out
where it just went plus to some insane value and then I tried changing it and
just basically ended up setting it to default so it doesn't like to
communicate with MSI Afterburner that well and still in the latest drivers did
not help so we're gonna pull this thing apart right now and see if something's
wrong that's visibly wrong with the hardware we're gonna try to give it some
tag guest loving and then give it a reboot so pulling the laptop apart I can
see that this thermal paste is really sloppy we definitely need to clean up
this GPU right here and then put some new thermal paste on that could even be
the problem in itself where if this is even capacitive this thermal paste that
could be causing the instant cut out when the benchmark is loaded I wouldn't
say it would be the fans because we heard the fans ramping up before and
even if one of the fans has failed it would take like a good thirty seconds
for this to overheat and switch off where it's switching off instantly and
it's even switching off when we try to change things like the core clock so
what we're gonna do now is of course clean this all up and then put it back
together and see if that fixes it but also just go over this laptop with a
fine-tooth comb and see if anything else stands out
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music] so here we are now at the next day we've
given this some tech yes loving temperatures are looking a little bit
better but the problem is it's still like after I've reinstalled everything
it still does cut out after that running that heaven benchmark and I've also
managed to find the cleveo app where we've managed to down clock the GPU and
also down clock the memory to as low as it can go and this is the weird thing
I'll show you right now it I can get it to actually work properly and it's a
weird fix where I go to the Nvidia control panel and then I change to
integrated graphics the Intel HD graphics run the benchmark close it down
then I change it back to auto select and then I run it and it then works after
that so it's looking to me like either something is damaged on this laptop like
a little chip that connects the GPU and the CPU or it needs a new v bios where
it's just not as efficient as it used to be so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
actually gonna flash a gtx 1070 max cube bios onto this laptop and see what the
results are like [Music]
[Applause] [Music] so now we have a meta box laptop that we
picked up for 200 Aussie dollars and it's working absolutely fine
nothing is now faulty it now runs due maternal runs f1 2019 and it ran those
games for quite a while and the temperatures are okay on the CPU and the
GPU but to get here it was a string of events that I consider very lucky and
we'll talk about the string of events the first being the env flash tool now I
went onto Reddit and there was thankfully someone who had left up an
older version of env flash and it was only one of these versions that enabled
me to force flash a different bias on to this laptops gtx 1070 and that was the
5.1 for so big thanks to vipre and also the guy on reddit that uploaded this and
made this env flash version to begin with so after that we then went on to
tak power up and bless the tech power up for having this v bios database because
someone uploaded an unverified cleveo gtx 1070 bios with the same file size as
this meta box right here and basically the meta box is a I guess of rebrand of
a cleaver laptop which I think cleveo our big laptop manufacturer in Taiwan so
we then got that gtx 1070 bios we downloaded it I then tried false
flashing it numerous times and it was right at the last time I was like look
I'll just try this on this different version of env flash and sure enough it
then forced flashed and we restarted and it ended up working and the funniest
thing is we just had nothing to lose so I tried everything I could to get it
working and of course trial and error in today's video ended up prevailing with
the Big W though what if this laptop didn't work after that V BIOS flash well
this comes down to me just then putting it up as an office PC and turning it on
integrated graphics and disabling the gtx 1070 because i would have still got
my money back as a just a 15.6 IPS laptop ddr4 i7 6700 HQ that would have
easily been worth what I traded it in for so that was sort of like my retainer
I really had nothing to lose except my time when I tried taking the gamble on
this laptop but it paid off big time with those three steps but you're
probably wondering now this TDR video failure blue screen what's going on
there because I read up on forums that people were having these problems not
with just with meta box laptops but other laptops out there so you're
probably wondering what is the exact issue now I can only really hazard a
guess as to what exactly is going on with this laptop and that comes down to
this feature in the BIOS I feel it's called GPU performance scaling now what
this does is if your CPUs not using a hundred percent and the GPU is using a
hundred percent it can then essentially borrow that TDP budget that's not being
used or that what's that isn't being used by the CPU and then transfer it
over to the GPU essentially over volting the graphics card to get more
performance while your CB is not using up much performance and what happens in
this process is I feel is that there's a chip for that that enables that to
happen and on this particular laptop I feel like that chip has become faulty
and it's just cutting out so by me flashing it to a different gtx 1070
cleveo bias that maybe doesn't support this technology I was then able to get
the gtx 1070 working absolutely fine again
so if you do see this error on a laptop in the future then you may wish to
consider flashing the vblast but the problem is you've got to then rely on
lock to see if someone's uploaded a different V bus for your gtx 1070 on
your laptop or whatever grabs card for your laptop is on to the tech power up
website so I was really fortunate and really lucky that someone did that and
it ended up working because basically it said the PC a subsystem ID was different
to the gtx 1070 i had on board here and so basically that ended up fixing this
laptop where the performance was impressive the noise wasn't that loud at
all in the keyboard and everything else checks out the build quality is actually
quite good on this box right here to begin with
now the gtx 1070 that's actually got more cout
cause then the desktop very nice just clocked lower and then of course there's
the max-q variant which is even clock slower than this gtx 1070 in this laptop
here so I will give kudos to this particular 1070 it's not a bad version
or bad variant it actually can get up and go
especially at 1080p even in something like doom eternal on Ultra settings
we're getting some really good fps numbers so I'm really impressed at what
this thing can do but one thing I will point out is there's only a single ddr4
16 gigabyte stick in there I'd like it to be 2 sticks to get that dual channel
so perhaps I'll upgrade this laptop and make it 32 gigabytes of ddr4 who knows
but for what it's worth we've now got this thing up and running it is working
absolutely fine and I've got to say this is probably one of the best scores I've
gotten in the history of the channel where this thing here is traded in for
$200 dollars we just gave some tacky as loving applied some new thermal paste
and here it is at Tech yes City going through the steps the trial and error
with that motto that is if you've got nothing to lose you've got nothing to
lose so do let us know in the comments section below what you think of this
deal right here I believe personally I think this thing would be worth in its
current state in Australia in the current situation going on right now
around about 1100 Aussie dollars that's what I feel something like this would go
for so that's a big win on my part getting this thing to work again to a
hundred percent of course love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and
speaking of thoughts and opinions we've got the question of the day from 60
schastye and they asked do these apply to AMD based components as well and they
referred to yesterday's video put the link up here where we talked about one
of the tuneups you can do using the inspector program on Intel CPUs now I've
tried inspector on AMD CPUs both old and both Rison in the past and it doesn't
give any performance boosts in fact it can be a slight by 1 to 2 percent
detriment to performance if you do disable the spectra and meltdown updates
on the CPUs well I think it's actually you can only disable one of them because
Rison at least is immune to the other vulnerability so if you're on an
MDC PU you don't have to worry about using inspector it's not going to really
make any difference whatsoever and with that aside I hope you guys enjoyed
