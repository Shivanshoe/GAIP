recently here at Tech yes city we did a build involving this CPU right here the i9 9900 t where the purpose of that bill was to get one of these CPUs which admittedly it is pretty cheap for an i-9 CPU coming in at two hundred and fifteen dollars shipped worldwide and so I utilize that I nine branding to make something that really came together for a decent price point if you haven't seen that build I'll put the link up here and to be honest the feedback after that is some pretty good news I pretty much listed that build and it lasted up for about ten minutes before it instantly like sold someone just snapped it up and I was just scratching my head like wow the power of these I nines it can work if done right so first things first with this CPU if you're looking for something just for the name then this is definitely going to have it but the reason I didn't do this video sooner was because I feel like it's not the best value for money for gamers out there and if you've recently seen my $20 e on the x99 video we took a look at put the link up here for that they are coming in those x99 Zeon's are the ones that are going to be for those people who are looking for pure price performance though this right here let's look at what this exotic is all about who it's gonna benefit and of course how it performs against popular counterparts like the Rison v 2600 risin 530 600 which come in a lot cheaper than this and of course it's big brother than ninety nine hundred KS which clocks all the way to five gigahertz all-cause and of course uses a lot more power that before we get into the video one thing I will say with this CPU was I can't really find it anywhere for sale on retail shelves that is the retail version until have it listed on their website at currently plus 400 USD so getting this thing for two hundred and fifteen dollars even though it's an engineering sample did surprise me quite a bit though that being said you're probably wondering are these engineering samples going to affect the final outcome of these chips and I don't have a retail sample to compare it to but I've tried it against three different motherboards around here at the tackiest studio and it's all worked first go as soon as I've popped it in these motherboards they've worked absolutely fine whether they're an 8 series or a 9 series motherboard and the funny thing about these engineering samples right here was that they'll manufactured back in early 2018 and this one right here it also supports thirty six hundred megahertz XMP profile on memory out of the box which I was curious to test so basically what I'm trying to say is though this thing works and it works quite well even though it has a base clock of 1.7 gigahertz I found in all my testing here it clocked up to three point three gigahertz in games then in stress test it went down to three point two gigahertz and the single core boost allowed this CPU to turbo all the way up to three point eight gigahertz so that one point seven gigahertz printed on the CPU that's nothing to sweat about when it comes to real world operations though one thing I did run into that was something to be a little bit worried about was if you're trying to manually tune this CPU in terms of the CPU ratio as well as it's a cache ratio then I'd recommend just leaving them on default and only locking in your XMP profiles because when I try to play around with a CPU manually it actually did down clock the CPU to 1.7 gigahertz all core and this was both on an h3 10 motherboard and in as Roxy 390 anyway let the benchmark numbers roll and then we'll get on with a conclusion with the 9900 to [Music] so starting off these numbers this time around we are using an RT x 2080 TI and we were using 3200 mega @co 14 timings though one thing i will say with the risin v 2600 in today's comparison was it was a retail sample I recently got off the shelves and the memory only went up to 3000 66 megahertz that's the best I could get this CPU to so the numbers may be a little bit lower than what you used to before it's worth it's still gonna be running fine with it's all core out of the boost which went to around three point seven five gigahertz all core anyway rolling those numbers Assassin's Creed syndicate you guys asked me to test out a few different titles on Ubisoft that stressed single core performance more than it does multi core so I've included a few of those this being the first and we can see here that the Rison 5 3600 is doing the best in terms of price performance the 9900 t isn't doing that bad at all in the 9900 chaos coming out on top so this is on high settings as well 1080p then we move over to Far Cry New Dawn and we've got here a scenario where the 2600 is coming close to the 9900 T so this is raw single core boost in this game and we see the 9900 T's basically trading blows with the 2600 3600 is coming out on top and then the 99 hundred KS getting a massive gain over the 900 T so even though the single core boost can go up as high as three point eight gigahertz unfortunately when you get slight loads which is what fire Crichton new dawn does on other cause it will drop it down to three point three gigahertz which is what we saw in this game and why the 9900 T didn't do as well as I guess it could have done in some of the other titles here but now moving over to fortnight's showed the 9900 T came in with the L here scoring 248 average FPS versus 252 on the 2600 then the 3600 getting a sizable boost over that than the 99 hundred KS coming out on top though when we look at those numbers for what they're worth I'd say it's not really a loss for any of these CPUs since they can all play on 240 Hertz monitors absolutely fine which I'm guessing a lot of competitive players will want to do and even then we're testing out on high settings so we could drop these to low settings and get even better numbers and we've a shadow of the Tomb Raider showed the 9900 T's scoring in with a very similar number to the 3600 despite the 3600 having less cause and less threads and we know this game does like to utilize all those calls and threads available as witness with some other benchmarks on higher core count models CB used in the 2600 this was the worst result for the CPU out of all the games I tested here today scoring significantly lower than both the 900 T and the 3600 in this benchmark however escape from tarkov showed that the 3600 was right up there with the 9900 KS basically trying to break through that cap limit of 120 fps and scoring 121 average the 900 T coming in with a hundred and twelve and then that was baiting the rosin 5 2600 then the last idle we've got up here is F 1 2019 high settings and what was kind of like starting to make me scratch my head was I did check the FPS limit in this game and it does have 250 so I'm quite surprised that the 1900 KS is getting 259 average FPS the first time I've actually seen this happen in a game though if what it's worth all the other CPUs scored some really solid numbers in this game nothing to sweat about and finally moving on to the Cinebench are 20 numbers and then followed by the power consumption numbers we can see here that the 3600 in my opinion did the best out of these numbers getting a really solid single core and multi-threaded performance number especially for its price and then the 900 T did do pretty well but it was still falling behind that of the 3600 in both malty and singled the 2600 was falling behind the 1900 T but that's got two less cores for less threads just like the 3600 and so I guess it's score is decent on the 900 T if you want to use this as a workstation or for video editing this is a pretty good number to get a realistic idea on how the CPU will perform especially couple in with this next slide here the power consumption numbers which is I feel the biggest benefit of this CPU this engineering sample that we've got in today's scoring just over 50 watts on a full stress test it really shows you where Intel sweet spot is on 14 nanometer despite them taking their CPUs all the way to 5 gigahertz the 9 100 T did oppressively well with its power consumption results and if anything coupled with the i9 name on this CPU these are the two reasons I like the CPU but I don't love it and basically if you're going to go for a mini ITX solution all you really want to get that I know and branding and pretty much cheap out on a motherboard get a budget CPU cooler than the 9900 T with that low power consumption figures that you just saw will enable you to do that so basically now recommendations for the 9900 t if you're a desktop enthusiast and you want to go this route I would argue that the horizon 5 3600 is going to be a better purchase both in terms of the motherboard upgrade path as well as the CPUs role performance both in games and in productivity I'd say the 900 T however of course does have that benefit of going pretty well in a Mini ITX rig as we said before or of course if you want to pop this CPU in a gaming PC and then maximize the bling on that ad and the last thing I'm going to say about this CPU is I haven't been too crazy about it mainly because I knew the x99 Zeon's which I'm covering heavily this month I know they're better buy for a lot of you guys out there who are looking for that pure price performance sweet spot so of course this does have its merits it's just not up there I feel for people who want to get the most for their money especially when you can get those x99 boards with cheap memory couple it in quad-channel whereas this only has dual channel and you can get the CPUs and much cheaper there going to be a price performance champion so I've still got to cover the eight core which I'll be comparing to this in an upcoming comparison as well as the 12 core so do stay tuned for those videos of course do let us know in the comments section below what you think about this 215 dollar engineering sample from Aliexpress love reading your comments as always and speaking of a comment which turns into the question of the we've got this from Nicolas Vidal and they asked does this method work with the xeon e5 26 89 x 79 they're referring to our v3 full unlock tutorial which you will need to do in order to extract the most out of the X 99 Zeon's that I'm covering here on the channel so basically this tutorial only applies to those Haswell X 99 Zeon's the v3 specifically the 26 89 is actually what would be considered a v1 so it's a different generation which didn't carry this exploit unfortunately so you pretty much left with what speeds this CPU will perform with out of the box though that being said you may be able to get a little bit more extra performance if your motherboard supports a big clock or host clock overclocking where you can take that from 100 megahertz to say 103 megahertz and extract a little bit more performance out of that CPU anyway guys hope you enjoyed this video or it's helped you out and if it has done either of the two I'd appreciate you hitting that like button for us and without a side I'll catch you in another tech video very soon so stay tuned for the 8th called Z on which we'll be featuring very shortly peace out for now bye [Music] you
