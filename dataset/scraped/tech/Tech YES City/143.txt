so recently i got asked this question hiya brian 
i need your advice i got money to burn at the   moment and i'm wondering if it's a good time to 
move on from my vegas 64 and jump on the 3080   ti damn thing is about 2 000 plus you think 
my 64 still has life in it by the way grass   on 500k subs and this is coming from a long-term 
subscriber he's actually one of the original 300   subscribers here at tech year city that was back 
when my channel was called a different name and   basically with the vega 64. in today's video we're 
going to be answering this question directly and   we're going to be talking about why you shouldn't 
even fathom the idea of paying over double msrp   for a card that is already a very high margin 
product on nvidia's stack especially the 3080 ti   let's discuss hey there you apex legend mate get 
it right i'm a steel legend if you're after a   motherboard to support those 11th gen cpus in the 
azeroth legend h570 has you covered with an eight   phase power design 2.5 gigabits per second nick 
pcie 4.0 and base frequency boost to support those   max turbo states on any of the 11th gen cpus then 
this motherboard is certainly going to be for you   links in description below to find out more so at 
1199 usd suggested price from nvidia this card was   already considered by most and myself included 
a money grab from nvidia the expected price of   this card was considered to be coming in around 
a thousand dollars this is where i thought this   card would come in at my review and considering 
the 3090 was released earlier last year with   better performance and double the expensive gddr 
6x vram for 300 more it puts the 3080 ti in a very   weird spot now also coupled with the fact that 
miners aren't going to be targeting this card   anywhere near the likes that they would target 
say a 30 60 ti or a 30 70 and you have a card   that is simply overpriced for gamers and wait 
i think overpriced would be an understatement   massively overpriced is the correct term now 
who's doing all this over pricing well i've   noticed it's not just the scalpers that are to 
blame here i've started to notice that miners are   starting to become a little nervous which we'll 
talk about in a separate upcoming video though   the advice is going to tie in with this video and 
that is retailers are definitely starting to want   to put their hands in the proverbial cookie jar 
so to speak and not just the distributors now   they're basically hanging onto their cards for 
their dear life at high prices in hopes that the   unsuspecting gamer like manny for example with 
some of their hard-earned cash will eagerly want   to get ripped off and it is actually starting to 
show graphics cards are coming back into stock   the supply shortage is starting to become dictated 
by the price and hence we were at a month ago   at a crucial leveling for profitability with 
ethereum mining and now we're at a crucial point   for prices to start coming down to more realistic 
levels you think of my brass is coming down   brian this is unheard of let me explain this 
all boils down ultimately to one big factor   and that is cheap money we're starting to see the 
governments are starting to not hand out as much   free money as they were before at least not in 
australia and so when cheap money starts to become   less available well high prices start to abate and 
that is exactly what we're starting to see now so   where do we go from here well in manny's case he 
has already got a vega 64. and this is a graphics   card that is more than capable of playing games 
especially the latest games with good frame rates   so waiting in order to upgrade to the latest 3080 
ti would be highly recommended as prices have   reached a peak now especially for these higher 
end cards and the 3080ti is being sold for nearly   double the already overpriced msrp in australia 
these cards are going for 3 000 aussie dollars   when for example the 3080 was first released here 
they would go on for around 1300 and even then   that was considered over asking price back then 
though at least in the defense of the 3080 ti it   is still coming under that of a double msrp when 
i checked ebay completed listings the two thousand   one hundred dollar mark that these cards are being 
sold for represents about a seventy five percent   markup they have a little look at this when we 
look at the sales prices of the 30 60 tis for   example they are going for around eleven hundred 
dollars well over the 399 dollar price point   that they were suggested to come in at in fact 
that's roughly a 175 percent markup versus the   75 markup on the 3080 ti so this right here is the 
massive difference that miners add to the price of   cards chasing pure hash rate per watt that is 
profitability though as the profitability drops   so will the prices of even the mighty 3060 ti but 
what i'm going to recommend to manny going forward   might seem a little bit outlandish but it's going 
to be the tech yes take and i've been doing this   for years i've been getting the deals buying and 
selling doing my flips and it's something that   i'm going to be changing to personally i'm going 
to be switching gears into and that is i would   suggest to manny to sell his vega 64 for 700 to a 
miner and this is what i call the tech yes shuffle   knowing the market get yourself a 200 rx 474 
gig so you're not having any downtime gaming and   you'll now have 500 in your pocket and then once 
the gpu prices come back to more normal levels   you will now have yourself a much much cheaper rtx 
3080 ti in fact you could be even saving as much   as 1300 doing this when you think about it since 
the card should come back down to around twelve   hundred dollars in coming months and coupled with 
your five hundred dollars profit you can make now   this drop from around the two thousand one 
hundred dollar asking prices people are   asking for now could leave you in a much better 
position so this is simply how you juggle in the   tough market where people especially the miners 
they want graphics cards with six gigabytes vram   or more which means that if you're a gamer 
purely a gamer you're going to be getting   better value on cards that are four gigabytes and 
under and i think the rx 470 right now even though   it's overpriced it's still not as overpriced as 
some of these higher vram cars especially the ones   that can be used for mining like the vega 64. so 
since you've got a card that is being targeted by   ethereum miners i would honestly sell that get a 
card that's not being targeted by ethereum miners   and then once the price of ethereum goes down 
even more and the profitability sync even more   then you can come back in and buy that higher vram 
card that was previously once targeted by ethereum   miners so it might be weird you came here for a 
recommendation to upscale i'm recommending for   the time being to run lean and down scale 
and so it might seem counterintuitive it   might seem like you're part of the problem but 
you're actually becoming part of the solution   and that is driving out the dumb money from the 
miners that are willing to pay these higher prices   and now we're going to go on to the counter 
argument here because people are going to come   in and go well brian mining money's going to 
stay profitable forever prices of ethereum are   just going to keep going up and if that was the 
case then i don't think nvidia themselves or even   amd would even bother selling these cards to the 
public they'd just start producing them themselves   and putting them on mining benches and going hey 
what's the point of even selling these graphs   cards to the public we can just make so much 
money crypto mining and selling off the crypto   that we don't even have to bother selling these 
cards to the public but that's not the case   they're still selling the picks and the shovels 
just like in the gold rush the only people that   were making money were the people selling the 
picks and the shovels so if you've got the pick   and the shovel in this case the graphics card 
i would suggest selling it right now and then   just waiting until the gold rush is over and then 
you can buy your pick and shovel back for pennies   on the dollar but the next example i'm going to 
pull up for you guys is a scary reality about   how even some of these miners are coming into the 
market and they're losing money and we're seeing   the prices level out for these cards from last 
month we had the peak in cryptocurrency prices   we also had the peak in cryptocurrency mining 
profitability and that was at an all-time high so   here's where we saw the prices of the 6700 xt for 
example that went from a thousand and ninety nine   dollars already massively overpriced from its msrp 
up to twelve hundred and ninety nine dollars so   there was a few people who bought these cards at 
12.99 but we're going to pay particular attention   to someone here that bought five cards in this 
listing last month for 12.99 now if he had waited   a little bit longer he could have saved himself 
roughly 600 already just by waiting to buy the   cards now so they've gone up to 1299 now they've 
gone back down now to 1099 and he would have only   made 390 dollars profit from mining from those 
five cards in that time at least according to what   to mine so this leaves this particular late comer 
to mining in at a loss of 610 dollars currently   however if the prices of crypto start collapsing 
then we could see this effect start to accelerate   much quicker much sooner so in a nutshell i know 
you guys probably heard this before but this is   the time where i'm making content around it i'm 
just telling people just to hold out all the signs   are pointing towards pricing coming down and the 
sheer search interest in crypto is showing this as   well so actually a couple of months ago the first 
time in history the term crypto outpaced that of   gaming but now that's dropping down the trend of 
gaming is actually starting to go back up again   and crypto's starting to weigh off the general 
interest in crypto in other words is dropping   off and so with all this hysteria and fomo and 
elon musk pump tweets and the news just focused   on an elon musk tweet sending the crypto price up 
and down and doggy coins 420 tweets all that stuff   along with the price is starting to drop off and 
the most important thing to see with all this and   all the hype and hysteria is that the dumb money 
has already been all soaked up and once this money   is out it only leaves one type of money left 
in circulation and that is the smart money and   the smart money i'm going to tell you something 
about that it sure doesn't want to hand it over to   someone else smart money usually doesn't hand over 
smart money to someone at a grossly overpriced   level which is why i'm predicting prices will come 
down sooner even within the next couple of weeks   anyway guys i hope you enjoyed today's video if 
you did and be sure to hit that like button and   also let us know in the comments section below 
do you think the advice that i'm giving out here   for manny as a fellow pc gamer is good advice 
or not love reading those thoughts and opinions   as always and if you stayed this far and you're 
enjoying that tech yes content be sure to smash   that sub button ring that bell to get the videos 
as soon as they drop but with that aside we've   got the question of the day here and this comes 
from blob and they ask best buy in the usa sold   a 30-70 pre-build by cyberpower for 1599 plus tax 
is that a good price how does it compare to the   market in australia and if i'm comparing this to 
australia it depends on what else is in that pc   for instance if it's a 9400 f and it's got 
eight giga ram it might not be a good buy   but if for instance it's got a ryzen 7 3700 x or 
it's got an i7 10 700 f 16 gig or 32 gig of ram   good power supply ssd hard drive the whole works 
then it's actually a pretty solid price that's a   decent price for a 30 70 gaming build considering 
everything else matches up with that card in terms   of balance so if you were to get a 30 70 build for 
around 2 000 aussie dollars plus tax which would   be around 200 that would leave the build around 
2.2 000 for a 30 70 build which i haven't seen   for a very long time here in australia which 
means to me that that is a good price hope that   answers that question and i'll catch you guys in 
another tech video very soon peace out for now bye you
