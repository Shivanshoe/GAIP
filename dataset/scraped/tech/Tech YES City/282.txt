the end of september is nigh and that can only mean one thing and that is the used pc parts hunt of the month here at tech yes city now before we get into this month's part hunt i'm gonna tell you guys about my personal experience in the last month and that is that i've had a lot of success sort of under a thousand aussie dollars so the low end of the market and even to like the mid-range of the market is still kicking along it's still fine i think people in this price range aren't really holding out for a graphics card that at least with the rtx 3080 that's going to cost them a lot of money in oz at the moment i think people are trying to resell them for 2 000 just for an rtx 3080 so there is this bit of sort of despair that's come along with the launch of the 3080 and that's the supply problems but if you picked up an rtx 2080 super or a 2080i or a 2070 super last month when they were going pretty cheap i think you made a good call because at least you'll be out of game for a few months because all these problems will be solved in the next few months it's just a matter of time and with that of course i i'm even me i'm i'm a beta tester at the moment for nvidia going on their new graphics cards so there are a few problems with the rtx 3080 but in time i think they'll be ironed out and once they are ironed out the used market itself will then stabilize and we'll be able to find where prices are going exactly but in the meantime me personally coming into this month i'm just going to be hunting those uh sort of low end to mid-range parts because i'm just really not moving anything past the thousand aussie dollars like i'm sitting on builds for the longest that i've ever been sitting on even though i don't have any builds up for sale right now previously i think it took me like two weeks just to move one pc and i was like damn this is a really long time that was a 1080 ti build that i had up for sale i had to drop the price of that just to move it so things are really weird at the market in terms of pricing and what people are prepared to pay but i guess that weirdness can be explained by people are holding out for rtx 3000 series cards to come back into stock and on the flip side there's also a crunch in the economy as well so those two factors combined means that anything over a thousand dollars is going to be harder to move in my opinion than it ever was in the last few years but in the meantime what i'm going to do coming into this month i'm going to go back to my grass roots and this is where the fun is going to start i'm going to be looking for all those budget parts whether it's i5s even first gen ryzens i7s cheap ddr3 ddr4 power supplies cases you name it i need the whole lot of course if something higher end comes through at the right price i'll take it but my focus this month is budget parts because again i've been having just a lot of success as not just that too i've been having a lot of fun on this budget entry market so with that aside let's jump onto good old gametree and facebook marketplace and i hope you guys have been doing well wherever you are in the world let's have some fun and see what deals we can pull [Music] up so starting off with facebook marketplace here we've got three potential deals already where the people have replied and they've got some pretty good prices uh the first being two monitors they look like they're both 22 inches and at 25 aussie dollars i am okay with that considering i get them off less for 35 bucks if it's not too far of a drive for me i'll go and get these monitors then we've got some ddr4 memory where there's two different sets someone's got 16 gigabytes of ddr4 another person's got another 16 gig but in a 2x8 configuration and i'm just going to pay asking for both of these because they're very good prices for ddr4 memory where from retail you're going to pay double so i like the prices of both these there's also a ddr3 listing for 50 aussie dollars as well for 16 gigabytes which i messaged them waiting back to here but we've potentially got four but it looks like we're going to score three deals from facebook marketplace in terms of graphics cards and also cpus there really wasn't anything available i mean someone had a gtx 670 up for sale and they were saying well i want 75 bucks for this i offered them 40 bucks because again a 670 is very old and you if you don't have problems now with it it's got you know two years time probably gonna have some problems that go wrong in the next two years so the life frame of this 670 is really like pushing it even at 75 aussie and in terms of the other gpus out there i saw a 960 for sale but i tried to message the guy it was some error so you must have sold that already but the biggest thing with graphics cards right now is that i don't want to pay these overpriced prices on used gpus because there's rx 570s for sale for 169 aussie dollars brand new with the warranty so there's just no purpose buying these cards that even come close to this in price when they're used and you've got to go drive out to go get them and waste your gas waste your time so the used gpu market is still looking like it's a complete mess where i am locally but the good news is is that we've still got that alternative avenue to get some rx 570s especially we want to put together some good price performance rigs if we can pick up the other parts now moving over to good old game tree we've found here uh three different listings one being an r7260 one gigabyte they wanted 20 bucks i just said okay i'll give you 20 for this thing since it is just a little banger it'll go in a say for instance a minecraft pc or just something entry like cs go there is a market for these uh pcs believe it or not so 20 bucks that's really not going to add to the build cost at all but then next up we've got an i7 940 and this is 20 bucks but the thing is it says it comes with a main board and it's as is so i mean the x58 main board it's worth a gamble considering you're getting the i7 cpu for 20 bucks so i just put in the 20 asking on that one too so we'll see if they're good to go but now the last thing we're going to focus attention on here is an i7 4770 for 150 bucks now straight away my reaction is man this is overpriced for an old school i7 as well and the thing is though this is the going rate for these cpus believe it or not i'm speaking to people who actually sell these in bulk and they say in australia 150 aussie is actually the going rate for these cpus it's just crazy because you've got the i3 10 100 now which is miles better brand new going for just a little bit more but that's how confused the marketing is right now with the i7 versus i3 and i guarantee you a lot of people in the market for a gaming pc who don't know much about this stuff would be like oh i7 and they would pick an 4770 over an i310 100 even though the 10 100 is a better cpu to get by a long shot there with all that out of the way i've got to jump in the yes mobile now head up to brisbane because we'll go see les but there's also some of these other deals where pretty much all these deals are up in brisbane which is like an hour drive for me but this seems to be a trend going on where i don't really find any deals locally except a uh 260 so hopefully we get the r7 260 because it's local yo les what is crackalackin uh not much mate i'm about to head up to brisbane go get some deals and it's that time of the month so i thought i'd stop by say hello and of course see what you got cracking yeah i don't have much cracking i mean good jacket yeah well i was just wondering if you wanted to release the kraken on my wallet oh my one's pretty big and now we just finished up at lez's place and he only had one pc for us one pc that's all we got this month but the good news is that we're going to go pick up some of the memory now both the guys on the 50 kits of memory got back to us but the monitors as well the two monitors that is just around the corner so we're gonna go grab those two monitors chuck them in the boot too and also on the gold coast uh someone's messaged me about a ryzen cpu so we're gonna go pick that up as well on the way home there's apparently someone with a broken 1080 ti so i'm going to go check out that where they just want me to fix it so we're going to chuck that in the boot as well because it's on the way home so a little bit of synergy being created right now but i am surprised i think this is the least amount of tech that i've ever gotten from les in the history of the channel but keep in mind the other week i went and saw him when i did a vlog i'll put the link up here where i was getting back into the used parts hustle again after all this rtx 3000 stuff but let's put that foot down on the gas and get on out of here [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] so here's all the deals that we got last night but i did find this on the way home this is a ryzen 5 1600 and we got this for 100 aussie dollars then there's this pc right here from lez he wanted 130 for it i said look 110 and uh we sort of came to an agreement on that i do like the hp z210s because all you really have to do is generally pop an ssd and a graphics card and they work pretty well and you can get a lot of value out of these units right here then we've got the ddr4 memory kit so there's a 16 gigabyte kit there that was 50 aussie dollars then another two eight gigabyte sticks of ddr4 50 aussie dollars and then i uh went over to a viewer's house someone was right around the corner from where i was picking up one of these deals then they said look i've got a 1080 ti and it's not working anymore and i said sure like i'll come pick it up we can look at it in the next ken yes fix it episode and so when they were there they said look do you want any older parts and i'm like yeah ddr3 first gen i7s or i5s like show us what you've got and so he had a first gen i7 and some ddr3 which they uh kindly gave us for free so big thanks for that uh jeremy as i really appreciated always can't say no to free used parts that's for sure then the last of the bunch is these two monitors one samsung one ben q and we got them for 50 aussie dollars for the pair so not bad for 22-inch monitors 1080p can never say no to monitors because you don't know when you'll need them even though i've stocked up on monitors i've got a bit more than i need right now in the future that can quickly turn the other way where you're finding yourself needing monitors so it's always good if you find stuff cheap enough i've always said this in the past if stuff's cheap enough right now always stock up on it right now and so now it's day two of the parts hunt and i've looked around gumtree high and low again and this time i've found a potential deal on a gtx 580 i've offered 40 aussie dollars for it and there's also a deal on uh three hard drives where they wanted a hundred dollars for at externals but they're all like two terabytes so i put down an offer of 80 on that so hopefully we can snag up both these deals but in terms of gpus looking at the situation right now it just seems like at least where i'm at locally this is going to be a continuing trend until there is something like an rtx or a gtx 3050 and perhaps amd releases a 6000 series on the low to mid-range uh end to alleviate this problem so until nvidia or amd decide to release a graphics card at the lower price points entry level we're going to see all these graphics card use graph scope prices just going pretty stupid and pretty much this rx 570 in one picture shows what i've been talking about this whole time this card is going on the used market more than it's going for brand new the exact same graphics card so it's really like for me firstly it's just really like shaking my head face palm all those emotions are coming through with the gpu market right now now another thing too is earlier this month we talked about the rtx 2000 series and how much of a roller coaster it could be now we've seen the rtx 3000 series launch and i think the stock was so low that a lot of people missed out and now sort of that demand is coming back to the rtx 2000 series where 2080 ti's have gone up in price now and uh 2070 supers 2080 supers and those three tier higher cards have all gone up in price again at least where i am locally so i think even the retailers were giving into that sort of fomo sort of uh panic selling and they were like in australia these retailers were dropping down their prices of 2080 ti's very low um i mean i snagged up a 2080 ti for 800 aussie dollars that for me was like risk free and that 2080 ti i guess has gained a bit of value now i also got a 2080. i did buy a 2070 super as well i didn't talk about that in the last parts hunt because i got it after the used parts last month so there has been a few deals that i've come into recently that has been sort of off camera but in terms of the market in general um prices for you stuff is generally right now where i'm at a little bit overpriced people are sort of struggling i'm struggling to get the deals this month i think this is an indication of sort of what's to come there's a lot of people where i am locally a lot of resellers who are hungry for the deals and as soon as they come up they just get snagged so i i really i've got to think of a new plan going in where i definitely have to start bowl quartering stuff even though that takes away from the element of the used part-time essentially where i love getting these one-time deals and making stuff especially on the low end putting together these pcs they can play games for really cheap that sort of like that element is just it's really hard it's getting a lot harder to do and i'm realizing that looking at the potential deals on the market anyway guys in the meantime i will update you with the remaining two deals and let you know in the description if i do snag them this month's tally is pretty small i'll put it up on the screen for you where it's definitely the smallest parts hunt this year and possibly one of the smallest parts hunts in the history of the channel though there is one more element to talk about and that is pretty much i'm just exhausted from all the rtx 3000 testing because we tested all resolutions like 1080p 1440p 4k and uh overclocking under vaulting all that stuff does take a lot of time and then of course when you're putting all these numbers into spreadsheets after that for me personally it gets to the stage where you're just looking at so many different numbers you're like whoa like this information overload essentially when you're trying to put it all together so that was a big one this month other than that i do like testing the new stuff as well especially on the rtx 3000 line because it does give us a basis for how much the use stuff should be priced at so right now i'm just seeing the gravis card prices are just all across the board are overpriced and again i'm pleading to nvidia or amd to hurry up and release something on the low end and maybe with the new navi cards amd does just that just like when they released the rx 470 and 480 originally it was met with like a bit of confusion people were like okay shouldn't they be releasing the high end first but now in hindsight i actually appreciate that move so much more and i wish amd would do it again with like a 6600 xt or something like that that'd be really cool and hopefully they can do that and fix the used gpu market problem and with all that out of the way do let us know your favorite deal of this month there isn't a whole lot to pick from so do pick wisely for us in the comments below but we do have the question of the day here which comes from dennis sovar and they ask i bought a ryzen i guess three to 1200 for 70 dollars new good deal question mark so this i honestly personally for 70 if that's usd i'd say it's not that good of a deal at all aussie dollars it's okay you saw here we picked up a ryzen 5 1600 for 100 aussie dollars that for me personally is a much better deal because you're getting that six cores 12 threads as opposed to four cores four threads which i think a lot of people nowadays do want the four cores eight threads as sort of like a baseline minimum yes four cores four threads will still play games fine but you're kind of just leaving yourself there with a very limited uptick so mediocre deal at best if we're talking aussie dollars i'd pay around 50 aussie dollars for a ryzen 3 1200 that's my personal max and of course how do i price that up at 50 aussie dollars that's all got to do with the rest of the components in the build what balance are you looking for how much you're looking to re-flip the build what price performance are you going to get out of it and of course what the market is looking for that's the biggest one what the market demands is what you should always be trying to satisfy that's probably a different story for a different day because there's the ultimate thing that you've got to factor in and that is your time if you're going to go out and do pc reselling and it takes you say five hours to put together a build and you're only making 100 bucks could have you made more money just working some other job so there's all those factors that you've got to put together and just ask it is it worth it uh best question of all time is it worth it is this video worth a free like you got to give me a free like toss me one of them and i'll catch you in another tech video very soon peace out for now bye [Music] hey look what i got here what's that it's a pc and i paid a fortune for it how much did you get it for i picked it up down the tip so you paid nothing for it exactly right yeah so is this going to be your new pc is it yeah yeah okay well we're going to need a cpu and some memory but yeah we'll patch this thing up for you and you'll have a brand new pc from 2008 wow
