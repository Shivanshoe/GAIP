Around Tech YES City we have been known
to delve into the wonderful and magical land of the Xeon and today we have our
friend the 1680 v2 and this is a CPU that was made back in 2013
eight cores 16 threads and it was overclockable and it's such a special
CPU not just because it's a Xeon but also because there was no i7 equivalent
out on the x79 lineup where the maximum core and thread count you can get with
the i7 was 6 cores 12 threads though nowadays you can pick this Xeon up for
around 200 US dollars and the best thing about today's video is I literally
pulled the multiple that I'm using in today's comparison out of a dumpster and
then I bent some pins back and we got it working and the best thing is we're
overclocking quite well so we've got this CPU up to 4.6 gigahertz overclocked
up from it's three gigahertz base clock and these numbers that you're going to
see today still show that the old-school Zeon's are nothing to laugh at where
we're coupling it with a 20 atti and we're also giving it quad channel ddr3
21 33 megahertz XMP memory versus the 39 50x with its 3600 mega at CL 16 and also
the 10 900k with its CL 1630 600 megahertz so enough talk it's time for
the return of the Xeon hey dude I love paying $200 for a Windows 10 Pro Licence
said no won today's video sponsor s cd-keys has you covered with the cheap
Windows 10 Pro OAM single end-user license using the TYC coupon code you
can get this for as little as 13 USD links in description below so moving
into these results we've got over clocks on the 10900 k 5.2 gigahertz all core
then we move over to the 39 50x we've got a overclock of 4.4 gigahertz all
core and then we move at at 1680 v 2 as we said in the intro 4.6 gigahertz all
cooked now we use the same CPU cooler across the board this is the H 115 i RGB
platinum and without further ado let's look at these results pulling up shadow
of the Tomb Raider 1080p high settings direct x12 we see here the 10
100 K does pull ahead of the competition quite substantially here getting 170
average FPS there's 138 and 133 now something interesting about shadow of
the Tomb Raider I'm not used to seeing FPS this high so something must have
happened recently with this game that allowed a guest the 10900 K in
particular to do a lot better than I previously seen with it but another
thing I have done with the Intel CPUs is I have disabled specter and meltdown and
also on the AMD side that's automatically immune to meltdown and
then for the specter protection I leave that enabled actually because I find it
gives it better fps so for shadow of the Tomb Raider at the
1680 v - dude lose out by a little bit however that being said we move on to
the division - and here we saw a slight victory for the 1680 b2 versus the 3950
X and then the 10900 K pulled out ahead but it wasn't by a whole lot and this is
a 1080p setting with a 20 atti that the Xeon didn't want to just stop
there I wanted to show the world that it's still capable of bugging and Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon we scored some impressive results here with 175 average
FPS versus 171 on the 3950 x versus 203 on the 10900 k then we move over to war
zone where we got 201 with 110 at 1% and point one percent losses with 88 on the
10900 k4 this is a hundred and eighty-seven 93 and 75 on the 39 50 X
this is 195 95 and 78 on the Z on now another thing about the war zone
settings this time around I did change them to what I consider or at least what
I researched was competitive settings we've got high textures and also an SEO
tropic filtering on higher but a lot of the other stuff is on low but you also
up the field of view to a hundred which is what most pro streamers use though
the next game up here we've got a special for you guys grounded not yet
released but I've got early access to this game so I'm able to test it for you
guys and we've got here the 10900 case growing 102 at 1080p high settings with
good 17.1% lows same for the 39 50 x that did well and also the zealand did
very impressive here to scoring 97 81 and 58 the last game we're pulling up
for you guys is 49 where the 10900 k decided it wanted to scream ahead with
500 and forty average FPS with the one percent
lows pretty much matching that and actually higher than that of the Xeon
and matching that of the 39 50 X with 362 average FPS versus 339 so with those
numbers out of the way a cpu from 2013 given the right circumstances given the
right memory because if we're putting this high-powered memory on the newest
and latest and greatest Intel and Rison systems we should do the same for the
older Xeon and doing so showed that this quad channel 1680 v2 does do an
impressive job even in 2020 and it goes to show if you can find someone just
giving away or selling an X 79 motherboard for virtually nothing and
say for instance you can find a good CPU cooler on sale then nothing stopping you
from getting really good FPS out of the old-school stuff and honestly for the
1680 v2 even though it doesn't have the latest avx2 instruction sets most of
these games here it was showing that it was performing extremely well and I was
actually blown away by the performance of this CPU granted the Zeon's do need a
lot more tuning and manual overclocking than the 39 50 X and also the 10 900 K
but I guess in ways that is the beauty of some of this older gear that out of
the box it's sort of a bit dormant but once you start giving it throttle it
really responds in a response in a big manner that one thing I will say is in
the case of the 10900 K and the 1680 v2 is once you start moving up to these
really high of clock speeds the power consumption does go up and we can see
this in Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon where I've testing the power consumption here
and it's going around 400 watts for the 10 900k going up to a maximum of 398
watts and then on the rising system were scoring 351 watts and then on the Xeon
we went up to 465 watts so the old-school x79 staff does juice a bit
more power especially when you're gaming but of course if you pick it up cheap
enough and power doesn't cost a whole lot where you live then something like
this may be a good consideration if you're looking to build the best price
performance high-end gaming rig into and 20 now of course it is used and
there is the risk of anything used not working a hundred percent or having some
weird problem but I find most the time with used deals as long as you scope it
out and you see it tested and working before you get it or you get some kind
of confirmation that the parts work properly then you're usually in good
hands now one more thing with the 1680 v2 is that it doesn't support the latest
avx2 instruction sets so what this means is that if some game or some program
comes out in the future that it requires a B x2 or it works a lot better with a V
x2 then the 1680 v2z on will fall behind against its new at counter parts and a
perfect example of this is Cinebench r20 even though it's a synthetic benchmark
it does highlight the differences between the maximum theoretical
performance of the ten 900k versus the 39 50x versus the 1680 v suit with a 39
50x with its 16 cores 32 threads is really geared up in a different league
for productivity than these other two CPUs and then of course the 10 900k is
also in a different league compared to the 1680 v2 if you need
productivity with a VX - anyhow with all that out of the way if you guys enjoyed
today's xeon showdown versus the latest and greatest then be sure to hit that
like button also let us know in the comments section below what you think of
the older Zeon's as I love reading your thoughts and opinions as always and
don't worry when you guys keep messaging me in the comments spamming video after
video that you want to see more Zeon's I hear loud and clearly and also we've got
the question of the day which comes from Helios G gnosis and they asked did
something happen to your channel mate I've been subscribed for a while and I
look just now and I see the option to join what the your channel is in my home
screen subscribed channel this also to add to that witness by the way maybe you
should do a channel update I know sometimes YouTube does weird mass
on subs on people join us in sub not join premium by the way to clear any
confusion that may cause if any and this is one thing that I notice along my
channel that happens I'd say like 2 or 3 times a year where it seems like we're
doing really well everything's going great and then all the sudden it's like
Oh and I don't know what's going on I have
messaged YouTube in the past when people have come in and say hey look the videos
aren't showing up on the sub feed and I really I have no idea what it is and
I've tried to figure it out for years now and it just seems like whatever but
that's like in life that's just how things go but ultimately I don't really
know what's going on there I'll probably message YouTube and see if they know
what's up with that in the meantime if you do get unsubscribed and you enjoying
the content and make sure you hit that sub button and ring that bell and you'll
get that content as soon as it drops in your sub box and also let us know in the
comments - are you enjoying me shooting on panasonic again this was done on the
G 8x which I picked up on a bargain I'm gonna end up getting this camera for
like 50 ozzie dollars and if you guys want to hear how I'll talk about that in
the used part son of the month and this is the sinner like V profile which I
have sorely missed I changed over to Sony for cameras and
filming and now I'm kind of thinking about changing back to Panasonic so do
let us know in the comments if you enjoyed this picture and without aside
I'll catch you guys in another tech video very soon peace out for now BAE [Music]
