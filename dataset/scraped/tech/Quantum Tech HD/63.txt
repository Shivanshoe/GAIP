Building a wall it's not as easy as it seems,
 but these workers make it look simple The essential part of any wall is its foundation The foundations need to be at least
three times the width of half a brick... ... or at least twice the
width of one brick Once the trench has been dug and the
concrete poured, they insert rebar all along When placing all the blocks, they
control the elevation with a string line It is common practice to fill the holes
 of cinder blocks with rebar... ... and then add concrete
within to strengthen them Once the wall is finished, they use natural
 stone to embellish the exterior You can install natural stone directly
 on porous concrete, stone, or block If the surface is smooth, you can attach a
metal lath and a scratch masonry coat... ...to provide a surface for thin sheets of stone to grip The last step is to inspect all mortar joints
and to wash them to remove any debris Construction of concrete stairs includes steps
 such as designing, preparing foundation... ... building formwork, concreting, finishing, and curing It's a difficult task that requires
 a skilled worker to construct it The foundation for the concrete stairs
has to be correctly constructed... ...so that loads are transferred into ground successfully
 and resist the movement on the stairs The most important step when building
concrete stairs is to use a proper formwork The angle of flight, dimensions of tread,
 and riser need to be checked Once the formwork is done, they
pour dry concrete before adding water After pouring it, they create the shape of the
 stairs using a straight wooden board They need to make sure
 every step is perfectly even... ...before adding the cinder blocks on top They use them to make the
concrete keep its shape while drying Concrete typically takes 24 to 48 hours to dry
 enough for you to walk or drive on it However, concrete drying is a
continuous and fluid event... ... and usually reaches its full effective
strength after about 28 days Once completely dry, they remove all cinder
 blocks and clean the steps from debris Now they are ready to be embellished
 on top with any material To set up this old cellar, this worker is
 going to create a new concrete floor First, he digs the floor so that it gets at
the stairs level once the concrete is poured Cellars were used to store wine and food underground,
 as they maintain a cool temperature all year Today, with refrigerators, they have lost this use, so
 they can be renovated to be used as basements Concrete slabs are multi-purpose
surfaces for homes and gardens They are inexpensive to install and
durable enough to last for years He lays down the rebar mesh before
 pouring to get a reinforced slab The reinforcing steel
absorbs the tensile, shear... ...and the compressive stresses
 of the concrete structure Plain concrete does not easily withstand tensile and
 shear stresses caused by earthquakes or vibrations Once the pour is done, it's important
to level the surface and vibrate it Concrete ceilings are popular in apartment
blocks, residential houses, or any building These are robust, raw, and blend with
 contemporary and industrial aesthetics Concrete ceilings have a thermal mass,
 they absorb and stores heat You need formwork to
build a concrete ceiling Pressure-treated lumber is necessary to
support the reinforcing bar and the concrete These workers build a cinderblock
 base that will support the pouring Use a level when making the
formwork to ensure the ceiling is horizontal If not, you will waste time and
money later working on the flaws After the formwork is built, it is time to
 work on the rebar reinforcing structure It's better to start pouring
concrete from the far corner After pouring concrete, these workers
use hoes to extend it on all the surface A piece of wooden board is used to level
 the area and liberate any air bubble You can also use a concrete float to ensure no mark is left
