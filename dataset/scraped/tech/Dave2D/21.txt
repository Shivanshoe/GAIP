it's early 2022 we're seeing a lot of new phones pop up and a lot of them are running the new snapdragon 8 gen 1 their new flagship chip now the first time i had access to it was in january and i was sent a couple real me devices as well as the moto x30 that used this chip and when i ran my initial benchmarks on it it did not look good the chip was able to perform better than the triple a from last year and it was pretty competitive with apple's iphones but it needed a ridiculous amount of energy to achieve those scores and it produced a lot of heat to the point where some of these devices couldn't even finish the benchmarks they would overheat and it would shut down so the thing is i didn't make any video at the time because i just chalked it up to like speed right these companies were trying to put out a device as soon as possible to be the first of the market with this kind of chip in it and i felt like they just weren't done well but recently i picked up this device this is the oneplus 10 pro and say what you will about oneplus as a company in terms of their elevated pricing and the kind of sketchy direction of the brand but the one thing they've always done well is they make a phone with great performance they've always tuned the device to work nicely with the chip it's properly cooled they've always done a great job with it and they have software features to maximize the performance of the device so when i picked this up i assumed that this would be a really good representation of what this new snapdragon chip could do right so i ran the benchmarks but it had the same kind of performance it's better but energy efficiency still wasn't where i was hoping it to be and because it pulls so much juice it gets hot and in some cases it throttles really aggressively to deal with that heat like in gentian this will last maybe six seven minutes before it throttles down now almost all phones are going to choke on gention even the iphones but when this new chip gets too hot the performance is barely better than last year's triple a and that's the biggest problem with all that heat it can only flex for a few minutes before it becomes no better than the old chip so as a reviewer you look at this data and the first reaction you have is like this isn't a good chip right that's the conclusion you draw you're drawing number one it draws a lot of juice two if it's drawing this much power to be able to achieve these types of scores the battery life is invariably going to be shorter right but then i started playing pokemon unite on this phone and this is a game i'm very familiar with i've logged in over 1200 matches on this thing and each round is exactly 10 minutes there's no overtime it's like a moba where you control pokemon you do things but the game is surprisingly consistent in terms of like play time and every time i've played that on my iphone 13 pro max i lose about four to five percent battery life every match it's like clockwork if you have 15 battery life you'll get in three matches no less no more because it's just exactly 10 minutes a game and when i started playing it on this phone i was getting very good battery life and i thought how is this possible i was also losing about four percent battery life five percent battery life per match and just to put this into perspective on the pixel 6 pro and on the oneplus 9 pro these probably lose around seven percent per match like this is so nerdy like how do i know this because i've played so many hours of this stupid game i just know the battery consumption on each round and i was like this doesn't make sense if this is such an energy consumptive chip how is it lasting just as long as the iphone 13 and then i realized all the testing that i've been doing like all the synthetic benchmarks and the gaming benchmarks they're all done with extremely demanding scenarios and those are not realistic representations they're actually very poor representations of real world use right people aren't buying phones just to benchmark them to get the high score like most phone use is light to moderate use and even with games very few games are nearly as demanding as genting impact which is why so many reviewers use it like it's a good tool to showcase the upper end of what a chip can do but i realize that that's a it's actually a really poor way to test this new chip i sorry i take that back it's not that it's a poor way but it's not the only way that we should be judging this chip because when you run normal tasks on it like light to moderate use like you're using youtube or browsing the net or playing a light game or even a moderately demanding game this chip is great it is significantly more energy efficient than the previous generation and i think that's where it excels with regular use this new snapdragon 8 gen 1 is great but i have to return this conversation back to the original stuff the highly demanding kind of energy intensive scenarios and that's where this chip falls apart it lags behind what apple has and even some of the older snapdragon chips in terms of energy efficiency at the top end i also think the marketing material was a little bit misleading because in order to get those kind of performance bumps you need to feed it a ton of wattage and that's where just eats dirt on energy efficiency now i think that the reason why this is all happening is i think qualcomm wanted their new chip to be competitive in terms of just broad performance with apple stuff i think they wanted their numbers to meet up close in the benchmark world and they just did whatever they could do to get those numbers up there now there are a couple things that come to my mind though so number one i do think that this is something that could be fixed with software maybe like it seems unlikely but it's not impossible but the other thing is that these devices these are just like regular like thin elegant devices right i think this chip the snapdragon 8 gen one if you put it in something like the rog phone or like the lenovo phones like the gaming phones you could probably do some really cool stuff in a more aggressively cooled device but my overall thoughts on the snapdragon 8 gen 1 and the upcoming phones this year i got to be honest in january i was concerned when i first saw the benchmarks and i was running the the meters to look at the consumption i was like man these things are going to be they're going to be hot but having seen this from the perspective of real use right you don't just tunnel vision on benchmarks and gentian impact and you actually use it for real things it's actually a great chip okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you
