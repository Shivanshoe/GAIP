okay so this is the newest pocophone the poco x3 and it is a roughly 200 phone that hits really hard it's just packed with so much good stuff on it i think this is probably gonna be the best 200 phone this year like i i really think that this is gonna be the one now the original pocophone the f1 this was a phone that just made waves right it was meant to be disruptive it was meant to draw a lot of attention to the brand but ever since the f1 i haven't reviewed other pocophones because i mean xiaomi's just been using other phones like redmi phones and rebranding them as poco phones and none of them really struck me as being something special this one's different this one is a new phone it's not like a rebrand from something else so i like that and let's just get right into it so the build quality this is a metal framed phone it's aluminum i don't know for sure i mean they claim it's aluminum it feels like metal but it does have that reflective chrome finish that we do see in plastic framed phones but i do think it is metal and then the back is not glass it's a plastic back very similar to other pocophones it's got some glass like reflectivity to it but it is plastic and it'll have the durable properties of plastic and i like that they went with it right if you're going to have a 200 phone that has like a 120 hertz screen and all the features that this one does you kind of have to go with some material decisions like that so if we go around the device we have a sim tray it's got a gasket for some water resistance and you can go with a double sim or a single sim with the micro sd we have an ir blaster up top and we also have a notification light that is visible through the grille of the earpiece it's this little white light that just shines through and i like it it's so simple it's not intrusive like they don't have a special aperture for anything it just shines right through the grill and i feel like more phones should implement or could implement something like this without too much of a trouble but it's nice that it's there we also have very tactile buttons they click like quite audibly and the tactility is good but they have this they feel cheaper it's hard to describe like when i click them it feels like there's plastic components in there when there usually aren't and then the fingerprint sensor so this is a reasonably fast sensor it's in a great spot and the kind of divot that's in the area to place your finger is really ergonomic and there's also this sharp edge on the side of the power button it's actually quite similar to the sharp edge on the zenfone 7. and the bottom we have your headphone jack awesome and a usbc port this is actually a slower port it's usb2 so you can't do super fast data transfers through it now the front has really nice sounding stereo speakers and like i mean good stereo like even sound good volume i like them now the display is a 120 hertz lcd panel and it's a pretty good image there are some things that i think people should be aware of if they're interested in this phone though so even though it's 200 bucks i got to mention this stuff number one the backlighting has some inconsistencies around that punch hole it's most noticeable when you have like a bright image and you're viewing it on an angle like you can see here there's just some inconsistencies around that punch hole it's not super obvious but if you look for it you'll notice it but the weird thing is if you look straight on it's almost imperceptible it's actually invisible to me if i look straight on but the moment you tilt it you'll see it and the same thing goes with the bottom edge there's just you can see that the back lighting isn't perfectly done there it's again most noticeable on an angle but straight on it's not really noticeable now for me i don't care about these imperfections at all i feel like this barely affects the image quality of the screen but i thought i should put it out there for people that are more picky about stuff like that there is another issue that i think is like a bigger issue and it's not pertaining to the screen itself but it manifests itself on the display so this is a 120 hertz display but you'll notice oftentimes with the animations and stuff there's a bit of a stutter and i think it's related to the frame rate down clocking that xiaomi xiaomi's putting on this phone so with this device because it's got a 120hz capable screen if you left it at 120hz or 120 frames per second all the time it would chew through battery life quickly right but i think in an attempt to preserve the battery life or extend it as long as possible they are down clocking it really quickly and quite aggressively so if i'm in the ui and i'm swiping around it'll be displaying it at 120 frames per second very smooth very fluid but if i let go of that like the touchscreen i don't touch it the frame rate will drop to single digit fps and now if i touch the screen again it takes a split second for it to bring that speed back up it takes a while for it to ramp up to a fluid a visually fluid frame rate and because of that delay the eye picks up a stutter and i don't know how i feel about this because partially it's a good thing right because now your battery life is preserved really well and we'll get into battery life in a second but because of that stutter it's noticeable and i don't know if they can fix this without affecting the battery life too much so this phone has an amazing battery life right now 5160 milliamp hours it's a big battery but it's not just the size of the battery it's what they're doing in software how they're down clocking the screen and how they're just stretching the battery life through software and it's a bit of a trade-off right you gotta do these weird things in software and make your screen not super smooth to be able to stretch out that battery life like this is a phone that gets a comfortable two days of real use like actual use two days it's crazy eight and a half nine hours of screen on time it's so good but i think right the moment you start tweaking the software so it looks smoother and feels smoother you're gonna eat into that battery time so it'd be cool if they could have like a software option for users but i think most people would go for battery life now it also charges up very quickly it's got a 33 watt charger in the box juices it up in like 68 minutes it's a really fast charge the thing is on a phone like this that doesn't have any software to kind of adjust the charging speed you're gonna it's gonna invariably affect the durability or longevity of this device right when you have batteries that get warm from really fast charging all the time it doesn't bode well for like lifespan of the phone personally if i owned this and this was my regular phone i would just use like a 15 watt charger because it does get quite hot on the charge but you do have access to super fast charging if you want it so this runs a snapdragon 732 g and it's also running ufs 2.1 storage so not super fast hardware in there it's reasonably fast but it's noticeably not flagship like when i looked at the oneplus nord that's got a 765g in it even though i know that's not a flagship chip it feels flagship like this does not this feels noticeably mid-range it's not like a slow performer i'm not going to say it's like unusably slow or anything like that but it is slow at times not just in games when i'm looking at frame rates but even in the ui when i'm swiping around i'm just doing things stuff takes a little bit of time to load but it feels fast enough and i feel like for 200 bucks i'd be very happy with this kind of performance gaming performance is hit or miss it obviously depends on the titles you're playing any kind of heavy 3d title isn't ideal on this device so the camera system the aesthetics of the camera system first of all is a little bit different like i don't love the look of it it's got this weird shape to the lens cluster and it's also quite protuberant sticks out like two millimeters or so the image quality of these photos is what you would expect on a mid-range phone right clean easy shots are fine the ultrawide shots could be sharper but the moment you throw low light into the mix it doesn't do great i think the one thing i would say is nice on this phone is the image stabilization in video so it's pretty decent but when you take low light videos the image quality starts to fall apart quickly so this is all with the stock camera app if you put g cam on this thing i took a few photos it's a little buggy right now i feel like an updated version of gchem would run nicely on it but the low light images are just so much better with gcam okay ui so this is running miui 12 and it's been a couple years since i've actually spent a lot of time on miui and it is so much cleaner now than it used to be there are still a couple things i don't love like number one there's ads like there's straight up advertisements in the middle of your ui sometimes and it's just it really shouldn't be there i understand why they do it like samsung's even doing this stuff now but i hate that number two i don't like how there's unremovable software and it's like xiaomi stuff that you know they want to put it in there and it seems like they collect data when you're using them so i would just prefer to uninstall those apps but i can't because they're baked right into the rom but those are the only real gripes i have with miui it's a way cleaner and better operating system now than it was two years ago but the real thing here is the price point 200 bucks is a really hard price for competitors to be it's such an attractive phone because it's got so much stuff at that price point like super fast screen 120 hertz 50 160 milliamp hour battery it's a big battery that lasts long they got a lot going on for this phone okay what do you think good for the price let me know okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
