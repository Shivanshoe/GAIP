okay so my 2018 razor blade died this was a device that I use for a lot of 2018 and the vast majority of 2019 and it finally died it was through no fault of the device itself I had on the kitchen counter AC adapter was connected and I yanked it by accident the whole thing went on the ground and the left fan completely stopped spinning it now has error messages on boot there's nothing I can do to it so I thought I'm just gonna switch it over to the 2019 razor blade because I've had that review in it for a while I just never bothered switching it over just because this was sufficient for the stuff that I do but then I thought why not take this opportunity to look at all the other options that I have in like the vault of review units that I have so here's the thing whenever I tell anyone in videos or on discord that this is my laptop of choice people say why do you go for this why do you go for the razor blade when there are so many other devices you have access to that are either more powerful they have better cooling better battery life etc why do you go for this so I thought maybe they're right maybe I should check them out so that's what I did the first device that I checked out was this one this is the Acer concept d7 now I never did an official review on this thing this was a device that was sent to me really early on in the product launch cycle I'll just put it down there he's dead anyways but I never did a review because it was just a very niche product but I did mention it in my content creator video for having an excellent screen I actually think this is one of the best screens you can get on the market right now for just content creation it's very color accurate it's bright it's a great 4k panel however when I set everything up on it just to test this thing out a little more thoroughly for what I wanted to do with it it had two problems number one it throttles I don't need like insanely good thermal performance because video editing isn't like ah the toughest stuff in the world but it throttles a little too much for my taste and secondly the nvme drives in here are improperly cooled I don't know why they made a device like this where a it's it's clearly designed for content creators right it's a I know it's a white fancy laptop and they mark it as a content creation device but when you access the drives like they are they're difficult to upgrade to begin with you have to go in remove the motherboard and going to the backside of the motherboard and replace them there there's not a lot of airflow there and because these drives are mounted right underneath the keyboard you can't even use like a thermal pad to try to pull the heat off of it so you're basically stuck with these drives that overheat and when I offload footage onto this computer like if I take one of my red cards and just dump it onto here halfway through the transfer the speeds drop because the drive is way too hot so this thing was unfortunately out of the race so the next device that looked at was the XPS 15 from last year this is the OLED panel model and I did a review of this thing earlier last year but the one thing I noticed was that it did not have great thermal performance but since then there have been a lot of updates including firmware updates for this machine so I thought I'd check them out but it still has thermal issues the other thing I don't love about this machine is actually the panel this is running the OLED screen and even though this is a screen that's kind of geared towards content creation like a lot of laptop companies are using this Samsung panel for their content creation devices it's just not a great screen because color calibration is extremely difficult for these devices like you got to set it at a particular brightness level and and keep it there too to keep it calibrated which is a little bit unfortunate and there's also the issue of PWM flickering I'm someone that's sensitive to it I didn't think I was but when I use these devices for an extended period of time like literally four five six hours sometimes a stretch staring at the screen I noticed my eyes getting very tired and just it's just not a great feeling so I couldn't use this and this issue with these OLED panels affects every OLED laptop so the XPS 15 the Alienware M 15 r2 like I also have an OLED panel in this thing this was out because of the OLED issue and then even the aro 15 so this is this is again a device I never did a review on but this screen is one of the best OLED screens on a laptop it's the same screen as all the other ones but they've calibrated it really well and it actually locked the brightness on this thing so you can't bring it up to the same kind of brightness as other devices and I still have issues with eye strain on the aro 15 it's unfortunate because it's a really solid device overall but I just can't see to stare at OLED screens on laptops for an extended period of time at least not with the current Samsung panel so here's the thing display is important to me right I think when you're doing video editing it's got to be reasonably color accurate and I do like to play games so I'd prefer like a high refresh screen but I even looked at the math book so I don't love this device this isn't mine I had to bring it in just for this video but like the 16 inch MacBook this year they fix the keyboard they improve the thermals and it's got a great 16 inch screen but I just can't do it I like my games too much and I also don't love the value that the Mac books offer right now okay the last thing I took a look at was a razor blade 17 this is a super heavy device I kind of forgot how heavy this thing was like I did a review on it but like I tried this thing out for I think 4 days 4 days as a daily like I bring it to work bring it back from work and it's just way too big for me I like the idea of it it's just like the 17 inch screen doesn't provide that much of an advantage to me like especially because you're still at 1080p it's a nice device and I like the idea of what a bigger screen would offer but like it's heavy it's like you got to be swole to bring this guy around so in the end I went for the 2019 razor blade there's a lot of stuff I dislike about this machine if I'm being honest like I don't love the keyboard of complain about this thing for so many years that right shift key kills me I don't like Razer synapse and thermally like it's good it's just there are ones that are better but I don't know it's weird right when you think about content creation devices there are so many companies out there that are making these you know quote unquote content creation laptops and they're surprisingly like they're surprisingly not ideal like they have thermal issues and a lot of these devices have these OLED panels that are incredibly difficult to calibrate properly I just feel like a lot of stuff gets ignored when they shouldn't be when it comes to content creation laptops so that's why we have the 2019 razor blade as my pick again it's imperfect clearly but it's just less imperfect then what these guys offer for the stuff I want to do okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs we loved it see you guys next time
