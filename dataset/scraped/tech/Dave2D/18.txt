i think the g14 is consistently one of the most popular laptops that asus has because it's small it's powerful and it goes on sale pretty regularly you can get this thing at a fairly reasonable price without trying too hard and in the past it's always been like an atr and s to your product to me but this year they made something really special so this is running amd's new cpus and it's also running amd's new gpus and it's combined in hardware that has been tweaked and updated to take advantage of those new components and we have a laptop that is so much better than the previous stuff it's kind of weird so let's start off with the size it's a 14-inch device it's very compact and lightweight it comes in this white color which i'm a huge fan of and there's this blueish purple badge down here which is slightly different this year i think it's really nice looking touch but on a device like this it's very hard to pack it with powerful components and cool it properly like a lot of companies have struggled with it but the g14 has always been able to do it pretty well but this year they just took it to a whole new level so the cpu in here is the 6900 hs from amd and it pumps out about 15 better performance than the 5900 hs on last year's model but if you compare it to intel's newest stuff intel chip is faster this new amd chip is great but it can't take the crown in terms of just raw performance but the key here is energy consumption because in order for intel to get those numbers it has to pump a lot of power into its chip and with great power comes a lot of heat and on a device like this that is small and compact and thin heat is the deciding factor as to what you can do with it like what kind of components you can put into a device like this so we have a pretty energy efficient cpu but the gpu in here is where it really steps it up so on last year's model the top end configuration of this could only get up to an rtx 3060 a pretty good gpu but still just a 3060. this year they have their new amd 6800 s and the performance that you're getting out of this chip is so much better than the rtx 3060. it'll depend on the game or the app they're using but in general it's a legit 30 to 40 bump in performance in just one product generation it's fantastic it's between like a 30 70 and a 30 80 in terms of performance it is however a 105 watt gpu instead of the 80 watt from the previous generation so it's like a 20 maybe 25 bump in energy consumption but like a solid 30 to 40 bump in performance it's absolutely worth it now to pull this off to have higher wattage in the same chassis size as before you have to have a better thermal system than the previous stuff right so they've done a few things the fan blades have been tweaked so they draw a little bit more air uh the vapor chamber is a little bit bigger it covers a lot more stuff now so it's got the cpu the gpu and the vrms all covered with the vapor chamber and they have liquid metal on both the cpu and the gpu they've clearly put in a lot of effort to make this thing as thermally capable as they can but when you push this system hard it gets hot it's actually a couple degrees hotter than last year's model it's way more powerful than that one but when you slam it it gets hot it doesn't throttle and the external temperatures are fine but i just do not like seeing 96 degrees celsius on a cpu even if it's an amd one now depends on what you do but you probably won't max out the temperatures on this device i just would have liked to have seen more aggressive cooling like even fans that were a little bit louder because these are not that loud and i feel like on a device that can get this hot they should have pushed a little bit harder now for the people that are interested these new amd chips have an integrated gpu as well the rx 680m and the performance is pretty decent but i do think that for most people that have a device like this they would usually just use the discrete gpu when they have the option now the screen is updated so this is a 16 by 10 aspect ratio now and it is a really nice looking screen it's qhd it's bright it's got fast refresh rate fast response time it's way better than the previous stuff there's no more ghosting good colors muck switch kick ass screen uh there's also a webcam up top so for the people that want to log in with facial biometrics now you have that option and the fact that there's a webcam on the g14 is a huge win but there is one thing of concern so the g14 products and the g15 they have this thing called ergolift where when you put the lid of the laptop back it lifts the keyboard but this mechanism has this thing where the exhaust of the hot air blasts against the screen now on the old g14 and the g15 because those have like a thicker chin like a bezel at the bottom the hot air is just hitting the plastic it's not ideal but you know based on my test there's absolutely nothing wrong with it this year because of the 16 by 10 aspect ratio screen that hot air hits the panel directly like right onto the lcd now i'm sure they've tested it i'm sure their engineers thought about this and looked at it but it's just weird to see super hot exhaust hitting the panel directly i'm just saying now the keyboard has also been tweaked this year it's now a full white color instead of that silvery finish that they had previously this shows the laddering a little bit more clearly it's got rgb lighting and i really like the layout i'm someone who's used the g15 keyboard so much that transitioning over to this was really easy but i think most people will enjoy it it does not have a print screen which some people require some of my programs actually need it it's not the same as window shift s or function f6 it's the dedicated print screen button uh but yeah good keyboard trackpad is also really good i think this is one of the best surfaces it's got a great texture to that glass and the click mechanic sounds and feels nice okay the top lid so this has that annie me matrix led lighting and it's been upgraded this year there's more leds in there but the idea is the same it's a cool feature but to me the novelty wears off pretty quick it's just like this area you can throw up memes but if you like that kind of stuff it is better this year now in terms of battery life i was getting slightly longer run times this year but they didn't change the size of the cell this is still a 76 watt hour battery it's just that the chip is more energy efficient now the charger is a little bit bigger it's a 240 watt instead of the older 180 and it's just required to feed the more powerful components in here uh the rest of the stuff we have a single slot of ddr5 which is replaceable the rest of the memory is baked onto the motherboard and then we also have a single nvme drive and underneath it is the wi-fi card which you can replace if you want they're running a mediatek wi-fi again so personally i'd swap that out for an intel chip down here we have two speakers that have been upgraded these actually sound quite a bit louder than the previous stuff the mid frequencies and lower frequencies are decent there are no macbook speakers but for a gaming laptop they're not bad i'll give them that and y'all can see the big vapor chamber down there now also on the bottom of this panel they have this aluminum section which is a little bit different from the previous year this area does get warmer when you're running the system so if you're doing like a render or something and you're having this thing on your lap it's going to get a little bit warmer it doesn't get like crazy hot but it's just i think it helps with the thermals but it's something to keep in mind if you're someone who uses this device on the lap frequently it's going to be a little warmer this time around and there's also some dust filters on this back plate in terms of ports there's two usb-a and two usb-c's the usb-c on the left side is supposed to be able to support use before in terms of hardware it's capable of it but they just don't have the drivers apparently for it yet so it's to come uh the ac adapter comes out the side here as well which i'm not a huge fan of i prefer kind of rear mounted ac adapters if you can get them but overall this is a fantastic device now in this video i talked about thermals right and it gets a little hot the thing is when you have a device like this and you want it to be as powerful as it can be you are going to hit the wall of temperature every manufacturer has that issue it doesn't matter if it's alienware or razer or these guys small devices powerful components it always gets hot i do think they have a great product this year both in aesthetics and in performance but keep in mind that it is a small system and small systems always have limitations of some sort okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
