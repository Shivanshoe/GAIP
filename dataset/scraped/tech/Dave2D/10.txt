all right so this is the new legion 5 pro from lenovo and last year's product was very popular it was like a fan favorite people on reddit loved it reviewers loved it my discord channel loved it if you were looking for a gaming laptop last year this product was probably recommended to you at some point or another and this year it's even better but what made it so popular was two things first it was reasonably well priced but secondly it's got awesome performance for that money now this year my unit's running a 12 700h from intel with a 3070 ti now the cpu can get ridiculously fast like if you run it by itself without the gpu the system will pump 120 watts to the cpu so if someone has a dick swing with huge center bench scores this is a great machine to do it with the 3070 ti in here comboed with that cpu gives some great gaming performance if you compare it to last year's 3070 model with the amd chip this new one's faster in almost every game but the biggest jumps and performance are going to come if you can flex that cpu as well so if you have apps or even some games that can take advantage of both the cpu and the gpu this does really well like video editing applications are awesome with the new 12th gen chip if we take a look at thermals though last year's device had excellent thermals it was an easier device to cool because of running amd chips lower wattage less heat this year's device with the new intel chip it is a more difficult device to cool it's still cooled properly but they had to run the fans a little bit louder it's not crazy loud but it is noticeable at the top end that this is a louder system overall than the 2021 version you do get three different fan profiles again in software which you can choose between but there's a couple things that are slightly different for one on the silent mode this intel version is not truly solid like on amd's version last year if i remember correctly if you put it on silent the fans didn't spin at all or at least not audibly now in silent mode it's very quiet but you can hear it secondly there's a feature in the balance mode which is supposed to automatically tune the cpu and gpu to optimize the performance in some games but for my testing i couldn't see too much of a difference there is still a muck switch which is great but there's also no fan control no like granular fan control i talk about this every year and something i'm hopeful for and in the past when i talk about it like it would be nice but i don't think it's necessary this year because the intel chip is so power hungry and can take advantage of like a lot of wattage and will technically put a lot of heat it would have been extra nice this year to give the users that kind of control the internals there's not too much that has changed this year you still get two nvmes and two ram slots they did change the position of one of the heat pipes near the gpu like it used to run along the inside but now they swing it out to the exhaust directly which i assume is a good thing for thermal performance the battery size hasn't changed this year it's still an 80 watt hour battery but the battery life has actually dropped a bit so last year's model wasn't a great contender in the battery life department anyways it was like a four hour battery this year it's like three hours 45 minutes i'm assuming it's mostly because the intel chip it's like a bigger more powerful chip not bigger but it's like a more energy consumptive chip and i mean with the it just turned off but with a screen that's like a 16 by 10 aspect ratio this type of device is never going to get amazing battery life anyways but i mean that just goes to show you the difference between intel and amd in the exact same chassis with the same battery size so this screen is basically unchanged from last year it's still a 16 by 10 aspect ratio it's great for productivity and photo or video editing with that extra vertical space and it's a fast screen it's bright it's got pretty good color accuracy i don't love playing shooters at that aspect ratio though i'll normally run it at 16 by nine and just keep the black bars at the top and bottom otherwise it just throws off my aim but for open world games and more casual stuff if the game can take advantage of that aspect ratio that bigger screen is always nice uh let's talk about the keyboard so it's mechanically a great keyword like it types well it's got a nice kind of feel to the keyboard and i think i typed pretty fast on it and for a zoned rgb lighting system these are bright and pretty vibrant same with the trackpad mechanically it's great it's a nice texture the clicks are nice there's nothing i dislike about the keyboard or the trackpad in terms of the mechanics of it however the palm rejection on the legion 5 pro has always been a bit of an issue for me it's not a huge deal because you can always disable that trackpad but i've noticed in certain games especially shooters where you're trying to you know strafe frequently or you're trying to pick corners or if you're trying to jiggle peak if you hit the at least for me if i hit like the straight buttons too quickly my palm will just graze that touch pad and it'll throw off the aim and it's super annoying again very easy to fix you just got to disable the trackpad when you play the game but i've just never had this with any other device it's kind of strange that last year and this year to a certain degree it persists the other thing is the weight of the device so for a 15 inch laptop it's pretty heavy uh it's not super big or thick or anything like that it's just the weight and i think most that weight comes from the thermal system like it's not running anything fancy right it's no liquid metal there's no phase change material there's no vapor chambers it's just good old heat pipes heat sinks and they've put a lot of them in there and that adds weight to the system also it's built really well it's like a very tanky like it's just built really solid when you pick this thing up and you hold in your hands you know that they've done a really good job in terms of the build of it but it's heavy and the 300 watt ac adapter is pretty sizable and would add considerable weight to this package you have to bring it back and forth from work or school every day uh now last year i talked about the weight especially with the ac adapter because that system couldn't even pull 200 watts at max draw this year with this new intel chip and when they're feeding it like crazy wattage you need that 300 watt adapter it could be smaller there's other companies that make more compact like gan versions of ac adapters that are smaller but i i respect the fact that they're putting 300 watts in this system because it can use it the port selection is quite good and a lot of the ports are located on the back of the device which keeps your workspace clear on the sides and there's also a kill switch for the webcam now when it comes to a purchase decision right now at the time of filming this i don't have proper pricing on this there's only one configuration of it on their website and that configuration it's expensive but i don't think that's just some placeholder like joke pricing that they have there i think that's legitimately where they're going to start the pricing of this device and i think it's because of the fact that this has intel chips now a good intel chips and intel knows that they have something good and they have to charge good intel pricing which is unfortunately really expensive now the way that i look at this product is that it's only certain users and certain kind of applications that can really take advantage of this new 12th gen intel chip a lot of the games just do not get much faster but because i don't know the pricing of like the actual configurations it's kind of hard to gauge whether or not this is a good value my gut feeling is that these will not be nearly as good of a value as last year's amd models and this is just based on that one configuration they have available but that's just a gut feeling there is the very real possibility of aggressive sales though lenovo is the sale company like their stuff goes on sale so frequently and sometimes for such aggressive sale pricing that you never know right but i'm just talking regular pricing for it i think that the amd stuff from last year is just going to be a better overall value so if you're looking at this right now you're like i want this but i'm just saying last year's stuff was awesome i mean the only real difference if i'm being honest is the presence of uh like the different logo i much prefer this look instead of that like gaudy like the the spartan mask thing that they had going on last year but it's just aesthetics okay uh really good device this year but pricing i don't know we'll have to see okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
