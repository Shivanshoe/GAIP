[Music] all right the rog phone five these are some crazy cool phones this year they are significantly improved from the previous generation and they're very powerful like they're just stacked they're marketed as gaming phones they're very powerful in that sense but they're just awesome phones that i think most people who enjoy phones and appreciate powerful stuff you're gonna like this phone okay let's start off with the design real quick here so there's two phones i have here the regular bass rog phone five as well as the ultimate edition the first thing they've gone away with the kind of design gimmicks that they used to do on the previous iterations so rg1 two and three they had these design elements on the back of the phone to give the illusion as if there's some kind of thermal dissipation or thermal element on the exterior those weren't particularly functional and they've gotten rid of all that stuff it's just a nice aesthetic back now so the regular rg phone 5 has a glossy glass back there's some red accents but the rog logo lights up and you can control it pretty extensively in software i've seen a lot of rgb lit phones before like this tech isn't new but this feels really well engineered they've done it in a nice manner so it doesn't protrude it doesn't feel like some afterthought it feels like it was built to have this kind of lighting and it looks really nice it actually reminds me of the lighting on the g14 zephyrus laptop the other device i have here is the ultimate edition and this one this one slaps this is a white and blue backed phone and it's got this kind of matte pearlescent finish to it it's not like a glossy finish it's got this super clean vibe to it and there's also this monochrome oled screen on the back of it and this is so cool to me it's once again flush to the back of the device it feels really well built it doesn't feel like they just added this in at the last second and you can customize it you can have it show battery percentage you can have it show an incoming call like not caller id but just a notification that calls coming through and you can customize it with your own artwork it's really cool they've clearly put a lot of thought into this and the image actually rotates depending on the orientation of the phone so it's never like an upside down image they've done a good job on this thing there's also a brightly colored sim tray on both these phones the white one has this bright blue and then the base model in black has a red one and they both have good luck have fun etched right into them i do wish that the white one like the ultimate edition had a different colored trim like the frame of the phone was like silver or also white i feel like that would have looked better but this still looks really cool okay so the actual functionality of these phones what makes them special makes them different from regular non-gaming phones is really performance these are running snapdragon triple eights but because of thermal engineering they're doing it can get rid of the heat better so asus does this stacked pcb thing here so two layers on top of each other and it uses a vapor chamber graphite materials to get the heat out of the system and in very demanding games that push the system hard you will notice a difference in sustained performance one thing that you'll notice is that the pcb on the rg phone five is right in the middle of the phone so it allows the heat to disperse more evenly and it also allows them to run a split battery system which we'll talk about in a second there's also air triggers on the top of the device i guess top in landscape mode there's touch sensitive areas that you can use as shoulder buttons on a controller in the first few generations of the rg phones i never liked them like the technology was cool very good idea but they just never felt responsive enough they've tweaked it to the point where it feels a lot better it's not perfect right it's not going to feel like a regular shoulder button on a controller because there's no travel when you press it it's just a touch sensitive impact but it's good you also have key mapping and you can add crosshairs to your games if they don't have them and there's also an inverted color mode so you can spot enemies a little bit easier in the dark it's kind of questionable as to how fair all this stuff is like there are certain games out there that if you have a crosshair and if you have the ability to flip into negative colors it can give you a really clear advantage but the onus is on you uh there's also a usbc port on the side so you can charge your phone while you're playing games without the cable getting in the way and there is of course the active cooler the fan so this has been redesigned for this year it now connects to the phone using a different mechanism it used to connect with a usbc pass-through now it uses some pogo pins on the bottom which i think is a better connection system and this when connected gives you some back buttons it gives you rgb lighting on the back as well as a kickstand now from my test it doesn't reduce the thermals by a ton it's like three maybe four degrees cooler on the surface when you have the fan running if you're hard to the core with mobile games then maybe this is something you'd want to implement in all your gaming but i think for most people they just go without it but it does come with the ultimate edition it's a separate add-on if you purchase the basic model but on the white super duper edition it comes in the box the speakers on the rg phone five are really good they're loud they're clear and the stair separation is fantastic they've always been good though right the rg123 they've always had great speaker systems in these phones and they're just even better this year they're noticeably louder i will say though and i said this last year as well that if you're in portrait mode like if you're scrolling through reddit and you're watching a video in vertical the stereo separation now it's going from the top and the bottom it's very distinct it's almost jarring but the sound system is excellent for gaming and for media consumption there's also the return of the headphone jack if i'm not mistaken this is the first phone that comes to my memory that where they removed the headphone jack one year and then they brought it back last year on the rg phone 3 i ripped into them for not including the jack i know there are reasons like they were saying that there was space limitations because of the 5g antennas whatever the reason it just didn't make sense to me that a gaming phone wouldn't have a headphone jack they brought it back and this isn't just for gaming right anyone who's purchasing a phone like this would appreciate a headphone jack so i'm glad it's back and it's got a really high quality dac to it it's an ess quad deck it's a good one now the screen has some bigger bezels on the top and bottom like the forehead and the chin of the device i feel like on a device like this you have to have big bezels like it's a gaming phone right your phone is often in landscape mode and your palms are touching the side of the thing you do not want accidental clicks you don't want accidental swipes on this thing i'm glad that they included or they kept bigger bezels it's not as big as the rg phone 3 but i wouldn't want them any thinner than this and i also think that the quality speakers that are behind these bigger bezels like you got to have big bezels on a device like this i'm glad that they're in there so if you're looking at this and you're like those bezels are too thick you're wrong they built it like this on purpose the screen itself is 1080p 144hz it's a very fast and fluid gaming screen but it doesn't get super bright it's 800 nits at the top end and i feel like on a device like this if you're playing games indoors perfectly fine but the moment you go outdoors you will notice a deficiency it's not massive but if you compare it to like a oneplus phone or a samsung phone like those are like the best screens this does feel a little bit dimmer than you might like the battery is still huge it's a 6 000 milliamp hour battery it's the same size as the previous rg phone 3 however this year they've split it into two separate batteries so three thousand milliamp hours per battery and because they're two separate batteries you can charge them simultaneously with one 65 wire charger it's super fast charging and because of this split battery design you get better thermal performance as these batteries are being charged they're just able to handle the heat in a more efficient manner now asus also allows the user to adjust the charging options so instead of it going to 100 charge every time they allow the user to tweak it down to 90 or even 80 and this extends the life or the durability of the battery just basically the more you charge your phone to its full capacity the worse it is for a battery over a long period of time so by allowing the user to tweak that stuff it just makes these phones last a little bit longer which is nice to see on an enthusiast phone like this now the camera systems i'm not going to go too in-depth on the camera because that's clearly not the focus of the phone but it shoots reasonably well with pretty good dynamic range and low light photography but one thing i noticed and i'm not sure if this is just with like early software the battery was chewing through really quickly when i was using the camera i don't know if this is something they'll tweak over time with software but it's something i noticed now overall i feel like the rog phone five is excessively awesome everything about it is just over the top right 18 gigs of ram crazy speaker system super fast screen super fast charging this is just everything amped up right it is at the heart a gaming phone and even the unboxing is this augmented reality experience it's a really cool phone but the more i used it the more i appreciated it not just as a gaming phone but just a really good phone overall i love the speakers i love the presence of the headphone jack i love the big battery they did a really good job this year like a really fantastic job and the blue and white doesn't hurt at least on my books uh i don't think it's perfect obviously there's a couple things that i feel like they should have done with this i feel like on a gaming phone it should have expandable storage i've said this in rg devices as well but especially now because this is so powerful you can do so much stuff on it i think a lot of people would appreciate secondary expandable storage secondly i feel like they should have or could have done a better job on the ultimate edition like i love the color obviously but if this was tied in with some kind of like super popular game like the way that oneplus did it with the cyberpunk phone right that was done that was done so well like look at this thing this thing like you like this is a special edition right and this is not even a gaming phone per se but they tied it in with the game and it's like iconically cyberpunk i don't know i feel like this could have been a little bit better but the third thing is water resistance because i noticed the sim card tray did not have a rubber gasket i feel like this phone is probably more susceptible to water damage than your average smartphone in 2021 and i get it there's a lot of ports really difficult to seal all that stuff and the people buying this phone probably aren't scuba diving with it but i just i would have liked to seen that especially for a premium phone like this but overall rog phone five yeah they did a good one this year okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
