so last year asus had the zephyrus g15 this was a great product and this was my favorite laptop from 2021 it was a nice blend of performance to size with a really nice design aesthetic this was like chef's kiss to me but there was another product last year called the m16 and this had the same idea as the g15 but it had two differences it had a screen that was better it had a bigger screen 16 by 10 aspect ratio really thin bezels and i was also running intel's chips but because last year's intel's chips ran hot this made the product worse in my opinion than the g15 like it just wasn't worth the extra fan noise and the extra cost to pick up this thing so my personal decision was to go for the g15 last year now this year they've both been refreshed the new g15 with all its new amd stuff and the new m16 and this is rocking intel's newest stuff so the big difference this year is that intel's 12th gen chip their alder lake stuff is awesome and it made me so much more interested in checking out the new m16 and comparing it with my favorite laptop from last year so this device the g15 it hasn't changed that much on the exterior it still has this white finish as an option and i gotta say the material is actually quite durable i have a two-year-old kid who scribbled all over my old one with a marker and it came off without any issues no scratches no scuffs i think they did a good job with the durability of the material this year the keyboard has a slight iridescent finish to the keycaps like it's something that is subtle but it is different from last year's model and there's also rgb lighting on the white color option this year on the inside we're looking at ddr5 memory but it still only has a single stick that's swappable two nvme drives and mediatek wi-fi again now in terms of performance this year it's running a 6900 hs and it's about 15 faster than last year's model when you're looking at benchmarks but the more interesting thing to me was the gpu so this review unit is running an rtx 3070 ti and this is actually the first laptop i've had with one of these new ti labeled gpus and this device gets faster gpu performance than the 3080 on last year's model so it's got a lower spec'd card so a 3070 ti isn't as decked out as a 3080 but because asus is pumping more wattage into this gpu it's able to outperform the 3080 and that difference in wattage plus the addition of the new mux switch for a little extra kick gives this device great performance and every game it benchmarked was faster on the new g15 despite having a lower spec gpu compared to last year's model but the thing i was concerned about was heat because the thermal system hasn't changed it's still running liquid metal on the cpu it's got the same heat pipe system the same fans and those components were able to cool the previous g15 without any issues but when you have an extra 20 watts being fed into a system like this that is as thin and light as this it can make a difference but fortunately it keeps up it does run a little bit harder compared to last year's model but overall i don't see any issues with heat it still does blow hot air against the bottom bezel but unless you change the entire design of the laptop that's something you just have to live with i do need to mention a thing so when i first got it i threw overwatch onto it and i was playing i wasn't recording the screen i wasn't even running any logs for hardware info but i noticed the temperature spiked up to like 81.82 and there was a blip of a throttle it just happened now i couldn't recreate it and because i wasn't recording it i have no proof of this and some people are like cool story bro no pics didn't happen but it did happen now the responsible thing for me to say is that i don't think it's an issue it just happened once it could have been like a background process or something that was happening and that's why it happened but i truly could not recreate a throttle in the system after that first day now the screen has been upgraded this year they have a 240hz panel as an option it's got great colors but the brightness hasn't changed it's still only around 300 nits it's moderately bright but now they have a webcam up the top so for the people that were concerned about the lack of webcam they have it this year and it supports infrared technology so you can log in with facial biometrics to get into windows now we got to move this conversation over to the m16 because i feel like as cool as this product might be the conversation is not complete without this guy so this came in a few days ago as well same with the g15 and this is a system that is running the alder lake cpu so in terms of the exterior and the aesthetics of this device it's actually quite similar to the g15 and unchanged from last year so i'm not going to go into too much detail of it well i will say that the keyboard deck has this soft touch matte rubber finish to it which looks really nice when it's new but it picks up fingerprints very easily the screen on the m16 is also better it's bigger it's brighter it's thinner bezeled while maintaining the same surface area as the g15 this is a really nice screen but in terms of the performance this cpu is so much faster than last year's m16 and significantly faster than this new g15 the gpu situation is also a little bit different this year so last year you could only get up to a rtx 3070 at the top end i think the reason why they did it was that these systems were too hot they couldn't handle it so they couldn't put in an rtx 3080. this year you can even get up to an rtx 3080 ti on the m16 and the performance you're seeing on the system is so good the core i9 pairs really well with a 120 watt gpu now i use a program called adobe premiere to edit my videos and the g15 last year was a good performer it's kind of in the middle of the pack for performance laptops but if you compare those to this new m16 this is on a whole new level that 14 core chip is an amazing performer for multi-threaded applications but it comes with a baggage of heat and fan noise so like the m16 last year if you want the best possible performance on this system you have to crank the fans up and it gets loud [Applause] but unlike last year you still get really good performance when it's on balance mode and for me personally that extra fan noise is absolutely worth it this year so in the previous generation you had to get crazy fan noise and it was slightly better but this year for this type of performance game absolutely worth it for a render like you just flick it on render your video or do whatever it is that you need to do turn it off and that's like a huge time saver now i deal with time sensitive video content and so for me it really matters and this is a personal thing but i think for the people that are looking at a device like this and you have you know workflows that require some extra kick and you want that extra cpu boost this is so much better than the g15 now if you're just looking at this from a gamer's perspective there's no way i'd choose the m16 or the g15 it just isn't worth the price and the extra fan noise to me but for the people that are using their devices for more than just games this has awesome performance i do think there's some software tweaks that need to come in like sometimes the system isn't hot but the fans are still running and there's a slider in the rog software that feels broken it's a thermal target for the gpu that throttles it way too aggressively now in terms of battery life there's no doubt the m16 has significantly worse battery life than the g15 it's the same battery size but those amd chips are so much more energy efficient than what intel is offering right now in terms of speakers the speaker systems sound very similar between the g50 and the m16 i think they actually might be identical there are six speakers and they actually sound quite good compared to the vast majority of gaming laptops out there now my overall take on these systems g15 is still a really solid system this year but last year i just didn't even consider the m16 to be competitive but this year because intel's chips are so powerful and so capable this is a very solid system for the people looking for strong multi-threaded processing capabilities but both are solid g15 has its clear advantages as well but there you have it the g15 with the efficiency of amd's new chips and the new m16 with monster performance from intel and its big screen okay hope you guys enjoyed this video
