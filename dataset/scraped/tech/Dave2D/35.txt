okay these are the new 14 inch and 16 inch macbook pros from apple with their new chips inside them now these are the products where apple gets serious with the professionals where they give pros the gear that they need to do what they do right and you can tell right from the unboxing experience that these are going to be professional devices because in addition to the laptop you also get the new power brick and the new braided magsafe cable but you also get the ultimate token of professional apple gear the black apple sticker because if you know your apple stickers this only comes with like their real pro gear iphone pro you don't get it airpods pro you don't get it even the old macbook pros you don't get this this time because this is for pros you get the good good so you're off to a good start black apple sticker you know they mean business now if you look at the design of this product this is function over form which is unlike apple right normally they go for that svelte like super sleek elegant look this time they've just they've put that stuff aside and they focused on what would make a functional and ideal product for people that need this tool to do their job because it's thick and i love the thickness because thickness gives you ports gives you bigger batteries gives you better thermal systems in there everything's good when you go thick um okay let's start off with the displays here so this is a notch display and having used this for a little bit i feel like the notch is completely fine it's not an issue like if you have an app that's full screen the notch disappears if your black background disappears if you even have a black strip at the top of your wallpaper it disappears and if you're moving your mouse cursor just goes right through it in case you're wondering like i was like does it have to go around it like is it hard surface no it just goes right through it uh people in my last video about this they commented like why did they have the notch if you look at the dell xps products they're able to fit a camera without this notch like look this is an xps 13. i'm familiar with the xps devices this is how dell does it right they have a very small camera in the thin bezel at the top of the screen but have you seen the quality of this webcam it's awful there's no way that apple in 2021 would put a webcam of that kind of resolution into their pro device like there's absolutely no way so for them to like this is just what they have to do it sucks that doesn't have face id i don't know why maybe it's a good security thing maybe it's a thickness of device thing but if this has face id it'd be so much better but maybe in the future the image quality of this webcam is actually quite good now the panel uses the retina xdr technology so it's lit by mini leds and it's a pro motion panel so it can adaptively adjust the frame rate up to 120 frames per second so a couple things here it's a nice looking screen right it's bright it's color accurate it's fantastic but the adaptive pro motion tech is the first time i've seen it on a laptop ever like normally when i do battery tests on any of the devices i do like any laptop review i'll manually adjust the refresh rate like the hertz on the screen to 60 even if it's a gaming panel i'll drop it to 60 just so the battery test is fair and accurate this does it automatically and when it comes to battery life for extending the battery capabilities of a device doing that automatically is amazing and i think that's one of the reasons why it has the battery life that does we'll get into that in a second but this display super fast and just to test it out i just wanted to see right i threw parallels on here put overwatch on here and it is so weird to see overwatch running at like 120 frames per second on a macbook and seeing the frame rate on the screen now the windows drivers were janky so the performance isn't optimized but to be able to see 120 hertz display playing a game on a macbook is something else i want to talk about bloom real quickly so the ipad pro from a few months ago or like half a year ago had bloom issues now i looked for it so both the 16 inch and the 14 inch i was cognizant of the potential problem and actively looking for it but it's really faint like it's there but it seems very mild in comparison to what we saw on the ipad pros previously now i have a few guesses like maybe they're using a different kind of optical film behind the panel so it's like helping to diffuse that light a little bit i'm not sure or i've just gone lucky with these panels i think there's none of them really had it there's also the very real possibility that i'm old and my eyes aren't sensitive like i'm 40 right maybe i'm looking at these things i'm like bloom what bloom i don't see anything it's it's possible but i think based on what i've seen here and what i saw on the ipad previously it's not an issue this time around the keyboard so this has a very similar feel to the previous generation of macbook keyboards i like them and the layout is really good and the removal of that touch bar is like it's the best thing i never liked that touch bar hardware function keys are the best the trackpad's nice and big but it's the same size and feel as a previous generation so it'd be as you expect the speakers have also been upgraded this year they sound better but they don't like it it's not much better to me at least not to my ears but the thing is macbook's speakers are so far ahead of everybody else it's like i don't even know why they even bothered right they could have just reserved this for the future when other people caught up but they're a little better this year now in terms of ports you get three usbc's and an hdmi you also get your sd card slot i love that html i literally used it this morning so i was watching like a stream my family was watching at the bts concert and we wanted to it could only work on the safari browsers i had to pull up the macbook and they wanted to watch on the tv airplay wasn't working i'm like you know what this thing's got the port and like you know before you'd have to get the dongle people be panicking the world would be on fire but now you're like what's up port you plug it up i think people complain about the fact that it doesn't have 2.1 i don't think that's what it's for it's not for like the the best screens to be connected to it it's to be used in a pinch like if you're at work and you have a presentation you want to connect it to the projector or whatever it's it's there i love it and they also have your magsafe connector i tested the fast charge it works as advertised it fills up super quick now let's talk about performance so here are some benchmarks up front the m1 pro and m1 max are a pretty nice upgrade from the regular m1 and the cpu front and even when you're running cinebench in a loop for 30 minutes it's able to maintain the same score it's very well cooled but the bigger moves are in the graphics department if you look at the gpus in here in terms of just raw performance the m1 max has the kick of about an rtx 3060 maybe a low wattage 3070 but certainly not a 3080 and i was hoping for that that's kind of what they alluded to in their charts but because it has unified memory and unified cache it can absolutely keep up with the 3080 and maybe even excel in certain applications so it really depends on what you're using it for so here's some workflows that i tested the performance gains are always going to favor apple's own applications right so stuff like final cut and logic and even xcode for people that are developers you can do it really fast on the system but for me i don't use any of those things i use premiere and i was hoping that this would be like a render machine i thought it would just like crush them it doesn't which is kind of good because now i don't have to pay 5 000 for a new laptop thank god and i would have been tempted to if this was faster than my windows machine but for the people who would benefit from this new hardware you're in for a treat like if you use any of those apple applications or something that can really benefit from m1 pro or m1 max it's awesome and the best part of it is not just the performance it's the energy efficiency it's crazy good so i've never seen this before i've never seen a device put out this kind of performance for this little energy consumption and because it's so energy efficient the thermal system is so quiet you can barely hear them even when they're going full tilt and also with that energy efficiency comes really long battery life so they claim up to 21 hours on the 16 inch i tested them they're not as long lasting as i'd hoped but they're still the longest lasting high performance laptops ever had in the studio particularly the 16 inch this one is quite impressive so if battery life is important to you i'd push you to this direction uh now let's close off this video with one last thought it's in regards to a purchase decision because it's apple and because it's like the new new from apple i think people are gonna be tempted right you're like i i love that maybe i could use this but truth is these are these are not cheap these are professional tools they're expensive and for most people that want this but don't actually have like a like a clear and present need for it you don't need it these are just too expensive to pick up as like a fun purchase they're really cool but they're tools that's all they are okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
