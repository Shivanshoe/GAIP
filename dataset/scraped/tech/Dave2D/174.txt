hey how's it gone Dave 2d here so Microsoft came up with a bunch of new products recently but the two most interesting to me were the surface book 3 and the surface headphones two I'm going to talk about this one first and then the headphones later now if you're unfamiliar with what a surface book is it is a powerful tablet running an Intel CPU and it's got the screen and a battery inside this tablet thing but it can connect to a base and the base has an awesome keyboard it's got its own battery but most importantly and most uniquely it has a graphics card inside it like a dedicated GPU or you can get the options for dedicated GPUs now connecting the two is this very unique hinge that kind of defines the whole surface book family and is this segmented mechanism that works incredibly well for what it's meant to do which is to support a relatively heavy tablet on to this laptop - and one device now this is the third generation of it the first and second ever viewed this year they didn't change too much on the exterior but it did receive some notable performance upgrades both in hardware and software so the big one is the GPU this year they've now been upgraded to gtx 1660 TI max-q and it pumps out way better graphical performance than last year's model fairly capable in games and can be good for certain applications that can make use of the extra GPU power but there are limitations with the system because of the detachable nature of a surface book and the other thing that's been upgraded is the CPU is now running 10th gen Intel CPUs that are mildly faster than the previous generation but it is still a 4 core CPU so don't expect massive gains on that front it does have a better integrated GPU though so if you're just using the tablet component and you're not connected to the base unit you do have better graphical kick with the new 10th gen CPUs ok other things that have been upgraded it's now running faster SSDs and the Wi-Fi has been upgraded it's now running Intel branded Wi-Fi 6 instead of their older Marvell non Wi-Fi 6 stuff and they've bumped up the wattage on the AC adapter so you don't have that weird power drain that was happening on last year's 15-inch model now something that's always bugs me about the older surface models it's a minor thing but they fixed it finally it would be improved it's that there's an ejection sequence when comes to surface books we're yet to press the button wait for a little message to pop up and then you can remove it on the older ones that sequence took a while and really that featured like that functionality of a detachable screen is what defines this entire product category not just the surface book but all of the surface tablets it's just that the book is the only one with a delay and when there's a delay it ruins the whole flow right they've increased the speed of ejection significantly it's now like maybe a second before it used to be three so this is this is nice it's something that I think a lot of the users wanted to they would have liked to have seen it and they delivered I like that now there are some things they still haven't changed like there's still enough phone about three and AC adapters still using surface connect to power instead of a USBC charger I think some people really like the Microsoft Surface connect I prefer use b/c but that's just a personal preference and if you tried to swap like if you take a surface book to screen and you try to put it on this thing like the base of this it knows what you're trying to do it won't work um and the battery life surprisingly feels worse this year I only got around 7 1/2 hours with the screen at 250 nits now there are some things that they didn't change that have always been awesome so the screen it's bright its color accurate this is a really good screen with a perfect aspect ratio for this type of product they've nailed it before and it's still really good keyboard for the most part hasn't really changed the brightness and volume controls are in a different spot this year but it's an excellent keyboard I think this is one of the best keyboards in the market when it comes to any kind of laptop or two and one that trackpad is also really good Microsoft always has good track pads on their surface products and the webcam is one of the best in the business 1080p it looks great with good auto exposure the one thing that would have been nice this year would have been a higher refresh panel like I know it's not a gaming laptop clearly and I know the battery life would have been reduced even further if they stuck a panel like that into here but fast greens makes it makes everything better you eyes productivity apps everything is just a little bit smoother when you have a high refresh screen but it's not in there okay I want to close off this surface book conversation with kind of my thoughts on the product category as a whole right now Microsoft executes this thing really well there's stuff missing from and it's not perfect but Microsoft usually does a very good job with surface books and this year it's just that much better however I will say that in 2020 if you're looking at a product like this like the the market ish has shifted a little bit like nowadays you can buy six or eight core laptops that are thin and light and very powerful that are cheaper than something like this and they just they just deliver they deliver performance they deliver power that this thing cannot because of the form factor now a few years ago when the surface books first came out the products themselves were relatively powerful for its time nowadays because these things have four core CPUs and because there's thermal limitations of a design like this these things have fallen behind in terms of just raw performance compared to the other things that are out there because you can pick up something like an XPS or a razor blade or any of the half-dozen premium thin and light performance laptops out there and just get a surface tablet and you'd have two devices but you'd have two really capable devices for those two different needs this surface book 3 is super cool but it's actually kind of weird to have a GPU that's capable like this paired with a fork or 15 watt CPU normally companies don't do this but Microsoft has to do it because there's thermal limitations they can't put anything more powerful in the screen like the the chip has to be a particular wattage so if you're gonna pick something like this up make darn sure they're gonna make good use of the detach ability because if you're not there's probably a better product or combination of products that's better for you ok enough about the surface book 3 let's talk about surface headphones - everyone's talking about these black ones the gray ones are so much cooler I feel like black headphones are everywhere a nice gray colored headphone like this not that common so I went for the great ones I think these are so much better than the previous generation they're cheaper they sound better and they have noticeably improved battery life like the old ones were barely getting 10 hours these are almost hitting 20 hours from my use it's a winner now the reason why I'm drawn to this device in the first place is its design aesthetic it looks really clean and it's got these nice mechanical controls of sound so you can increase volume or decrease volume by spinning it and on the other side you have noise cancellation you can crank it up to remove an ambient sound or some kind of constant environmental noise or you can crank it the other way to amp up your environmental sounds like a voice or someone who's talking to you while you have these on or just sounds in general and they work quite well they're very comfortable they're also quite durable it's got a metal headband it's got premium quality plastic the whole thing feels really solid and the microphone is also good like if you're taking a call in it sounds clean and the the sound that you're like whatever conversation are having on that mic it gets projected to the earphones you can actually hear yourself talking so you don't scream super loud like in this unnatural way it feels very natural when you're using this device okay so this is what I sound like through the mic on these headphones the good thing is that I can hear my own voice like my voice is being piped into the headphones as I talk but if I turn like the noise cancellation back on ya know it's all muffled you guys can't hear a difference but for me I feel like I'm just talking in a like in an enclosed muffled room and I can't hear anything there is like a tweak that I do want the surface had fun to that I don't know if everyone's gonna like this but it's got touch controls on the left and right I remove that completely because I feel like I accidentally hit that stuff all the time I just don't have touch controls that's just how I roll and with that tweak it makes these my favorite over your headphones available right now I really like them okay that's the surface headphone - this was a surface book 3 hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs have you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
