[Music] okay today's a big day for gaming laptops we have new cpus from intel new cpus from amd and of course new gpus from nvidia their new rtx 30 series for laptops now this type of upgrade scenario doesn't happen very often normally you have like a cpu upgrade and then half a year later you get a gpu upgrade and it just flip-flops between the two this is like the perfect alignment where they all refreshed at once so if you get something new this year you're going to get something that lasts a little bit longer than normal in front of me is a stack of laptops these are the premium gaming laptops from asus and here's the thing before today like there's pre-briefings right for journalists you kind of hear about what companies going to bring out and then we kind of deliver the news to you every company is coming with some cool stuff right now but asus is doing something a little bit different they did a full refresh of their entire lineup and it's amd across the board so i wanted to get these things in to show to you guys because this is something special so at the top is the stuff that i'm personally most interested in but i think at the bottom there's gonna be stuff that i know a lot of you guys are gonna be interested in just because of the price point so at the top we have the new asus g15 so last year they had the g14 very popular device uh it was like one of the first good amd based gaming laptops right it kind of changed the way that we perceived what amd could deliver in a laptop this is the 15 inch version g15 and it comes in two colors obviously the white which i'm partial to as well as a gray now this year it's been redesigned properly so it has the same kind of design language and styling as the popular g14 from last year so it has that magnesium alloy body as well as the perforated top panel so you can kind of see the little dots on the back of it this one does not have the anime matrix like the thing you can light up the little dots in the back that's still only on the 14 but the internals are where it gets special so this is running the new amd 5900h eight cores 16 threads and this device can be equipped with up to an rtx 3080. now they will not allow me to benchmark it they want the drivers to be finalized before i showcase these numbers to you but having seen this thing and having just played with it a little bit i don't think they really needed me to wait i feel like if i just show this you guys you guys would be impressed but we'll wait uh okay and that's just the case for all these these are all engineering samples so i'm held back by i guess uh review embargoes until you guys can see the actual data so battery in here 90 watt hours it also has capable or capability for 100 watt usbc charging if you have access to it but it still uses a barrel plug that's what comes out of the box but this is a very very capable system it's not like the lightest and thinnest thing out there but i've always liked like i like the g14 because of the styling not just because of the color i think a lot of people that watch my videos are like oh you just like it because it's white no it's because when you have a magnesium alloy case and you have like those plastic components as well but it just feels super tanky i don't feel like there's any fragility or kind of delicate feeling to this i it's just that's why i like these devices so much okay the g14 has also been updated this has retained the uh the shape and styling of the one last year so it's just an updated version of it but there's a couple things that they've added relatively minor so there's a kind of prismatic or iridescent glow to some of the metal accents but the big upgrades are on the inside so once again amd 5900 or 5800h cpus and the gpu can be upgraded to i believe in rtx 3060. now both of these devices the g14 and the 15 have upgraded screens so you get a 1080p 144 hertz panel i kind of like the baseline or if you want to be fancy 1440p 165hz panels with crazy good color accuracy so the g15 can supposedly hit hundred percent dci p3 which is fantastic for a high refresh high resolution gaming panel like that's something i got to see so i'll be honest if this is as good as they claim particularly with the screens i'm going to be tempted to switch over to one of these maybe even the 14 inch because this kind of power and portability is quite unique you don't get this in anyone else right you just cannot get this size with this kind of gaming and video editing performance okay moving on we have the zephyrus duo this is the double screen gaming laptop and it's got that tilting screen so when you open it up the screen pops up just a little bit to give you a better viewing angle now this machine has also been updated to amd cpus as well as the best nvidia rtx gpu so you have rtx 3080 but the interesting thing to me is that this is a device that is like the best of the best and even when it came to a premium product like this they've updated with amd which unlike last year i don't know if you guys watched my channel last year but that was my biggest complaint right every laptop company was still using intel chips despite amd being the clear and kind of better choice for the consumers it was so hard to find a premium gaming laptop with amd but everything it's all amd okay so amd 5900h rtx 3080 it's gonna pump out crazy numbers this was the first one i opened up when they all came in i was like i gotta check this thing out it delivers it delivers uh it still has the the trackpad on the right so if you're left-handed you're still screwed so the screen's got a couple options there's a 4k 120 hertz panel as well as a 1080p 300 hertz panel so if you need the speed you have it available on this machine the cooling system so they've added a second air intake underneath this smaller screen and it's running liquid metal so the performance on this device this year should be improved okay let's move on to the next device so this is pretty cool this is a 13-inch ultrabook looking device called the flow x13 and it looks pretty tame right 13 inch device magnesium alloy it's like an ultrabook and it opens up to be a two in one it can be folded all the way back to become a tablet but this kind of product isn't new i mean this doesn't even look like a gaming product at all it is running amd's new 5000 series chips which is cool you know eight core not a ton of wattage so it can't sustain a ton of boost but if you'll notice there's an interesting port over here and this changes what this device can do so this can be connected to this okay so let me explain this is an external gpu and it's running an rtx 3080 inside this very small package now let me explain my thoughts on this device there was a time like three years ago when i was personally interested in external gpus i did a lot of videos on them and there was this belief a personal belief that this was going to be the future external gpus would be the future for laptop gaming and there were a lot of attempts by multiple companies to try to bring it to life but it never became mainstream because of i guess two or three reasons number one it's expensive right you gotta get an enclosure for it which costs money then you gotta put your gpu in it which obviously costs money but then the performance that you get from your external gpu is heavily crippled by a thunderbolt 3 connection it's like the the let's say you buy an rtx 3080 you lose like 20 25 of that performance just because of that connection this delivers in a completely different way so this is a connection that delivers double the bandwidth of thunderbolt 3. and the box is small it houses a laptop 3080 it's got a full set of ports on the back and an sd card reader the port however is proprietary so you're dependent on asus supporting this thing hopefully they continue with it but this makes so much more sense to me than a traditional external gpu right now it's just that idea was sound like a traditional external gpu enclosure but this is this is so much better and if you have this system if you're fortunate enough to pick something like this up this gives you an extremely versatile setup right you got this crazy ultrabook you have this extremely powerful jeep you can connect it up to you can squeeze all of the juice out of that gpu because of this connection you don't lose any of that performance okay so that is the flow x13 now i can't test this thing out because this seems to be much more dependent on drivers than all the other stuff so the performance on this thing we'll have to wait for a future review but the idea is it's on point i love it okay let's move on so the next thing is the asus tuff a15 now this is a device okay so i have if you've seen my kind of like uh laptop rating video i did at the end of last year i did not rate the a15 very well because of one big issue thermal issues and this is a very popular laptop this was in certain parts of the world the best-selling gaming laptop last year likely because of the price point it comes in quite inexpensive but i didn't love the thermals they changed it heavily now i cannot open this i've been told not to open this i want to so badly because i took a peek and like you can see it maybe i'll just open it for you guys asus i'm sorry but i just have to show my audience the insides because i know they're going to appreciate this so we have a completely redesigned thermal system we have way more heat pipes we have a third exhaust it now vents out the side as well and we have new fans they're made with a better material they have a better design they have more fan blades the whole thermal system is just significantly better so if you've been eyeing this system and because it's got the new amd cpu as well as the new nvidia gpus this year would probably be a great year to get it assuming the pricing doesn't creep up because this stuff probably doesn't come for free right all the materials even the copper alone just to make the extra heat pipes and stuff it all costs but hopefully they've kept this thing as a inexpensive entry-level device uh the the logo has also changed so it's no longer that weird wing shaped logo it's more like modern looking design and you still have that tough on the side but yeah clean looking laptop which i think a lot of people are going to enjoy the next device is another rg tough model this is brand new for this year it's the dash f15 so the traditional gaming laptop right you have a kind of performance gpu for playing games and then you're often forced to purchase a high-end cpu to go along with it like an eight core or sometimes like a six core cpu but those components are expensive and they run hot and it's like they're difficult to cool and that's what makes gaming laptops the challenge that they are and the price tag that they are this one removes that expensive cpu and put something that's a little bit more reasonably priced these are equipped with tiger lake intel cpus and they're four core cpus but they're still equipped with high-end rtx 30 gpus so you get a system that should be a little bit cheaper should be a little bit easier to cool so it's thinner and lighter and it still plays games very well because the main thing is the gpu for most games right this is a model that i think more companies should try to adopt it's like this uh kind of like mid-tier gaming laptop that still retains like the thin and light profile but it doesn't cost a ton now pricing for all this stuff is unknown at this point but just from what i've been told this is not going to be like a super expensive premium model but it still has that like kind of classic zephyrus look it's a nice one and it comes in white also the lighting on this thing is teal so if you ask me this is clearly the best laptop in the world but for most people who don't edit videos or you don't use applications that can take advantage of a lot of cpu cores this is a really good option especially for the kind of mid to lower price point gaming laptops okay let's close this off with these devices so these are the strix laptops there's a 15-inch model as well as a 17-inch model and these tend to be a little bit thicker asus doesn't focus too much on keeping these guys like super thin they have good performance but they tend to be a little bit chunkier they of course have the new amd cpus also running liquid metal as well as up to an rtx 3070 and the displays on these go up to a 300hz 1080p panel or a 1440p panel and of course you have the underglow i know the strix laptops have a relatively unique glow that some people like and if that's your jam these deliver that now there's also a scar edition so this is kind of like the premium version of the strix devices it's the same kind of idea in terms of the shape and design language but this one has a removable like back cap over here so you can swap them out with different magnetically connectable end caps and they include a few different colors in the box and there's also on the inside a optomechanical keyboard this is the first time i've seen it from asus i've used a few other devices with this type of keyboard and it's just like a very clicky tactile mechanical keyboard it's not for everyone because it does make your keyboard usage a little bit louder but it is available if you're interested in it and there's also this pretty cool semi-translucent component to the keyboard deck i think it looks quite nice now the screen so this has also been upgraded compared to the strix like the regular strix this has a 360 hertz option so it's like a super fast screen and it can be upgraded to an rtx 3080 if you need that extra gpu performance on this kind of laptop but that is the lineup i feel like this year like two things come to mind number one i feel like asus is the company that like they were one of the first to do this whole amd push right and i feel like this year they're bringing that chip to all of their devices i love that it's like it's it's amd time i like to see that i like to see the competition not that i want to you know take a dump on intel but they're giving us amd options even in their top of the line premium products now which is really nice to see but the second thing that comes to mind is pricing so i obviously don't know any of the price on all of these devices but there's a part of me that's worried that the pricing is going to go up like last year amd devices were not that they were super cheap but they were well priced reasonably priced and i'm afraid because at this point amd knows that they have something really good and not just that they know they have something really good they know that we know that they have something really good so because we all want this stuff now because amd's options are so good i'm afraid that pricing will bump up a little bit but we will have to see okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
