okay so the title of this video has the pro in brackets it's both the iphone 12 and the iphone 12 pro in one video and when i first started using these phones i had originally planned on doing two separate reviews one for the pro one for the non-pro but as i use these phones more i realized that they had to be done in one video for me on my channel this had to be a one video because there's so much that's like intertwined between these two phones there's so many things in common between them they have the same flat edge design the same dimensions same screen size same screen res the same notch sizes same magsafe compatibility same charging speeds they even have the same charging brick so clearly there's a lot in common between these two phones so if you have a conversation about one it's just highly dependent on the other now if you take a step back and you look at the pricing the iphone 12 is an 800 phone and for 25 more pay a thousand bucks and get the iphone 12 pro now for apple this is a little strange to have phones that have a pretty different price point but to have such a similar feature set but here's the thing i don't think this was the original plan i think for apple the iphone 12 pro was supposed to be a more substantial step up from the iphone 12. like this was supposed to have a 120 hertz display we saw the rumors in the summer this was going to have the high refresh screen but somehow it didn't make it to these units whether it's a supply chain issue or whatever the reason being these don't have high refresh screens so it's pushed the 12 pro closer to the 12 in terms of feature set and keep that in mind because it's going to come back into play towards the end of the video now both of these phones are excellent iphones i love the flat edges and the super flat screen the form factor is really nice and the pacific blue on the pro is just a phenomenal color this is like it's so hard to showcase this thing properly in videos it's something you get to see in real life but this is a really really nice looking color to me and the displays on these phones are very similar they're both 6.1 inches high resolution oled tech they're nearly impossible to tell apart the iphone 12 pro gets a little bit brighter but i think the vast majority of people will find both of these screens really really good and seriously indistinguishable unless you're looking at them side by side and really looking for a difference in regards to ceramic shield that's the tech where apple claims a four times improvement in drop protection that may be the case for drops and like shattered glass but in terms of scratches i don't think there's a noticeable improvement at least not for me i had this in my pocket in the same side as my keys i normally try to separate it but occasionally your phone goes into your key pocket right and i got a scratch it's unfortunate but if you are someone who cares about this kind of stuff you're still going to need a kind of screen protector there's a new one from dbrand that uses tempered glass and it has a really good fit on these devices now in terms of the battery both of these devices have the same battery size they're both around 2800 milliamp hours and the iphone 12 lasts longer than the iphone 12 pro the 11 pro with the bigger battery and the smaller screen lasts the longest but the 12 pro is kind of short i don't know why i can't explain it maybe it's a difference in software tweaks maybe it's the extra ram on the pro maybe the screens are actually more different than it seems on paper but that's just that's just what i'm getting right now in terms of 4g versus 5g connectivity i can only test for 4g up here in canada so the battery life is good but i have no idea what it'd be like if i connected these two 5g towers now magsafe the tech is neat but it's not super impressive to me i haven't seen anything from the magsafe accessories that really jump out to me as being like you know i gotta have this right now the magnetically attached wireless charging is nice but it's not it doesn't feel super new to me i originally thought though that having a ring of magnets on the back of your phone isn't it doesn't impede anything right for the people that don't want to use magsafe anything it doesn't change the phone experience but i don't know because having a series of magnets embedded into the chassis of these phones it has to take up some room in there right maybe they have to use smaller batteries in there this year to implement magsafe so it's cool that it's there but i think we have to wait a little bit to see the true potential of what this tech is going to bring to the iphone ecosystem now onto the cameras the difference between these two phones lies in the camera system they both now have low light ultrawides it's something that the iphone 11s and the 11 pros really lacked and they have them now they are pretty good but they're not amazing right i feel like ultra wide photography done in low light conditions is really tough there's just a lot of data that has to collect and there's not a lot of light when it's dark and it's a difficult shot to do the iphone 12 and the iphone 12 pro handle them reasonably well now in terms of the regular wide lens because the 12 pro has the lidar scanner it often shoots better when it comes to tough conditions and in terms of portrait photography it can also take advantage of that tech it'll focus faster and give the system better depth information now in terms of the regular photos i find that the 12 and the 12 pro shoot better than last year's iphones particularly it comes to shots with more dynamic range as well as shots that are showing more detail there's just more clarity in the shots taken from the iphone 12s [Music] the 12 pro does have the benefit of the 2x optical zoom but they can both shoot in something called dolby vision hdr now because i use adobe premiere and it can't even handle this new kind of footage i can't show it to you at least not unless i use a completely different editing program but this tech is seemingly quite good so john from tld he shot a pretty cool hdr video with these phones that i'll link below but it's tech that isn't easy to kind of visualize right now because not a lot of phones can even support this type of visual experience but the iphone 12s can shoot view and edit it all on the device now i want to talk about pricing this is a very important part of the conversation the iphone 12 at 800 is an expensive phone certainly not cheap but it's a well-rounded phone this year it's a strangely well-rounded phone and i use the word strangely because it has such a similar feature set to the more expensive 12 pro the significantly more expensive 12 pro so the 12 gets an easy recommendation for me if you've been eyeing it and you can afford it it's a it's a very solid phone the 12 pro when i first saw this on day one my kind of knee-jerk reaction is it's overpriced it's too similar in feature set to the 12 but once you match the storage option you're getting a better build quality you're getting a more robust camera system although battery life is slightly less you're not paying a huge amount of money for that extra 12 pro experience but there is one last kind of twist to this story at the beginning of the video i talked about how this phone was likely going to be upgraded to a 120 hertz panel next year right i think those panels will only appear in the pro options like that would be the best way for apple to distinguish their pro phones from the non-pro phones that's my guess so if you're someone who cares about high refresh screens and you buy one of these this year when the iphone 13 pro whatever they call it when that comes out next year you're gonna be extremely tempted to buy that one as well and so a phone that should last three four five years is now going to last one year now this is only for people that care about high refresh screens and on this channel i think a lot of my viewers do i'm just putting it out there so if you're someone who's drawn to either of these phones this year keep that in mind because this year the phones are weirdly similar but next year i think the difference will be more substantial possibly in price as well and that is my iphone 12 and 12 pro review hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
