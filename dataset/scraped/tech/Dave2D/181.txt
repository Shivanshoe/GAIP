all right so next year we're probably seeing a new breed of MacBook and this is an important one so I thought I'd make a video for the people that are interested in laptops and Mac books but also for people that are interested in buying a laptop this year you want to hear this stuff because this may affect your purchase decision so the rumors have been floating around forever but we've gotten some really good confirmation recently from maangchi quo we're going to be seeing an ARM based MacBook in 2021 now the difference for the people that are unfamiliar with the stuff the difference between a Intel based Mac book which is every single MacBook that's available right now versus an ARM based one is the chip inside so instead of an Intel or AMD processor this would be running a custom processor designed by Apple in-house completely customized to whatever their needs or wants are and they would go to control this whole process from top to bottom so as an example Apple's iPads their iPhones their Apple watches those all run custom processors that are also ARM based and all three of those devices are very capable and powerful computers well what's a computer but very capable computing devices now if you look at their chips they're incredibly powerful and the devices are very well tuned between the hardware and software like the synergy between them and how to communicate is very well done because the hardware and the software was made by the same company so it's got some it's got some really nice advantages going on there with the mac books they don't they don't get that opportunity because the chips were made by Intel and even though Apple spends a lot of time tuning and tweaking their software they're still working with the processor that they themselves did not make so the rumors that have come out from Ming Chico are saying that there's three Mac products that are being developed right now that have custom chips based off of the upcoming a 14 so this is 5 nanometer tech that's incredibly powerful and the question would be why right a lot of you guys might be like why would Apple want to do something like this and there's three really like super huge advantages that a product like this would deliver the first thing is performance Apple's arm-based processors have incredible performance if you look at the iPad pro and even the iPhone 11 the benchmark incredibly well like these are phones and tablets that can push out similar scores to an intel-based laptop so clearly the performance is there but the other thing that comes along with that performance is incredibly good power efficiency if you look at that iPad pro score that was done off a device that does not have a fan its passively cooled and I wouldn't be surprised if these new MacBooks also run without fans and without the need for big heat pipes and with that energy efficiency comes great battery life because that's one of the best things of arm-based processors they just don't they just don't drink a lot of juice so when you have a laptop with an ARM based processor in it I wouldn't be surprised if this thing hits like 16 18 hours of advertised battery life from Apple which would be amazing and way longer than any laptop that Apple has put out to date another advantage that comes with this type of custom chip is control so you get to control that whole design process like I said but right now when Apple comes out with a laptop and they're like hey this is the new you know 2020 MacBook whatever they're entirely dependent on what Intel brought them right if Intel came out with a really cool chip that year that's got 2 4 extra cores everyone's like yeah that's awesome but sometimes they come out with chips Intel comes with new chips that are like 5% better than the previous generation 10% better and Apple now has to market that right they now have to deliver a product to the consumer that's like mildly better than the previous generation and that I mean that's never that's never good for anyone other than Intel selling those chips you're on year when you make your own stuff you can guarantee that you'll be able to deliver better performance every year if you want there's also the flipside where if Apple wants to you know they want to twist things a little bit they can stagger their performance increases the way they want to but the general idea is that you are no longer dependent on someone else to improve your product every year and the other thing is security like if you think about you guys may know of Apple's t1 and t2 trips the reason why Apple puts those chips into their laptops is for security because Intel has some vulnerabilities with some of their stuff so they put the t1 and t2 chips in here to keep stuff secure and handle stuff like you know fingerprint identification microphone control camera control all the stuff that might be a little bit sensitive it's handled by an ARM chip that Apple developed and a lot of users take that stuff for granted or just don't even care about it but it really is something that Apple takes seriously the whole thing about security and privacy so they spent the time and energy and effort to put that stuff into their laptops and now when they make their own chips it's just it's built right into the SOC so that's another advantage but the big advantage for me and the stuff I'm looking at it is price so when you build your own processors when you design you get that stuff made through your own supply chains it's cheaper and Intel stuff is quite expensive even like the base model MacBooks or you know two three hundred bucks a pop for the chip so for Apple to be able to find some way to get around that pricing it could lower the pricing of these Mac books whether or not Apple kind of pockets that difference or passes those savings on down to the consumers something we'll find out next year but my gut feeling is that they'll actually want people to buy these devices because they need that user base for the for the obstacle the big obstacle when it comes to this and a lot of articles been written about this is the adoption of this new ARM based ecosystem by developers like well developers actually make applications and recompile and retool all the stuff that they do to utilize this new processor and this is where I feel like I have a little bit of of knowledge that I'd like to share with you guys not knowledge through Apple but just knowledge through my previous work I think developers will have no problem hopping on board apples very good at convincing their developers to get on board with new movements like this and that's not because Apple is like a super friendly or coddling company it's just that if you don't move with them you're just gonna get cut right and apples very like when they do stuff like this they're all in they focus on their their goal like they want ARM based Mac books they're just gonna make it happen they don't want use PA anymore they're just gonna make it happen they're they're good like that and people just they fall along the developers they go in with it it's not going to be super easy but I think it'll be relatively smooth from the user experience we're not gonna see like it's gonna be it'll be ok that's how I feel like it'll be now I think a lot of people that are doubtful this they look at this product as an example this is the surface pro X from Microsoft this is came out in 2019 this is a ARM based surface product and this did not do nearly as well as they had hoped I think because it's just a different user base it's different development like everything's different you can't compare this to an ARM based Apple product because it's Apple that's just how they roll now this only applies to the Mac books to start not the MacBook Pros I think that they're gonna support Intel and possibly AMD chips with their MacBook Pro lineup for a while for a good while but it's just you know the the entry-level consumer stuff I think they're gonna be switching over to armed next year and if you're interested in a laptop now you know that this something this is something exists so the takeaway is this if you're someone that's like a casual MacBook user you just want something with a keyboard it runs Mac OS and it's got a good screen and decent performance and it has crazy good battery life I'd consider holding out until next year's MacBook or whatever they call it comes out hopefully it's not called MacBook arm but whatever it is I think is gonna be a very interesting product and I think will be a good fit for a lot of kind of casual Apple users and it's not just you know cool to see it come out but I want to see how this how does this affect the entire Apple ecosystem over time okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs if you loved it I'll see you guys next time [Music]
