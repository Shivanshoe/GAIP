okay let's talk about the oneplus nord this is a phone that is very easy to like very easy to recommend i think a lot of reviewers are going to be crowning the oneplus nord as like the best android smartphone in this kind of price point in the four or 500 price point this is the king for 2020. it's that good and if you look at the performance to the price nothing really beats it there's stuff that's comparable right a lot of people are bringing up you know phone x phone why it's got similar hardware but if you're looking for someone that has really clean software great support years of software support this kind of sticks out as being something special it's so good to the point where even its own brother or cousin like the oneplus 8 the regular oneplus 8 this looks weirdly overpriced in comparison to the oneplus nord uh so the way i'm doing this video is i'm going to do a mini review of this phone and then i want to talk about a purchase decision because there's there's there's stuff i want to talk about all right let's talk about the good first the screen 90 hertz super fluid very fast flat edges there's no accidental miss clicks or swipes like i frequently get on the oneplus 8 pro the build is good it feels very one plus like the actual heft and weight of the device feels good feels like a solid device but it definitely looks less premium to me like the texture on the side trim like it's a plastic trim so there's just a bit of a kind of wobble to the finish it's not like a perfectly smooth finish like it would be if it was metal and it just gives this slightly less premium look to it if you're being picky and if you're looking for it but the actual build of the phone seems quite good for one with a plastic frame the back material is glass and i like it i don't think there's kind of issues with a plastic framed phone like this at least not structurally it's never going to be as strong as a metal phone for sure right but i think they did good for a 450 dollar phone the battery on this thing is excellent it charges up really fast it took just over 50 minutes to go from zero to 100 like the full fill up and the screen on time nine maybe ten hours some days it's just a very comfortable full day battery the processor so this was where i thought there'd be some deficiencies but it is quite hard to notice a difference like this is from someone who's looking for differences right so there's the occasional hiccup when you're watching embedded videos on certain websites if you're on reddit and you're scrolling and there's a video playing sometimes it can stutter for a split second and for gaming i thought there'd be a more noticeable difference like when they mentioned that the snapdragon 765 you know you would notice it most in 3d games you can notice it but it's not like the games are unplayable like i'd be very content playing most games on this phone the snapdragon 765 is perfectly good so some things i don't like the mono speaker i mentioned this in my preview but it's something that i personally value like i like my stereo sound when i'm using my phone in landscape and you don't get it with this phone uh it doesn't have wireless charging doesn't have any water resistance it's not the biggest deal but i do miss wireless charging in particular and i don't like the vibration motor it's quite weak so if you're someone who prefers strong haptic feedback on their phone you'll be a little bit disappointed with the one on the oneplus nord all right camera system this is uh it's a fairly good camera system i don't think it was something that was unexpected right i think that the photos that are coming off this thing are pretty much what i would have expected from a four or five hundred dollar oneplus phone now oneplus is marketing it as a flagship camera it's the headlining feature they have on their website but when you put it against some legit flagship cameras it doesn't really hold up the images are very similar to the oneplus 8 i'd say it's a bit softer and the colors look a little flatter on the nord the ultrawide camera isn't as good to me so the images look more washed out here it's nice to have like i always prefer ultrawides over zooms but the actual image quality on this ultrawide sensor isn't fantastic i think the oneplus 8 shoots better ultrawides than the nord and same thing goes for the 8 pro and like the iphone 11 obviously those shoot noticeably better ultra wides than the nord the low light photos are pretty good i actually think that the night shot photos are cleaner on the nord than the oneplus 8. i was a little surprised by that the photos just keep a lot of the detail even in really dark conditions now the macro lens the third lens going down is terrible like if you look at the oneplus 8 pro those macro photos are fantastic that's like top tier macro photography on a smartphone compared to this thing the nord it's just really bad and take a look at this photo this was done on the pixel 3a it's using their ai zoom feature but you can get pretty good detail to the same kind of zoom as the macro lens on the oneplus 8 pro not as good as the apro but noticeably better than this two megapixel sensor garbage on the oneplus nord i can't help but imagine an alternate scenario where the oneplus nord instead of having six cameras had three maybe even just two cameras one on the front one in the back forget the zooms and ultra wise just one really good sensor so the camera system the oneplus nord is good but i would consider it to be like a b-tier camera system it's not on par with like a pixel or the iphone 11's or the p40 pro from huawei or even its own oneplus 8 pro those are all truly flagship camera systems this is not so if you're in the market and you're looking for this phone you you want to buy it you've pre-ordered it or you plan on pre-ordering it the camera system is it is what it is just be aware of what you're getting and if it's legitimately important to you like if photography is something that's very valuable to you i would look somewhere else as attractive as this phone is for its price point i'd go for like a pixel 3a or even the upcoming foray because those are those are those take better photos okay there's one other thing i want to talk about it just popped into my mind just before i hit record on the camera here it was the idea of like what's next how does oneplus position their upcoming oneplus 9 or oneplus 9 pro like if you take like this is so good and it's it makes other phones look weirdly overpriced right how do you sell a one plus nine or one plus nine pro in the future alongside this phone that's only in like i don't know six seven months it's not super far away it just popped into my mind like how are they gonna do it what do you think what do you think is gonna be the distinguishing feature between the nines like the nine and the nine pro and the nord do you think it's like just camera system cause like that's the biggest difference right now right at least between the eight pro and the nord how do they do it okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
