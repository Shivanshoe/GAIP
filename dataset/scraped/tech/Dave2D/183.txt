so Apple has this new $400 iPhone and I feel like it's gonna be an incredibly important phone this year not just for Apple not just for like iOS users that are hoping to upgrade not even for Android users that want to upgrade it's for the entire phone industry because when you look at that phone you look at the specs that they've put into this iPhone se it really feels like a completely different type of like decision-making went into this device it feels like a hey how much can we pack into a $400 phone how much can we give our customers for that money like what do people actually want at that price point and that's not normally what we see the typical thinking it feels is with any kind of brand-name phone it's what crazy amount of tech can we stuff into this phone and then how much can we sell it for what's the highest price we can jack this thing up to before people stop buying it that really feels like the the trend that we've seen for the past five six years it's just crazy increase in price of all the flagship phones like $1,200 $1,500 now we're seeing $2,000 smart phones these are the phones at the top end right the premium expensive stuff but when these brands make their mid to your market phones like the four or five hundred other phones they have to these phones so hard so that the top-end stuff doesn't look terrible in value by comparison right you got to make that you got to make the $400 phones appropriately Specht out so that the super expensive stuff looks good but last year there was an exception the pixel 3/8 and I thought that this was one of the most important phones that came out last year because it was a phone that prioritized the camera when I did the video on this thing I remember thinking I'd like to see Apple's response I want to see what Apple does now knowing that there is a $400 phone out there with a killer camera and I think the iPhone se is the response maybe not direct right maybe this was planned a long time ago maybe it was never really in response to the pixel 3a but I love what this thing brings and I hope it becomes a thing right I want more smartphone companies to have this mindset of like hey how good when experience can we deliver for 400 bucks instead of this idea of like hey how do we had we con people into buying $2,000 smartphones right those are very different mindsets and I'd like I that the thing I find most interesting is I don't think there's a lot of companies that can pull this off like if you think about Apple think about what's going on here when they have a $400 smartphone that's it on the shelf with the rest of the lineup if you're a potential customer you walk into an Apple store there are people out there that were gonna buy an iPhone 11 or maybe an iPhone 11 Pro and now they see this yeah I'll go for that hell yeah I'll save like the four or five six hundred bucks I will buy the cheaper $400 phone so they're losing some revenue in that sense but they're probably getting a huge chunk of people that would never even considered an Apple phone but now they got a $400 option and they come over so if you think about how many other companies are willing to make a good $400 smart phone that makes the rest of their lineup look weirdly overpriced right not many and maybe that's the play maybe that's Apple's ultimate like Jack move where they're like hey smartphone industry we don't even care about Hardware anymore like yeah we've got our expensive stuff but we'll sell this cheap thing it doesn't matter of what you got it doesn't matter if you come up with your snapdragon 10030 two gigs of ram it doesn't matter because we have a four hundred dollar smartphone that people want to buy and when people buy this thing we can sell them services and that's how Apple can make their money so this whole idea of a $400 smartphone is just like this is gonna this is gonna change so many things in the industry I love it and I'm just I want to see how this thing plays out now it's probably not a phone that's for the hardcore tech enthusiasts right it's got a big forehead big chin and the screen itself is lackluster compared to the amazing options we have available but a lot of people just don't care about that stuff it does have wireless charging it does have water resistance and it does have that superfast 813 processor can shoot 4k 60 video and because it's an Apple iPhone is gonna have years of software support it's like I'm expecting five plus years of software updates like what other $400 smartphone can boast that right like to have that kind of software support for that many years that's iPhone for you now there is one thing that I feel like Apple kind of left out like these hey you got one in its the fact that they don't have a night mode on the iPhone se like with that a13 processor with the knurl engine I feel like they could have done it maybe but it's not in there and there's also I feel like some collateral damage when it comes to the iPhone I see like the existence of this $400 smartphone heavily affects the resale market of everything not just iPhones but every phone out there right especially the older like the ones that like the iPhone se like the eight the seven the six asked the six all of those like those are worth very little now because of this $400 phone and even the more expensive iPhones and Android phones the whole market just gets shifted around a little bit because of the existence of this phone which is kind of interesting but this is the thing that's most interesting to me what is androids answer to this what is an equivalent $400 smartphone like I've been thinking about this the closest thing that came up to was the pixel 3/8 right but that's you there's there's some deficiencies with that product that the iPhone se does not have like particularly processing strength and the new one the pixel for a-1 that eventually comes out that's probably the closest stuff because when you try to look at everyone else in this space right any other 400 micron there's a half-dozen phones out there that are really good but they all can't compete with this iPhone se at least I don't think it can like you need a phone from a reputable company that's gonna last with good software support who who's doing that at 400 bucks I'm not saying that can't be done and this is why this is so cool because I think companies will try to step in I mean they have to if you don't you lose right someone's gonna like every company now has to compete with the $400 iPhone okay hope you guys enjoyed this
