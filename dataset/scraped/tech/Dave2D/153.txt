yo we got to talk about the pixel 4a i know they don't shoot videos on weekends i'm shooting this off of a phone uh but i feel like this is just something i it's just right on the tip of my mind i got to talk about it with you guys so earlier today a tweet comes out it's from ishwan he's a reasonably reliable leaker he doesn't leak a lot but the stuff he does bring out is usually quite accurate so he's saying pixel 4a priced at 350 bucks us dollars and that is a crazy crazy price so it's not just the price tag right it to me it's like the it's what it represents we always knew the pixel 4 was going to come out it was going to be an inexpensive phone with a fantastic camera we expected it and we were looking forward to it but it comes in at 350 bucks now the thing that this is representative of at least to me is google's commitment to just doing their best to win market share over apple's iphones that price tag is purposefully like it you know they did it because apple's iphone se is priced at 3.99 3.99 if apple never came out with that 400 se this year i'm pretty sure google would have priced the pixel the pixel 4a at the same price as last year there's no reason to to put it to 350 bucks but look at this now we have like competition at this part of the market this is this is awesome um oh my god there's so much stuff running through my mind 350 bucks like the specs on that thing the cpu is unremarkable but six gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage with a killer camera if you saw my last few videos of like uh the oneplus nord we'll talk about that in a second but you could tell that the camera on the pixel 3a just it just crushes it it's it's something else now the other thing i want to talk about was is the upcoming release date so they're launching this thing on august 3rd so monday a tech release on a monday is extraordinarily rare just it just doesn't happen i don't know exactly why but tech companies usually drop their stuff middle of the week or sometimes end of the week pixel 3a came out on a tuesday pixel 4 came out at a thursday i believe mondays are rare i think the reason why they're doing a monday like the august 3rd i think this is this is crazy but i think it's because they want to pop out this phone to stop people from buying the oneplus nord so the oneplus nord is uh it's already announced everything but the actual sale date is august 4th the tuesday it's available to go on their website to purchase on august 4th and i think google's dropping this thing on august 3rd just to be like bam what's up you looking for this you're looking for a cheap phone that has everything now i think damn there's there's just so much i think this is gonna be a crazy i think they're gonna send a they're going to sell so many of these phones headphone jack plastic phone a small phone one hand operatable this one's going to crush and 350 bucks anyways i wanted to just share my thoughts on this thing i think this is gonna be a crazy phone this is gonna be the phone that i think it's gonna be fun that i recommend for most people not the oneplus nord it's probably gonna be this one what do you guys think is this crazy i'm convinced that price point is real ishwan's like he knows his stuff i'm i'm convinced 350 bucks will find out monday [Music] you
