all right so you know how AMD's laptops are just crushing right now right they have better value and performance than what Intel's offering in a lot of their devices and we've seen some really good AMD laptops already but this just took it to another level this is the Acer Swift three it's a six hundred and fifty dollar thin and light performance machine not like ultra high performance but it is very capable for the price point so this is gonna be super popular with students because they've done so much right at a fair price point so it's running these new AMD chips the 4700 you one of those new Rison ones and it's got a built-in GPU that's the vega seven a very capable graphics chip that pushes out frame rates that are just you just don't see that with integrated graphics before it's really cool so I'm just going to go into the the one and only negative I find about this product first just to get it out of the way because if this is like a deal-breaker for you you can move on alright this screen is a very mediocre screen it's a 14 inch 1080p panel but it's not very bright it's bright enough for most people's regular use but if you use it in a brightly lit environment or you want to bring it outside you might have some issues but the bigger problem is color accuracy this is a very color inaccurate screen everything seems to have like a greenish tint to it I did run the Spyder X on this panel to try to calibrate it it can only do so much though so if your workflow or hobbies require you to have like good color accuracy you might be disappointed with this like if you're into like photography or digital illustration or video editing I would look at other displays if you're gonna rely on this thing as your main panel okay aside from the screen though and I'm just putting it out there that is the the one weakness of this device if you're good with that you'll probably like the rest of this device okay keyboard good keyboard not just for an inexpensive device it's a solid typing experience for any kind of laptop the arrow keys on the bottom right here there's page up page down keys it's nice to have dedicated keys but if you're someone who's not used to the positioning of those you may accidentally hit them if you're hitting left and right it is something you get used to quite easily and I think the overall keyboard experience is solid there's a fingerprint sensor on the bottom right so you can login to it really quickly through Windows hello and the trackpad is its winners precision driver I think all devices are these days the surface material is smooth but it is plastic so it doesn't have that ultra premium feel that more expensive glass trackpads might have but it's a good overall trackpad and the click is it's a clean mechanical click alright let's talk about performance because that is where the juice is this is running an eight-core 4700 you from AMD and multi-core performance is good like really good for a device like this but performance is limited because it's running a 15 watt chip in a chassis that's relatively small and the fan noise is reasonable I actually think they could have gone with the bigger or a louder fan to just get slightly better performance but they went with a quiet fan and I think a lot of people will appreciate that and in terms of gaming performance this machine is surprisingly capable I can play shooters like valance and overwatch at near hundred frames per second on this 1080p screen like granted the graphics are lowered but you can't do that with integrated graphics with any Intel device it's actually really really impressive of what's going on here so if you're someone that's you know you're a casual gamer this is a great option and here's the other thing if you can convince your parents to get this thing like if your student and you're like hey mom hey Dad here's a $650 machine you don't mention the fact that you can play games but you're like I want this for school it's secretly capable for lights gaming and I would've been happy with this performance when I was in university like if you think about what you're getting here for 650 bucks it's quite impressive think about the razor blade stealth from last year the 2019 model that had an MX 150 and was like triple the price of this and this gets better performance than that just in terms of gaming performance yeah that's the power of AMD and this new Vegas 7 chip like the AP that's inside these things ok to close this off so the port's we have a decent port selection it's got two USB as1 use PC that can be used for charging does use a barrel plug for regular charging but you can use use PC if you need to in a pinch and that's it for ports there's no card readers or even a third USB a-ok so build quality on this machine because I didn't talked about this earlier it is fully aluminum and surprisingly sturdy it doesn't feel like ultra premium if I had to be like critical and picky about where there might be some shortcomings or deficiencies I can't really find anything like you open the device with one finger if that's something that really bothers you like you do have to hold the bottom part of it down to open it but overall bangin okay let's show the inside just real quick you have good access to the internals you can replace the SSD and the Wi-Fi but they're both good like this is a PM nine and one a super-fast Samsung Drive 512 gigs I don't even know how they're supplying this at 650 bucks like I'm I've seen laptops that are double this price that have crap your drives on this it's also got the Wi-Fi six like the new Intel card great Wi-Fi card the RAM however is soldered on and I don't think you can even upgrade it beyond eight gigs you're stuck at eight if that bothers you and the battery down here is a fifty watt hour battery it's like a six and a half seven hour battery on my regular test I really would have liked to have seen a longer battery life it's a little bit short you do need to bring the charger if you're bringing this to school or work like it's uh it's almost a full day but not quite compared to like an XPS 13 those have some of the longest battery lives out there this is a little bit short it could be the chip like the AMD chip but it's not drawn crazy wattage I'm not sure what it is I think it's just the battery size it's a little bit short but yeah that's 650 bucks I'm okay with that there's also speakers on the left and right that sound way better than I thought they would there are devices again that are much more expensive that sound worse than these so yeah happy with the speaker's they do point down like they're their bottom firing so if you have them on your lap or something they may not sound as clear but overall good sound system overall good laptop I think there's gonna be crazy popular just because of its price point and what you're getting for 650 bucks popular with students popular for anyone who's looking for a good value in a well-built laptop the only compromise I feel like they made was that screen so that's why I mentioned it earlier in this video if that's something that doesn't really bother you that much and I feel like for most people it shouldn't but if you're picky then know don't get this thing but otherwise it's got my recommendation okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subject it see you guys next time [Music]
