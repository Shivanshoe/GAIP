alright let's talk about the iPhone se so this phone came in last week and the moment it did I switched out my sim from my old iPhone se to this new one now this small older iPhone se was one of my favorite phones of all time I even won a record last year saying that this was my favorite phone from 2019 and I mean it's an awesome phone but the phone that have been using the most of recently has actually been the oneplus 8 Pro I've been using this for about a month at this point and to go from this like giant screen phone that is extremely feature-rich like this has everything it's big it's bright it's super fast to go from this to this a relatively feature poor phone it was a it's it's a bit of a jump right so the way I'm gonna do this video is and I talked about kind of the deficiencies that the iPhone se has kind of address them and talk about whether or not I feel like they are legitimate deficiencies and then we'll get into some bigger picture stuff so the three kind of big things I'd like to talk about in terms of shortcomings of the iPhone se are number one the screen number two battery life and three of the camera so the first one the screen this is you you there's no way you can get around this this is a dated screen it's small it's low res and it's only 60 Hertz I mean this has got to be one of the least impressive displays you can get right now on a smartphone in 2020 and when you compare it to the 1 + 8 pro this has got to be one of the most impressive displays you can get on a phone in 2020 and when I pull this thing out of the box I was like okay is this what we're doing we're going back to like the forehead and chin again like when you put them side-by-side the difference is massive but when I use this phone over the weekend just as a regular phone and wasn't trying to nitpick and draw comparisons between this and other phones I'm perfectly happy with this screen I really am it's small but it's a good screen nonetheless the other thing I want to talk about is the battery life so the battery on the iPhone se is a relatively small one it's 1800 milliamp hours and if you're doing regular stuff like emails and browsing the web and Netflix and social media stuff it's fine it'll comfortably last you the day maybe day and a half it's shorter than the 11 and 11 pro but for the size of the phone it's normal the stuff that the battery though is games and at first I couldn't figure it out I was thinking is it a certain type of game I'm playing is it this particular title it may be this Diablo clone is just really poorly optimized but it was with everything and I was going through battery life super fast like we're talking like 1% of battery life every minute and a half of gameplay and I think it's because of the processor like if you think about the design of this phone when they put everything together they put the 1800 milliamp power battery in here with that low res screen it actually can hit those claims numbers because those are not intensive tasks but the moment you push this CPU hard and it can go hard because it's a very capable a13 chip this thing drains battery life like you wouldn't believe and it's not just games like anything that uses the processor for an extended period of time like if you're shooting photos or videos and you're just in the camera app and just snapping away it'll drain super fast as well so depending what you do it will affect your battery life very heavily on this particular phone so if you're just like doing regular stuff easy day day and a half but if you're pushing it hard you'll kill it fast okay a quick note about the camera system if you're shooting well-lit scenes I think you're gonna get great image quality most people will be very happy with the daylight photos that come out of this camera there's probably some people out there I'm a good number of people out there that would have loved a telephoto or an ultra wide but you don't get that but I think everybody would have preferred a better night mode so they didn't include like an official night mode on this camera I'm convinced that there's like the processing capability maybe not to get the exact same image quality as like an 11 or 11 pro but better than this I would have thought like it's clearly its weak point the low-light photography on the iPhone se isn't great and it compared to like a pixel 3a that thing is way better for low-light photos so depending on again the type of photography you take you should be happy with the iPhone se camera the thing is though like even if you're not a professional photographer you're gonna invariably take a photo at night right stuff happens in the evening and I think they could have done better than this those are the main deficiencies of the iPhone se like the camera the battery life and the screen and depending on what you want out of your phone now you know at least from my perspective those deficiencies manifest themselves in real use so I think for a lot of people they look at this phone and it's like the perfect fit right if you're someone that you just want a very functional phone that's super reliable easy option right but then there's the more discerning individual I think a lot of you guys are that type of person where it's like you you see the benefits of it and you see the negatives of it and it doesn't really it may not add up to you right like how is this a $400 phone how is this phone that seemingly has so many imperfections still so well reviewed by so many people and there was actually a tweet by Lou from unbox therapy which I thought was fantastic he had this picture of the samsung galaxy s7 edge and he was like if they put in a snapdragon 865 and they priced it at 399 call it a day what people actually buy that phone with every actual interest in a product like that and it's obviously no right no one in their right mind would want that product and yet this thing is available this thing has interest and this ins flying off shelves but I think it's because Apple does it a very particular way like this foam has no competitor there is no Android equivalent of a $400 phone that's quite like this and everyone's like what about Brand X brand Y the difference is that with every other brand that's trying to hit that 4 or $500 price point they are trying to make these phones stick out from the rest they're trying to make these flagship killer phones for 4 or 500 bucks and they're putting in superfluous features like 108 megapixel cameras and crazy high refresh screens and curved edges they're trying to make those phones stick out as being special the problem with that is that when you do that your phone you lose out on the basics this phone nails the basics and it's $400 I think it's gonna be a crazy popular phone this year now this conversation seems to only apply with North American pricing when you look at South America and even some euro pricing and India's pricing like it's a completely different conversation this is a more expensive phone than the oneplus 8 in India but like I know there's crazy tariffs over there but that seems really expensive for iPhone se now as for this particular phone I was gonna replace my mom's iPhone 7 with this this was supposed to be a gift for her but in this process of using the phone and trying to develop some thoughts for it to share with you guys I have I've grown to like this thing I can't really explain it like every logical part of my body's like this is not a special phone Dave it's just an iPhone se it's really not meant for enthusiasts but I'm drawn to it I got to be honest I really like it so I'm gonna swap out my main SIM into this thing and just use it for a bit just to see what it's like okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it I'll see you guys next time [Music]
