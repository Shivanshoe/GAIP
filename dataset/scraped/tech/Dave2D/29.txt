last year i did a tier list on laptops and it was pretty well received i mean most people enjoyed it but obviously there's some people out there that are like pissed because their favorite laptops weren't the exact same as my favorite laptops but that's just how tier lists work right it's an opinion thing this year i'm doing the exact same thing and hopefully pissing off more people in the process uh no it's just it's just for fun right okay so i'm gonna be ranking the laptops that i was personally interested in for 2021 and i'm gonna be ranking them not just in order of like technical capabilities but also other things like you know how they look or what the companies were going for and innovation all that stuff it's just a very personal opinion but i'll kind of explain my choices as we go down this thing so we're going to start off at the top with the alienware x17 so these came out in the fall uh i like this device i feel like this is an easy a like we're starting off with an a yeah easy okay here's the thing with the x17 this is from a company that's known for running thicker devices that are hot and it's like surprising how good this thing was i personally feel like this is the best alienware product that's come out in like a decade really good product easy a uh the x-15 less good it was you know what it was the same idea as the x-17 right it was smaller and consequently there's more like limitations as to what you could do with it but i felt like the x-15 like they made it a little bit too thin you didn't have the mechanical keyboard option it wasn't as quiet it wasn't as special it wasn't as like unique of a product so i put it into c maybe a b like if i'm being technical i'd put it into c you know what it deserves a c like okay here's the thing if they had if they had made it a little bit thicker i feel like it could have been a b maybe even an a but i feel like they screwed up on that part they were trying to like chase that super thin thing that everyone else was doing and i think they they kind of floundered there see okay macbook pro 16 not particularly a gaming laptop but a really cool device and something that i was interested in this year i would place this as a i'm gonna go with a b as technically amazing as it is it is super super expensive it's honestly like 50 more money than an equivalent premium windows laptop so i feel like it deserves a b uh the 14-inch version though that as expensive that one is i think it deserves an a because it's like it's the technical complexity and difficulty in shrinking something down and they did it right the ability to get the same kind of performance on a 14-inch device as their 16-inch that's an a but because it's so expensive it doesn't deserve an s tier and i don't i didn't buy either of these right they're really cool but they're so expensive so i'ma pass on okay prometheus 16. so this was the alienware knockoff product so great performer it's coming from the company that a lot of the laptop nerds love myself included it's electronics but it's a product that is cool in the sense that it's got great performance and they have a design language that isn't like the same as everything else out there it's a little bit less generic looking but it's like it's a clone and they cloned alienware and it doesn't quite look like an alienware device it's got the alienware you know dna going on but it's like this like derpy version of an alienware device um i i think it's cool but not a b certainly not an a like if you're if you're talking straight performance a sure but you're cloning another brand and it's not like a great clone of it so it's a c um okay prometheus 17 this is the bigger version i don't even know why they labeled these things or like titled both of these things with the same branding of prometheus because they're not even they don't look anything alike uh i'd put the prometheus 17 as a as a b i guess really good performer but it's a very generic looking device it's just special in the sense that it's a it's a strong performer uh okay the mech 15 or the neo 15 it depends on the brand so the mac 15 is made by electronics neo15 is made by xmg the same idea it's like a it's a chassis that's shared between the two this is a very popular device amongst the sweaty laptop nerds and amongst my discord last year i think i gave this thing a b i don't think it deserves a b this year so a couple things come to mind i feel like this is a brand that really cares about the performance so they're constantly tweaking it and the this year's generation is definitely better but also i put it as an a so this year because of the rtx 30 series gpus it was difficult for companies to cool these things properly right and so what a lot of companies were doing is they were lowering the wattage of their gpus to try to make it fit into their devices which is perfectly cool but these guys they let it rip at a high wattage and they just dealt with it in a proper manner thermally so i give them credit for that it does endure it doesn't deserve an s to me i feel like uh as much as people love that brand it's non-stir because it's like a generic device also the keyboard on it is this mechanical keyboard that i've never been i've never drawn to so it's an a tier uh the triton 300 oh dude this was the this was like that intel the h35 chip so if you didn't follow my channel i never reviewed any of these like intel chips so intel made these chips called the h35 chips and when they came out i was a little bit wary of them because they were quad-core cpus but they were still expensive devices so truthfully i felt like the responsible thing for me to do was just not cover them to not even give them any light of day because by drawing attention to them it would just draw interest in them so i actually just made a video saying don't buy this stuff so honestly i feel like this deserves an e dude you know what i think we got to open up another tier because it's like there are devices out there that deserve an e and for whatever reason we'll get into them i feel like there's going to be more but this is worse than that i feel like this is a product class that shouldn't have even existed i'm making a new tier an f tier just for this breed of laptop and triton 300sc is the first one that goes in there and it's not to like rip on the brand i feel like it's not really their fault like i feel like intel probably conned them into making the product in the first place but it wasn't good and i feel like it shouldn't i really don't think that thing should have existed okay uh triton 500sc that one okay so this was a very cool looking laptop it's like a gray color with some teal accents right up my alley from a technical perspective it's kind of in the middle of the pack but i like the way that it looked see what made this one special though was its price point like i think best buy had a very readily available 1500 version that was like rtx 3060 and it was like a thin light device that looks pretty cool i'm gonna put it in the d slightly below average but i don't think it can sit alongside like the x15 yeah no way so yeah it's a d okay nitro 5. okay nitro 5 this is like one of the og budget gaming laptops i remember when this thing first came out like that red and black gaming laptop was like wow you know a 700 gaming laptop this is so cool i think in 2021 it's still like it's respectable right it's still like the they still do this thing because a lot of companies don't touch this stuff no one wants to be in the in the thick of making cheap budget gaming laptops that have low profit margins that's the worst place to be in but acer they still do it man they still get dirty and they still make the nitro 5. uh i like it i'm gonna put it in the b not an a b because i respect it and here's the thing if if i was a kid and like i was trying to convince my parents to get me a gaming laptop that would be the one and so i like the fact that they still do it no one else is doing it at least at least people who have a really tight budget have a gaming laptop so that's my pick b for natural five the zephyrs g15 oh dude that's this machine right here okay it's either being a or an s tier it's an s here okay i like the white color you know i don't think it deserves to be an s here does it okay so i've been using this as like my main computer for the past ever since it came out ever since i got the review unit i used it and then like i've switched off devices but this is my machine i like it a lot there's a couple things i really don't like about it i don't like the fact that doesn't have a print screen i've talked about this in my videos i use print screen frequently for work and for like just like taking screenshots and stuff windows shift s is not the same as windows print screen that is the best no print screen second thing i don't love about it is like the black bezel like the trim around the screen it's black and i don't love it but white device you know what's really special about this thing this is running right now and the mic right there's no there's no fan noise so few windows performance laptops have a fan profile like this and it's something that like not everyone appreciates but i do right this is okay it's a nest here i'm keeping an s because it's a white laptop there's not a lot of them i'm people are going to hate me for it but it deserves to be a nest here okay um okay the g14 so last year i gave this thing an s tier i don't think no definitely doesn't deserve to beat s anymore for sure see what made it special last year is that it paved the way it paved the road for like all the other amd laptops out there be like this is what you can do if you take an amd chip and you make it thin and like light and you properly cool you can pull off something like the g14 and it was cool it was also extra cool because asus had the balls to work with amd and make something from scratch which was the g14 it deserved to be an s3 last year this year i don't even think it deserves to be an a-tier anymore i'm going to put it in b the one problem i had with the g14 last year still exists on the g14 this year which was the screen at a very slow response rate and a response time and i'm just like it's a gaming device right and when you have like 120 hertz refresh but you have slow response time you get this ghosting i'm like it just it kind of ruined the experience for what that thing could be so it's a yeah i'm going to put into b tier i may shift this stuff later on but now i'm seeing it beside the things it sits alongside yeah it's a b tier okay the blade 14 razor i really liked this device and if it came in a 32 gigabyte configuration and it wasn't just capped at 16 i'd probably use it it'd have to come in like the silver or white color as well if it did i'd probably jump on it right away so this was i want to give it an s here because they did something special i'll explain in a second let's go with eight here for now so what makes it special is i think it's the most power efficient device that windows offers like bar none so obviously m1 is so special everyone's talking about it is power efficiency the blade 14 is similar in the sense that it deserves uh it just deserves recognition for what they're doing it's super super power efficient it's very small very compact yet pushes out a good amount of performance and also can be equipped with an rtx 3080 which at that size i mean obviously they're cutting the wattage on it and it's not as powerful as some of the bigger boys but the fact that they're able to do it and cool it properly and quietly it's at least an a the only reason why it's not an s tier is because it doesn't come with 32 gigs of frame which i would personally use and maybe if it came in white it would go up there so a for now okay the m15 oh dude dudes the alienware m15 r5 this was their amd variant their first amd laptop that i could at least i've experienced um okay the review unit i was sent had i mean had no muck switch it had it was missing cuda cores and it was like a lower wattage gpu dude i want to put this in like eat here so i get it they had like a bios update and they fixed a bunch of stuff but there's still okay here's the thing it's eater so this is why this is an amd product for alienware and you have the opportunity to do something good right you have the opportunity to make something that's special and different and just thermally like you have something that you can do something different with compared to your regular intel chips but they didn't they made this like sloppy version of the m15 and i mean they tweaked it they they spent time with it to make it a little bit better but they could have made something really good if they if the m15 r5 had been like their flagship product and they had funding and whatever they wanted to make this their best product they could have done it they absolutely could have but they didn't and i feel like they squandered a really good opportunity so e for you m15 r5 now the r6 was the intel version of that it was better than the r5 so you know i had thunderbolt 4 had pcie 4 had all the fours uh but it still had issues here's the thing when you have a device like this that's like a little bit thicker right you have the room to cool things better it shouldn't run so hot i feel like they just they i'm talking about alienware here they focused more on the x products and to make those things better than they did on the m15s this year so yeah i'm comfortable giving it a d i wouldn't put it alongside with the e with the the amd r5 because that was that was really not good the r6 was a bit better okay the dell g15 okay so this was a product that it's a little bit weird on this one so i purchased a unit for myself uh the review units that people were being sent were configured with a screen that was not truly representative of what this product was so this is a budget gaming laptop from dell i forget the exact price but it's like under a thousand dollars for the starting price but the screen that comes with the base model the cheap model is atrocious like i got it from the store i was like what am i looking at this is garbage this should not exist in a 2021 gaming laptop but the product overall is good it's just that if you want a usable screen especially usable for games you have to spend like thirteen fourteen hundred dollars and up and i felt like that was just such a it's just a weird way to configure these products it's like you have these cheap price tags you lure people in to be like yeah we got this cheap budget gaming laptop but the screens are complete ass until you spend big boy money and by the time you're spending 13 1400 there's so many other options out there so for me this is a d maybe a c because the product was good it's just the screen was garbagio okay we're going over the c we're going with the c the dash f 15. so this was a product that was also equipped with those terrible intel quad core chips but this is arguably the best-looking laptop that came out this year like legitimately it was all white and metal and like the trim around the screen was white and also the lighting was teal not like rgb that you could configure into teal it was like it only came in one color it was teal lighting with a white everything else it was perfect like truly chef's kiss in terms of the aesthetics but it had that dirty dirty intel chip so est here right who cares about performance when it looks so good okay the s17 from asus um [Music] okay this was a product that i don't feel was it was okay so this what made this thing special let me place it back down here was what made it special was that the keyboard could lift up on this angle and it would allow the product to vent off its heat a little bit more efficiently it was really cool and they've done stuff like that in the past but this time it was the keyboard that tilted up not the screen and it was just like a it was a remarkably well-cooled device and really strong performer and i was surprised at how good the performance was but and usually i tried to use that thing as as my personal device like i wanted that to be like the thing that i used i never loved the keyword it was usable and i felt like you know if you bought it and you were stuck with it you would just learn to get used to it but i just never got into it um it's definitely not an s tier for me is either an a or b i'm gonna go with i'm gonna go with b because i feel like the the idea is cool but yeah it doesn't deserve to be like with along these sides both with an x17 because that's really good yeah it deserves to be b okay the m16 oh man i think people are gonna be pissed off with my with my opinion on this one so the m16 was it's got it's the same idea as this one here the g15 except it's supposed to be the intel variant and you know they've done two things one it's an intel chip and secondly they've extended the screen so instead of having a chin and a bezel at the bottom it's just like all screen but the presence of that intel chip changed the product completely they had to make it thicker they had to make the fans louder they had to make the fans run constantly just like if this was the m16 there's no in hell that would be able to screen record while running this thing while without you guys being able to hear the fan it'd be just be going the whole time and i feel like it just changed what the product was and i don't even think they should have used that chassis for that particular product so i'm gonna give it a c yeah it wasn't bad it's just like it now becomes just like there's so many other products that they have in their in their lineup that is like that instead of it being the thin you know ultra light chassis that the g15 was so it's a c but i feel like some people loved that thing oh well okay the scar g15 this was um okay so this is a kind of it's supposed to be like an inoffensive entry from asus it's a powerful performer nothing crazy about it it's got some rgbs uh the thing i didn't love about it was the keyboard so it was more expensive than their regular uh strix g15 it's like this it's the scar editions like the premium edition and it had a mechanical keyboard that actually failed for me after like a couple months one of the keys stopped working and then i just never liked the typing experience on it either like for an optimal mechanical the tech is really cool it's just it wasn't it wasn't a good keyboard to me um and it was also expensive had cool rgbs though so i'm going to put this with i guess a c it's definitely not a d it's a c all right the amd of edition of the g15 so this is the advantage edition it's like all amd and it was really cool what really made it special is the price point so i think it was like sixteen hundred dollars and it had like the equivalent of maybe a little bit less than rtx 3080 in terms of performance which is awesome for that kind of money right this does it deserve to be an a it's not an s here that's for sure i'd say it's a b or an a i'd give it a b i'm comfortable giving it a b it wasn't it wasn't an elegant way to cool this device like the fans were pretty loud and i remember being fairly plain outside of its performance but at sixteen hundred dollars it's such a good value uh it almost deserves to be an a but it's just not special enough to be an a in my opinion okay uh the zephyrus duo so this was the double screen gaming laptop this is i guess their second version of it i liked it uh i just and again it was a product that i wanted to try to make it as my own thing because editing videos with that extra screen real estate is really nice and it's like that you just throw your timeline down there it was really cool but it just it never felt right and i felt like a lot of people that were drawn to it would have felt the same way right it's just like the idea is cool but it just isn't tuned just right i felt like if the screen was a little bit it was a little bit closer to the main screen if that like secondary one was pushed up a little bit or tilted a little bit more it'd be a better experience but i'd say a d it feels bad to put it down there but it wasn't again like looking at the stuff in the seat here because c is like at least in this chart it's still like slightly above average right it's not like nothing on here is bad except for maybe f here so yeah i'm comfortable with the d actually e is pretty bad too but yeah it deserves b d c i'm placing a d because it was so expensive there you go okay legion five oh dude easy as tier this was like fantastic device it was so good i never even did a review for it truth is i was super busy at the time setting up the new studio so a lot of the products that came in i couldn't get to including some of the legion devices but it's very deserving of the s tier category it's just like well-priced good performer like a really good performer and it looks good right like how many devices at that kind of price point have a clean professional look to them without it screaming like super gamer boy it's one of the best ones out there so s tier for me uh okay the legion five pro this was less good to me uh it's technically the better one i'm gonna place it in a2 because okay two things i did not like the bigger trackpad they made it bigger on the legion five pro as well as the legion seven but it just made it a worse trackpad experience to me like like the palm rejection wasn't good enough just you're constantly hitting it uh the other thing is that i just didn't like the design like i felt like it was a it was a product that was just not as nice looking and potentially but like purposefully done like that uh so it's an a tier now the legion seven was the best of the bunch but and this is a little bit more expensive see the thing with legion seven i don't think it deserves to be an s tier even though it is the better one of the product is a little bit more expensive but yeah it's like the the price that you have to pay to get the legion seven and you do have access to more powerful gpus and stuff i just don't feel like it deserves to be an s because it just doesn't have that specialness to it you're just paying more for a better product it doesn't have that like special value that legion five does also the legion five goes on sale like really aggressively sometimes it's a it's a yeah it's quite different so legion seven really good product a tier just not an s tier uh okay xps 15 i didn't love the xps products this year as much like they were improved from last year which is cool but they [Music] they had this trackpad issue last year which i drew attention to and it still existed in both of the products this year like i ended up picking up an xps 15 as well just to see and it's just it's a it's a very expensive product and it's this problem with the trackpad they've had a year to fix now where it's like it's rattling and it has issues with clicks it's it's a problem they know it is and they've admitted it but after a year you could have gone to the factory fixed whatever process or whatever mechanics you have in place that are causing this issue and it still exists and it's like it's really weird so and they also didn't improve the product enough or very much also amd if they could stick amd into this product it would just be so much better like it's a thin device it would really benefit from lower cpu temperatures but it's all intel uh it doesn't mean e xps 15 i'd say would be a d xps 17 better no it's also yeah i'd say they both belong in the d they're good they're just not that good but i love the design i think they're some of the best looking laptops you can get right now in terms of the aesthetics it's just the internals could be better and should be better especially for that kind of money okay uh the aorus 15g man i did not like the ers devices this year again these are things that i did not draw attention to because i felt like they weren't good enough um the aorus 15g it was it it was running a gpu that was lower wattage than it should have been considering the type of device that it was also they got rid of the mechanical keyboard so this is a this is a d for me yeah the 17g kept the mechanical i'm not going to super details on these ones i feel like these are just kind of there because i felt like they should be here out of completion because i did cover them well sorry i did look at them actually spent a good amount of time on these ones i actually shot the review i never edited them okay uh yeah c and d for those two the arrow 15. this is better for sure um also made by gigabyte so i had an oled model version i really like the screen arguably the best oled screen you can get on a laptop a lot of people try it and they're all nice to look at but i think with the arrows they tune it better than everybody else it's like they have really nice colors that stay accurate depending on the brightness it's good uh yeah it's a b tier for me uncomfortable with it placing there okay the ge76 from msi this is i think this was the fastest laptop i had i don't think i had any higher 3d mark scores outside of this machine it was really fast in terms of laptops it's powerful sure uh it's a little bit loud to get there so maybe a c there's nothing really have to complain about this thing it's just that it's not remarkable so i'm going to place it as a c it's pretty good yeah okay the gf66 so this was a cheaper budget product i don't think i did a dedicated review oh my things went all crazy there i don't think i did a dedicated review on it but it was okay this was a product that should be cheaper than the price tag that it lists for so this should compete with like the nitro 5 and products of that like it's i don't know 8 900 bucks is what it should be but it's a little bit more than uh the competition it does come in that white color and if it didn't come in this white color i would slap it in like the d but i give it a c it's a it's a fair product it's just again not remarkable it does not deserve anything more than that it certainly shouldn't sit alongside the nitro because of its price point yeah i don't think you know what i remember having a really nice screen though like for an inexpensive gaming laptop it has a good screen for gaming it's like a fast screen maybe a b sure let's give it a b i would say that it's a better product than the nitro 5 in terms of like the overall thing but it's just more expensive so depending on your budget but i like both of them the existence of both of them allows you know budget-oriented gamers choices okay uh the stealth it's another one of those quad-core intel devices uh easy f this again a product category that just should not even exist to be honest oh dude victis this is a good one not a good product but a good story so i had four units of the victus i bought one it had issues i was like huh maybe it's just a weird thing i bought another one also had issues separate issues like the first one had an issue with the hinge the second one had a flickering screen and then i borrowed one from a friend like a co-worker i just borrowed his and i used it in the middle of the test thing like i was doing a review on it i was like in the middle shooting it his enter key stopped working and i was like okay the quality control on this product is weird now i reached out to hp i'm like yo can i get a review unit they sent one so i actually had four of these devices their review unit was perfect it's just that i felt uncomfortable giving any kind of recommendation because three of the four that i had had issues and i looked online there's like people had issues so i don't know i felt like this was a product i was going to skip this year i did not feel comfortable giving any kind of conclusive thoughts on it based on the units that i had e based on the review unit probably a c but the retail ones that i had access to a solid e okay the omen 15. so this was a product that i think got an s tier last year from me i think so it definitely doesn't deserve an s here this year it's not like a bad product but it's just a way more competitive market people got better they didn't if anything they had like a really lazy approach to their product this year they just did a chip drop and they didn't change a thing so i'm going to place it i don't even think it deserves to be an a to be honest like looking at the stuff that it's sitting alongside with legion five pro and the legion seven no way so a b a b it is okay so i'm going to take a look at this tier list real quick i feel like there's stuff i gotta shift around to be honest the s tier is deserving g15 yeah i feel like it deserves it the f 15. i was like what okay this obviously doesn't deserve to be in the s tier i think if i'm being fair and if i'm being true to the statement i said at the beginning of this video where it's like an opinion thing and not just the technical merits of the product it would be an e because of how it looks it's not an f it you know from a technical perspective it's an f to your product with that chip but it looks good it's arguably the best looking device that's come out this entire year when it comes to windows laptops so it's it's an e uh okay let me take a look real quick make sure i don't have anything out of place i'd be tempted to give the blade 14 and s here but nah i'm good with this i think there's nothing on this list that really you know what's most interesting is like the legion devices cleaned up this year they're really good they're just good i feel like that company knows what they're doing they care about what consumers want and they make good products the one thing that was kind of sucky is that like it was really hard to get a lot of their devices this year i think they were just out of stock just because of supply chain issues the other thing that's interesting is the spread on alienware they got an a a c a d and an e across their devices but there you have it um i think i'm good with this list this is going to be a long video but what do you people think because last year when i did this people were like screaming at me they're like what the how can you put that thing an ass tear okay listen that's how tier lists work you don't have to agree with me to like the content i want to see what you have though what do you think should have been an s here and yeah let me know i'm gonna check out the comments like i did last year i'm gonna go through just like just like the way communities do okay thanks so much for watching the video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
