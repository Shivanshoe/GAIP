okay let's talk about the new 2020 ipad air this is a device that's had a pretty significant update this year they've changed the exterior of the device it looks a lot more like the existing ipad pro lineup they've changed the interior they've added obviously like the new chipset but they also added some features that have never existed on any ipads before so let's just dive into this thing i'm gonna go into the aesthetics first because that's probably one of its most interesting draws like if you're coming into the ipad world and you're looking to purchase one one of the reasons why you might be interested in this one one of the big reasons is because it looks nice this looks a lot nicer than a regular ipad right because of the thinner bezels the more modern design language it is a really nice looking machine really similar to the 11 inch ipad pro it's got the same shape same size the bezels are a little thicker on the ipad air so it's got a 10.9 inch screen instead of an 11 inch screen but it's got the same holes for the speakers on the sides and the same smart connection on the back so if you have accessories that worked for the 2018 and 2020 ipad pro the 11 inch one they'll very likely work for this model as well the new ipad air so i'm gonna dive into the screen first because i think that's the most important feature to me this new screen has true tone and good brightness but it is a 60 hertz display i've talked about 120 hertz and just high refresh displays in my phone reviews and i have a very particular kind of mindset about that stuff like when it comes to phones i feel like high refresh screens are nice but they're not really game changing when it comes to tablets it's a slightly different story so it depends on what you're doing but i really feel like if you are someone who's using a pen like the apple pencil for the input if you're drawing or writing having a high refresh screen makes a significant difference and that was something that i noticed right away when it came off of the ipad pro like the tablet that i'm using the most of over the past little while is a 2018 ipad pro with a 120 hertz display and coming on to this the 60 hertz display on the ipad air is a noticeable step down for the apple pencil experience now i'm not a digital illustrator or an artist of any sort but i can tell that there's some kind of latency or lag that doesn't feel as natural as the 120hz display on the ipad pros then again this is a significantly more expensive machine the ipad pros i would say that if you're someone who uses the pencil frequently i would lean more towards the ipad pro even older models just because of that faster refresh screen it makes a big difference when it comes to the apple pencil input there's also the advantage you get with games right some games in the app store allow you to play with high refresh rates i play a game called dead cells and it's this very reaction based game where you kind of have to press buttons based on what's happening on the screen really quickly and i do find that i perform better when i'm playing on the ipad pro it's just a smoother and more visually fluid experience and it doesn't just apply to action games there's a whole bunch of kind of chill and relaxing titles as well on the app store that can benefit from high refresh screens as well but the 60 hertz panel on the ipad air will handle everything else just as well it's just slightly smaller than the 11 inch ipad pro now i want to move on to the new feature this year it's the presence of a touch sensitive power button it's got touch id baked right into the power button on the device now this implementation of touch id took me a little bit of time to get used to number one the location is different right my muscle memory has always just been going to the bottom or just depend on face id to open up my ipads but you got to just make an effort to go up there normally with an encased ipad the moment you open it because of the magnet system it automatically turns on you don't have to physically press most ipads to power up but now you got to make that that mental like no just like you got to hit that even if you have a case that automatically turns the device on secondly it's not a super fast touch id it's slower than i would have expected coming from such a fast processor like the a14 is a beast but there is a bit of lag when you're trying to unlock the device i do prefer unlocking an ipad with face id over touch id okay under the speakers this has a two speaker setup which honestly sounds almost identical to the quad speaker setup from the ipad pros the bass there is stronger and the system gets a little bit louder overall but the double speaker on the new ipad air is just so much better than anything they've had in the past with regular ipads or ipad airs because now there's speakers on each side there's one on the left one on the right so the audio experience is so much more complete than it has been in the past now in terms of performance the a14 in the ipad air is really fast like impressively so in many cases it matches if not beats the current ipad pro chip like the a12z that being said there is a ram difference there's four gigs of ram in the ipad air six gigs on the ipad pro but when it came to my real world usage i found them very similar like i would have thought that a four gig machine running two concurrent apps with the split screen would just be sluggish but it really wasn't i do think that in time because apple's software updates are sometimes limited by ram that the six gig ipad pro will be able to go a little bit further into the future now i want to move on to the discussion of a purchase decision so should you buy a new ipad air so this machine the 2020 ipad air has a few things that really separate it from the base model ipad right it has access to the second gen apple pencil it has access to the magic keyboard like a really good keyboard arguably the best keyboard that exists for tablets it has access to usbc charging it has access to a bunch of really nice colors like let's be real here those colors are going to be very powerful draw for people to spend a little bit more money to get an ipad air instead of a regular ipad now the question you should ask yourself if you're interested in a device like this and you're like should i get the ipad air should just go with the kind of basic ipad it's really about usage right if you're going to be using a pencil frequently or you're gonna be typing on your device on your ipad frequently then i would go for this because these two alone like this second gen apple pencil is so much better than the first gen the access to this magic keyboard is something that is i mean i've reviewed this before previously but it's a really good typing experience it rivals it rivals laptops legitimately it's actually better than a lot of windows laptops but it's a really good keyword and you don't have access to this magic keyboard unless you have an ipad air like the new ipad air or the much more expensive ipad pro now there's another question of should you go for the ipad air or the ipad pro and this is a big jump up unless you can score a 2018 model if you can somehow luck out and get a two-year-old model that's refurbed or whatever i think the best value is 2018 ipad pro but if you have to buy a new 2020 ipad pro and you're designing between the two it really comes down to the pen like the 120 hertz screen can you take advantage of that pencil and that refresh rate of the apple pencil with that screen and if you can and you want it for your workflow i'd suggest an ipad pro because the 60hz screen on this there is a limitation but there you have it that's my review of the 2020 ipad air okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
