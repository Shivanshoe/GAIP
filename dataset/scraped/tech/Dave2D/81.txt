[Music] all right so as a laptop guy because i'm someone who's main computer is a laptop i'm constantly looking for that perfect laptop mouse right i want someone that's wireless but i also wanted to really good battery life and i also wanted to have a high performance sensor something that's responsive and is good for playing games and it's remarkably hard to find there's lots of mice with really good battery life but mediocre sensors or gaming mice with great sensors but with weaker battery life they're not that mix that i'm looking for today razer is announcing this thing the razer orochi v2 and this seemingly checks all the boxes that i would want in a high performance laptop mouse it's a gaming mouse right it's got ptfe feet it's got a high performance gaming sensor and it also claims a 425 hour battery life and that's high performance 1000 hertz pulling like it's all the good stuff and there's also a lower energy consumption bluetooth connected mode that's 950 hours but the claims are a little bit misleading so in order to hit that kind of crazy battery life you need to use this thing a lithium-based double-a battery now this is included in the box i've had this in here for two weeks and i've logged all my use i've put in at the time of this recording 83 hours 83.5 hours of mouse use and i'm almost at full battery still it's a very long battery but here's the weird thing if i remove this lithium battery and i replace it with a regular double a alkaline based battery this battery life drops from 425 down to 260. it's a very significant dip in battery life performance and it's not just the big dip it's that it's now very similar in battery life to its competitor the g305 from logitech this is a very popular mouse and this is a battery based mouse and they claim 250 hours on their website and their marketing material anyone can use that lithium battery and get elevated numbers it's just it's a little bit strange to me not to take away from the mouse it's a good mouse but overly aggressive marketing never sits right with me so i want you guys to be aware that if you're interested in this mouse and you're seeing you know those big battery claims it's because it's measured with a special battery okay so the mouse itself the weight is you know what even the weight is a little bit misleading so they claim it to be less than 60 grams but that number is measured there's an asterisk there without the battery so 60 grams is still very light noticeably lighter than a g305 but i think putting that 60 gram number on a box is deceptive it's a light mess for sure but it's strange to me that they would mark it and advertise this weight when it's in an inoperable state like you can't do anything with this mouse at 60 grams it needs a battery so i feel like that really should be in the way to this device like this is marketed as a 99 gram mouse because that's how much it weighs with the battery in there this is probably 73 and change when the battery's inside another thing to keep in mind lithium batteries the double a's are a little bit less than an alkaline battery in weight like eight grams lighter it seems insignificant like you know we're getting sweaty over eight grams but when it comes to mice and these types of weights 8 grams is relatively significant but that's another reason why the weight is a little bit lower on paper because it's a lithium battery it's a solid shelled mouse so there's no perforations there's no honeycombing and there's also no rgb lighting on this thing which is very rare for a razer product it has six buttons and i really like the main buttons there's no wobble on the top shelf i also like the sensor positioning it's kind of closer up to the fingertips which i personally like and it's got a false ambidextrous shape so in the sense that it's symmetrical somewhat ambidextrous but the side buttons are only on one side so if you're left-handed you wouldn't be able to hit those with your thumb the side of the mouse is more comfortable to me than the g305 there's a bit of an inward curve to it that fits my thumb nicely it also has two colors white black as well as some custom options which i'll show you in a second and there's also ptfe feet and inside you can power it with either double or aaa battery as well as using either 2.4 gigahertz on a dongle or bluetooth to connect it to your device and this goes for 69.99 so 70 mouse now this is a small mouse it'll work for both palm and claw grips but if you're used to having a big hump on the back of your mouth or like a big tail end of it to rest your palm it doesn't have that this is definitely more suited to people that prefer small mice and when you pop up the lid or the the top of it you have access to your two battery slots one for double a one for aaa and they're not to be used simultaneously it's like one or the other and basically if you use a doubly battery you get the full battery life because it's the bigger of the two but if you are weight conscious like you really want the lightest version of this mass possible you'd go with a aaa battery uh but your battery life would obviously be shorter this angled positioning of the battery slots is actually one of its more unique features so normally when you have a battery operated mouse and this is a g305 i'll use as an example the battery is mounted in a kind of vertical position it's just straight up down and you can feel it in the weight characteristics of these mice like you'll feel it it's almost like there's too much junk in the trunk right when you're moving your mouse especially if you whip it quick the back end of it because it's weighted like this it kind of right it just kind of swings out a little bit you'll notice it if you use these mice enough and i think anyone who's watching this video if you use the g305 you have one right now you can just tell that there's something in the back end of this because it's such a dense battery sitting at the bottom of it right this is because it's angled it gives a more distributed weight feel it's not perfect like when i close this thing up and i move my hand around you can still tell that there's something in there it doesn't feel like a regular you know like a lithium ion cell based mouse because it's still quite dense the double a but it's noticeably better than a vertical orientation but the overall feel of this mouse for me is good it's not my favorite shape right i like my mice a little bit bigger with the hump that's a little bit more pronounced but i think for people that like small mice this is an excellent shape and the weight of it and the overall feel of it is on point let's talk about performance so real simply this has excellent performance now i wouldn't say that it has better performance than the g305 this also had a really good sensor but testing this thing out over the past couple of weeks feels really good it's responsive it's very consistent there's nothing i would complain about this sensor having this kind of battery life on a sensor of this caliber is excellent but i gotta say it's not that different to me in terms of the sensor performance to the g305 but keep in mind that this kind of performance is only present when you use that 2.4 gigahertz dongle if you connect it with bluetooth the performance goes to crap and it'll just feel like a regular office mouse at that point so i highly recommend using that dongle if you can uh there is the presence of onboard memory it's the ability to kind of load your preferences onto this mouse and then just do it once and you just get rid of that razer software if you want and there's also the availability of custom face plates so these are colorful faceplates you can use to swap out on the top of the device and they have a cool look but they don't feel quite the same to me like the texture on this feels a little bit better to me than the customized face plates like the colored ones have a slightly more sticky texture to them when you're using them but they are a really cool way and a really simple way to add more color to your setup if that's what you're looking for but the big question is how good is this mouse right what i actually call this the best laptop mouse like i'm sure razer would love to put into a marketing material like this is very clearly a laptop focused mouse and what i called the best laptop mouse maybe like sure i just wish the marketing hot sauce wasn't so thick on this device okay that wraps up this video hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
