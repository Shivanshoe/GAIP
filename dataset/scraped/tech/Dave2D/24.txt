so samsung's s21 fe came out recently the fan edition and the general consensus about this phone has been you know it's a good device but because the timing of its launch you shouldn't get it you should pick up the pixel 6 instead it's the it's the better choice between the two and i disagree like i can understand from a technical perspective why people would think the pixel 6 is just like the clearly the better option right it's 100 cheaper that's a big one uh it's also got google's great camera system it's got a bit more ram and it's got you know a more premium finish the materials on it's got a glass back whatever so people are drawn to the paper specs or the paper features of this device and you can skin it to make it look like a ninja turtle which is arguably the most important feature of any phone but here's my take on this okay so i've been using the pixel 6 as my main phone for ever since it came out like i reviewed the pixel 6 pro but then i gave that to my brother and i bought with my own money a pixel 6. and it started off as a good phone a great phone right and usually with devices they start off a certain way but then they get better with software updates but for whatever reason this year this device has become progressively buggier over the months so i've had issues with the fingerprint sensor i had to do a full factory wipe on this thing to be able to get it back up it was super annoying i've had issues with the auto rotate on the screen sometimes it won't rotate when you want it to i've had issues with the adaptive brightness that's been something that existed ever since the november update it's been like you're out in a sunny day you're looking at your phone you're using it all of a sudden it's like boom and it's dark it's like why is it doing this dude and i like adaptive brightness i ain't one of those people that just put it to max and just like blast my eyes out i like the adaptive brightness and it is extremely unreliable on this device and it's now mid-january it's still busted it's ridiculous and then there's twitter if i'm in the app and i'm scrolling a little bit too fast it crashes it literally quits the app and i have to reload the app and i just don't use twitter on this phone anymore if i'm on twitter it's on my iphone or a computer because it just doesn't work on the pixel 6. now i'm not saying that the pixel is like you know bug written and all the other phones aren't i'm not saying that at all but for a pixel device this is definitely a buggier launch than it has been in the past and it's not just me right like if you look around there's definitely other people that have had less than ideal experiences with their pixel 6 device and it's just if you're choosing between the two i'm just saying it's not as clear-cut it's not just like oh yeah go for the pixel six because the technical specs on it are better uh the other thing is materials so a lot of people are drawing you know go for the pixel 6 because it's got glass and it's just like a better more premium finish and again from a technical perspective and maybe a cost perspective sure glass is more expensive and it's more premium looking or premium feeling device but dude on a device at this kind of price point plastic is just it's the move i've said this in other mid-tier reviews and i got to say it again plastic is the better option it's more durable it doesn't crack as readily it's just a better choice like if you extrapolated three years out from today right and you looked at all the pixel six devices out there so many of them will have shattered glass backs that's what glass does right but how many cracked or shattered s21 fees you think they'll be in three years there'll be some but there'll be way less because plastic it don't crack it's just how it is right actually that's a lie if you you can crack plastic but it's just way more durable you get the point so i like what google did in terms of providing a premium finished phone at this kind of price point 600 for a glass back phone of this quality it's awesome but i don't think it's the right choice for everyone right and for the people that are looking at this type of phone an s21 fe you want it to last you want it to be durable and you want it to be you want to just not switch phones every year right plastic is king for that type of option and the last thing i want to talk about is pricing so yeah on paper s115e is 100 bucks more than the pixel six right but the pixel six just does not go on sale even on black friday this thing didn't drop down in price like you can get bundles and stuff but this is such a cheap phone for google that they're not making a ton of money in this thing they can't this is not built to go on sale you know what i'm saying s21fe is designed to go on sale and to look more attractive because of sale pricing it's gonna have carrier incentives it's going to have sales like even right now literally the week at launch you can already get this thing with 100 amazon gift cards and there's some sizable regional discounts on this phone it is listed as a 700 phone but it is not being sold or purchased by people at 700 bucks so if you are someone who just does not have access to the pixel 6 like you can't get in your region or you just don't have preference for that and you just like samsung's phones for their software for whatever reason you like the brand it's it's good it's a really good phone and all that stuff like i just get the pixel six now man i think i just don't think so not this year last year i recommended the pixel five or so two years ago i recommend the pixel 5 over the s20 fe because that's what it was last year but this year i'm just calling how i see it it is not as obvious of a choice as people are making it out to be now i want to move this conversation over to the topic of the i guess the the flagships the samsung flagship devices so if you are looking at this stuff you might be looking at the s21 like the regular s21 and you can get this for i don't know like 100 maybe 150 bucks more than the fe because it is a year old at this point but the fe does get the extra year of software updates just because it came out in 2022 versus 2021 on the original s201 but because of the timing of this launch on the s21fe it is actually really close to the launch of the upcoming samsung flagship the s22 and i have some thoughts about those phones so they're going to be using the new snapdragon chips the snapdragon 8 gen 1 and i've tested a few phones with that chip like this being one of them this is from real me the gt2 pro this is actually similarly priced for all this stuff it's a if you're adventurous you can import this thing for a very cheap price but the chip is a good performer especially when it comes to graphics but it uses a lot of juice and it pushes out a ton of heat so for samsung's but to use this new chip in one of their new galaxy devices you know those are thin and elegant i think they're gonna have to throttle this chip quite aggressively to make it work but we'll have to see so s21 fe i think if you're looking at this here like i wouldn't wait for the new stuff because it's just it's a different breed of product the fe this year is an awesome phone it has a fantastic screen that gets bright very smooth at 120 hertz really solid camera even in low light and in tougher shooting conditions and it's seemingly a much less buggy experience than what the pixel 6 is offering right now and it's not even any more expensive if you play your cards right okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
