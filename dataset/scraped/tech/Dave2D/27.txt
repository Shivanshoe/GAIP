let's talk about gaming displays both for desktops and for laptops so over the past few years we've had a lot of companies push for better gaming displays right we've had high resolution we've had better colors faster response time faster refresh rates and it's a good push for that tech but it's always been done in this type of panel a matte finish or like a textured anti-glare coating that's put on top of the display itself or on top of the panel and these are nice looking screens but i saw something better so these are both the eve spectrum this is a retail unit that i bought earlier this year it's a good screen 4k 144 hertz really nice to look at nice to play games on but this also made by eve well this is like an engineering sample something they want to make this is the same display panel but it's an untextured glossy finish on the top now the moment i pulled this thing out of the box i was like this is so much nicer to look at so much better like a way better visual experience than the regular retail unit the moment you put up anti-glare or matte finish on a product you're basically putting like a diffusion layer on top of the screen so you're having like you're reducing the brightness you're reducing the contrast your colors are more muted your sharpness is lost like this definitely just becomes a little bit more fuzzy or like mistier because it's got this fuzzy layer on the top this is just it's better visually it's empirically a better experience but you now have to take into consideration reflections so it should be pretty obvious in that camera but in case it's not i brought out this big boy the guy that this used to be my old videos i miss them and on the regular matte finish screen it's this diffused glow from the light stick but on here it's like not quite a mirror but it's much more reflective now i think that difference is the main reason why companies have pushed for an anti-reflection coding right the thing that i noticed the most like outside of games and videos was text text is so much sharper without that matte diffusion layer and it's especially noticeable on a 4k panel like these right it's just there's a ton of pixels there's a lot of detail you can have but the moment you put on that anti-glare coating there's a bit of blooming there's a bit of just like diffusion of that image going through that diffusion layer but reflections right now if you think about kind of everyday tech like phones tablets uh some laptops like macbooks like every macbook every current macbook has a glossy screen they're all using glossy screens because that gives you the best visual experience and it is so weird to me so weird to me that when it comes to gaming screens there's no option like how has that not been a consideration over the past few years everyone's been making matte gaming screens and i wouldn't even be surprised if you got better performance like player performance with the glossy panel like it's just more contrast that separation between light and dark how could that not help you play better in in games or if you're playing competitively now i got to talk about reflections because reflections that's the consideration right even though it looks better and it is a nicer visual experience our reflection is a big deal so i've been testing this screen in the studio in various locations as well as bring it home because i just want to see what this thing played like right my overarching thought is that this the whole thing about reflections is a non-issue now if you're wearing a pure white outfit and you're playing in a room with like all these windows and you have no way of controlling the light then sure if that's your life then you're gonna go with you're gonna do better with this screen like a regular matte finish but if you are a gamer and you're playing games in the comfort of your own space you tend to have control over light right you tend to have control over how you tilt your screen or like if you have blinds or whatever and it's just so much better so if you had the option i think most people would prefer the glossy panel now the elephant in the room is the topic of eve as a company now they sent me this engineering sample but just because they sent it to me doesn't make them immune to my criticism so i bought this with my own money this was like 800 us dollars the purchase experience was less than ideal and they unfortunately have developed this less than ideal reputation where they promised delivery dates and they promise things and they tend to they're they're short in terms of like delivery time and you know making products available when they say they're going to be available and also they've had issues with refunding pre-orders this product does not exist yet it's not a retail product that you can go and buy eve wants to make it and i think they're looking for kind of consumer feedback as to whether or not they should go forward with it i think they should and i'll put a link in the description as to like how they're going to organize the manufacturing of this thing but when i pre-order it probably not like maybe if i was really hungry for this tech and like i've always wanted a glossy panel for my gaming setup sure go for it you'll be the first guys to get it but i think most people i'd wait i'd wait because their track record has not been good i would go to their website though i'd vote let them know that i want them to make it but i would wait and not pre-order when it does come available right away now i do think that if you're looking at this and like you want it i think other companies will adopt it there's no way that you know aorus or lg or asus is looking at this and be like nah we don't want that tech like it's really good i think it'll come into the market and kind of into the fold of gaming products in the near future i don't know probably a year year and a half we'll see a good number of them that's just a guess but laptops dude this is what this would be awesome this kind of panel glossy on a gaming laptop that's the good stuff okay there you have it the glossy non-textured display from eve spectrum hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
