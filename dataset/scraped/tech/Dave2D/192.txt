okay so with the Xbox series X and PlayStation 5 announcements that happened this week I've had this strong interest in consoles that I normally don't have and it revolves mostly around the hardware like both of these systems have incredibly strong Hardware not just for a console but just incredibly strong Hardware period like if you tried to build a PC with this kind of stuff if you have an 8 core CPU in there and a 10 to 12 teraflop GPU in there it's not cheap and you throw in a 1 terabyte SSD like that is a high-end PC high-end gaming PC which is that stuff is expensive and then if because this is a console it is probably gonna sell for like five maybe six hundred dollars it's not gonna be super expensive so for the price of a decent graphics card for just like if I was gonna upgrade my PC for the price of just a graphics card I can get a whole system like a whole gaming console for 600 bucks that's incredible and even though I'm not a huge console gamer I look at that and I respect that and also there's very clear advantages to console gaming right look if you're not particularly savvy with tech you can just go into a store pick it up but the whole simplicity of console gaming is one of its biggest appeals like there's no friction you go into a store pick up the system set it up you're done like you're playing you know there's no like there's no research there's no getting sweaty over which component to pick there's no you know you don't want to watch tech tips from Linus to figure out how to build your PC you just go like you've been playing that game within minutes of bringing that system home because of how easy everything is to set up and there's also the advantage of titles like you can have exclusive titles on consoles but the big thing is pricing consoles tend to be way cheaper to get into than a gaming desktop but as I looked at this announcement and I looked at all the specs from the PS 5 and the Xbox series X I had a whole bunch of thoughts in my mind I just want to share them with you the first thing is how impressive everything looks right now and I think it does because of the timing of these announcements like when you look at the timeline of this this is March we're in March right now we're like eat maybe even nine months out from when these products are actually gonna come out that's a long time that's a really long time before holiday 2020 so yeah the specs do look but there's also the timing of these announcements relative to component announcements so like CPUs and GPUs for desktops we're kind of on the tail end of that product cycle right now so we're gonna see refreshes in both graphics and CPUs for desktop PCs really soon over the next month or two so as impressive that this stuff looks right now I think by the time these products actually launch like when the Xbox series X and the PlayStation 5 actually come out during the holiday season they won't be as impressive as they look right now okay another thing pricing these devices are I mean their consoles they're going to be remarkably inexpensive at launch but they're designed to be lost leaders at launch like these products are designed to pull in customers into their ecosystems and to keep them there and the reason why they're comfortable eating dirt on their console pricing is because they're gonna sell you games which they don't want to pay like Steam or the epic game store or any kind of cut they're selling you accessories they're selling you those monthly passes be able to play online they will make their money elsewhere so they're very comfortable selling you these cheap consoles to start and once you're in that ecosystem you start spending some money on games you spend a couple hundred bucks or maybe in a thousand bucks you can't leave your you can't take that library and just go somewhere else you got to stay with whichever console you got that thing for so I mean yes the companies are working on you know backwards compatibility that's why it's so important to them that's why all the companies are like hey you know yeah we're supporting our older games because if you if you don't support them you're basically telling your customers to burn their entire library of older games but the point I'm trying to make is that there's hidden costs when it comes to these super cheap consoles they are very appealing and they're super cheap for the type of hardware you're getting but it's for a reason another thing I want to mention is the marketing around like the 4k 64k 120 or even 8k gaming that can come out of these systems I feel like that's very ambitious not that it's impossible like it is entirely possible for this hardware to push out that type of framerate it usually doesn't happen like if you look at the current consoles they are already capable of four case see like the Xbox 1x and even the ps4 Pro they can push at 4k 60 but not a lot of Triple E developers push out that type of framerate with those systems and it's because the average Tripoli developer chooses higher quality graphics instead of higher frame rates because that's the stuff that sells if you look at ps4 commercials or Xbox commercials that stuff looks crazy good because they focused on image quality not frame rate it's actually very difficult to sell high frame rate gaming to the average person not everyone appreciates that stuff so if you're someone that expects 4k 120 or even 8k gaming like I think your temper your expectations because I think that's more of an ambitious goal instead of something that they'll achieve anytime soon Microsoft in particular has said that they're not gonna be making any first party exclusives for the first year on the Xbox series X so what that means is that any game that comes out with the launch of the Xbox Series X is going to also be available for their Xbox one and possibly PC as well and what that means and that in the bigger picture is that if you're a developer you have to kind of your development ambition for those games like you can't make some super crazy stuff that works with the Xbox series X because it has to also work with the older stuff as well Sony the PlayStation 5 they don't have that rule so they have some developers that will be making games specifically for the PS 5 and no other system and I don't mean just like exclusive titles I mean it's going to only work on the PS 5 not even the PS 4 pro so games at launch I think are gonna look better with the PS 5 than the Xbox series X not that the series X is gonna look bad or anything but I just don't think that they can push that hardware as hard as the PS 5 guys can at launch another thing I found really interesting was that both consoles are gonna support ray tracing and that's huge in the past the only ray tracing that was available was stuff on PCs right like the 1% of PC users that had the high end cards that could support ray tracing but now developers have a huge or they will have a huge group of people that have ray tracing capable hardware so it's just way more incentive for developers to put ray tracing elements into games I think we'll just see a big jump in the uptake of ray-tracing tech which is awesome now I think both the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5 are gonna be big like they're gonna move that needle for a gaming hardware and the gaming experience in ways that no consoles have done in the past like I think the idea of an SSD like it just changes the nature of console gaming it's gonna be good if especially for people that are really into console gaming but if you're one of my viewers that you know you're normally in our console gamer but you look at this stuff with interest because you know the tech is gonna be good you know the hardware is comparable to what pcs offer and you know the price tag is probably gonna be quite good just remember its price like that for a reason and also remember it is just a console a really good console but a console okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs if he loves it see you guys next time
