this is a laptop that i think is going to stick out from anything you've ever seen before in this space this is the newest version of the neo15 or the mech15 and in addition to all the new components like intel 12th gen and up to an rtx 3080ti this is a device that can be connected up to a water cooling system and it is so cool so they claim that with this system connected up to it you can reduce the temperature by 20 degrees celsius which we'll get into in a second but the first thing i noticed when i pulled it out of the box was that this laptop is no thicker than their regular one like we've seen a couple attempts at water cooled devices before that were huge and thick and super heavy this is for all intents and purposes a regular 15-inch laptop it's kind of weird that they were able to do this and keep the profile the exact same shape and footprint as the previous version it's pretty cool and on the back of it you can see that they have this hatch or this like rubber flap where you can connect the water cooling system there's two connectors one serves as an input and the other as an output and when you're done with it or if you don't want to use water cooling at all you can just close that flap up okay now the water cooling system just to introduce you to this thing this is very small for what the old versions of water cooled laptops used to look like this is like way smaller than i thought it would be and depending on who you buy it from the pricing will range from like 100 bucks to 200 bucks so it's not crazy expensive i feel like it's reasonably priced for what you're getting here now the way this thing works in terms of connectivity uh the hose screws into this end like it's got two caps at the bottom of the water cooler and then the other end connects to the laptop so this is a quick connect system uh and it works just like it's kind of like a push-pull type connection it'll clip in and it has a mechanism that prevents being yanked out accidentally and then when you're done with it you can just lift that bar and it pops off it's a pretty simple mechanism but when you have it connected up it forms the full loop like the cooler water runs through the hose into the laptop through this copper water loop and it pulls off the heat from the existing heat pipes and then the warmer water comes out of the hose into the radiator that cools it down so it's a fairly simple mechanism but at the same time it is very complex because this is running water through a laptop and if there's any kind of leak or flaw in the mechanism here and for a world of hurt now this device does not come filled at the factory you have to fill it up with your own coolant i'm gonna be using uh this is stuff from corsair it's their hydrox fluid in blue of course this particular model the one from xmg comes with a different coolant but coolant it's just coolant and honestly if you're using this we'll get into it but i think you should be using distilled water but for the purposes of this presentation i'll be using the blue corsair hydro x and i think it takes about like a full fill is probably 200 mil so just so you have that in mind if you ever do this uh one other thing the cap let's place this real quick the cap at the top it's a pretty snug fit it's a plastic cap that fits onto a rubber housing over there uh it's decently snug i do think that if this thing tipped over or something i don't think anything's gonna leak out but yeah it's okay okay so let's just fill this up real quick after you fill it you plug up the ac adapter to the water cooler and then the cooler has a cable that plugs to the back of the laptop and that powers the device but the laptop talks to the water cooler through a bluetooth connection and allows you to control the rgb lighting as well as a bit of control for the fan speed all right now in terms of performance this laptop at stock with the air cooling is a great performer it's got the intel 12th gen 12700h it's got rtx 3080 ti it's pushing out great numbers but when you plug up the juice this just delivers a whole new level of performance the cpu runs about 20 maybe 22 degrees cooler but the gpu is even bigger of a gap it's kind of wild to see these numbers coming out of a gaming laptop it's about a 10 bump in performance so depending on the game or app that you're using it can be pretty substantial you do get the benefit not just with the better performance but you also get reduced fan noise which is actually quite substantial like these gaming laptops when you crank the fans full tilt they get really loud and this system like the water cooling system is significantly quieter and you also have reduced temperatures which could theoretically make the device last a little bit longer i will say a 10 bump in performance for 100 or maybe 200 is pretty reasonable i think a lot of people would be interested in paying that but there are a few things you should be aware of number one is fan noise this system is not completely silent so when you connect it up even if you're not doing anything you're just idling the system there is a bit of a fan noise just when you first start it up there's like some bubbles so this would be like the heavy load or heavier load this is the quieter mode but in both cases it's not completely silent compared to a regular air cooled laptop that has a very low fan speed when it's doing nothing but the other thing you have to be aware of is maintenance because unlike a regular air cooled laptop there is a degree of upkeep that has to come with a device like this so if you ever have to disconnect the laptop from the water cooler there is a chance that a drop or two will come out of the hose it's not a big deal it's supposedly just the water pressure of the hose but there is a chance that it'll come out now it's not always it's actually quite infrequent but you do have to be mindful of that because you could be in an environment where you just can't have fluids dripping out of your laptop uh that sounds so perverted but that's just the case right the other thing is that there is some fluid that remains in the water loop on the inside of the laptop and they recommend you drain it out because if you don't it has this chance of just dribbling out and there's a decent amount of fluid in there look at that did you pick that hump it's like laptop p it's kind of warm this sounded another thing is that when you disconnect the device if you're losing a little bit of fluid here and there if you're draining the laptop a couple times a week because you're traveling you have to top off the reservoir now i would say that using a like a retail coolant is not the move i would absolutely use distilled water because if you're using store-bought coolant like the stuff they include or even like the corsair hydrox stuff here there's a there's like biocide there's like other stuff other than water other than like pure distilled water in these products and if it's going onto your table or like your i don't know your workspace like that's just you don't want to think about it right if it if you pick this up distilled water is the thing that i would use because if it does spill it's like whatever just brush it off let it dry off because it does water okay my personal take on this product overall i think that this idea is phenomenal i think that this is executed in a way that is so much better than the previous like the asus gx700 i reviewed a few years ago this is really cool it's small it's compact and it works really well the temperatures are like it's super good as to what this thing can do in terms of performance the big question you have to ask yourself if you're looking at this like not just like should i buy this it's like should you consider picking up these types of devices because it has access to this like it is very unique no one else has this type of product no other company right it's just the tongfeng devices so the thing had to consider i think it's not the price because 100 200 bucks for 10 improvement most people would be willing to do it i also don't think it's the performance gains right is a 10 bump in performance really worth it i think i think most people would take that right it's really the maintenance and the just the upkeep of the system that i can't gauge for the average person now me personally i love it absolutely if i was younger and i had more time this is a hundred percent this is what i'd be using but that's me that's super sweaty nerd dave right and i think for a lot of you guys you have to keep the realist the the realistic element of this it's like if you're going to class you got to do the the drain if you're doing anything that requires travel you've got to do the drain because you do not want to risk the fluid just going out into your bag but there you have it uh the water cooled laptop and i think this is really cool okay hope you guys
