okay let's talk about the oneplus 8t this is a surprisingly difficult phone to review for a couple of reasons number one the pricing for the 8t varies quite drastically depending on where you pick it up in the world right if you're in asia you get certain pricing and in north america it's a little bit more expensive and then number two the more important reason is that this phone doesn't just exist in a vacuum right the oneplus 8t has to sit alongside a whole bunch of other seven to eight hundred dollar smartphones and right now in the end of 2020 we're seeing stuff like the s20 fe the pixel 5 the iphone 12 the iphone 12 mini there's a lot of really good competition to this phone so it just took a little bit of time to kind of wrap my head around this thing all right let's start off with the good stuff this phone is packed with super fast hardware from the screen to the storage to the 5g connectivity if that matters to you it's just got speed written all over it this is classically oneplus fast just like the oneplus 8 and the oneplus 8 pro from earlier on this year now quick note about the colors of these phones the original oneplus 8 and oneplus 8 pro the greenish hue on it was called glacial green and it's kind of like a matte pearlescent finish the 8t has similar kind of green color they call it aquamarine green i believe but it's a glossy finish and to me it doesn't look as nice like i definitely prefer the matte finish of the 8 and the 8 pro from earlier this year but there is a second color variant they call it lunar silver which retains that matte finish but this one has a glossy metal trim which doesn't really go as well with that matte finish as the original eights but that's just picky aesthetic stuff now there's other cool stuff on the 8t that i really like the flat edge on the display is something i've always appreciated but was missing from the 8 and the 8 pro it's nice to see it come back there's also the presence of super fast charging so this supports 65 watt charging it's two batteries that are filled up simultaneously and it uses a big boy charger 65 watt charger and well the whole charging system is a little bit different now so it's got usbc to usb c this is the first time we've ever seen double usbc ended stuff from oneplus and it fills up crazy fast like you'd expect from a 65w charger it took me just over 40 minutes to fill this thing up from zero to 100. it's super fast and it's kind of neat to see those numbers roll up so quickly i don't know how real they are like it could just be a approximation that they've done in software but it is cool to look at and it doesn't get much harder than regular 30 watt warp charging the battery life is also quite good i got seven half hours pretty consistently screen on time with screen brightness at about three quarters the speaker on the bottom is quite a bit louder than the earpiece speaker so again there's like that stereo sound discrepancy if that bothers you but the good stuff is really good on the oneplus 8t now i want to move this conversation onto the deficiencies or the shortcomings of this device and to understand that we kind of have to talk about pricing so when i did my original review of the oneplus 8 this was a 700 phone and i said it was a good phone a really good phone but i felt like it was overpriced the 8t is a little bit more expensive they made some upgrades but there's a couple deficiencies that still remain on this device number one there's still no wireless charging and number two the camera system is pretty mediocre now if you look at the competitors so the big ones would be like the s20 fe the pixel 5 and i guess the two iphone 12s like the mini and the regular all four of those have wireless charging and all four of those have significantly better camera systems than what is offered on the oneplus 8t the photos that come off the main sensor are pretty good they're kind of oversaturated over processed and the contrast is a little too high but i think in general people will like these photos the ultrawide is where i feel like it shows most of its weakness the shots are heavily overprocessed and you lose a lot of that detail from that processing especially with night shots and the macro lens is also not particularly good i don't think that the camera system is poor overall but it could be a lot better especially at this kind of price point you see my issue isn't with any of the specific camera sensors or the lack of wireless charging because as poor as some of that stuff might be it doesn't break the phone right my issue is with intent with what oneplus is purposely doing right now because of their three-phone lineup so they have three phones they have the oneplus nord which is their budget option the oneplus 8 or the 8t kind of like the middle of the road and they have their super expensive or more expensive oneplus 8 pro and when you have three phones with three distinct price categories it's very difficult to load the correct feature set into the phones so that they all remain competitive and attractive to the customers the middle one is the one that is going to get screwed the hardest because oneplus is really good at that budget stuff right the oneplus note is super popular it's a good loadout well configured well priced and the oneplus 8 pro with the best camera system even though it's expensive it's well reviewed and respected because the camera system is really good i'd go so fast to say it's the only good camera system oneplus has ever put into their phones the oneplus 8t it has to look appropriately spec'd on the shelf it like it can't be too good it can't be too poor but when you have something like the oneplus nord and you have something like the oneplus 8 pro it is super hard to configure this thing properly it is so hard to make this phone sit on the shelf alongside the other two phones and so we end up with is this weirdly gimped phone that has deficiencies in areas that don't need to be deficient they do not need to have this camera system in here i'm sure that if they spent like 20 bucks if the cost of this phone could be bumped up by 20 bucks they could have a killer camera system in here they could bump up the price by another five bucks and have wireless charging in there but they can't because if they did no one would buy the eight pro and went by the nine pro next year that version of the at would be too good be too well specced for 750 bucks but this makes the real 80 a very difficult phone to recommend openly like there are certain people that will find certain features on this phone very useful right if you're someone who needs that fast charging plug it up for a few minutes get like 20 that's awesome but for the vast majority of people i'd recommend one of the other phones or one of the older eights like eight or the eight pro it's unfortunate right this is oneplus news phone and it should be an awesome one and it is but because of the competition because of its pricing it is what it is okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you
