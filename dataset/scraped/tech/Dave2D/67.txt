get over here all right so the moment i heard about this device i wanted to make a video for you guys badly because it was such a cool laptop to me and this is probably going to be one of the most interesting devices we've seen this year in terms of the gaming laptop space so this is the amd based blade 14 from razer now amd based gaming laptops are not super special or rare at this point in time every company is doing that right acer asus alienware msi they're all have these amd based gaming laptops which is a good thing to see and finally razer's gone on board but what makes this one special is that this configuration has never been done before so what razer has is the top spec'd gpu like an rtx 3080 equipped with the amd 5900 hx it's a step above the chip that's been seen in basically every other thin and light gaming laptop out there which is the hs or the h variant this is the hx an unlocked overclockable amd chip and it's all packaged in this thin gaming laptop this is just a 14-inch gaming laptop it's kind of crazy what's going on here like the engineering to make this happen is quite impressive you put it beside like a 15-inch like this is the 15-inch razer blade advance or the studio edition like you can see the difference in size it's very small very compact now in order to make this happen this was not simple right if it was everyone would be doing a thin high-powered device like this but it's actually quite complex for like the past year we've been wanting razer to put an amd chip inside their device and it seems like they're brewing something that was special they were brewing this device now when you pop it open you have your standard kind of razor fare you have your rgb keyboard as a chiclet style keyboard this doesn't actually feel all that cramped i thought it would because they have the speaker cutouts on the side still and the keyboard shrunk a little bit but it feels very familiar to me if you've used a razer laptop keyboard you also have their standard glass trackpad this is a nice trackpad and you also have a 14-inch screen you get two options there's a 1440p version as well as a 1080p version and there's also a webcam up top that supports windows hello so you can log in with facebook metrics these are very fast screens and even on this pre-production unit i'm not seeing any kind of ghosting or artifacting that we've seen on other 14-inch gaming laptops so yeah i think this is a well-rounded package now i want to talk about those two components a little bit more detail so the the cpu and the gpu and what makes it special so in the traditional kind of thin and light gaming laptop space if they're using an amd chip in there they're using either 5800h or 5900 hs both very capable chips but they're just kind of the standard fare i say standard it's still like high-end stuff but it's like the regular amd chips this is running the hx the unlocked overclockable chip so the boost clock is higher the top end but even the base clock is faster it's like 10 faster than the regular chips but what's most interesting to me is that they've also paired this with an rtx 3080 at the top end you can equip it with the fastest mobile gpu out there and the question is like how how are they doing this like it doesn't make sense to me i mean everyone wants that every gaming laptop would love to stick the fastest most powerful components inside and sell it but you can't do it there's thermal limitations right how did they pull this off now this is a pre-production unit so i can't run any kind of extensive testing or proper benchmarking on it but when i pop it open you can see the presence of the vapor chamber this is tech that they've used in a lot of their high-end devices it's just a method of cooling the chips a little bit more effectively than a regular heat pipe but there's a couple other things i want to draw your attention to razer in the past has done this thing where they lower the cpu clock speed just a smidge to keep the temperatures down and it's quite effective it keeps their systems cooler and quieter than a lot of other competitors but the clock speeds have been dropped a smidge and the fact that synapse controls the power distribution like between the cpu and the gpu i think that razer can do it i think that razer can make this product and make it a functional viable performance laptop in a small form factor with all those high-end components in it it's pretty cool now there are a couple things that i think you should be aware of if you're interested in this device number one when i popped it open the ram is soldered on and it seems to be limited to 16 gigabytes which is i think it's great for gaming but if you're a content creator extra ram is always nice the other thing it only comes in black and i'm partial too not just for like the white color for the aesthetics but i've always found that black razor laptops they nick like they show the the silver material like the aluminum underneath the anodization pretty easily if you damage it and i don't like that there's always skins and stuff you can get for this device but a single color of black you know what would be awesome if they did that gray color again that like titanium gray whatever they did a few years ago gray version of this with 32 gigs of ram i would buy one immediately like 100 okay but that's the new razer blade 14. it's pretty fly so there's a couple of the things that they announced today so there's the updated version of the razer raptor the 27-inch gaming monitor with the green cables that flow at the back that's been refreshed and there's also this thing the 130 watt gan charger this is based off of gallium nitride and it's a very compact ac adapter for laptops or phones whatever you have that you want to charge but that's the e3 announcement from razer they pumped out a bunch of hardware this device the razer blade 14 i am i'm excited for it i want this to be my personal device like i want to use it in my regular workflow so i'll be doing a proper review on that in the near future so stay tuned for that okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
