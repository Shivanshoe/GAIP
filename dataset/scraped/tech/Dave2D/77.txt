get over here okay so remember a long time ago like two days ago i made a video about how i didn't want to have a table in front of me when i shot in this new studio and i'm still figuring it out it's difficult there i don't want the table but sometimes when you have a lot of stuff that i want to show like a bunch of cool laptops how do i do it right okay so intel they just launched their new 11th gen mobile chips and they're making some big claims we're seeing frame rates and benchmarks that make it seem competitive at the very least against amd maybe even better but keep in mind all these benchmarks are kind of cherry picked from intel they're kind of showcasing it to their best advantage i can't do full reviews on this stuff yet it'll be coming very soon stay tuned but i do want to show you a bunch of new laptops from msi that have these new 11th gen chips and some companies are just doing refreshes like they just do a chip drop in their old products but msi did a revamp across their whole board as well as made a couple completely brand new products so the first one is the z16 this is by far the best built laptop i've seen from msi so as a company they have a lot of metal laptops right but they're usually made with stamped or just folded metal processes where it keeps the cost down and it's still a metal device but it's never as sturdy or as durable as i'd like to see and i think a lot of this is reflected in my audience as well right you see it in their build quality across most of their metal devices the z16 is milled out from a single block of aluminum so it's the stuff you normally see on high-end premium laptops like macbooks and i wouldn't be surprised if that's what they were going for with this whole build quality the look and feel and shape of it even the keyboard has this macbook like appearance and even texture to the keycaps it's this kind of silky smooth finish that's very reminiscent of the mac keyboard it's strange now it's 16 millimeters thick if i'm not mistaken this is the thinnest high performance windows laptop i've ever had in the studio it's strangely thin but also has a 16 inch screen so it's got a nice 16 by 10 aspect ratio screen quad hd 120 hertz it's got 100 dc ip3 it's got all the good stuff you want for gaming as well as color accurate content creation it's a fantastic looking screen so it's running on 11th gen cpu from intel as well as an rtx 3060 very capable hardware but because it's a early kind of pre-production unit an engineering sample i can't run official benchmarks on it and just i can't i'm not allowed to test it out thoroughly i will say though the one thing that just pops up into my mind the moment i look at this the build quality in this thing is bizarre like you see these grills every time i've ever seen an msi device i poke at these grilles and there's a bit of flex to it some better some worse but there's always some kind of play to the device because it's always been made with folded metal and it's never super sturdy this is on a whole new level not just for msi but even the high-end premium windows laptop market you don't get devices built quite like this it's something special so if you've ever wanted a laptop that was super thin but at the same time very durable and well built and you didn't want a macbook because you want other gaming capabilities or just the versatility that windows offers this is pretty cool they've built something that is super thin yet has the durability of something that is like a macbook cause if you've ever felt that stuff like they're built strong and this it's in that class okay the next device is the gs76 this is a device that i reviewed last year i believe it was the gs75 but it's completely revamped this year the 76 and they fixed two relatively big issues number one the hinge is no longer that weird gold color and the overall build quality is noticeably better so this device is their 17-inch thin and light gaming laptop it's a pretty popular device probably because it is so thin and light at a reasonable price but last year's model there was a lot of torsional flexibility to the device and i think they listened and they added i guess structural elements to it it's a lot more durable the whole thing just feels sturdier and less flexible it's about a half pound heavier than the previous iteration which is not insignificant right a half pound is still a half pound but on a 17 inch device that was five pounds before it's still really lightweight for a device of this caliber uh there's also a 360 hertz screen super fast display super fast components and i also noticed the change in the speaker positioning so they've always had bottom firing speakers which i've always disliked on the gs line they're now upwards firing and even on a pre-production unit you can immediately tell that it's got cleaner audio coming from these upward firing speakers so it comes in black it's this nice thin and light device if you like 17-inch thinner light gaming devices gs76 looks pretty nice this year now i'm going to move this conversation over to the last family of devices there's three here that are similar in design language but they're all slightly different so at the top you have the white sword 15. this is my favorite device of the stack and it comes in at under a thousand bucks that's an entry-level gaming laptop and normally when you have this kind of price point you do not get white devices certainly not white devices that look good and are built nicely this is it's weird to see like normally you can't get a white laptop with a clean design like this and a muted logo up front for a thousand dollars it's just not a thing especially not one with great performance like this thing should be able to deliver also if you look at the bottom you can see the heavily perforated grilles i feel like the thermal characteristics on this device are going to be quite good especially when it seems to be using the same thermal system as the more premium and more heavily configured gl pulse this is equipped with a more powerful rtx 3070 but because the heatsink array and the whole thermal system is of the same family i have a feeling that these two devices are going to have excellent thermal characteristics for this kind of price point the rtx 3050 and 3050 ti deliver very usable ray trace graphics and i want to take this moment just to flex my ray traced minecraft build so i never played minecraft when it first came out this is like a relatively new experience for me and my son got into it but the difference between regular minecraft graphics and ray traced minecraft is night and day i think it's crazy how much ray tracing does for that game so that's some of the msi devices with intel's new 11th gen stuff i'll be doing full reviews on that chip and some of these devices the one that's not in here that i really want to see was that ge76 like the raider if i had to guess that's got to be the most popular device i didn't review last year's model but i i got to get it in so yeah reviews coming soon and yeah hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time if you're still watching this video if you're one of my long-term subscribers or even some of the new people that just recently joined this format is it's different right like not having a table not having the ability to place devices let me know in the comments like what you think obviously this isn't perfect i'm tweaking this stuff as i go every day it's like everything's a little bit weird for me but yeah i mean what did you think let me know [Music] thanks
