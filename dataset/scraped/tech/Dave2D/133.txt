okay so sony just put out this playstation 5 teardown video and the first thing i noticed was like oh my god that thing is a huge huge console it's bigger than i thought it would be like i expected it to be large because we'd seen like the paper specs and you see the pictures and you compare them side by side but when you see it in front of a person and their hands manipulating the device you realize it is a huge console but the other thing i noticed is that because of its large size and its spacious interior it gives you one huge advantage over smaller consoles you can cool it really well you can cool it more easily and more effectively because you can put huge components in there you can put a big fan ps5 has one fan double intake blows a ton of air in there and you have a gigantic heat sink and because that heatsink is so big i think that the playstation 5 is going to be a quieter system than the xbox series x like just the physics behind it right huge heatsink means a lot of surface area to pull heat out of the system versus the xbox which is already a very sizable heatsink but this one on the playstation 5 looks like it's 50 maybe 60 larger just visually it is huge now microsoft is using a vapor chamber on the xbox series x while sony's using a more traditional heat pipe system but if they're designed properly they are very similar like i know the term vapor chamber sounds so much cooler and so much more new age than like a heat pipe but they're they're basically the same kind of tech they're just different shapes and looking at that chunky heatsink from the playstation 5 i really believe it's going to do an awesome job at pulling heat out of that system now the most interesting thing to me in this entire video from sony was the presence of liquid metal as the thermal interface material on that chip it is crazy when i saw that i was like what like we'd seen the rumors right a long time ago there were rumors that sony's gonna use liquid metal in this thing and i'll be honest when i saw those rumors i was like there's no way because here's the thing liquid metal is better right in terms of thermal performance but number one it's expensive number two it's a more complex application it doesn't matter if you're using machines or labor to do it it is a way more complex application process than just squirting thermal paste on it right you have to be careful it can be time consuming it's way more involved than just a traditional thermal paste application but number three the most the craziest thing about this is that in order for them to use liquid metal on the ps5 it has to be so well engineered like look at this picture and i draw your attention to two things so you can see like the liquid metal layer floating on top of the soc but look at the foam barrier that's surrounding the chip so that is put in place to prevent the liquid metal from spilling out and going into the rest of the system because if a drop of that stuff comes out it'll screw things up really quickly and if you look closely there seems to be a second inner trim of some kind of sponge or foam based material possibly to prevent the stuff from spilling out as well the whole thing is though if you have liquid metal because it's gallium based it's conductive if it comes out of that area and it touches any kind of metal contacts on the rest of your playstation 5 it can short-circuit it real fast so it's got to be really well engineered but the reason why i find this so interesting is that i don't think this has ever been done before i can't think of another time when a consumer a consumer item that's mass-produced right there's gonna be like 10 millions of playstation 5 tens of millions of playstation 5's maybe hundreds of millions at the end running liquid metal and it's crazy it's cool but remember sony did this in the pursuit of thermal performance it's a bit of a risk right it's a lot more complex than just regular thermal paste but i think the payoff is that you get a system that is incredibly well cooled and quiet the playstation 5 seems so well engineered to me like from the side panels that pop off easily to those dust collection ports we can just like vacuum out the dust that builds up to the bottom stand that comes off and has a little area we can put the screw back into like it just seems so well engineered it feels so japanese right where there's like so meticulous about these engineering decisions and everything just kind of works out really nicely it's so sony and i love it they also showed the area that's going to house the expansion slots so if you want to get extra storage for the ps5 you would plug it up in here but the whole system feels so much more thought out right it seems so well engineered to like the playstation 4 playstation 4 pro those are good systems but this is just on another level i feel like this is just i think people are going to appreciate it what do you think is this cool okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
