okay so asus has a line of gaming laptops called the rog zephyrus laptops and they're like the premium laptops from asus like the premium gaming stuff that is the best built the best performing the thinner lighter stuff this is like their flagship stuff this is the rog zephyrus duo zephyrus m15 and the s15 and i was originally going to do a video on each one of these but then i thought there's so much stuff that's like in common between them and i thought i'd just do like one super duper mega laptop video and just kind of cover them all at once so i'm gonna start with this one because this uh i've done a preview of this device like i had like an engineering sample a few months ago but this was a device that i actually wanted to use as my primary machine it was going to be this or the xps 17 different devices but you'll see why it's this really cool implementation of a secondary screen and this screen is awesome it really doesn't matter what you're doing if you're playing games or browsing reddit or doing video production music production it really doesn't matter because having more screen like this is always a good thing and because of the tilt is just a lot more useful than other implementations of a secondary screen on a laptop now in order to have a screen like this they have to shove everything down and the keyboard is in this lowered position i don't mind the ergonomic change as a result of this like there's no more palm rest you do have the optional palm rest that it comes with here it is and it slots right in front of it it doesn't attach magnetically or anything it's just like this piece of rubber it's comfortable i don't really need it but the one thing that i don't like about this keyboard is because of this because your hands are forced to be further away you are now like eight nine inches away from the screen than you normally would if this laptop didn't have this configuration like normally i'm gonna show this your hands would be like here on a laptop right but because of this they're here so you just sit a little bit further back and because of that seating position it's like this 15 inch screen becomes like a like a 13 or 14 inch screen just because everything's a little bit smaller now because it's further away and i don't think there's a way around this i feel like if you're gonna use the zephyrus duo you have to be comfortable with being seated further away from the screen than you normally would be the keyboard itself is fine i actually like the way that it types layout is good and the trackpad even though it's shifted over to the right is a perfectly fine trackpad but it's just the the positioning that you guys should be aware of if you're going to drop this kind of money on this machine the rest of the device um it's good i'm not going to go into thermal performance until the very end i'll kind of talk about the thermal designs of all these things at the end but this machine is equipped with an rtx 2080 super max q and the unlocked 8 core cpu from intel it's got 32 gigs of ram two ssds but only a single slot of replaceable memory the other 16 gigs on this device are soldered on the wi-fi module is baked on and the battery life is okay it's a four hour battery it's a big one 90 watt hours but because of the secondary screen and the device that i have has a 4k panel up top i was only getting just over four hours on my regular battery test uh there's one other thing i would say is like a minor quibble i have about this it's the ac adapter it comes out like not only does it come at the side it's actually quite close to the front of the device so it's just in this relatively inconvenient spot i really like to have seen it in the back or at the very least kind of further back on the side okay let's move on to other devices uh let's go with this one the zephyrus m15 this is the least expensive of the bunch it's actually my favorite of these machines i like it a lot not just because of its price the price is better but this is designed really well for a 12 or 1300 machine it's well built with a solid chassis unibody construction so there's no seams or anything like that on the paneling it's just it's it's what you would expect for a zephyrus product and i'm actually surprised they're selling this for this price point at least surprised that they're able to do this type of build at this price point because it's almost identical to the one that's double in price in terms of build quality it comes in this nice gray color i think they call it prismatic gray and it's got this like dot matrix looking thing that's slightly holographic it's super subtle but looks really nice to me and the gray is all over the device as well it's not just the top panel it's on the keyboard deck and everything and it also has that like slightly soft touch finish to it but it's also complemented by this nice white backlighting on the keyboard which in this day and age is not that common a lot of gaming laptops go for like crazy rgbs and this is just a nice pure white the keyboard has a pretty standard asus layout i think most people like it or at the very least get used to it quite quickly and there's also the small arrow key cluster on the bottom right if that's something used frequently there's one thing i noticed in terms of the lighting it is that nice white lighting but there's a difference between the rgb versions and the white lit versions the white ones have like you can see the function keys like you can actually see the f1 through f12 quite clearly but on the rgb iterations they don't actually light up the f numbers only the functions that those keys do so if that's something that's very important to you and you want these devices go for the gray prism white backlit version okay trackpad standard good trackpad that's basically it for this one no we'll look take a look at the inside very similar innards between all of these devices but this one has the weird thing it's the cheapest one but it's got the same mediocre speakers as the one that's triple the price right that's normal so there's two ssd slots and a single ram slot again and this one has a 76 watt hour battery but you're getting five hours of battery life which is a little bit better than the surface duo this is running a single screen for one and a lower res screen for two so it's just going to have slightly better battery life than the big boy uh the screen so it's a 1080p screen 240hz it's a great screen now this unit is running the six core intel cpu as well as the rtx 2070 max-q which is again a very decked-out system i am surprised that they're able to sell this at that price point like if you look at the other competitors that are selling well-built machines that look good look simple and have like a full package if you're getting a 20 70 max q at you know fifteen hundred dollars and change that's pretty good now there are some things i don't love about this machine uh they're minor but i'm just going to mention them the ac adapter coming out on the left side again like right in the middle it can be inconvenient when your cables are coming out there uh standard port selection otherwise but there's no webcam so not everyone needs a webcam for the people that do you now have to purchase an external it doesn't come with one or anything it's just part of the deal now some people might love that right the whole privacy thing going on right now but that is the zephyrus m now last up zephyrus s 15. this machine is this used to be the flagship this used to be asus's most expensive laptops like the first zephyrus s the premium super thin super powerful machine the difference between this one and the m is well the big thing is components this has an eight core intel cpu and an rtx 2080 super max q it's gonna be the fastest stuff that you can get in a laptop but to cool components like this it's hard like to cool an 8 core cpu i should rephrase to cool an intel 8 core cpu it's difficult right these things pull a lot of wattage and that rtx 2080 super max q is it's a power hog so you've got to vent the stuff properly now in order to do it in a chassis this thin asus does the the gap thing right when you raise the lid the hinge opens up to allow for better airflow it is effective absolutely does a good job removing heat but the question is is it really worth it because this is double the price of the m15 and they're very similar there's a lot of stuff that's like identical between the two the shape the design the construction of the two they're so similar even the internals are very close to each other so here's my take on this when the zephyrus s first came to the market this super thin super powerful device this was special it was weird to be able to see something that was this form factor with this kind of capability but over the years every company including asus but every company has just gotten better at cooling laptops and keeping them thin so now all three of these devices are now running liquid metal they have great thermal systems and you don't need crazy hardware to get excellent performance right now and that's not to take away from what the s15 is right it's a very powerful eight core rtx 2080 super equipped super thin machine that's really difficult to do but not a lot of games can take advantage of what this thing offers over what the half price m15 offers it also doesn't have as nice of a screen it's a 300 hertz screen but it's not as bright i prefer the screen on this cheaper one if if i had to choose between the two so that's basically the lineup we have the appropriately priced one we got like the baller version and we got the super baller like zephyrus duo okay that wraps up this video hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
