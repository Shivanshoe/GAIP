all right so apple brought up some really nice products this year but they're more recent stuff the m1 pro and one max products were particularly impressive and ever since they've come out i keep seeing this conversation pop up online of like apple and gaming apple should get into gaming apple should make a gaming laptop or some kind of gaming hardware because they can do it now right they're new chips powerful cpus really powerful gpus a lot of bandwidth very energy efficient they have all the ingredients right in front of them to make something that would be not just competitive but could beat a lot of the modern consoles and gaming laptops out there right now so why haven't they done it why haven't they made that push for gaming and i would love to see it right aaa gaming titles on apple hardware would be super cool but the more i looked into it and the more i saw what apple's been doing over the past few years it just feels like they're never going to do it i actually don't feel like apple cares about that kind of gaming so if you think about how they could theoretically get into that space right now there's two possibilities two big ones like number one they could make a console like product right something like an xbox or a playstation 5 or maybe even something that's like a switch akin to a switch something that is a console product that isn't an ipad or anything like that right something that's dedicated for gaming or number two they could push for more aaa titles to be developed so that they would run on their new silicon now i'm going to start off with the talk about the whole idea of a console so the concept of a modern day apple console isn't new and even last year there were rumors that something like this might pop up you can imagine a box like apple tv max or something and you stuff it with apple silicon it's very compact super powerful for its size 10 teraflops in this small little box the idea that is really neat but that's just not what consoles are about right consoles are supposed to be these inexpensive devices that you sell at potentially a loss to as many people as you can and you make money off the games that you sell those right that's how microsoft does it that's how sony does it that's how nintendo does it that's how the entire console industry works right now that's just not what apple ever does they like to sell you expensive hardware and they like to sell it to you frequently every year if you can right not once every few years on a console cycle no man that whole model is just so not what apple does i just don't see them ever doing something like that some idea of like a dedicated gaming box i just don't see them doing it the second thing is the idea of apple pulling in aaa developers to make games on their platform and there are some technical obstacles like you can't use standard apis you can't use directx you can't use vulkan you have to use metal if you wanted to be like the best optimized for apple stuff but it's all doable right the problem is there's just no money here there's such a small user base of people with macbooks especially macbooks with powerful graphics cards you have to play high-end games because a tiny portion of the world uses this kind of hardware so if you're a game developer you're not looking at this like you're looking at windows because that's that's where it is like if you think about rocket league a game that i loved there was a time when they had a mac os built or like a port that ran natively on on apple on mac os but then they killed it right there just wasn't enough of a user base to keep it active and to support that build so they just got rid of it even something like gentian impact that's a game that's built in unity and the devs can easily create a mac os build if they wanted to even one that's native for m1 but they choose not to right they have one for ios for android for ps4 for windows but they don't have it for mac os because there's just no incentive for them to do it there's the financial incentive ain't there but where apple excels at and truly excels at is in mobile gaming like they absolutely crush it there so there was a report of apple's gaming revenue from 2019 and is supposedly higher than microsoft sony and nintendo combined it's only like eight and a half billion dollars in profit and it's all pulled from the app store right that 30 cut that they take from all the sales that happened there plus the apple arcade stuff and we don't know how accurate those reports are but one thing's for sure they're making a good amount of bank from that app store and it's all done through phones and tablets has nothing to do with high-end hardware has nothing to do with aaa game development it's just like casual mobile games that's pulling in a ridiculous amount of money which is like it's cool for apple but the truth is i find it unfortunate because if if apple wanted to they could enter that aaa gaming world and they would do well in it right they have the resources they have their money they would just take a few years pull in some developers set up a program make it easier for devs to work on like they could crush it but they don't they choose not to why because this stuff does not make money like that high-end aaa gaming it's just so much less money than the micro transactions and the free to play models and like all the mini casual games that they sell in the app store that stuff makes a ton of money and it works really well for them apple's in one of the most profitable positions you can be in in the gaming industry possibly the most profitable position and for them to shift around resources just they can enter the mix and compete with the stuff it's just a lot of effort for not a lot of gain so i think apple looks at this stuff and they just do not care about this type of gaming it's unfortunate because we're looking at their amazing hardware like they can do it they could they could make something cool but it just wouldn't make financial sense for them now i do think that in the future they're looking for the next thing right how can they get into a space where they are innovative where they are leaders and i think with like augmented reality or maybe the metaverse stuff in the future maybe that's where they're going to go into and i think signs lead that way but that's way in the future i think if we're looking at apple's new hardware we're hopeful for something to come out from it that's geared towards gamers no i don't think it's gonna be a thing okay hope
