okay let's talk about apple's airpods max these are very expensive at 550 us dollars these are just so much more expensive than people would have imagined a pair of wireless over-ear headphones to cost even if they'd come from apple they're just the price tag is something else now when apple pushes a product onto the market especially something that is their kind of first attempt at they usually bring out something that is difficult to compare to the other players right they don't just make clones of the other products the other competitors they tend to just make something that's slightly different and they tend to focus on characteristics and features that other people aren't and in this case they focused well the big thing is design right this does not look like your standard pair of headphones they just don't they're very apple like and when you look at them you compare them to other popular active noise cancellation headphones these just look distinctly different and then you combo that with different colored ear cups and the ability to customize the different colors of ear cushions it is just built differently this is a completely different type of headphone look compared to everything else on the market now that doesn't make it worth 550 dollars right the aesthetics of a pair of headphones is only so important and only so valuable but right off the rip these are different the airpods max are built really well there's no way to deny that right there's a lot of metal going on construction and the build quality and finish is just really well done if you compare them to sony's xm4s i've never ever thought that these were poorly made in any sense right i've always thought that these were really well built but they're plastic right there's a lot of plastic in this construction it's just a different class of product when you compare it to the build quality of the airpods max that being said is it really worth paying extra just for metal ear cups who knows but let's be real here these are milled out from a single block of aluminum there's no seams it's just one piece machine time and there's two of them this doesn't come cheap now metal ear cups give the airpods max a very distinct look but it introduces a couple issues number one weight these are definitely heavier than your average pair of wireless headphones out there but secondly durability i don't mean like breakage i think these are very well made i don't think they'll break but in terms of the aluminum i think all right they can scratch they can be damaged quite easily if you don't take good care of them the fact that they include a case when you buy them it's just very obvious that these are delicate in terms of their finish like when was the last time apple included a case like a protective case when you bought a product it's always some kind of third-party thing they sell you but in this case they got to put it in because they know that they are relatively delicate now in terms of their fit the headbands have a fully adjustable arm like you can just put them to whatever position you want instead of having the kind of ratcheted clicks i didn't think that'd make a big difference because all the headphones i've ever used have had clicks and i've been perfectly happy with them but these are they're better they just you know being able to do those small adjustments does make a difference now for me personally i don't like the weight i think this is going to be very subjective right depending on the way that it sits on your head and just your head shape this is going to feel differently for everybody but for me personally i can feel that these are heavier than all of my headphones that i've owned before that doesn't mean to say that they're uncomfortable they're just noticeably heavier i did go for a run with them even though they're clearly not meant for that but i was just curious to see what that experience was like and there's just so much mass to these that every step you take like there's the momentum of them going up and down it's not a good experience the mesh on the top is also a little bit different from anything else i've used before in this category and i was hopeful that maybe they created a product that for people like me that wear their hair up that it would just kind of help with keeping your hair unflattened over time but it'll still flatten your hair so if you care about that now you know um okay i want to talk about the controls so there's two components here there's a button for turning active noise cancellation on and off and then there's also a jog dial which is very similar to the crown that you see on the apple watch now the button up front the noise cancellation button it's in a great spot works as intended we'll get into the kind of sound quality in a little bit but in terms of the controls it works perfectly the crown is distinctly apple and it does look really neat but i'd prefer my buttons on the bottom maybe i'm just used to it because all the other wireless headphones i've ever used that had controls on the bottom or the back but this is now on the top it looks nice but i don't think it really provides a better experience per se than having regular buttons on a pair of headphones the battery life on these are rated for 20 hours which seems pretty decent like any kind of electronic device that can last 20 hours unplugged is usually pretty good but in this product category we're dealing with competitors that have 30 35 hours of battery life so it doesn't really stick out as being great but that being said i do think that most people using this device will be perfectly happy with 20 but just for the people that travel frequently and you go through stretches where you just don't have access to a plug it is something to keep in mind okay let's talk about sound because sound is i mean it's really important when it comes to 550 headphones i'm gonna compare them most to these guys the xm4s do they sound better that's the question right i think they do i do think that these are a better sounding pair of headphones than the sony xm4s well let's just talk about the sony's first i've always liked the sound of these and for the type of music i listen to they're particularly good i listen to a lot of edm and there's a lot of like the bass on these is nice it's thumpy it's rich it's just like a nice bassy sound however if you're listening to stuff that has more higher frequencies like let's say you're listening to classical music which i also really enjoy on the sonys i've always found that sound to just be a little darker they like the bass is just too enriched on these you can always adjust it but at stock they've had a thicker sound with the lower frequencies the airpods max they're just brighter the other thing is a wider sound stage airpods macs have better instrument separation and just more width to the audio profile than sony's xm4s now in terms of noise cancellation sony's xm4s are arguably the best in the business right now right these are very well reviewed and having spent the past few days trying to discern the differences between them they're very similar in terms of their noise cancellation capabilities i would say that sony's xm4s are better at removing a consistent environmental sound like let's say in the background someone's got a hairdryer going these are better at reducing that kind of sound but i feel like the airpods max are better at like voices or just sound that is less consistent so if something pops up like a kid is talking in the background or someone else is watching a tv show these are better slightly better at removing that kind of sound but yeah i feel like i'm splitting hairs they're both really really good and i don't think you can pick one or the other just over their noise cancellation capabilities now in terms of their mics here's what they sound like this is what the mic sounds like in a quiet room but now there's water running and a hair dryer and rogan's podcast running out of the background and my voice is obviously not as clean as before now i'm recording off the sony's and this is my voice in a quiet environment and once again we have a tap running a hairdryer and logan's podcast in the background and my voice should obviously be worse than the previous recording i think they're both really good but i feel like the airpods max are slightly better at removing environmental sounds from your voice when you're using the microphone uh one of the things spatial audio so airpods max and airpods pro have something called spatial audio it seems a little gimmicky until you actually experience it it's actually pretty cool it just gives you this very immersive experience when it comes to watching shows or movies it's really hard to describe in a video so i'll be honest i'm not going to bother trying but it allows you to move your head around and the the sound sources will move in correlation with the screen and the earphones do with that information as you will now i want to wrap up this video with pricing because this is an important one so the price point 550 this is it's expensive right and okay i want to open up this conversation with the topic of apple's pricing strategies apple is really really good at pricing their stuff right they take a lot of stuff in consideration they have a team i'm sure these they've mapped it out right they've done all the calculations they take all the stuff in consideration what is this product for who are we trying to sell it to does this product lure people into our ecosystem does it trap people into our ecosystem it sounds terrible but you know what i'm trying to say right they take a lot of things into consideration when they price these things it's not just some number they pull out of their butt right okay 550 these are not a good value it doesn't matter how you spin it these are expensive now they're not meant to be a good value they're meant to be a premium luxury product from apple that's designed to be priced in a way that apple can make money right they've obviously priced this thing at that perfect point where it's expensive enough they could they can make as much money as possible without being too expensive to repel people away from purchasing it right that's the sweet spot when it comes to products like this and if you look at apple's website these things are sold out like they're literally sold out until march in every color so it doesn't matter how expensive i think they are or how expensive you think they are clearly people are just buying them so for apple these are priced perfectly if anything apple probably could have charged more and still be sold out with them right now which is crazy there's so much inertia to this brand okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time what do you think of the airpods max [Music] you
