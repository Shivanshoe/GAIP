so this is lenovo's legion seven it's a product that i think a lot of you guys were interested in is something that i was also anticipating because it's a it's a product category that lenovo has done really well for the past couple of years even the legion five a product that i reviewed a couple months ago is highly recommended but the legion seven is a little bit different now this is their top tier stuff this is like their their more expensive or most expensive gaming laptop and it kind of puts it in the same region or realm as something like this this is the razer blade uh this is their 15-inch model and this is a device that is similar in terms of product category right they're both like you know 15 1600 base and they just go up in price as long as you as you configure it but they're similar in like height they're both going for like thin performance gaming machines the razer devices are cooled better they clock these things slower purposefully so they don't run super hot and they don't get super loud that's how razer has been doing the razer blades this year this device does not do that this is a device that runs hot because this chassis is not designed to cool the components that you can configure the legion 7 in so as an example this thing can get up to an 8 core cpu and an rtx 2080 super max q gpu some very powerful stuff and the wattage that those two components pull is really high like it gets it gets hot now lenovo has put a vapor chamber in some of the higher configured units in this device so it helps a little but it still throttles and it's something that i did not expect coming from their high end model because the past two years they did not have throttling at least not to this degree on a flagship gaming laptop now i also mentioned the presence of a vapor chamber right but only certain configurations get that vapor chamber tech like if you get the eight core cpu you get the vapor chamber and also if you get certain gpus that are more powerful you also get the vapor chamber but the weird thing is and this is really weird i actually think that vapor chamber is not good i don't think it cools it particularly well so on this system i have a 6 core cpu and the rtx 2080 super max q a very powerful gpu but the cpu is just a 6 core cpu it's the same cpu that's in like the legion 5 that i tested a while ago that does not have a vapor chamber i'm getting worse thermal performance on this machine than i am on the legion five and this is when i'm just testing the cpu and this is the crazy thing this is not my first unit i ordered one from lenovo a month and a half ago i got it and i had bad numbers and i thought there's something wrong with this unit so i didn't do the review i waited for an official review unit it came in i got the same numbers so it could just be that i got two limbs in a row it seems unlikely but it is possible right but to me it feels like the vapor chamber tech that's in here isn't particularly well done and vapor chambers are often a term that's used by laptop manufacturers or just companies in general to market stuff vapor chambers are inherently not super special they're essentially just fancy heat pipes but they're just shaped differently i don't think they did a good vapor chamber on the legion seven and i hate to say that because i like the brand i really like their laptops and for the past couple of years they made such good stuff that i can easily recommend openly recommend but this device feels like a bit of a miss just in terms of thermal performance alone because if like that's why you buy this stuff right normally by the expensive stuff because they're cooling things better in thinner packages like this but when it comes to the legion seven this year it's just got ok cooling nothing great now the rest of the device has also been updated this year they have some rgbs on the back like that light up quite aggressively and you got some front kind of like underglow rgb now all of this is controllable in software which we'll get into in a little bit uh and the keyboard is also a little bit different i don't like this new keyboard as much last year's keyboard and the year before that they just had the regular layout they didn't have the 10 key on the right but they've added it this year and it just makes everything a little more cramped it's a personal preference thing some people love their number pads i don't but the actual keyboard mechanism and the feel of it is the same as last year and i actually like the way that it types the trackpad is also different this year as well they removed the individual buttons like they used to have buttons you could click like physical buttons on the left and the right they've removed that and now it's like a single trackpad the screen is again this is multiple configuration options so it depends on the one you actually get my unit's the 240hz panel it's bright with good colors it's really nice in games but i can only speak for this particular panel i don't know what the other ones are like at the top there's a webcam they've moved it from the bottom so it's now in a normal position and there's like a plastic kind of privacy cover that you can slide back and forth if you want to close off that webcam for security so the thing that kind of defines the legion seven what differentiates this machine from let's say the legion five it's the build quality right this is a metal machine metal top surface metal bottom panel and the keyboard deck is metal it's just uh it's a better built machine in terms of build quality but i don't know if i prefer it like all things aside this is like a it's like a hard metal it's probably very durable but the legion five's got this nice like soft touch finish a really well-built one and i kind of like the way that feels more than this one and also i don't know like rgbs to me are meaning less and less right i mean some people love the look of this stuff but i will just say from personal experience you get bored of this stuff pretty quickly like if that's what you're drawn to and you have to pay a huge premium just for the crazy rgbs maybe you don't actually need it that's just my personal opinion um okay performance on this machine because it's equipped with such good stuff is quite good in games but if you push it hard enough it will throttle and you'll notice that cpu speed drop it's mostly noticeable in like very demanding games like if you're playing stuff like overwatch or like competitive shooters where you're trying to take advantage of a super fast screen it's not very noticeable but if you're pushing i don't know let's say when cyberpunk comes out i guarantee that if you push that game hard on this system you'll notice the throttling you'll see the frame rate spike and that's what happens when you can't cool something perfectly so if you take a look at the inside you can see your vapor chamber you see your two ram slots your two ssds as well as your wi-fi card all of them can be replaced the wi-fi card this year is an intel ones of the killer stuff they had last year which is nice and then you see your large 80 watt hour battery now this battery took me several days to test properly because there's a bug in the software that's eating battery life really quickly the lighting software made by corsair it's called iq choose through battery life on another level it's like one percent every minute and it's not just this device any laptop out there that's running the current version of iq just gets their battery life destroyed so if you want to test this thing properly you have to uninstall corsair iq if you remove it five and a half hours which is pretty good and the ac adapter is shrunken down so last year's was quite large and this year's is a more manageable size the ports are laid out in a similar fashion to last year so a lot of them are coming out the back which is nice and they have some on the side they have two thunderbolts on the left which is a lie because there's only one thunderbolt 3 and the other one's just a regular usbc and the build quality on this thing is good the exterior like the fit and finish is on point lenovo usually does a really good job with it and this is no exception this is like their high-end premium laptop so it's done well my issue with this device comes from the whole thermal thing not that it's an awful machine it isn't it's just that lenovo's usually done this device really well like i said in the beginning it's usually been exceptional something that stood out as being better than the rest but this year i i can't say that so if you're asking me for a purchase decision like should you get the legion seven it pains me to say this but i would say that this year i i wouldn't recommend it the legion five awesome device it doesn't come with like this kind of higher end configuration but i would go for that instead of the legion seven this year at least from what i've seen with the vapor chamber and if you want something that's more higher end like you want faster gpus or you want like a like a metal finish there are so many other devices now right that's where part of the stems from in 2020 there's so much competition for high-end devices that this doesn't stick out the way that the 740 did last year and the 7 30 the year before that it looks really cool this is probably one of the most colorful laptops you can get on the market but in terms of just raw performance it's a bit of a miss this year okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
