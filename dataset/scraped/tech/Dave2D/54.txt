okay so this is a video for people who are looking to purchase a laptop for back to school or for people just looking for an inexpensive laptop purchase in general but i'm going to go through some general thoughts i have about the laptop purchasing decision and then i'm gonna go through i guess some devices that i like in particular and then we'll just wrap it up now pointer number one right now especially during this time of year you're gonna see a lot of endorsed or sponsored videos for back to school products like you'll see these like 3 000 gaming laptops for back to school you know company x sponsored this video and let me show you product x from company x i hate that stuff and i feel like it's it's irresponsible for companies be pushing crazy expensive stuff to students it's just i know there's some people that can afford it but it's just it's the wrong message and i hate seeing that stuff to be completely honest but uh i'm gonna try to focus the stuff on inexpensive devices so that leads me to point number two when it comes to purchasing a laptop for school you are going to get the best value with used or refurbished stuff and it's it's it's usually better to purchase a device that is like higher end and used than to purchase something at the same price point but new so like uh kind of mid-range or upper mid-range stuff that's a couple years old that is where you're gonna get your best value for the overall product especially when it comes to long-term durability when it comes to students uh and pointer number three i've said this before in previous videos but i cover a lot of gaming laptops on this channel i love them but i don't think that they are the ideal choice when it comes to a device for students you just get shorter battery life they're heavier and they can be a distraction which is cool sometimes but i think that you can just get you can get really far with just a regular work laptop or work based laptop and leave the gaming stuff for for a different purchase okay uh okay let's move on to the products themselves so this year you'll notice that a lot of the stuff that's on here if you've watched my older videos they're coming back again and it's because not a lot of innovation happens at the budget level right companies don't pour a ton of r d and marketing into the inexpensive stuff because it's like low profit margins here they pump it up at the top and we just get trickled down tech at the low end so a lot of the stuff has appeared in previous videos but the one thing you'll notice that i'm going to be talking more about apple's products this year because this video is sponsored by no it's because of m1 m1 has changed the way that i perceive apple products overall but particularly for students both when it comes to like battery life and just long-term usability of the product plus resale like there's a whole conversation around that but we'll get into that at the end uh but when it comes to windows laptops let's start so the first one i have here is the acer aspire 5. this has appeared in multiple videos it is a very good laptop for the price so it starts at like 500 or 600 bucks depending on how you spec it out there's ryzen versions there's intel versions and they're usually like strangely well priced they are not perfect the screens are a little bit dimmer than i'd like them to be the keyboards are not super responsive but they're just so good and hard to beat for the money i've seen a lot of products come in here at the same kind of price point as the aspire 5 and most of them just can't compete nothing from asus like the vivo books nothing from hp i really like this there are some products from lenovo but in terms of availability like this you can pick up anywhere and everywhere every country has it like amazon has it best buy has it it's everywhere the lenovo products they're just you got to live in certain regions people to pick it up so this is my pick uh my biggest concern if you do end up picking one up my biggest concern is the durability of the hinge this is something that it just comes with the nature of a 600 product right their durability and kind of build quality isn't top notch so be careful just if you if you take care of it it'll last but if you treat it roughly a 600 laptop will be a 600 laptop okay the second tier of product isn't one device in particular but a whole class of products and that is the premium stuff from a few brands but from a few years ago so stuff like the x series from lenovo or the xps devices from dell or the surface laptops from microsoft these are devices that are really good but because they come out with them all the time like every year they got a new one and better ones the older stuff drops in value pretty quickly but they're still remarkably good and laptop tech doesn't go up that quickly right so you're looking at devices that are like three years old sometimes four years old you get them for like six seven hundred bucks and they're really good and because these ones were built to last they're metal bodies their hinges are more durable they're just built really well better than these 600 devices when they're new so because these are so common and popular you can get replacement parts easily you can get replacement batteries you can get replacement components you can get replacement hinges for stuff the bus they're easy to fix and they have excellent components both lenovo x series and the xps products have great keyboards great screens good battery life you can't go wrong with these devices and if you get them used or refurbished the pricing can be really good now the surface products often have really good pricing when it comes to buying used or refurbished but the thing to keep in mind with them is that a lot of times they are not easy to upgrade or repair them they're a more sealed device compared to lenovo's x-series or the dell's xps products but all three of them surface laptops xps devices the x devices from lenovo they're just they're all good and no particular order i like all of them wholeheartedly okay i'm going to move this conversation over to the macbooks so when it comes to this type of video in previous years i usually don't push people towards macbooks usually if you want a macbook you're going to buy you don't need to watch some sweaty asian dude talk about macbooks but this year because of m1 i do feel like there's a conversation that i haven't had before uh okay let's start off with why i haven't recommended them in the past so usually macbooks are number one more expensive two repairability upgradeability is a joke uh and then over the past three years with the butterfly keyboard it's just been like i don't i knew that that would be a problem from day one it's like how can you recommend a keyboard like that to people that need to use a device for like several years right can you imagine being in the middle of the school year and all of a sudden like your e key goes out it's just it's the worst so for a while i just i i strayed people away from macbooks but because of m1 it's a little bit different number one they got rid of the butterfly keyboard two they have really good battery life arguably the best not even arguably it is the best i would say that of all the devices i've tested and all the claims that people shove in my face like look at this product look at that product no this guy has the bed the best battery life by a significant margin too when it comes to battery life for students it's like it's chef's kiss right this is what people want when it comes to a student laptop good reliability good keyboard good battery life and depending on how you play it you can get these for a reasonably good price m1 products i've seen them on ebay for like 700 bucks 800 bucks it's not cheap it's not five six hundred bucks but the other thing to keep in mind is resale because of m1 like if you get an m1 product today it will hold its resale value better than anything else on this table because it's just the market for this and because it's apple silicon and this is like their next generation of stuff and they're going forward with apple silicon this will hold its value really well so this year i recommend it and i well let me let me rephrase that i recommend it for people that are interested in it now if you're someone who's comfortable on windows i still say look at it i wouldn't push you towards it but look at it right if battery life is important to you you're gonna be amazed with what m1 can do but if battery life isn't the big deal then there's there's good stuff out there in the windows camp as well okay um there is one other thing i want to show you guys if you have 700 and you're like should i buy a laptop or should i buy optimus prime [Music] if you haven't seen this video i highly recommend greetings i am optimus prime yes you are okay for the people that haven't seen this this has nothing to do with laptops at this point this is just like a dessert everyone likes a good dessert right okay you ready hey optimus [Applause] transform [Music] you
