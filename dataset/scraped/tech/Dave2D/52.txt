get over here okay so i wanted to have a conversation with you guys about google's upcoming phone the pixel 6. now a couple weeks ago google announced the product they showcased both the pixel 6 and the pixel 6 pro and they also had some details about their upcoming soc google tensor now at the time i had some mixed thoughts about this whole thing right there's a part of me that was really excited about this launch i like the design aesthetic of it i like the look of the camera bar and the whole idea of custom soc on a google phone is really neat right the potential and the possibilities of that are very very cool however there's another part of me that was concerned and it's because over the past few years when you look at google's hardware it's a lot of hit and miss right some stuff is good some stuff is reasonably priced but there's a lot of stuff that was expensive and didn't really pan out the way that i think the consumers wanted it to so there's a discussion to be had so i'm going to start off with the phones themselves the pixel 6 has a 6.4 inch 90hz display with flat edges it's got an under display fingerprint sensor and then on the back there's a 50 megapixel main camera that's supposedly using the samsung gn1 which is a very capable sensor it's a big beefy sensor and then there's also a ultra wide beside that there's also a reported 4 600 milliamp hour battery but then powering all of this is the google tensor chip now if you look at the pixel 6 pro same idea on the inside it's got that same tensor chip but because it's a bigger phone it's got a bigger battery 5 000 milliamp hour supposedly and a third camera lens this is a 4x optical periscope telephoto so it's a fairly capable zoom lens and then up on the front we have the under display fingerprint sensor as well as a larger screen so 6.7 inches but this is also a little bit faster at 120 hertz but there is a bit of a curve on that front glass on the pro model so there's a lot to talk about here but i want to focus first on that soc google tensor so this is not actually a true custom soc and not like the sense that m1 or apple's bionic chips are those are truly custom solutions apple designs a product in-house it gets fabricated to apple's exact specifications like whatever apple wants or doesn't want that is what comes out right and that's what gets delivered to the customer with this thing google tensor it's a solution that's built in i guess the whole thing is done through samsung right it's a program that samsung has where companies can work with samsung to deliver a product that's kind of like a tweaked or modified version of their existing ips or ips they have access to right so stuff like exynos they can tweak it they can modify it they can potentially add elements to the chip but it's not a completely custom solution so i see this idea of like you know maybe it'll have amazing energy efficiency that we've never seen before like no it can't it has to be based off of samsung's existing stuff so it'll be akin to whatever they've had before now they do get to add to it so i'm sure google's going to put in stuff like their pixel visual core their neural core and whatever ai or machine learning stuff that they have up their sleeve if they can put it in i'm sure they will but there is a limitation as to how much you can really modify this chip based on this existing process it's kind of like amd that works with different companies to create different products off of the same architecture right they work with microsoft to make the xbox series x they work with sony to create the playstation 5. they work with dell to create you know some custom all amd gaming laptop all three products are different in the sense that the end solution is a little bit different but the overall capability of each device is quite similar and that's what would be happening with google tensor and any kind of existing samsung chip now the good thing is that the benefits of google be able to tweak and modify this chip and add their own components to it is that the image processing can be heavily tuned and optimized for that specific camera sensor that's in here the samsung gn1 and i'm a firm believer that this pixel 6 and the pixel 6 pro are going to have amazing camera capabilities both in photography and videography like when you grab a sensor that's as big as that thing is and as capable as the gn1 you combine it with hardware like this you can't go wrong there's no way that it's going to have just kind of good images it's going to have pictures and videos that i think will push the whole smartphone industry i really think that but this is where my concern kind of kicks in if you rewind time back to 2000 and i want to say 2017 the year the pixel 2 came out the pixel 2 xl those devices were fantastic like the images that came off of those just blew people away i think that was the year they added the pixel visual core and it was amazing like the computational photography back then it was so impressive it was so different from what everyone else was doing but it wasn't enough like all the marketing material all the angles all the ads you saw from pixels were like look how good our photography is compare us to the iphone 10. compare us to the samsung products we're so much better but even with such an amazing camera system they couldn't capture a big market right both the pixel 2 and the pixel 3 struggled with sales it was weird right you have this phone that has an amazing camera system arguably the best it's seemingly the thing that matters right why aren't more people buying this device maybe price maybe a whole bunch of other things maybe they're advertising enough but the point i'm trying to make is that even if pixel 6 has the worlds like you know the empirically best camera system nothing can touch it is that enough is that enough to pull people over to a product i don't know i'd love to see this thing just pop off i would love it to do really well but it doesn't seem like it's worked in the past and if you take a look at the countries of availability india is not on there at least not at the launch so it's weird that a huge market like that could potentially miss out on a really cool phone now i bring all of this stuff up because it's not like i i'm stoked for the phone i think it's really cool i think the hardware is really cool but in order for this to work in order for google's new path to work it has to sell with scale there has to be a lot of people buying this stuff right and because it's custom right when you have semi-custom chips like this it's not just buying stuff from qualcomm and right it's it's an expensive product and in the past google's tried all the other stuff they've tried mid-range stuff they've tried cheap stuff they've tried expensive stuff that had kind of mid-range hardware and this is the first time they're launching an expensive phone with expensive hardware like truly expensive hardware inside there and it's like if this doesn't work i don't know what if pixel gets axed in like two or three years because it didn't pan out that would suck because as a tech enthusiast like you want to see this stuff excel you want to see a google phone with custom google hardware in there just become something that would be amazing that would be the dream but the thing to keep in mind always with google they're not a hardware company this is like a blip in their whole plan right this is just meant to enable hopefully other stuff that they do like advertising models and whatever they do with google right the real google business is with software and advertising this hardware stuff is just it's a it's a it's a side thing and if it would work that'd be cool really cool okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
