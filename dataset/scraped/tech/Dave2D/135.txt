okay so google's launch night event just went down and they announced a whole slew of new hardware but i'm going to focus this video on the two most interesting pieces to me which are the pixel 5 and the pixel 4a 5g these are two phones that google has been you know teasing for a little while there have been rumors there have been leaks and we finally know all the details now i gotta be honest these two phones are the most interesting phones that google has put out in a really long time for me like i i love the pixel 1 and the pixel 2 and i kind of started to fall out of love with the pixel brand at least with their flagship stuff their a series was pretty on point but their flagship stuff has become increasingly less appealing to me and i think for a lot of you guys as well for i guess price that was a big thing but if i had like a wish list right if i had a wish list of things i wanted pixels to have it would be like number one better pricing number two bigger batteries and number three well this is a personal interest wide angled cameras and they nailed it the hardware this year looks so nice the pixel 5 is going to come in at 700 and the pixel 4 a5g comes in at 500. and this pricing feels right right if you look at the hardware it just doesn't feel like you have to justify anything like the pricing seems to line up really nicely with what you're getting it feels like that's just the way the price should be on these devices i do want to draw your attention to a couple things number one the chip so it's running a snapdragon 765g on both of these devices and it's a chip we've seen on the oneplus nord but it's the chip that allows for better pricing on these new pixel devices but the thing is it's really competitive on performance like i've tested it pretty thoroughly it doesn't matter if you're playing games or just doing anything that's processor intensive it keeps up it's only in the really demanding 3d games that you'll be able to tell the difference between a snapdragon 800 series chip in the 765g the other thing i want to mention is the battery size so the pixel 5 has a huge battery compared to the pixel 4. like i got to be honest i don't know how they fit it like this is the pixel 4. this had a tiny battery in comparison to the new pixel 5. and when you look at the size of these phones the pixel 5 is smaller and lighter than the pixel 4 but the battery is like 40 bigger than what was in the pixel 4. like i don't know how they did it obviously project sully took up a decent chunk of the of the real estate inside this phone but 40 bigger battery in a smaller package how sick is that another thing i want to draw attention to is the back of the phone so it's got a fingerprint sensor just like the pixel 4a but it is an aluminum back yet somehow it has wireless charging how i don't know how they're doing it like clearly it's some kind of magic going on because i have not seen another phone that could be charged wirelessly through an aluminum back panel it's pretty crazy the other thing is that new ultra wide lens i've always liked ultrawide lenses on my phones like ever since that first lg phone did it i just love it like you just be able to capture more stuff that's just the type of photos that i take maybe it's just like a lazy way of doing things you know shoot wide and then crop later but it's awesome and to see them do it on a pixel hell yes finally like i really want to see what google's capable of when you take a good ultrawide sensor and you pair it with software that's built specifically for it in google's camera system it's going to be good so we have 8 gigs of ram on the pixel 5 and 6 gigs on the pixel 485 g both of them with 128 gigs of storage the screens on both of them have that hole punch but on the pixel 5 you'll notice that the bezels around the whole thing are symmetrical like the top bottom left right they're all evenly bezeled which i think is a nice look and it's also a nice change compared to the previous pixels like some of those had huge notches the pixel 4 a5g has the bigger screen at 6.2 inches but it doesn't have fast refresh it's still at 60 hertz we did lose face unlock because they got rid of project solly on the pixel 5. so the only way you can get in there is through fingerprint sensor there's no more facial recognition but i think it's a fair trade considering everything you're getting for 700 and here's the thing at this price point at that 700 price point the competition is different it's not like what the old pixels were competing with like right now i feel like at the 700 price point the closest thing out there not that it's not good but it's like the samsung s20 fe i feel like this is a strong competitor to the pixel 5 but they're clearly different right like normally google like pixel phones have had to make like they've had a tough time carving out a niche for themselves right they were so they depended so much on their camera to be like this is the feature that's going to carry the product but now the price and the battery and everything like so much more it's so much more competitive this year what do you guys think cool phone same with the pixel 4 a5g cool phones let me know hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
