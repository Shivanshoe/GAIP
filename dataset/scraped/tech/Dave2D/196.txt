okay so NZXT they have some of the best looking case designs on the market and they are a super popular company when it comes to cases used by streamers and youtubers like ninja uses their stuff dr. Lupo NIC mercs even the hundred thieves compound that crazy ball in gaming house has a ton of NZXT cases in them this is their new one this is the NZXT h1 and it's super small see as much as I like the design aesthetic of their older stuff I've never built into an NZXT case before because they're big like even the smallest one they had before was like 26 27 liters this is 13 and a half liters it's very small - right up my alley and this is it the NZXT h1 so the first I'm going to talk about is the kind of design aesthetic this thing did not come originally in teal when I first got this thing this had a black back panel and I feel like it's a bit of a missed opportunity when you have a product that's clearly aesthetic focus I mean people who are buying tiny cases care about the way things look so I remove the back panel and actually separates into a trim as well as this grille and I painted the trim white the grille blue and here we are a customized 2d NZXT h1 so you have the back panel here which I've turned blue and is also the front panel which has tempered glass like this smoked kind of classic NZXT gray color to it but it's a very kind of clean and minimal looking case design it's a bangin case I like the way this thing looks now to get inside this thing it's relatively easy the back panel and that front panel pop off so I'll just do this on camera here now this paint is kind of fresh it's like a day old at this point so I'm gonna be a little gentle with it but so this pops off that and the same thing applies for the glass same thing pop it off and so once the two side panels are off this thing can now unsheath like so so the one I have here is a pre-configured unit that NZXT sells on their BLD website but more importantly you can get this case by itself like just the case now when I first saw the price I got that case I was like that's crazy expensive because there's 350 bucks but I realized that it comes with a whole bunch of stuff it comes with a 650 watt power supply it's gold rated modular comes with the 140 millimeter all-in-one water cooler and they also give you a PCIe riser so if you don't know what a riser is for is to allow you to mount your video card in an untraditional location just because of the shape and design of this case and to get into this thing you do need a screwdriver it's two screws it's relatively easy to access now to get to this stage like just removed shale you don't need any tools as toolless and tree in that sense but to get into the actual motherboard area to like install components you do need a screwdriver okay so this hole rad comes down on this hinge so you pop it off and there you go pretty easy access to the motherboard the one that include is the z3 90 I from Asus it's a really good motherboard you get your two RAM slots you get access to your empty drives it's relatively easy to build into but you do need to be careful about the kind of cabling when you close the rad back up because I mean it's a relatively cramped system right it is a small ITX form factor so just when you close it you don't want to pinch any cables closing it up they designed this thing in a way so that it's not easy to crimp something but just keep your eye out when you close it up but overall system is relatively easy to build into for a small form-factor like this the riser runs along the back of the motherboard and allows you to mount the GPU in this kind of vertical stacked configuration and the power supply it's a modular one they have pretty clean cable management with it I don't think that they did a perfect job with cable management like there's clearly some stuff hanging around here and there but for a NZXT case this is coming out of the factory it's pretty clean the performance on this machine is quite good I think they did a really good job balancing the whole like performance to noise level to thermals like a lot of the small IITs cases struggle with that because I've been so cramped it being so small that you often have either loud systems or under cooled systems and this is something that I've had issues with my builds I had ghost s1 prior to this I've had the circle case I've had the N case m1 and they're all difficult to cool properly quietly but this system it does it really well and I think it's because it's NZXT II because these guys are a company that caters not just to enthusiasts but just also to casual builders as well like a lot of the boutique ITX cases that have previously mentioned you have to know what you're doing right you have to kind of figure things out on your own and figure out what works for your particular build but because of the way I mean n60 is a huge company they're gonna do it right and they've built the system so that anybody can use it and just get good results and have a tiny case that looks really good now there are some concerns I have about the h1 first thing is they're all in one cooler I have no experience with this particular cooler because I think it's custom-built for this case I have no idea if it's gonna last I've seen some of their older stuff like some of the NZXT all in ones have had issues like I remember they had a bad batch two or three years ago but in the short terms I'd be able to test this unit I don't see any issues popping up the other thing is that with ITX cases because they're smaller motherboards if you need a ton of drives or a ton of USB connections you have kind of limited connectivity in that sense with a smaller computer like this another thing is that all the ports on this device are on the bottom so if you have stuff to connect it has to run through this gap at the bottom of the PC and it kind of bends out there's no hard angles or anything it's like a I don't think designed it well but if you are someone that connects and disconnects stuff very frequently you're gonna have to run some kind of system to be able to do that comfortably another thing to be aware of is that the Wi-Fi antenna that comes with this motherboard is this shark fin shaped thing instead of your traditional kind of bunny ear and this is designed to run outside of your case so you have this really clean setup and you have this external shark fin which if you're running Wi-Fi doesn't look the best but overall this is a bangin case I like the shape of it I like the way that it builds and I think it's very reasonably priced for what this thing offers the thing that I think is most unique about the h1 is that a lot of companies that make kind of small boutique ITX cases they have limited runs so you they're very expensive and they're hard to get this thing is made by NZXT a huge company it's gonna be readily available and I think they did a really really good job with it okay there you have it h1 from NZXT hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs we loved it see you guys next time [Music]
