so this is apple's mac studio and this one is running their m1 ultra chip their most powerful processor and of all the systems i've ever had in the studio this is the fastest one for the stuff that i do it's faster than any pc i've built it's faster than any apple system i've had in here it's super powerful but it's so over the top it's like overkill for the vast majority of people including myself but that being said having seen what this thing does i'm so tempted to get one it came in a pretty small box it had a handle on it like many of apple's heavier devices and it opens up a little differently like maybe because of its weight but they use the sides of the boxes to help leverage it out of the packaging it's pretty cool and inside you get the mac studio itself a power cable and some paperwork and of course you get the ultimate badge of pro apple users the black apple sticker now this device is pretty heavy it comes in at just over three and a half kilograms and it most of that weight is like towards the back of the device so i think it's because of the heatsink it's like a pretty extensive thermal system in the back and it's a huge copper heatsink on the ultra model and it's like this when you lift it up it's like there's junk in the trunk it's got some heft to the back of the device the m1 max configured ones supposedly have an aluminum heatsink so they're not as heavy as the copper heatsink equipped ultra versions but they're probably back heavy as well now in terms of its size it's got the same kind of footprint as the mac mini so 7.7 by 7.7 inches but this one's a little bit taller and obviously heavier and i say a little bit but it's like a couple inches taller it's noticeably taller but this is still super super compact for this type of system i actually don't think there's any other company that's ever tried to make something this powerful in a chassis this size it's really special in that sense the port selection is really good on the mac studio there's six usbc and all of them support thunderbolt on the m1 ultra equipped version there's ethernet in the back and the hdmi port back there is only hdmi 2.0 it's a bit of a miss i feel on a studio device like this that's like a high-end powerful device i feel like there are a good number of users that would want a high refresh high resolution display coming out of that port but it can't there's a rear mounted audio jack and then a power button that's on the curved portion of the back there and then up front you have your fast sd card reader now the rear of this device is taken up with a huge exhaust like this is the vast majority of the rear of the device and they've even drilled holes along the curved part of the frame just to maximize the airflow that comes out of this thing the bottom of the device is where the air intake is and once again it's heavily perforated but there isn't an easy way to access this device like on the mac mini this is where you'd pop out and get into it but this is a review unit i don't feel comfortable like prying at it there doesn't seem to be a simple way to get in here and we'll talk about repairability in a minute but this is not easy to get into i don't know where i'd even start like maybe through the kensington lock you got to like poke something in there and like pry it open but that doesn't make sense i don't know okay in addition to the mac studio i was also sent the studio display and this unboxes like an imac you lay it down flat one thing i noticed though when i pulled it out is that the power cable comes attached to the monitor and it seems really stuck into the display like i'm not even sure if it's detachable i pulled on it pretty hard but because it's reviewing it i want to break it but it seems really unlikely that you wouldn't be able to remove the cable so i plugged everything up and i ran some benchmarks and the m1 ultra does really well in cinebench and geekbench like the m1 performance just scales so well with m1 ultra you really do seem to get double the performance of m1 max when it comes to synthetic benchmarks and same with gpu performance it benchmarks really well but it will depend on the application as to how well you can utilize that hardware so let's start off here this is the 12th gen intel system i recently built it's faster than the amd system i built last year it's obviously faster than any laptop i've ever had including the m1 max macbook pro but the m1 ultra is on a whole different level and most of the main apps i use from adobe suite perform very well on this system which is kind of strange because when it comes to apple products they usually synergize best with apple software like final cut and logic but yeah i'll take it so i've only been able to use this system for a few days and i've only been able to test a handful of workflows but i also tested out blender now blender was recently updated to 3.1 where it now supports metal gpu rendering and for my tests the m1 ultra is faster than the max but it can't even come close to what the nvidia rtx cards can do over there there is one thing to keep in mind as cool as all this stuff sounds a lot of apps and a lot of components or effects in apps lean very heavily on single threaded performance still and this system has good single threaded performance but so did the m1 max and so is the m1 pro so it's like you know stuff like the viewport in blender or like giant photoshop files like if they performed poorly or like not great with other systems that you know had good uh single threaded performance already it doesn't get better with the m1 ultra product it's just single threaded performance is just the way it is um okay the thermal characteristics of this device doesn't get hot doesn't get loud and it's so strange to me that a system like this can have performance of this caliber and maintain the noise level and energy consumption and heat output that this does and it's so hard to stress in a video like this and people some people just straight up don't care they don't care if their systems are like you know 60 decibels and they pull out 1500 watts some people don't care i do and when i look at this i'm like my goodness like this is an engineering marvel because no one else has done this like literally no one else has even come close to having this kind of performance and to have it scale so well and yet maintain the energy profile that this thing does it's very impressive okay i need to move this conversation over to the display and we'll come back to the kind of the two but the display when i first heard about it at the kind of presentation i thought sixteen hundred dollars for that it's overpriced it's a 5k panel but it's not bright enough for hdr there's no 120 hertz promotion there's no face id hardware so when i looked at it it's like there's so many good 4k panels out there with that kind of size like unless you're really looking for a 5k panel it seemed like not a great deal now i'm getting it in i don't think my opinion has changed too much but there's an argument to be made that if you're looking for something like this there's nothing else on the market and i guess when you have that monopoly and you're like the only person supplying this specific thing you can charge whatever you want right so with this panel i don't really think that the difference between 5k and 4k panels are visually distinguishable at least to me like at a 27-inch panel size like you got to be going right up to the panel to be like okay this is the 5k one right so a good 4k panel to me looks just as good as this one however the aesthetic of it is quite unique the aluminum stand seems really well made it seems like a much sturdier product than the lg display that apple used to sell and the nano texture coating this is an option that i'd personally skip unless you have no way of controlling your light sources like it'll help to diffuse direct light but it does soften up the image quite a bit and there's also braided cabling that comes with the product for connecting everything up if you're connecting it up to a laptop you get 96 watt power delivery uh but if you're connecting it right up to the mac studio everything looks super clean there's an a13 bionic chip that's inside the display and it's supposed to help with audio processing and image processing for the webcam i don't know how useful it is but it seems legit like when i first connected it up it needed to download a 600 meg update like a firmware update for the display and i'm assuming it's firmware updating that chip as if it's like a phone there must be like storage inside that display actually it is strangely thick to me though like it's not running super bright leds in there and when you look at their 24 inch imac like the m1i mac like they can put that whole computer and that whole panel into something super thin this thing doesn't really need to be that thick now it does have a center stage capable webcam which is cool and all but i don't think they need the thickness the speakers however maybe that's why so they sound really nice but not everyone wants to pay extra for speakers built into the display also in case you're wondering there is a basic speaker inside the mac studio itself uh okay i want to talk about value overall for this product so this it starts at two thousand dollars for like the base entry level with m1 max and then if you want the ultra it goes up to four thousand i believe i think this is a appropriately priced product like for the person who's looking at this for to better their workflow or their business with like better performance with multi-core processing capabilities this is it's a really good system there is however seemingly no way to upgrade the mac studio which i think is terrible for a desktop system but that's just the way apple's computing products have been for the past little bit uh again i've said this in multiple videos but like these are just tools right if you're looking this is like i want that thing that's so cool but i don't know what i'd use it for don't get this man like it's just it's apple's gonna market this thing so well i know you're gonna want it but if you have a clear use for it it's a good one now the decision that i think some people might have is like between between this or their laptops and if you want like the ultra like the best possible performance and you have the cash for it like obviously this is the only place you can get the ultra right now uh whether they drop it into their laptop that's a whole different conversation my guess is yes they do it but it'll be gimped slightly that's that's my guess but it won't be any time soon if they ever do it uh but in terms of the m1 max laptop versus the m1 max desktop like obviously you're going to know way better than anyone else that you asked this question to like the person asking the question but i will say that this system is somewhat portable like it's heavy but it's not like huge right you could just stuff it in a bag as you have like two power cables two sets of keyboards and mice and like two monitors you just like bring it back and forth between your work and your home or whatever i'm just saying it's a pretty cool system okay there you have it the mac studio and the mac studio display okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
