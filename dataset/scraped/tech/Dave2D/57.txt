all right let's talk about the nothing year one these are a set of wireless earbuds that seem heavily hyped right now on the market like there was a drop of them on stockx there's youtubers talking about it it's on publications it's in the news it's like the definition of a hyped product now the company behind it nothing was started by carl pay he's the guy that helped co-found oneplus it's also a company that's backed by casey neistat it's also co-developed by teenage engineering they make some of the best synths in the entire like genre of portable synths and the hardware is special they do in my opinion something that other hardware synths don't do it's just it's special so when i heard that they were involved in year one i was like i'm i'm curious my interest is peaked however there's a part of me that's concerned that this is just a standard pair of earphones being hyped up by social media right because it can kind of look like that good marketing can lead to this kind of stuff so i kind of i went in on it i thought i needed to learn more so the first thing i wanted to know was why why would carl go from smartphones to wireless earbuds so i dug around and i found this nugget of information apple sells a lot of airpods it was estimated in 2020 that they sold somewhere between 10 to maybe 20 billion dollars worth of airpods if you look at those numbers and compare them to the companies around there that's a lot and keep in mind this is just airpods an accessory right that lineup of accessories generates a lot of money for apple even with those conservative estimates so apple clearly knew what they were doing when they removed the headphone jack in 2016. but enter 2021 carl pay enters this seemingly saturated industry of wireless earphones with year one they're in here i just i can't unbox it i'm shooting this before the embargo okay um so the question is like why right why enter that market well for one if you do it right you could disrupt that market there's a lot of money in that pie okay and carl he likes to disrupt and he's actually pretty good at it so i think carl did two things with year one to differentiate his product from everything else number one price so these come in at 99 it's not the cheapest thing out there there's definitely cheaper wireless earbuds out there but we'll talk about in a second if you look at the feature set it's actually very well priced secondly though aesthetics ear ones look different they're made with a clear transparent plastic so you can see the innards and when you look in there everything that you're seeing seemingly has a functional reason for it to be there like all the components all the materials they all have a purpose they're not just sticking stuff in there for it to look a certain way now in one sense you could argue that they kind of look like air pods like in terms of their shape but in terms of the color just because of the transparency they look they look completely different like if you think about you walking on the street or you're just you know you're watching the olympics and you're seeing people with those white stemmed earbuds like they just look like airpods because that's the original wireless airpod from apple and anything that's white like the half of these things are white here they just look like airpods this thing you see it being worn it it's clearly not an airpod it's clearly if you know anything about this company it's clearly the ear one and then the carrying case is also transparent it has usbc charging it has wireless charging capabilities but the big feature is again is aesthetic now notice that i did not talk about audio quality because realistically the sound is almost irrelevant to the conversation of how these things will sell assuming they don't sound like complete trash there's no way they do right not with teenage engineering behind it and not with carl behind it there's no way that they're putting out a product that sounds terrible but the sound quality is actually not that important in terms of the marketing because the differentiating features between any of these things is how they look and the price that stuff is way more important to the average consumer than the nuances of like the actual sound profile but i'm going to assume that they sound good we'll find out in a day or two so this is the spec list and there's a bunch of cool stuff in here but the one feature that jumps out to me is the weight these come in at 4.7 grams per earbud and that's pretty light in this product category but i bring it up for a couple reasons number one is comfort right the lighter an earbud is when it comes to a wireless earbud like this the more comfortable it's going to be for an extended period of time if you're wearing it for a long time but the other thing is battery life so it's this juggling act this balancing act of how heavy do you make the device and also how much battery do you pack in the thing right and i think 4.7 grams with a decent battery life while it's running active noise cancellation i like that i think a lot of companies go the opposite direction where they go for something heavier but the battery lasts a lot longer but personally and this is just a personal preference i like my stuff lighter but with uh shorter battery life as a consequence the last thing i want to touch on is that price so the price of this product at 99 that's why this whole thing even matters to me personally because if it was 150 or 200 then no one would care right because then you can get similar stuff to this and then the only differentiating factor is the aesthetic right but because it's a hundred bucks you're looking at a product that is priced noticeably cheaper than almost all the big name competitors out there now people are going to draw comparisons to this and be like well you can get product x or product y for 100 bucks but they don't have a feature set like this so the pricing is kind of special now in terms of the marketing it feels a little thick i personally don't like heavily marketed stuff like i just you know i'm really averse to heavily marketed things and i can kind of smell and taste it it's got that hot sauce that marketing hot sauce that companies like to do but in their defense because it's a new brand new product i feel like it's it's necessary in this day and age if you don't do this kind of stuff especially when you have a good price point and you potentially have a good product i feel like i feel like i'll give it a i'll give it a pass in terms of its marketing but i do still have a couple concerns with this product number one because it's a clear transparent plastic it's gonna scratch there's no way that you can keep it looking pristine and as clean as the photos like even a week after use it's going to be scratchy just assume that it's going to get scuffed and that's just how the product will look but the other thing and this is kind of a more personal thing this is a product that it can't just be like the only product that nothing makes right they can't just be in the business of making earphones and that's it just make one product and they're out no way they're doing this for the long haul right whatever they come up with the future i'm interested to see what they do but what i don't want to see is like nothing year five you know 2025 and it's 500 and it's like you know the pro model and it's done in partnership with dolby audio that would suck because that's not what that's so not what i want but at 99 first product good feature set i want to crack this thing open thanks for watching this hope you enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs you've loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
