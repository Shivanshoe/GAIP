all right so these are the newly announced XPS 17 and XPS 15 from Dell the XPS 17 is brand new like they've never had an XPS 17 that was metal and carbon fiber they had some really old school stuff like ten years ago but this is the first time we've seen a 17 inch device from Dell that is made in this kind of form factor and this kind of design aesthetic it's something special and the 15-inch has finally been redesigned this is something that's been around for like four or five years where they just kind of kept refreshing it over and over again it's brand new this year fully re-engineered from the bottom up and we're gonna get into both of them now these are both engineering samples I've had them for about a week I've been up to play with them and we'll just we'll go in okay 17 inch model we'll start here because this is the thing that's got me super excited this is their flagship laptop it's gonna be the king of the XPS lineup and it looks very similar in terms of design aesthetic to the XPS 13 it's just a lot bigger because it's a 17 inch screen but the 13 the 15 and the 17 all have this kind of angled design aesthetic to them and they're all built from unibody chassis so they're built from a single block of aluminum that's kind of milled out with a CNC machine it just gives like strength and rigidity and a particular aesthetic to the devices now the 17-inch model and the 15-inch but particularly with the 17 the most striking thing this year is the screen it's a 17 inch panel 1080p or 4k but both panels are super bright at 500 nits good color accuracy this one is a 4k panel and it's awesome like the panel itself is really nice it's vibrant its sharp its touchscreen it's got all the good stuff that you would expect on a high-end 4k panel and it's also a 16 by 10 aspect ratio so it's a little more vertical space for people whose workflow or apps can make use of that but the real kicker here is the bezel it's super thin the whole way around like the top the sides the bottom it's essentially fully screened there's no chin there's no forehead it's very clean and when I did my first XPS 13 review that was a device that was very special for its time like when that first came out the entire industry was making devices with thick bezels around the laptop screens so that XPS 13 really stood out and I think it started to shape the way that laptops were made like manufacturers start to understand that people wanted this not just for a design aesthetic right obviously this looks nicer with a thinner bezel but it actually makes devices smaller like when you can fit a 17 inch screen into a smaller footprint like this the whole device becomes smaller like this is a smaller laptop than a lot of 15-inch devices like the actual footprint of this thing is smaller than like half of the 15-inch laptops out there right now it's pretty crazy the trim is so small in the bottom that if you look at it at the right angle you can't see any bottom bezel at all it looks like the screen just pops out at the back of the keyboard now it still has a webcam up top it's a 720p cam and it does support Windows hello for face logins so they've been able to pack an infrared camera into that top bezel the keyboard has also been reworked it's not a Maglev keyboard or anything it's just kind of like a standard layout XPS keyboard it feels nice 1.3 millimeter travel it's got some bigger keys than before about 10% bigger than the previous model and this keyboard is shared between the two models so the XPS 17 and the 15 used the exact same keyboard very easy layout to get used to I think a lot of people will enjoy this keyboard the one thing that you should take note of in case you're used to older xks keyboards the page up and page down Keys no longer have dedicated keys for them you hit function up and down to access that so if you're someone that used that frequently you're gonna have to get used to this on these new devices there's also a fingerprint sensor on the top right of the keyboard so if you don't want to use your facial biometrics to login you can use your fingerprint and the keyboard deck is also slightly different this year it's still carbon fiber it's got that like nice soft resin feel to it this is something I really like this is a material that if you've never used an XPS device before this is one of its best features like that carbon fiber weave is nice to look at it's durable and it feels awesome but they've changed the layout of it slightly so it's got carbon on the top and bottom area of the deck but the sides of the keyboard are just plain plastic and those house these new speakers so these are significantly improved from the older XPS 15 this is something I complained about in basically every single XPS 15 review have done over the past four years these are so much better than the old ones their top firing so there's a pair of firing up and there's also a pair of firing down and they sound way better they still don't sound as good as a 16 inch MacBook Pro though I really like the carbon fiber material but it would be awesome if they would just match the front material as well not necessarily made at a fiber but just to have like a black front you can get skins from I use D brand ones which look pretty good but if this thing was fully black with like a black trim that'd be on another level okay so the inside the trackpad they have a much bigger one this year but in terms of how it tracks and how it feels mechanically it's very similar to the previous generation which is a good thing because they've always had a decent track pad on the XPS lineup in terms of ports so we got for use BC that supports in about three and there's also an increasingly rare SD card reader so if you're a photographer or videographer and you want access to your media it's built right into the device now this guy does not have an HDMI port anymore so all the older XPS 15 s have had them but this device now has a adapter that has both the USB a and an HDMI out in one adapter but that thing did not come with these engineering samples all right so to power both of these they use a hundred thirty watt adapter that connects over a USB C but you can use some lower water stuff if you want to to charge these devices alright let's take a look at the inside the XPS 17 has two nvm ease both upgradable it's got two RAM slots also upgradeable the Wi-Fi card is big Don so you can't swap that any of your standard big boy 97 watt hour battery but the beauty of this device is its new thermal system the XPS 17 now runs a vapor chamber a way more efficient way of removing heat from this laptop now this is an early engineering sample but from what I've seen from my benchmarks and gameplay this is very impressive like this is so much better than anything we've ever seen from Dells XPS lineup it is really good so the XPS 17 is running these 10th Gen Intel chips up to an 8 core it's also running up to an RT X 2060 max Q I believe this device starts at $1500 here's the thing it is not a gaming laptop as powerful as this hardware is I think a lot of people look at the stuff and they're like that's a gaming laptop because it's got an Nvidia card in it it isn't I mean they don't mark it like that so I wouldn't expect a device like this to compete with like a thick board gaming laptop but it is very impressive and I'm considering switching to this machine as my daily driver okay enough with the XPS 17 suck but the XPS 15 this machine is also very impressive this year redesigned revamped it's very similar in design to be 17 and 13 it's got the same kind of exterior build this device however has only three u.s. PC ports got two on the left and one on the right and only the two on the left support then about three the one on the right does not it still has the SD card slot for media now if you look at the size of like this is the previous model of XPS 15 forget I think the 95 70 this device the new one is smaller than the old 15 inch by a very noticeable amount it's kind of weird that they're able to pack the same kind of screen size in there in a much smaller footprint but that's what thin bezels give you right when you shrink down that bezel you can shrink that whole device down the screen is still super bright on the 15 and color accurate it still has that webcam up top for Windows hello and it's all wrapped in this really thin bezel like this is a much better-looking device than the XPS 15 from last year this is a better looking device than like the vast majority of laptops right now this thin bezel is so cool the keyboard is the same as the XPS 17 it's very functional key word a lot of people like it and the trackpads also one of those big track pads just like the 17 the speakers I want to say that they're the same because on paper they have like the same technical specifications but these sound different I think the 17 sound better it could just be like a acoustical engineering difference on the inside just bigger space in there I couldn't tell you but they do sound slightly different they are still way better than the old XPS 15 speakers though now inside we're looking at two nvme slots two RAM slots with baked on Wi-Fi the battery has shrunk down I used to be a 97 watt hour this is now at 86 water and it comes in at the same weight as last year's model they're both four and a half pounds so this new one is actually a little bit denser than the previous one the thermal system on the Dean does not use a vapor chamber maybe it's just like a smaller chassis or maybe they didn't want to sacrifice too much vertical height but it's a bit of a shame this does have an improved thermal system over the old one it is equipped with a better GPU the 1650 ti max-q now and it's running their new Gore thermal material but my early impressions of the XPS 15 is that it's not as impressive of a solution as the vapor chamber that's inside the XPS 17 now you're gonna have to wait for my full reviews on both of these devices to get like a final read on this but my early take is that this is gonna be very impressive this is going to be as expected now some kind of ancillary thoughts Oh both of these are one hand OpenAL if that's your jam like you know some people talk about this stuff like it's like the greatest thing in the world here's the thing a hinge like that whole ability to open it up with one hand it takes good engineering to do it like if you make it too loose yeah you can open it one hand but then it just like flops down and that that's just a bad hinge and if you make it too stiff then you can't one hand open it so this is good to see that on both of these devices I really really would have loved to have seen AMD inside these things like that would have been that would have changed the game but we still have these awesome laptops that look amazing and this is the first iteration or generation of these new designs right maybe in a couple years we get AMD variants maybe please dell can we make that happen okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs if you love to see you guys next time [Music]
