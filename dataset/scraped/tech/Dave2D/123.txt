okay this is razer's brand new laptop the razer book 13. it's not a razer blade it's not a stealth it's the razer book and what makes it special is that this is well it's the thinnest and the lightest and possibly the least expensive laptop that razer's ever brought to market and it's aimed at a completely different type of segment right normally they make gaming laptops that are pretty powerful this is aimed more for like the productivity segment it's good for professionals good for students it's good for anyone who's looking for a laptop with premium build quality so it's meant to compete with stuff like the xps 13 and macbooks and basically any kind of the premium ultrabook that's out there so let's just get into this thing in terms of its size it's very similar in size to the xps 13. like the footprint of it is almost identical but we'll get into kind of a more detailed comparison to that in a little bit but compared to the razer blade stealth so this is razer's kind of thin and light gaming laptop right now it's about 10 smaller so nothing massive but it is a noticeable shrink both in footprint and in weight of device and it comes in this sweet silvery white color i think they call it mercury and the best part of this colorway is that when you pop it open can you see that white keyboard with the chroma shining through it that's a look now when it's closed the aluminum top and bottom panels kind of sandwich this plastic trim right in the middle and this trim is the trim that goes around the screen normally on a razer blade laptop it's aluminum the whole way around but they have implemented this plastic trim it doesn't look bad though like it doesn't feel bad it's like a very hard plastic and when it's closed it still looks really nice the back side is a little bit different there's a gap as well as this large rubber strip that runs along the length of the back of the laptop and its purpose if you haven't guessed at this point is that when you lift the screen the keyboard pops up and this is a mechanism we've seen on other devices like other laptops made from other companies but this is the first time we've seen it on a razer device and it serves two purposes one it lifts the laptop a little bit to give some better airflow underneath secondly it kind of pops the keyboard to i don't know maybe one two degrees of lift and for some people they like that kind of tilt it's not massive though right you can see like it's a very subtle tilt on that keyboard but yeah it's a it's new for razer's devices so the keyboard itself is a very razer-like keyboard if you've used any razer laptop in the past couple of years this is the same type of keyboard chiclet keys that have awesome rgb lighting and layout takes a little bit of time to get used to but i think most people who use this keyboard for a little bit of time will really like it now i am partial to razer's laptop keyboards i've been using them for a while so i'm just really comfortable on them but i think the responsible thing for me to say is that if you've never used a razer blade keyboard before and you've never used an xps 13 keyboard before chances are you're gonna like the xps 13 keyboard faster i think they're both excellent keyboards but this one's just i've always found this one like really easy to get used to just for everybody this one takes i don't know 15 20 minutes before you're super comfortable on it but they're both good now the razer does have the advantage of really bright and colorful rgbs if that matters to you the trackpad's really good it's got a glass surface precision drivers and it's got a pretty quiet click mechanic it's a good trackpad speakers on the left and right these sound good they're pretty clear but they don't have a lot of bass they don't sound like macbook pro speakers the screen this is a new type of screen for razer it's got thin bezels all the way around even the bottom chin is thin and it comes in three variants 1080p 1080p touch and 4k touch and all three of those have a 16 by 10 aspect ratio so a little bit taller than your regular kind of gaming laptop screen and it gives you a little more vertical room when it comes to doing anything on your device this one is the 4k panel and it's bright it's good colors it's a really nice screen the webcam up top supports windows hello so you can log into your system with just your facial biometrics and there's seemingly four mics on that top bezel like there's four little holes which i'm assuming help with noise cancellation on that mic all right so the ports on this guy there's two usbc which support thunderbolt 4 there's an hdmi there's a microsd and thankfully there's still a usb-a i was convinced that if they were going to make a smaller laptop than their stealth that they would remove it because everybody else is doing it but they kept uspa and i think on a device like this which is meant for real people doing real work this is a good thing to keep on the device now internally you have your two fans cooling a vapor chamber you also have the replaceable or removable nvme it's all sitting on nice black pcb which i always find neater and cleaner than like red or green pcbs and you also have your 55 watt hour battery this isn't a huge one but they claim 14 hours of battery life you're not gonna get 14. there's no way my test got eight and a half hours that's still really good right it's a 4k screen system of this caliber it's solid but it's just not 14 hours granted this is a kind of like early pre-production unit so the numbers can change with retail units but don't expect 14 hours if that's what you were hoping for now the performance on the razer book is pretty good it's running 11th gen core i5 or core i7 up to 16 gigs of ram its main strength though is that iris xe graphics right the gpu that's inside these systems is better than what amd offers in their ultrabooks right now this is not a gaming laptop it's not meant to compete with like anything that's gaming related it's its own thing it's a ultrabook with good build quality good performance again this is not like a full like a retail unit so i can't do full proper benchmarking on it but because of the vapor chamber and the two fans i don't see this thing being a poor performer for an intel based ultrabook okay that basically wraps up this video i'll probably be doing a full review on this thing in the relatively near future but this is the new razer book 13. what do you think cool okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved
