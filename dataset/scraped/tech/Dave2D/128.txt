okay so i thought i'd do a first impressions or an early impressions on the iphone 12 the iphone 12 pro magsafe tech and just general thoughts about all these devices so let's just jump right into these boxes these are a lot smaller than previous iphone boxes they're like half the size and inside for both of them you get the phone itself a usbc to lightning charging cable a sim tool a single apple sticker this time and no charging brick and i got to say something about the lack of these charging bricks and basically all of apple's iphones this year in my original video that i made kind of like a reactionary video to apple's iphone 12 launch i remember thinking like that i was moved by apple's environmental stance right by removing these bricks they're doing environmental good and the boxes are smaller to put it bluntly though i think i was wrong i think it was caught up in the whole marketing of it because when i did my own research on this stuff and kind of dug into the actual environmental impact that removing these charges would have it's good but it's not as good as i thought it would be so i think it's kind of like the right move over time but right now the the impact of it not just the environmental impact of it but the financial impact of it is there's a way bigger conversation to be had there but no bricks this year okay on to the aesthetics of these phones these phones look really nice to me we have a pacific blue iphone 12 pro and a red iphone 12. now the 12 pro the pacific blue is this bluish green hue it's almost like this dark teal color i i know it sounds preferential to the color teal but it does have a greenish tint to it it's not just like a pure blue and this looks so nice i think this is gonna be super popular the product red iphone 12 isn't like a deep candy apple red it's more of a kind of orange tinted red it's definitely not like the deep red that apple usually has for their product red devices i think that this color of red even though it's not like the traditional product red is a more lively variant of it like i just think this is a more happy looking red than their traditional dark red okay in terms of the back materials they're very similar to last year's iphone 11 and 11 pro so the 12 pro has that frosted matte finish to it that tends to hide fingerprints pretty well and then the 12 has that glossy glass back to it which tends to show fingerprints a little more readily now in terms of the size and feel of these devices for one they both have that flat edge i'm always someone that's loved flat edge devices right which is why i held onto the iphone sc like the original one for so long because i just like the small size and i like the way that flat edges hold in your hand but everyone's gonna be different about that but it's also a lot smaller so this is uh the 11 from last year this is the current 12. physically they're not hugely different in size like even if i hold it up and you're not looking it up close it's hard to actually tell that this is smaller than the 11 from last year but it when you hold it in your hand the way that it sits in your hand because it's missing the rounded edges it's a smaller feeling phone it's a really nice size to me the iphone 12 pro has the same kind of flat edges also really nice to hold in your hand but it is a little bit bigger it's actually slightly bigger than the iphone 11 pro from last year again impossible to tell from this video from here but it is in your hand it's perceptibly larger than the iphone 11 pro but it does feel more comfortable again because of the lack of the round edges your thumb will reach a little bit further than it did before on the 11 pro now the bezels on these devices are exactly the same like the 12 and the 12 pro have seemingly the same size bezel at least to my eyes the 12 has a thinner bezel than the 11 from last year i think it makes the phone look a lot nicer like a lot of people didn't love the thicker bezels on the iphone 11 this just looks a lot nicer i got to be honest i'm a little bit surprised right because normally when apple has two products in the same category and there's one expensive one and there's one that's less expensive usually they do some kind of aesthetic tweak to the less expensive one to make it seem less premium to make it seem less aesthetically pleasing but in this case the 12 still looks really good even when you compare directly to the 12 pro i think even some people would prefer the look of the 12 just because of the matte finish on the trim and stuff like that okay quick note about the antenna designs i'm in canada and the canadian iphone 12s don't have that antenna cutout for the millimeter wave antenna so we have 5g but it's just not the super fast millimeter wave 5g so in canada and i think in lots of parts of the world there is no antenna cut out on the sides it's just your kind of standard iphone antenna lines now quick note about the displays the iphone 12 pro display doesn't look like it's changed that much it's just a little bit bigger the iphone 12 though has had a huge improvement over the iphone 11. this display is oled right and that's one of the reasons why they'd be able to shrink the whole device they don't have to deal with an lcd panel and this change is huge in my opinion this is the one feature that i think is the biggest improvement across the whole iphone lineup this year obviously there's aesthetic changes but bringing oled panel onto the 12 i mean it makes the design look a lot more up to date and it makes the product feel much more competitive good contrast nice resolution it's very welcome change the camera systems have also been upgraded but i'll be covering that stuff in my full reviews of the phone all right let's move this conversation onto magsafe this is the new magnet based tech that is featured on the iphone 12 the iphone 12 pro and it works like you'd expect through magnets uh okay let's talk about charging first the magsafe charger looks kind of like a big apple watch charger but unlike the apple watch charger this uses usbc and to my surprise the magsave charger does not include a charge brick either like it's a charging accessory so i just thought that they would include it because it's literally for the purpose of charging phones but you have to have a brick in addition to purchasing the magsafe charger now this thing uses qi wireless charging and i charge a whole bunch of phones on it like pixels work on it samsung phones work on it but when you attach it to the back of a iphone 12 or 12 pro the magnets kick in there's a sweet sound effect that accompanies that connection but i am concerned about a couple things first every time i place my phone onto the magsafe charger there's there's a bit of contact between the metal rim and the back of the phone and if your phone is encased then that's not an issue right but let's say you have a bareback phone and you're using this magsafe charger every time like there's just this ever so slight contact between this aluminum piece and the glass back and over time isn't that going to show some form of wear isn't metal harder than glass i don't know i feel like this is something only time will tell like if i sat here for days just removing it and replacing it then we could probably see some kind of wear pattern but my concern is that this will show wear over time especially the frosted glass of the 12 pro the rubber middle of the charge pad is elevated ever so slightly but it's still making contact pretty often when i place the phone onto the device that was like a lot of contact that time okay other mag safe accessories there's cases that attach to the phone magnetically and there's also this nice wallet looking thing that while it's supposed to be magnetically shielded so you can place your cards in there securely but the end goal or end stage of what magsafe is going to bring to the iphone ecosystem is yet to be seen it can't just be this right it can't just be a somewhat portable wireless charger there's going to be way more stuff that comes out but i think this is the beginning of something from apple we'll see how that pans out okay so that's kind of my early look at the iphone 12 the 12 pro i think like just to come back to magsafe this if you're interested in picking this thing up it's not to be used as like a traditional wireless charger like if you already have a wireless charger this isn't like an upgraded version of that this is like a variation of wireless charging is the best way to put it this to me feels like if you're someone who's always wanted to have wireless charging but you don't like the fact that you can't use your phone while it's being charged that's what this thing solves i don't think it's meant to be used just as a really small wireless charger but that wraps it up if you have any questions about any of this stuff let me know in the comments i'll be covering it in my upcoming review but i hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
