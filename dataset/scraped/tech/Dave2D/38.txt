get over here okay let's talk about the apple watch series seven so this year's apple watch is probably most interesting for people coming from like a much older apple watch like a series zero like the og one up to a series three or for people who've never owned an app watch before and they're interested in trying it out this year so the two big features are the screen it's a bigger screen about 20 bigger than the previous generation and the faster charging there's a few other tweaks and updates the device but those are the two main ones so let's start with the screen this display on the series seven is noticeably bigger than the display on the series four five and six but the biggest difference is when you compare it to one of the older ones like series seven screen versus the series zero through three that's like a fifty percent bump up in screen size and for people that own one of the older devices that's a nice draw now bigger screen sizes is always nice as long as you can maintain the same kind of form factor right and that's what they've done here it's fractionally bigger like a millimeter taller than the previous generation but it's for all intents and purposes the same shape and size as we've known apple watches to be and with the bigger screen size everything's just a little bit bigger and in some cases they've retooled the ui elements so that it's easier to tap when the buttons are a little bit larger everything's just better with a bigger screen however i will say that the benefits aren't massive like in some cases like some apps like if you're looking at the map or you're looking at photos on your phone then yeah a bigger screen is obviously better right but for the way that i use my watch it doesn't feel like a significantly better experience like i felt that when the screen size increased from series three to series four that was more substantial like that felt like a practical and more usable increase in screen size this it's nice but not as clutch to me there are two new watch faces though and one of them the modular duo i really like so this face is an exclusive to series seven and if i'm being honest i don't feel like it needs to be like i feel like they could have fit all of the elements of this particular watch face onto a smaller screen like a series four five or six watch but it is an exclusive to the series seven i just really like how everything's laid out in this modular duo face now there is a second exclusive face to series seven it's called contour it's the one that you see in a lot of the marketing material and i mean the aesthetic of it is subjective right not everyone's gonna like it it's this set of stylized numbers that go around the perimeter of the dial but when i look at it it feels like a tech demo it feels like apple only put this on apple watch series 7 just so they could showcase what the largest screen could look like with the refractive glass on the side so you can kind of see that kind of bending optical illusion of the screen it's kind of neat but at the same time it's strange to me that they built a watch face with so much emphasis on perimeter detail just so they could showcase what the largest screen on series 7 could do it almost feels like they built that watch face just for the marketing material just for like the videos and the pictures so people could look at that watch face the contour design and be like okay that's the new one because the old one couldn't do that uh the other thing i want to talk about just the last thing about the screen is that with series 7 again it's an exclusive feature you get access to a qwerty keyboard so if you're typing a text message or you're inputting text on your watch you can type on a full qwerty keyword and it supports quick paths you can swipe around to input text a little bit quicker and also predictive text but i did find some issues with it like i understand that this is not like the only way to input text right if you're trying to respond to a message you can use your dictation or you can use the canned messages but if you do choose this and you want to use the qwerty keyboard i found it cumbersome like you're very dependent on the predictive text to get your message across like your fingertip is big right compared to the size of that screen and if you're swiping around or poking around it's just not an accurate tool for that size of display so you're leaning very heavily on the predictive text and if you ever make mistake and hit that backspace button it's really close to the send button i feel like apple should lower that in the ui a little bit just so it's not as easy to miss press but you do have access to a qwerty keyboard if you do need it in a pinch okay so when it comes to the screen i feel like it's a nice addition if you're coming from something that's really old or you're brand new to apple watches the nice big screen is always a nice addition but i don't think it's a it's a powerful enough incentive for people to come over from like a recent apple watch to this one but there is a feature on the series seven i think is awesome and it's the charging so it charges i believe 30 faster than the previous generation you have to use the included charger so if you have one of the older like like you know you've got an older device that's made by third-party and it was designed to charge apple watches having series 7 on one of those devices it won't charge fast it'll charge at the original speed but with the new charger and i'm assuming with new devices that are going to come out for charging at a quicker rate this thing charges it charges at a speed that i feel changes the way that i view this device it changes how i use the watch so normally when it comes to my personal use i was never able to go through the day get some kind of workout in or some kind of like fitness tracking in while also doing a sleep tracking off of one charge it would always kind of die or be really low in the morning so that it would just be unusable the next day so i feel like this faster charge rate makes it so that i can do the full day off of one faster charge and it sounds so weird that just a little bit of increase in charge speed changes how i even view this entire product from apple but it does and i feel like if you've ever been the person who's looked at apple watches and like i hate charging it frequently or i hate charging a watch that's why i don't want it i do feel like it's a significant update from older models but that's not for everyone that's just for people like myself who are just bad at charging electronic devices okay in terms of fitness so for the past year because i've been on android devices i actually haven't used my apple watch very much like i just don't i don't care both phones frequently so often times i just didn't use my apple watch and because i was sent this review unit and i was testing it out it is a strangely powerful motivator to turn this thing on and like go into the fitness app and see your friends right you see like marquez you one day puts in you know 9 million calories on a workout it's like god damn like i'm sitting here eating chips i should be doing something that actually i feel like that gamification of this thing is amazing and just over the past i don't know five six days i've worked it every single day just because i'm seeing rings across friends colleagues of just everyone's filling up rings it's like i gotta do the same i feel like i'm i feel like i'm being lazy if i don't now in terms of sleep tracking this is just like a personal anecdotal story i don't sleep very much i sleep like four to five hours a night i know i don't sleep enough my wife tells me i don't sleep enough my kids tell me i don't sleep enough i don't sleep enough but having a watch tell me like another device telling me that like you know sleep more it's time to sleep it's like i find just more anxiety provoking i just did not like it i was like okay i know i should sleep but i can't i got stuff to do i got work to deal with i just it didn't help me over the past like year that i've tried to use this device to improve my sleep habits it didn't do anything just putting it out there for the people that are curious okay so i'm just going to wrap up this conversation with one last thought so there were rumors of the apple watch series 7 to have a complete redesign there were several sources reputable sources including german from bloomberg and john prosser from front page tech and ming chi quote they all thought that there would be a refresh like a redesign for apple watch series seven and obviously it didn't come right that flat-faced design never came around it was just the standard curved edge uh apple watch that we've seen for several years now so when it when it first came out that this was going to be apple watch series 7. i think a lot of people kind of laughed at the rumors like you know why do we even look at rumors why do we listen to them because clearly that's not what apple watch series 7 was supposed to be but this year's apple watch did not get an updated cpu like the s7 chip it's got some updated elements to it right like there's a new driver for the display i'm sure there's other features in it that you know they've updated the package but the actual processor uses the same cpu as last year's and that's a first for an apple watch now there's a part of me that feels like those leaks and rumors were actually somewhat true like i do feel like that flat edge design thing is going to come out at some point i i just it this doesn't feel something feels off something felt like the iterative changes that were on this year's apple watch as nice as the air for like older generation users it just felt too slight to be like a proper update and i feel like maybe next year that's the flat edge thing that we're gonna be seeing just a theory okay uh so that's my thoughts on appbox series seven i'm gonna be wearing this one because i switched to the iphone this year uh this is i mean those rings i gotta fill those rings okay hope you guys
