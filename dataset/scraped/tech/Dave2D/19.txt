okay so alienware has this new super small super thin x14 device it's a laptop that has a lot of nice features in it it's got usb-c charging it's got phase change thermal compound it's got a vapor chamber a lot of nice stuff going on but it's also running intel's new 12th gen chips now normally when a gaming laptop is made for that like super thin super light compact form factor it's done with an amd chip like razer's laptop the blade 14 as well as asus device the g14 both of those are running amd chips because amd's chips tend to be a little bit cooler they use less wattage they're easier to cool in a device that's super small like this so it's kind of like the obvious choice and it was interesting that alienware had big enough balls to be like let's cool and intel chip in the same kind of form factor so let's start off with its size when they first announced this product in january i remember thinking okay it's just going to be a smaller version of the x15 and x17 right it's 14 inch screen and it is because it's a smaller screen it's a smaller product but it's the thinness like this is a 14 and a half millimeter thick chassis and i actually think it's the thinnest gaming laptop you can get on the market like the thinnest high performance device you can get in the market it's strangely thin and yet it still has that kind of tanky durability that alienware products have i think it's because they have like a magnesium alloy chassis but it is not super light both the blade 14 and the g14 are noticeably lighter than this device it's only like 100 150 grams which doesn't seem like a lot in paper but when you pick it up and you're holding it it is noticeable and depending on like what you're doing and what you're buying this product for you got to keep that in mind it does still have that light up alienware logo on the front but the iconic ring light on the back of the bigger alienware devices doesn't show up on the x14 you do get all the ports though and i mean all of its ports you have three usbc one of them being used to charge the system you have one usb a you have a microsd as well as the hdmi but you also have the headphone jack in the back and i like ports on the back but not headphone jack so one thing i noticed when i was editing videos off of this thing the cable you got to run it behind the system and then around it but it seems to have this tendency to go underneath the screen hinge right because it's just coming from the back and then if you close the device like it's i don't know i would prefer it side mounted but there you have it all the ports on the back so the sides are very clean now the screen hinge it is a custom hinge and the idea being that they had to build this custom hinge to be able to keep the device super thin and it's a hinge that slides back and forth on a track when you open and close the device it's not something you'd notice when you use it but it is interesting that alienware put in that effort just to keep the device a little bit thinner now the screen is a 14 inch panel and it's a really nice looking screen it's fast it's bright it's got great colors it's got g-sync it's got advanced optimus it is a 1080p panel but because it's a smaller panel it still looks really sharp in terms of pixel density and there is a 720p webcam up top now the keyboard i think they nailed so the competitors like the g14 from asus the blade 14 from razer they have good keyboards i've reviewed them and i like them but this one to me is the best of the three there's something about just the way it types it's got a nice layout it's got good feedback really good mechanics on the keyboard i think most people would prefer this keyboard over the other two the trackpad is also really good it is on the smaller side so if you do a lot of gestures it might feel a little cramped but the tracking is really nice the surface is great texture and the click mechanic it's just nice and precise it's a great trackpad now performance so this is running the 12700h from intel as well as an rtx 3060 and the configuration is quite different from anything else in this category in that 14 inch space it benchmarks really well in games and apps that can take advantage of strong multi-core cpu performance this is awesome and thermally no problem the vapor chamber the thermal compound the fans whatever they're doing it doesn't even have crazy fan noise it can handle the heat if anything this could handle another 20 maybe 30 watts of input and it would still be able to handle the the heat okay but the problem is wattage it's limited by the 130 watt ac adapter that's plugged up in the back this is a usbc powered system and because of that when you put in a high wattage intel cpu in here there's just no more juice left over for a high end gpu so they have a 70 watt rtx 3060 at the top end and the result is a system that's kind of in a weird spot if your games and apps can take advantage of great cpu performance you're golden but for a lot of gamers they just want high-end gpus in a system like this and this doesn't give you the top-end gaming performance most games are going to favor a more powerful gpu than a more powerful cpu but when it comes to certain workflows especially video editing this is just a better system i do think that the convenience and kind of universality of usbc charging that's valuable to some people but you can't power the ultra high wattage systems through just usb-c at least not yet the other feature that's really cool about this device is the battery life so this has an 80 watt hour battery it's pretty big and the battery life is significantly longer than razer's blade 14 but it's similar to what we see in the g14 from asus the ram is started on its ddr5 but the ssd and the wi-fi card are swappable if you so choose or repairable if you look at it that way the speakers on the side here aren't great now i know alienware has some dolby software that they're hyping up and they supposedly make these speakers sound better but if this is what they sound like with that software these things would have sound like complete trash without that fancy software but they're just no good if you're looking for great speakers from a small laptop this ain't it but the overall product i think is i mean i love the idea the idea of like a super thin super light uh high-end gaming laptop or performance laptop it makes sense i just like that this is i'll be honest i like that this offers the intel chip i think cooling an intel chip in a small form factor like this is difficult there's a reason why everyone else has been using amd but this now gives you the option if your workflow or whatever reason if you want that cpu performance and you want that top ncp performance and you want that super small form factor this is a good one okay there you have it the x14 hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music] you
