hey how's it going Dave 2d here so I installed iOS 14 on some of my iPhones the iPhone 11 pro the current se as well as the old-school se this is a phone with two gigs of ram and it still runs the latest version of iOS which is pretty solid okay the moment I installed it you could just tell this is a very significant update for Apple this in my opinion is the biggest update they've had for their phones in a really long time I'm just gonna go right into it the big one widgets like that's the thing you notice right away if you see a widget on the home screen you know what's running iOS 14 this fundamentally changes the way that the phones look in terms of like the aesthetic of it but it's also a very big shift in how these phones can be used now right when the event happened and the announced widgets the first thing that came into my mind was like well finally right this is something we've seen on Android phones forever and it's cool that they're finally bringing it in but having used this for a little bit it is quite different like the experience of widgets on the iPhone is very different from the way that it feels on Android phones with iOS app icons they collapse automatically right like they all kind of collapse at the top of the screen and it changes the way that you interact with your widgets and apps so on my Android phone I put all of my app icons on to the bottom of the screen and I do it that way because my thumb just now has easier access to those apps I can just press it without any kind of stretching or reaching and I put widgets around the screen just away from those app icons and this is just a personal preference this is something that I've always done but everyone has their way of setting up widgets and apps on Android phones with the iPhone even though they have widgets now the apps still collapse to the top of the screen and it just feels different than how I would expect a widget 'add iPhone homescreen to feel and the other thing that ties into this is that these widgets come in three sizes a small a medium and a large and the small size widget the square looking one looks the nicest on the home screen but it doesn't have interactable elements like the guidelines for developers is that when you have a small widget you can't press anything on that like the moment you press it it launches the app it doesn't have any kind of like buttons that you can manipulate you need to use the medium or large size widgets to be able to have buttons that you can interact with and it again it fundamentally changes the way that you can interact with this new widget system I like it but it didn't feel immediately familiar like I thought it would coming from the widget it phones that I use with Android I do love smart stack and this is something that feels this feels very Apple and it feels really nice so you can just have one widget area and then swipe through several widgets that you've placed in there similar to live tiles from older Windows phones it's a really nice thing it just keeps everything clean right so you don't have widgets everywhere another thing that we've added this year is picture-in-picture again something that Android users have had forever it's nice that they finally put it on I actually found it weird that this phone the iPhone se with its two gigs of RAM could still do picture and picture like I thought there would be some kind of RAM limitation you're running a show and you're still doing all this other stuff on the phone and it still works it's pretty cool they're also adding the ability to change the default apps in iOS 14 for at least two categories for male and for internet browsers so if you want to use something other than Safari and other than iOS mail you can use stuff like Chrome or whatever is that you want it's cool it's a good start but I feel like that should extend way beyond just mail and Internet like one of my favorite apps of all time is a polo it's a reddit browsing app it's simple but it's so good and it's so much better than the official reddit client in my opinion like this is an app that's done by a solo developer it has adjustable app icons it has a really cleaner interface it's a kick-ass app but I can't use that as my default reddit browsing tool at least not right now so I feel like it's a good start that Apple's allowing any kind of deviation from stock default app launchers but I'd like to see more another major feature they've added with iOS 14 is the app library and if you're unfamiliar with what that is it's basically like a storage pen for all of your apps so from people that have a ton of apps is going to benefit you the most just organizes and stores your apps off of your home screen and it gives you a lot of customized ability so you can make your home screen ultra clean but the way that the app library works is it's different so you can see right here I have a whole bunch of category folders that were made by iOS like I didn't input these categories myself it just used smart word recognition or some kind of algorithm to figure out this stuff for me it's nice but it's just different and it's not as intuitive as I'd want some kind of app drawer to be on iOS like if you look at the actual folders to get into the folder you've hit the bottom right cluster of icons but the other ones will actually launch the apps again is different but I think it's better than nothing right it's been a long time since we've been wanting some kind of app storage thing one thing that I see popping up on Twitter everyone's talking about this right now is this ability for iOS 14 to recognize backed apps that can be you can double tap or triple tap the back of the device doesn't work on the old iPhone se also doesn't work on the the new iPhone se so basically anything with a knotch can do it so I have mine set up for a double tap to launch the control center and this is on that's really nice on any of the notched phones because in order to access your brightness control or any kind of control you have to stretch up to the top right of the corner screen and pull down and it's not inconvenience but it's not you know it's not like a super simple one-handed gesture but you can now access that control center with a double or triple tap but one thing I noticed is that when you put the phone down it activates that gesture as if you've double or triple tap to the phone because it's just knocking the phone to sometimes three times and it's I'm someone that puts my phone down often with with a phone on and it just it activates it so the idea of the double and triple back tap is cool but if you have habits like leaving your phone on to put things down it kind of kills that functionality but I think it's more for accessibility anyways but it's cool that they have this there's a whole bunch of other features in ours 14 like the photography improvements the full screen change with a lot of the apps but yeah I feel like iOS 14 is awesome this year I feel like it's it's a really nice step up in the right direction and I think people will like it in fact that it's running on older phones like four-and-a-half-year phones is is a huge win for Apple I like that okay that's basically it I would probably do like a deeper dive in IRS 14 as future betas come out because I feel like this is still a very cursory look at it because a lot of developers have like this is the first day right so I'll do something a little bit deeper in the future but I hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs
