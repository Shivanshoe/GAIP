[Music] okay so this is the pocophone f3 this is their newest mid-ranger comes in around 300 350 us dollars once you convert it and this is just stacked the hardware in here is really good for the price i don't think that you're going to find many other competitors that can hit this kind of price point for this kind of hardware now pocophone has a whole slew of phones right they've had some 200 phones 150 phones they can get really cheap and those are great value but usually when you dip down to that kind of price point you have to make some pretty big compromises to get that price point right whether it's a screen or the processor or something some kind of deficiency in the product to be able to hit super cheap prices now at 350 this is not dirt cheap right this is a decent amount of spend but this feels like a fairly compromise free experience and if you're a performance enthusiast but you don't want to spend a crazy amount of money on a smartphone i would definitely consider this device so i'm gonna start for the screen because this has an amazing screen for the money probably the best screen you're gonna see at this price point it's 1080p 120 hertz great colors and it gets bright this is actually the same panel that you see on the me11 and when i look at this display this defines a product for me like when i look at this i think where else can you get a display of this quality this brightness and this kind of characteristic for this kind of price you just can't even other pocophones like the x3 pro that just launched that's a 450 nit screen this is 12 or 1300 nits it's so much brighter and it's just top end screen for a mid-range price the speakers are stereo but keep in mind that the earpiece one like the upper one is a little bit quieter than the bottom firing one but it is still a very distinct stereo effect now the fingerprint sensor on the side is actually quite unique it has a convex shape to it like it's a regular power button or a regular sleep wake button normally when you have a side mounted fingerprint sensor it's flat and they have like sharp edges and stuff that just makes the experience not perfect this feels like a regular button and it's fast to unlock i really like it now the frame of this device is plastic it's got a gray gunmetal color to it with a bit of a metallic sheen but it is plastic the back panel is glass and it also has that gunmetal color but this is very reflective it's almost like this chromed out finish i think it looks really good but i don't think it's for everyone and because it's glass i was concerned about the scratch resistance of it so i tested it out but it's really good despite the chrome looking finish now there is no headphone jack nor is there a micro sd slot in the sim card tray but i think they're going for a different user group i feel like they're not going for the users that would want that stuff they're trying to pull in the audience that would go for the premium flagship stuff because the processor in here is nearly top of the line it's the snapdragon 870 and this isn't as jacked as the snapdragon triple eight it's kind of like a boosted 865 plus so this 350 dollar phone can outperform devices that were top of the line four months ago it's pretty incredible now the performance is really good it's not as good as the triple eight but you're seeing great frame rates in games excellent system performance for the people that want that really fast and fluid smartphone experience this delivers it now the battery is 4 500 milliamp hours it's a medium-sized battery it's a little bit smaller than the one on the x3 pro but screen on time is also a little bit less than i was hoping for i'm getting like six sometimes six and a half hours it's not amazing but it's good you do get 33 watt fast charging so you can juice this thing up in just under an hour but you don't get wireless charging you rarely do with this kind of price point but if that's what you're looking for that would be a missing feature now i want to talk about the camera at the beginning of this video i stated that this delivered a relatively compromise free experience but the camera isn't amazing which in theory should be a compromise right let me explain at this kind of price point you never get a great camera system and unless you're buying like a used samsung device or like maybe a pixel 4a in general cameras at this point they're they're nothing to talk about and i think smartphone companies are they've realized that that is the that's the feature that you can just keep up selling right every hundred dollars that you put more into a phone you just get a better camera system and this is a camera system with very average image quality you get clean images with pretty good colors if there's enough light but it falls apart quickly in tough conditions and if i'm comparing this to the new samsung a52 photos taken in good lighting conditions are comparable but the moment it gets dark the a52 is noticeably better it's got a better sensor it has optical image stabilization so it's just gonna shoot better it is a more expensive mid-range phone though the ultra wide on the f3 is also predictably mid-range it's got fair image quality when there's enough light but it falls apart really fast in the dark now in terms of video you can shoot in up to 4k 30 and the software stabilization is pretty good on the pocophone but the overall camera system is fairly average it's not awful right there's devices out there that have way worse camera systems than this at this price point but it's nothing special but earlier i mentioned this device the samsung a52 5g and this is a very well-rounded phone this is 450 but you get a better camera system you get a headphone jack you get micro sd support there's a lot of good stuff that's going on in here but you also get a noticeably slower processor than the poco phone that's where things get a little bit more complex let's say you extrapolate and you look like two three years out into the future what does that phone experience look like for someone that picked up the samsung versus someone that picked up this f3 and i would say for a lot of people the f3 is gonna feel faster it's gonna feel like a more fluid experience in two or three years time so samsung gets great software support right they get three to four years of software and feature updates these guys are pretty good it's like two and a half three years depending on the device but they have excellent community support so you get like custom roms pixel experience in particular is really good on the paco phone devices there is still some blower that comes pre-installed you can remove it but there's also the occasional ad you can easily disable them all it's just super annoying that they do this in the first place but for 350 to get a near flagship processor this is going to age really well in comparison to almost any other product in this category to get this kind of performance it's why the pocophone f1 to this day is still so good because i had a snapdragon 845 think about it i'm sure some of you guys still use it you have a three-year-old phone i think it's three let's say three three year old phone and it's still competitive because it came with such a high-end processor that's why stuff like this even though it's really good today and it's viable for today and i highly recommend this device they just don't last as long i'm just putting that out there okay that's the f3 video hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
