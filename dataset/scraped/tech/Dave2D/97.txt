[Music] okay so this is a laptop that i was really excited to get in it's a device that's built to be really powerful to have the best possible performance but they've built it into a chassis that's not super thick right it's not like a chunky boy and it has excellent cooling and it's designed to be cheaper than the competition so traditionally when you have a gaming laptop the way that most companies will try to get the best performance from it is by pumping a lot of wattage to the cpu and the gpu mostly the gpu but in doing so now you have a system that just runs hotter right the more wattage you have into this thing the you got to figure out a way to to get rid of the heat you have to get rid of the heat or else you have systems that just don't perform properly so the easy way to do that is by making these thick systems but this they did something a little bit different so this is the prometheus 17 from electronics it's a brand that's really popular with the sweaty laptop nerds and my discord channel you i know a lot of the enthusiasts love this brand and this is their newest device so this is an inch or just under an inch thick and yet it has the performance of devices that are significantly thicker so this has the new amd 5800h and an rtx 3070 the performance is excellent like fast cpu fast gpu fastened benchmarks fast in adobe premiere excellent in games like truly excellent in games and keep in mind though that this is a 1440p panel so you do need more powerful components to be able to feed the screen resolution but you can tell that this is an incredibly powerful system like this is only a 30 70. you can get up to a 30 80 but even at the 30 70 just look at this benchmark here this has the same graphics card technically as a dash f15 or an msi gs66 but this is just a way better performer and it boils down to thermal capabilities they've designed the thermal solution inside the system to just handle heat way better and the difference is significant there's also some new software which is really geared towards sweaty laptop nerves but i think it's awesome you get extensive cpu and gpu control you get fan control and all this is really nice to have access to to have this kind of customizability from software that comes from the manufacturer not many brands are doing that but keep in mind that this is enthusiast level stuff right you can't just crank everything to 11 and just right just let it rip it's you have to know what you're doing or just be aware of what's happening before you just tweak stuff in there but to have that ability is nice especially for the enthusiast okay let's take a look at the inside to see what's going on so we have a back panel that needs to be removed a little bit differently than normal because there's some plastic tabs in the top corners that have to come off as well but inside you have access to your two nvmes your two ram slots your wi-fi card and you can see the thermal solution so this has five heat pipes and it's got four exhaust so it's vented off pretty aggressively i can't tell just by looking at it what makes it so special i'll be honest it's not like they have some crazy orientation for the heat pipes or they have like you know six exhausts it's seemingly relatively normal maybe a little bit bigger on fans maybe that's what it is but whatever they're doing is just really well done uh the battery down here so this is a 62 watt hour battery and it's small there's no way to spin it it's a small battery not just for a gaming laptop but because this is a 17-inch gaming laptop with a 1440p panel this stuff just drinks a lot of juice and this is a very small juice box i'm barely getting three hours on this thing like two hours 48 minutes ran a couple tests it's a short battery now if you're someone who's on the market for a powerful desktop replacement system like this chances are you're not too concerned about battery life but if you are this probably won't be the system for you there's also speakers like there's new speakers but they sound exactly like every speaker on a gaming laptop ever they suck this is a better keyboard than the traditional electronics mechanical keyboard so that big rectangular thing that i don't particularly love this is a lot better the layout's good and there's a number pad if you like it but really it's the fact that it's a simple membrane keyboard this chiclet style doesn't make for great marketing it's like a regular keyboard but i think the average person is going to like this keyboard a lot better so if you've been dissuaded from previous electronic laptops before because of the keyboard this is not that and the trackpad is big they do have this feature where you can turn off half of it and i've tried it like i don't understand why n would want that it feels strange to disable half of it like laterally it's it's an option though if you're into that okay the screen so this is a 1440p panel and if you're playing games it's awesome right high resolution so you can see stuff a little more clearly really fast reasonably bright and because the hardware is powerful it can handle the higher resolution quite easily but keep in mind that it is a 1440p panel and you kind of lock yourself into that resolution when it comes to games i've discussed this before and people will say you know there's every advanced game has render scales like obviously developers have tried to do what they can so that you don't play with interpolation too badly but because it's a 1440p panel no matter what you do playing at 1080p resolution there's slight scaling issues it's just it's very slight but it is noticeable especially when it comes to targeting games so if you're someone that's really sweaty about competitive gaming just keep that in mind and it also affects like videos right if you're watching 1080p videos or 4k videos because it's 1440p and you want to watch it at that resolution stuff can look slightly askew again it's not a big deal but i'm just putting it out there for the people that care me personally i love it i welcome high resolutions i like it for video editing i like it for gaming so there you have it i do want to talk about the hinge because this really concerned me when i first saw photos of this device the reason why it concerns is because there have been laptops in the past particularly lenovo's i think they were like the y700s they had a few laptops that used this type of hinge where the hinge is kind of closer to the center of the laptop and there's a couple things that come up with this like when you open the device you just put a little more torque on the screen like it's it's a little bit different from a side mounted hinge where you've lifted on the corner your hinge just kind of goes up with the the the force i don't know the physical the physics term behind it but you can clearly tell that when you open device with a centered hinge like look at this when i when i left it open like you're just torquing this part of it a little bit more than a regular laptop and on those devices those lenovo devices they had a ton of issues i don't think there's anything wrong with the hinge itself it was the hinge mount they just had a bunch of bad laptops like that and screens were busting left right and center i cannot tell if that's going to happen with this device i can tell you that when i open it up you can see some metal inserts on the mounting spots which is good and there's no weird twisting sounds or any creaks when i open and close it it seems good but i can't talk about the durability this early on now the rest of the device is a very simple looking laptop it's got a very plain top cover like there's no branding or logos on it it's just pure black and there is a rgb light up components like on each corner it's a very simple light streak and you can adjust the colors and software i'm not crazy about rgb elements but these are a nice touch to me and the ports on this machine so there's three usb a and one usbc i feel like for a 2021 device there should be at least one more usbc or just you know two and two would be good but yeah the port selection is decent there's also a full size sd if you're into that and you have your power lane and all the like video outputs on the back which is nice but this is a very powerful system like this delivers performance that you get in the chunky boys like it really does it's able to maintain good clock speeds good temperatures and under an inch thick it's pretty unique okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
