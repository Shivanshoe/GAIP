this is the rg phone 6 pro from asus it's their most powerful gaming phone and it's running the new snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 a very powerful chip it just tops benchmarks uh fantastic performer but with that performance comes heat but asus has figured out how to not just obtain the best performance with this device but also sustain it for an extended period of time so if you look at just raw benchmarks this runs at about 10 maybe 15 percent better than a regular snapdragon 8 gen 1 while also using slightly less energy and it's seemingly from the more efficient fabrication process of tsmc now the problem with any kind of top-end smartphone performance is heat because in order to get crazy scores these devices pump out a good amount of heat and then the systems have to throttle down and it's not just android phones some android phones throttle more aggressively than others but even iphones have to deal with that issue you just can't maintain maximum performance on a phone indefinitely but i would say that the rg phone 6 handles its heat quite well on par with an iphone 13 pro max but this year asus has a new accessory that just takes the whole thermal game to a whole new level so this is their new aerocooler six and okay so traditionally the coolers that asus makes for their rg phones are these fan based coolers right so they have a fan that clips onto the back of the phone and it's blowing room temperature air onto the phone and it's better than nothing but it's not particularly effective at removing heat from those systems right this year they're using a peltier inside it so it's a thermoelectric cooler that's pulling heat from one side of the device like the side that's attached to the phone or touching the phone to the back side of it that has the fan attached to it and it's just really effective at pulling heat off of this device so the best way i can show this is with a device from razer so this is their phone cooler it's made for iphones but i'm using this because this can be turned on and activated away from the phone so i can visually show the effectiveness of this so when this is sitting around in like on a room or on a table it's room temperature but when you plug it up you get the rgb razor lights but this part here gets very cold like we're talking 10 degrees celsius so like around 50 fahrenheit it makes a little bit of noise it's obviously a fan pulling the heat off of that heat sink but this peltier is very good at chilling things like 10 degrees celsius is like a chilled drink it's cold not just cool cold but this device from razer needs to be plugged in to pull this off basically every thermoelectric cooler for phones needs to be powered up to be able to work but not this thing so this works powered directly through the phone i'm just going to connect it real quickly but when it's plugged up and using the phone's power it'll run in this kind of medium effective mode called frosty mode it's pretty good but there's also a higher wattage frozen mode which requires the device to be plugged up to power but that gives you the best cooling performance and there's also a cool mode which is fan only so no peltier and there's also a smart mode and this will automatically switch between the different modes depending on the thermal load of the device it connects to the phone via the side usb-c and the cooler itself has this eject mechanism to help you get the device on and off but there were a couple times when i had connection issues with this device now i don't know if it's because it's a pre-production unit i feel like it could be fixed with software but sometimes i'd connect the thing up and it wouldn't detect the connection on the phone now the rest of the phone has had some tweaks and updates both on the inside and out if you look at the internals this has a bigger vapor chamber it's got more of the graphite material and there's a seemingly huge chunk of thermal compound in here that's sandwiched between the two pcb boards and it's all in pursuit of just better thermal performance on this device and on the back of this phone there's this new passive matrix oled display it's a different orientation and configuration compared to last year but you can customize it very extensively in the software you can show charge status uh the game mode incoming calls there's a ton of stuff that you can do with it with the built-in animations or you can upload your own animations onto the device the rear camera system has been updated so it's a completely new main sensor it's the imax 766. i took a few photos don't have any complaints both the main shooter and the wide look quite good to me the front screen's been updated to an even faster touch sampling rate too 720 hertz it's ridiculously fast and also the touch latency is at 23 milliseconds which is a slight faster than it was last year but from what i can tell there's no difference for me like every game that i played on it it's always been fast in terms of the kind of touch responsiveness it's seemingly just as fast this year there's still a bezel around the display which is arguably a good feature on a gaming phone and there's still a headphone jack and the rgb light back here can be customized quite heavily for notifications and such and it still has a great pair of front firing speakers also it still has an option for up to 18 gigs of ram for the people that would need that and it still has a huge battery 6 000 milliamp hours it's a split battery so it's two 3 000 milliamp hour cells uh and because of the improved thermals on the inside when you juice it up it actually juices a little bit faster than the previous generation with the same 65 watt charger and the air triggers so these have been tweaked a little bit this year they still feel like the regular air triggers like there's no tactile feedback when you click but it's improved year and year but the overall product is very impressive this to me is uh it's difficult to engineer something this good with that snapdragon chip being as hot as it is like it's it's a powerful chip but because it runs hot it's challenging to make this work but asus did it great phone really cool cooler really cool cooler there you have it the rog phone 6.
