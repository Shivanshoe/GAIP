on today's menu we have the m16 and the s17 from asus is that straight sure it's straight enough okay so let's start off with the top device this is the g15 it's a universally respected and appreciated product for what it is it's a very popular amd based device and i liked it i liked it so much that i bought one for personal use i spent a good chunk of money on this thing a couple months ago and it's a great device and i liked it i really really liked it until this thing came out so this is the m16 now this is a device that's running intel's newest 11th gen cpus and it's very similar in form factor and idea to the g15 but it's just better it's got a better screen it's got a bigger screen smaller bezels it's got a webcam it's got a whole bunch of features in it that make it a better overall product than what the amd equipped g15 was now that being said this is filmed before the intel embargo so i cannot reveal the kind of benchmarks and performance metrics on this particular cpu but i can confirm a few things number one it's faster for my particular workflow and the stuff that i do it's faster than what the g15 was it's also a little bit more power hungry the m16 comes with a 240 watt ac adapter the g15 came with a 200 watt adapter that 40 watt difference may seem insignificant but they're supplying the intel based m16 with a more powerful ac adapter because it can use it and because it can use it it has to be to vent off that extra heat in some way or form we'll get into that in a second and the third thing i noticed is it still has under volting i thought or i was worried that they would remove that feature but for the enthusiasts and for myself included like i just i always like to undervolt my systems and the m16 and i guess the 11th gen cpus still allow undervolting okay so some thoughts on the aesthetics of the m16 it comes in a black option and this is a like basically pure black variant compared to like the dark gray that we saw in the g15 the whole patterning and like that prismatic reflection you see through the holes remains unchanged the top panel is actually a little bit thicker than the g15 uh you'll see why in a second but if you look at the side of this thing there's a bit of a taper like it starts thicker at the bottom of the screen and it kind of tapers to a thinner top edge and it's because this panel is all screen like top to bottom screen there's a very thin bezel around this device it's an awesome look it's bright it's color accurate it's qhd it's super fast it's a great screen for gaming as well as for content creation this to me is like peak gaming laptop screen for what i like to do with my laptops i will say it's actually a different panel than the one on the legion 5 pro and the legion 7. i thought they'd be the same because spec wise they're very similar but that's a csot screen like the china star optical electronics this is an auo panel it's something that we're probably more familiar with if you're into sweaty laptop nerd stuff but this is a auo panel and it looks good now there is one thing that i am slightly concerned about they vent the exhaust towards the back like out the back of the device but because these are built in a way that the screen is kind of covering a portion of the exhaust it's a little bit strange on the m16 so if you look at the g15 the bottom of the laptop screen has like a plastic i guess shroud covering the led drivers and the exhaust hits this plastic shroud and even in my review i was like i don't love the fact that it's doing that but because it's a shroud and it's not like the actual screen i was like whatever right and over the course of the time they've been using this i've never noticed any issues but on this thing the m16 that exhaust is just blasting right against the panel and i'm sure asus has thought of this like clearly they've looked at this right and realized that could be an issue but it's just strange to me that you can blast the panel like the raw pixels with so much heat and it'd still be okay i hope uh but that is yeah that's a little bit strange to me the other thing that taper that i mentioned earlier on the side of the display panel i think it's because the led drivers they have to pack it somewhere right because there's no chin anymore you have to pack it behind the screen i think that's what they're doing that's why the bottom of this thing is a little bit thicker when you hold it up it is noticeable this does feel slightly thicker it's still a very thin and light laptop though there's another thing i noticed the rubber strip that runs along the back like the tail end of it it is a little bit higher than the one on the g15 and it serves to prop up the device a little bit more for improved airflow over the g15 and it makes you think why'd they do it right why would they prop up this device more than the g15 we'll find out in the future okay um let's talk about oh the internals so this is a slightly different keyboard deck than the g15 so this has like a soft touch finish it's similar to the g14 if you remember that thing but it's like a nice soft touch rubberized material i really like this stuff when it's new but it's one of those things where time can only tell what it'll actually feel like after years of cheetos fingers and greasy stuff like this soft touch finish it can age worse than just hard plastics and the keyboard exactly the same layout but it's actually slightly different in feel these keys on the m16 seem to have a bit more pressure required to be able to press it down but they're both great keyboards and the lighting on this device supposedly the retail units have rgb lighting my unit is just white and i can't seem to adjust it in software but apparently the retail product of the m16 is going to have some degree of colorful keyboard lighting trackpad remains unchanged and there's also a webcam now i'm gonna be honest a couple years ago when they first introduced like one of their zephyrus products that didn't have a webcam i was all for it i was like yeah i don't use my webcam that much but during the pandemic holy smokes i miss it on the g15 like there have been so many calls i have to take for work and i'm just like sorry guys no webcam just gonna have the deal uh but this yeah it's nice and it's not obtrusive it's like right in that thin bezel and i'm glad that this device has a webcam now if you take a look at the inside you can see the two nvme bays and these are super fast these are now pcie four and there's also 16 gigs of ram that's baked onto the motherboard we can upgrade that through one slot so that's the m16 it is really really good uh i will say we do not know its pricing at this point asus has said nothing about pricing and my gut feeling is that this will not be cheap i don't know how much more expensive will be than the g15 i mean i wish it was the same price so that it'd be truly competitive but something tells me the m16 will not be like the value king product out there okay let's move on to the ultimate flagship this is the s 17 from asus this year also equipped with 11th gen intel stuff but the thing that makes this thing special is the keyboard you see that i'm going to do one more time when you open the lid the keyboard pops up we've seen pop-up screens we've seen pop-up other things but i've never seen a keyboard that popped up like this certainly not one that was mechanical so i spent a couple days on this device before i shot this video because this is one of those devices where you just kind of get used to it you have to feel it out and you have to put your mindset in of like if i bought this and i was using it before i actually talk about it so my initial impression when i first popped this thing up was okay i like those keyboard switches this is the same switch as the mechanical keyboard we saw in the strix scar g15 but the orientation of it just that slight tilt i don't know it's like five degrees maybe eight degrees it's a very slight tilt but it makes it feel very different and me personally i like it but i had to get used to it and i wouldn't say that i prefer this keyboard over a regular flat keyboard without any kind of incline now because this product is more unique and special i don't think you just walk into a store and try it so i think it'll be difficult for people to make a purchase decision based on just this keyboard there's a lot of other cool stuff going on in this device but if you're eyeing it just for the keyboard i highly recommend testing it out if you can't now the reason why they even pop it up in the first place is because it improves airflow by lifting up the keyboard like this it allows air to pass through the hot components more efficiently but yeah this is the s17 i'm obviously not going to do like a full review on this thing this is once again an engineering sample the keyboard deck like this area the palm rest and the kind of surrounding keyboard thing is also a soft touch finish and on the top left of the keyboard there's a scroll wheel which is set to adjust the volume in its current state but that is the s15 like a very cursory look at it the internals if you want to take a peek in there it's just got all the regular 11th gen stuff so pcie 4 super fast drives and there's three slots in this one but yeah that's the s17 i'll be doing reviews on this stuff as the retail units come in like proper full reviews i hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time and if you're wondering about the table i have something in the works you'll see [Music] you
