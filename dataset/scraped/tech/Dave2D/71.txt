all right for the past few years now when it comes to gaming laptops or performance laptops in general that are graphics focused there's been one brand that's dominated for like i want to see like a decade maybe even more it's been nvidia when it comes to laptop gpus nvidia has just taken that crown and held on to it firmly until today so a few months ago amd let me know like hey you know look out for june we're going to be announcing something in june you're going to want to take a look at it it's going to be cool it comes in it's cool so this is the 6800m laptop gpu and it's being announced alongside with the 6700m and a 6600m and the short of it is this this device with that 6800 m is faster than an rtx 3070 by a pretty significant margin and very close to an rtx 3080. in some cases it's better in some cases it's worse it depends on the game that you're benchmarking but it's very close to an rtx 3080 but the best part of it all is that it's cheaper it's cheaper than a 3080 it's even cheaper than a 3070 and that is special so this device here is the first laptop available with one of these new amd gpus it's the asus strix g15 they call it the advantage edition and it's very similar to the regular strix g15 except it's running an amd gpu alongside with that amd cpu so let's just jump right into the benchmarks this system outperforms an rtx 3070 handedly there wasn't a single game or benchmark where the 3070 was able to beat the 6800m and this is a cheaper product by about 150 to 200 depending on the system that you're looking at and then when you compare to an rtx 3080 this is still competitive this device can keep up with the best laptop gpu from nvidia the rtx 3080 and it's strange to see it's refreshing to see because when was the last time we saw a device that was this good coming out from amd in terms of their laptop graphics it's never been a thing really like they've had good stuff but not stuff that was competitive like this the other thing is pricing because this whole device costs 16.50 so 1 650 and this isn't like the most expensive or the cheapest this is kind of a product right this is the first one that's launching with it you can't get this performance for this kind of money when it comes to an nvidia laptop you cannot even if you go with like those off brands like the you know electronics like cover a lot of that stuff you cannot get an rtx 3080 for 1 650 bucks it's not a thing so to be able to deliver this kind of performance is awesome for the consumer we're just going to see pricing drop down a little bit over the next little bit we see the 6800 m like this the 6700 mm 6600m they'll be in even cheaper devices than this one here but i think they'll work to lower the pricing of gaming laptops in general which i'm looking forward to because you've seen the pricing of some of those 30 series devices out there it's pretty nuts so promising i really like to see this stuff but there's a few concerns i have so number one is supply so when it comes to devices like this like a new technology from amd in the first year when new amd stuff launches you don't see a lot of laptop manufacturers hopping on board right away it does take a little bit of time so it's possible that this year we don't see a lot of devices with these new amd gpus i wish there were but that's just the way brands seem to move when it comes to amd products the second thing is the technology so if you are into ray traced graphics or you like the stuff that dlss offers for nvidia you don't get quite the same level of support with amd right now so they did launch their new fsr which is similar an idea to what nvidia has with dlss and it does support ray tracing but i gotta say nvidia's ray tracing handles illumination and reflections just a little better to me than what amd does but the overall product is so good you get great performance with good temperatures respectful fan noise doesn't have crazy power draw you get smart access memory you get amd smart shift so you can dynamically control your cpu and gpu pull there's a lot of cool stuff going on in the system and it's all for a very very reasonable price 1650 for this kind of performance is excellent like truly excellent so if you're in the market for just a high-end gaming laptop i would highly consider these devices now keep in mind nvidia does have some advantages still they do have better ray tracing support if that matters to you they'd also have better video encoding and decoding if that matters to you but does that really matter how many ray trace games are you really playing like if you're asking yourself honestly i play minecraft i love the ray trace graphics but it's not like the only thing that matters right so when it comes to this kind of performance yeah yeah they're back in the race i like seeing this from amd okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
