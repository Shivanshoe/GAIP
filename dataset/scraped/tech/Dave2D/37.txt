so i've been trying to build a new itx system and i've had a whole bunch of cases come in something really cool but then this guy comes in last week and i'm like this has to be the case that i'm building right it's teal well the company calls it caribbean blue but for all intents and purposes it's dave 2d teal right this is the color of the logo the branding it's my favorite color and i'm like this is crazy that this even exists as a stock product you can go out and buy it so this is the cooler master nr200p it's a pretty popular case uh it's like a relatively inexpensive case but it now comes in this sick ass color now when this came in last week i was thinking okay how do i build in this what i'm going to put in it what am i going to do with it but then i remembered a few months ago i was sent a whole bunch of other teal things so i was ben i was sent a bunch of teal case fans a teal cpu cooler and then from that same company a teal thermal paste now i don't know if the actual paste itself is teal but the packaging is teal and that's all that really matters so we are going to try to build the ultimate 2d pc now the truth is i have not researched any of these components i don't know how well they perform but more importantly i don't even know if they're gonna fit in terms of like the the casing and the sizing of everything i hope it will but we will discover this stuff as we go so in terms of components i'm gonna be building it to an intel system with an rtx ti and hopefully it's all cooled properly and performs well in this case it's pretty spacious and it's very teal let's do this i'm going to clear this out of the way and build the motherboard first this is the z490i motherboard from aorus i did a build on this particular motherboard a while ago but then i disassembled that build so we're reusing this motherboard uh the chip is the 10 900k this is gonna be replaced with something new in the very near future i imagine alder lake stuff but for this build we'll just go with it all right now the cooler so i hope this thing fits man because if it doesn't this whole video is gonna have to change i really want this thing to have a teal cpu cooler this is the g4 oc from iceberg thermal honestly i've never heard of this brand before but if they're running teal if they're running like teal aesthetics i want to use it in this build okay dude look at that coloring yeah okay dude there's no way this fits let me see let me try to eyeball this thing does it fit oh dude if it fits it's gonna be it's gonna be really close okay i'm gonna mount this on i need thermal paste it's gray i thought it would be blue thermal paste but the casing is cool how am i gonna screw this thing in with the fan there oh it comes off or at the very least it slides up so the fan on this cooler seems to slide up and down and it comes off okay this is a lot easier to put on dude i hope this thing fits this is a pretty tall cooler normally when i build itx cases the coolers are like flat right i don't go with like a regular cpu cooler but this time around i went with this guy yeah that's actually pretty smart so if you have like ram sticks that are have that are high you got like a special heat sink on the ram stick it'll clear it you can raise it to clear it now i need to know if this thing fits into the case okay please please work man you just gotta fit it's shy it's just shy it's like hold on it's if it fits it's gonna be to the t i'm gonna get some screws in here just to double check but i don't think it fits okay i have the motherboard screwed in and i'm just gonna place this panel on just to see how close it is it fits oh my goodness you can't see this but it's like there's a hair of a gap it's like this was built i told you this was built for this case oh wait maybe it doesn't fit yeah it fits well it kind of does you need a little little handiwork to make sure that the panel stays on but you could keep it on so the power supply i'm going with is the 850 watt from cooler master it's a small form factor i don't know if it was built specifically for this case but it definitely fits in here i do not have a higher wattage small form factor power supply than this because i'm powering some pretty heavy stuff it's going with the 850. this is nice and small modular gold rated let's do it so we're gonna go with the 3080 ti it looks like it fits i hope i think all the cables are connected this should be bootable at this point uh it's near the end of the day though so i gotta wrap this i'm gonna like close this up and finish the rest of this video another day but i think i'm going to test it just make sure it works and then finish off the trimmings like all the fans and stuff okay i set it all up once i tighten the screws on the cooler properly and just cleaned up the cables a little bit on the inside the panel fit perfectly it doesn't pop out or anything it's just like a perfect fit it's almost like this cooler was made for this case and it should be look at that color so uh i added some case fans up at the top the two teal ones this is in there cleaned up some of the cables and i killed the rgbs this is this is such a nice looking case now a couple things i noticed when i just tidied everything up number one the paint job on this case is excellent like i was worried that while i was manipulating things around and closing the panels that i'd be scratching this paint because i've had colored cases in the past where the paint just chips off easily this whatever they're using it's like an enamel or some kind of powder coating it is really well done it's like a nice solid and durable paint finish the other thing is that this is a really nice case to build into i have never built into the nr200 before i've seen it before i've read up on it it's a nice sounding case but having built in it personally this time it's like easily one of the best it's cases i've ever had it's a good one and because it's readily available like and inexpensive it's a good case so i ran some benchmarks played some games on it temperatures are great it's a quiet system very well cooled i really love this build like compared to the ghost s1 this is a lot bigger like this is an 18 liter case versus the seven liters on the ghost s1 but the thermal capabilities of it are a lot better and especially today nowadays when you have like more powerful gpus more powerful cpus they put out more heat it just makes better sense to have a more thermally capable case and i just really like this build it's like a really smartly designed case great performance i love it and obviously the color okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys
