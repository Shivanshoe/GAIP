[Music] all right so this is the new alienware mechanical laptop keyboard and this was a device that i almost told them not to send because i've been disappointed so many times in the past by other companies trying to do something like this so many gaming companies so many laptop companies have tried to make mechanical keyboards for laptops and it's just been disappointment after disappointment to the point where as a reviewer it's just like are they ever gonna be good really this thing comes in i had low hopes but this is something that cherry and alienware have been working on for three years turns out it's something special so the first thing i noticed is that these keys have very little wobble to them and the first time you use it it's a little bit weird because it's a such a sturdy typing surface it's just not something you're used to when it comes to laptop keyboards and the way that it works is that it's a pair of stainless steel wings that can pivot up and down there's also a spring in between the two wings that pull it together when you press down on the wings you're pressing down on the switch there's tension on the spring and when you get low enough it'll hit the actuation point and at that point you'll feel this very distinct tactile bump and it feels awesome if you like tactile keyboards and it's unlike a desktop keyboard like i'm not going to sit here and try to make you believe that this feels no it doesn't feel like a desktop keyboard at all it doesn't even feel like they're low profile switches like cherry makes some low profile keyboard switches which i personally don't like it doesn't feel like those it's a unique typing experience and i think unlike every other mechanical keyboard that's ever come out on a laptop there's no learning curve to this you don't get used to it there's no practice time you need to put in to be able to get comfortable with it none of that i think if you pick this up and you like tactile keyboards you like that feel of the actuation point you're gonna like this typing experience very consistent feel to the key very consistent actuation point across the whole keyboard the total travels 1.8 millimeters the actuation points at 0.8 those numbers probably mean nothing to you but it's at a very good point like that that spot where it clicks in it's it's right where i think it should be you also type fast on this keyboard i think the mechanism that pops it back up is just it's nice okay now there is potentially a downside to this keyboard and it really depends on every person can be different on this so it has to do with acoustics so i'm just going to demonstrate the issue you know what this is what normal typing would sound like if you're a mechanical keyboard enthusiast you might have picked up on the ping like the mechanical resonance that you're hearing now it's most pronounced if you type quick like if you hold down a key and you snap you just let it go real quick that didn't do it there you go you hear that ring that metallic ring that's i mean that's ping right now when it comes to traditional mechanical keyboards people spend like hours hundreds of dollars to remove that metal resonance from their keyboard builds right the thing that tay had built me this thing this has no ping this is beautiful look at this thing but there's no right there's nothing it's it's there's no metallic resonance to this device at all this thing has a lot of ping you ready for this that is a very metallic resonant sound now personally i don't care about that stuff now i'm not the kind of traditional mechanical keyboard enthusiast i feel like some people are very sensitive to this stuff that's why people spend hours lubing and doing all these things to mechanical keyboards to remove that sound but this thing has a lot of pain now it's just the spring doing its thing spring doing its thing delivering ping to make your ears ring the whole thing is very audible when you're typing quickly now i i can't convey this in a video right it really depends on how fast you're typing if you're someone who types really fast i think that's when that sound can get more annoying so i was tempted to pop off all the keycaps and try lubing this thing but number one it's a review unit and i have a feeling that that would probably damage it but secondly i don't know how much that would actually do for this type of sound it's not like it's coming from a stabilizer or one particular part it's every key has a lot of metal it's a stainless steel construct that just resonates if you type quick enough so is that a problem for me not at all but i'm not you and if you're looking at this keyboard and you're wondering if this is going to fit your lifestyle that's for you to answer if you plan on bringing this to a noise sensitive environment i mean a loud keyboard is still a loud keyboard and no one likes that stuff really not in like a lecture hall or anything uh the secondary function keys don't light up anymore so as an example like the f9 key you can only see the f9 you can't see like that little light icon underneath so if you're in the dark you kind of have to know where your functions are and it goes with basically all of the keys and also the top row of keys like those smaller keys those are not mechanical switches i feel like that's just the limitation of this design it would have just been cost prohibitive to have made these custom mini keys to go for this particular laptop but the keyboard overall is really nice if you like tactile keyboards personally i would like this i would want any laptop that i got to have this keyboard switch in it like i hope that cherry expands beyond just alienware i imagine they will it's just a matter of when because right now i think these guys have an exclusive on it but it's a great keyboard technology and yeah there you have it the alienware mechanical laptop keyboard um okay so the rest of the device real quickly so this is the m17r4 this keyboard comes in the 15 inch model as well as and the 17 inch obviously this machine is super fast it's running on rtx 3080 at 165 watts and it delivers excellent gaming performance but really the star of the show is that fantastic keyboard okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
