in front of me are a bunch of performance laptops that were sent to me from asus to check out now a few weeks ago they did a briefing with me and they're like yeah check these things out you're going to like them and they seemed really cool but when i got them in god damn these are like some of these are just phenomenal and i want to share these things with you so let's start off with my personal favorite of the bunch this is the g14 the exterior hasn't changed it's still got that nice white exterior with that iridescent purple badge and it's still in that 14 inch form factor but inside we finally have a webcam this is something that people have been asking for for the past couple of years and it's finally available and it's with infrared capability so you can use it for windows hello to log in with facial id now in terms of performance this is all amd this year it's got the ryzen 6000 series cpu and the radeon 6000 s series gpus and because they're all amd it's got the ability to do stuff like smart shift and just work together more efficiently it's the amd advantage that's what they always been calling it when you have the two from the same company but in addition to running all amd it now has a vapor chamber on both components both the cpu and gpu are better cooled than they were last year but interestingly the gpu wattage is significantly higher this year than was last year so now it's running at 105 watts whereas last year's systems on the g14 they capped out at like 80 watt gpus so those are some big gains in thermal capabilities on the g14 i'm sure part of it is due to the updated vapor chamber but it's also the fan like they've tweaked a little bit but the lift is the same like the keyboard lift and the exhaust looks to be the same it doesn't feel like they've changed a ton from the exterior but somehow they're able to pump an extra 20 watts into the gpu this year which is really significant in a package this size so i'm pretty excited to test this thing out thoroughly in the actual review i've played with this thing just to kind of see what this thing was capable of and it looks promising the amd advantage looks legit now the screen is another pain point that has bothered me about the g14 for the past couple of years but this year not only is it that 16 by 10 aspect ratio but but they fixed the response time this thing has always had this really janky response time on like the base model screen and it was so stupid to have a gaming laptop of this caliber of this kind of price point and to have ghosting it just killed me it's fixed 100 i've tested it i've looked at it like it's a proper fast gaming screen now they claim three milliseconds i think that's a bit generous but it's a really good screen this year and i think the overall package is so good i don't know pricing hopefully it's not crazy but yeah the g14 it's on point now internally uh this is gonna be taken with a grain of salt because it's an engineering sample i don't know how close the layout will be to the retail unit but you get one slot of ddr5 that's replaceable and then you have another 16 gig that's soldered on board and you also have one slot of pcie 4 nvme and it's a pretty similar kind of loadout from the previous generations but it's just an overall way better package i think this is just like it's it's on point this year so there you have it g14 okay moving on to my personal laptop right now that i use right now is the g15 now this product has also been updated this year it's got the updated 6000 series amd cpu but they're sticking with nvidia so up to a 3080 ti now again interestingly they were able to bump the wattage on this gpu compared to the g15 last year and it's strange right they didn't change the internals this time there's no tweak to the fans nor any of the thermal configurations that i've been told about and yet they were able to bump up that gpu wattage by 20 watts so now can hit 120 watts with the 3080 ti and it's just strange right it's significant again in a package this size be able to jack up that wattage like that but there you have it the g15 and i will be testing that thing in full uh when i get the review unit now this is an interesting one so this is the g15 strix scar edition this is their most premium version of the strix 15 and it comes in this nice translucent gray color it's a really nice design aesthetic and it also has this keystone which you can remove for personalizing the device like if you plug it up it activates with your profile and it also has this removable back cap that you can use to kind of customize your device this isn't new for this year but i thought i'd show it again because it's so cool now it's a 2d version of this device but this is supposed to be like their most powerful gaming device in the strix series right it's like the competitive esports gaming laptop super fast screens 300 hertz 360 hertz and it's drenched in super bright rgbs but last year they had equipped this system with the amd 5000 series cpus which were very fast but this year they swapped those out and they went with intel they're going with 12th gen intel and i think it's because that just gives you the best possible frame rate like i haven't been allowed to benchmark these things these are engineering samples but it makes you think right if they're going for a device where every frame matters on like you know 360 hertz screens they would go with the fastest possible cpu and clearly they went with intel for a reason i'm just saying now the screen is still a 300 hertz panel on the 15 inch model but this year it has a mux switch now normally i don't get too sweaty about mock switches on devices just because the games that we're playing plus the resolutions we're playing it doesn't make a huge difference for a lot of games but on this device i mentioned it last year because this is that type of machine and it's for people playing those types of games where muck switches make a huge difference so finally has it thank goodness and because it's an intel chip it's got thunderbolt it's got all the intel stuff uh the keyboard is also something that has been tweaked this year so last year they had an optomechanical keyboard which i thought felt nice but it bumped up the price of that machine it was too expensive it priced itself out of the competition because so many other companies could offer something similar in terms of performance at a better price but it's gone this year it's a regular keyboard hopefully a more competitive price and it can be equipped with a 3080 ti that's also running at higher wattage than the previous stuff internally we've got two ram slots two drive slots and you still have the ribbon cables you need to detach from the motherboard which i would have liked to see them switch to a more elegant solution like some kind of pogo pins or something so you don't have to unplug stuff every time but there you have it the strix and scar g15 okay next up oh man this is a really cool device so i did the briefing for this thing like two or three weeks ago and i remember thinking okay it's kind of cool but i want to see it in person and i get it in person it's like oh my god this to me is the coolest gaming device that asus has put out in several years so this is a gaming tablet for lack of a better term it is a tablet that has a very capable cpu and gpu in there but it's only 12 millimeters thin and i actually think this is going to be the world's thinnest device that has the i9 12 900k in it it's super powerful for a tablet it comes with a keyboard and if you want to you can connect this thing to an external gpu so you can use the proprietary asus connection like that xg mobile connection that we saw from previous generations it'll connect right up to here or because it's an intel chip with thunderbolt 4 you can use a thunderbolt 4 connection but if you think about it for a second this type of product like a 12 millimeter thick tablet with an intel i9 chip in it would have been impossible before like can you imagine like there's no way you could get a product this thin that had an i9 at least one that was cooled properly right it was impossible before and they have one now i get it in i plug it up and i'm blown away like it's so weird to see overwatch running at over 120 frames per second on a tablet like that's just not a thing and now it is the fans were also surprisingly quiet like they're right on the back of the system and you would assume that on a device like this that's got a powerful chip in it the fans have to be running at full tilt just to keep this thing from catching on fire right but it's quiet like not silent but i don't know my guess is 30 35 decibels it's a quiet system i don't know how long it can maintain a boost clock again i'm not benchmarking and testing this stuff i'm just like playing a casual game of overwatch but yeah man this thing is it's something special now on the back you have this kickstand so you can position the screen to whatever angle that you'd like and there's also this red rubber tab to help you pop it up in a kind of easier fashion there's also a camera for the people that are interested in photography with their tablet but there's also the signature aesthetic on this thing it's this window that looks right into the pcb of the system now it looks like there's some kind of shielding with a design on it and i think it's a nice touch to have this rgb lit window it's pretty cool however there is a bit of a issue with this thing so if you use this tablet and you're carrying it around you have to place it down like if you rest it on the table window side up like it just has to be that way because if you put it in a regular manner like this is how i normally put like a surface product there's a wobble to it and you run the risk of scratching the window or the surface that it's on so rainbows up to the sky i do think it's like you could you know you could be like walking in class and some dudes like hey man that's a nice microsoft surface you got there hell no dude i'm a gamer because it's all about the gaming window okay uh the keyboard so this is a detachable magnetically attached keyboard and it feels really good type's nice it's got a lot of travel it's got rgb lighting and the front of it has the alcantara finish that you would see with most of the surface keyboards but the whole package is way cooler than i thought it would be it's such a neat device and i feel like if i wasn't making youtube videos and like it didn't need a powerful gpu for my system like i would strongly consider picking this thing up okay there you have it the z13 okay next up we have the duo 16 and it's been tweaked a lot so this year that second screen on the inside doesn't just pop up it also slides back to bring it closer to that main screen and if this really cool mechanism that does it it's super smooth it pops up and it slides it back and the purpose of pushing that screen back is to get it closer to the main screen so there's just a more seamless visual experience between the primary screen and the secondary screen now this year there's also the option of a mini led main panel so you get higher contrast ratios and there's also the inclusion of a webcam up top this year now in terms of performance it gets up to a rtx 3080 ti but it's also running amd 6000 series cpus uh that is the duo 16 but remember because it's got that secondary screen the keyboard is always shifted down and you also have the trackpad on the right with its cool number pad feature okay last but not least are these four devices now i think that these will probably be the best selling of the asus lineup because these are kind of priced and geared towards that entry level to mid tier market these are the a15 the f15 as well as the dash f15 now let's start off with the bottom two so the a15 and f15 a stands for amd equipped ones f stands for intel equipped ones and what's interesting about all four of them is that they share the same kind of chassis and design but they will change the thickness of the bottom panel depending on the thermal requirements of the device and i think it helps to keep the cost down like by sharing so many components across the different product lines there's a lot of what i would imagine to be safe cost which hopefully passed down to the consumer now last year they came out with the dash f15 and this was a white device that is arguably the best looking laptop that has ever existed but that thing had a four core cpu that just did not make sense for a 1700 gaming laptop but they were willing to toss that thing out the window and replace it with the new f50 and it comes in black and it comes in white now it's no longer fully metal it's got a metal top panel uh it's got plastic on the inside but the overall product is so much better than what they had last year and i swear asus i haven't tested this stuff or benchmarked it i mean that's the thing i have to say right but i'm i'm excited and i feel like this year if you're a viewer that's been like looking for a new laptop you have someone that's like three four years old this is a really good year to get in on devices okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time and i'll be reviewing most of these maybe all but most of these uh when i get the actual review units in [Music] you
