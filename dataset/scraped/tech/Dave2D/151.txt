all right let's talk about google's pixel 4a this is for me a very attractive phone priced at 350 dollars very clean software excellent camera system class leading camera system in my opinion there's just so much going on that is good with the pixel 4a and for a lot of people like myself that live in north america who don't have access to the oneplus nord or don't have access to like redmi phones from xiaomi easy access to those phones these stick out as being something special so the way i'm going to do this video clearly i like them just do a quick kind of like mini overview of the things that i really like about the phone and then talk about some concerns i have about the pixel 4as and then i want to talk about like a purchase decision between like its close competitors but i also want to bring up this at the end a conversation about google as a company right now because i think there's some there's some interesting stuff to talk about all right so the things i like about the phone let's start off with the size i love the size of this phone it is so small and when you come off a large phone for someone like myself with like normal sized hands this just fits in your hand the whole one-handed operation it's really comfortable to use it's small it's lightweight and when you pull out of your pocket you put your finger fingerprint sensor on the back and it just it opens up the screen it's an oled 60hz 1080p panel it's a great looking display but most importantly it looks so much nicer not the actual panel itself but the bezel just it's uniform this year there's no weird forehead or chin this is like the nicest looking pixel phone we've seen from the front the battery life because of that screen is great i'm hitting like a comfortable eight nine hours of screen on time i think because the processor and the screen aren't particularly demanding it just doesn't suck a lot of juice so battery life is good there's a headphone jack at the top for people that want that and there's also stereo speakers up front if that's something you are interested personally i love stereo sound when i'm watching any kind of media and this delivers it so the audio quality on the pixel 4a sounds so much better than i thought it would pixels have never had great mic pickup like it's usually a little bit echoey and not very clear this just sounds so much better to me than the pixel 4 even from eight nine months ago the camera system for the pixel 4a is fantastic as you'd expect i feel like this phone sets the bar nothing is better at taking pictures than this phone when it comes to 350 phones i will say the differences are most pronounced when it comes to difficult shots like if you're doing low light photography or like uh like high dynamic range photography where there's like a lot of bright and dark things in the same scene this is where google software really shines if you're just taking regular photos like you're just taking a easy photo like well lit good conditions there's nothing moving around and any modern smartphone can capture that stuff quite easily but when it comes to more difficult images the pixels just do it so nicely but keep in mind that it's something that not everybody needs right i think that's one of the confusing things about camera systems on phones like we look at this stuff and we think we want the best everybody wants the best i want the best but sometimes we don't need it and if you look in your camera roll and you never see dark photos you never see photos taken in high dynamic range you probably won't need the stuff that the pixel's offering just put it out there if that's going to help make your purchase decision okay so i'm going to talk about some concerns i have of the pixel as well the color it comes in one skew black there were rumors and even leaked videos of other color variations but in the end they just landed on one color you can obviously skin it this is a it's one of like the new pastel colors from dbrand i think these look really good with these particular phones okay another concern to have is the water resistance so this is a phone that is not ip certified which isn't too big of a deal and they also have a rubber gasket on the sim card tray which is nice but if you drop this in water it's probably going to suck so the last i want to talk about is performance and this is a concern that was not for me but i think a lot of people were concerned about the kind of overall performance of this device i tested this thing to the best of my ability in terms of just real world usage as well as gaming now they put so it's got a snapdragon 730 g yeah 730g it is a chip that is i keep looking over here because i'm looking at the oneplus nord this has a faster gpu the actual like cpu component is similar but the nord has a faster graphics processor and when i put them together and i kind of compare them in performance they're very similar to each other for regular phone use but there is a difference in games this is fortnite normally runs at 30 frames per second on android it's not a game i ever got into on mobile but you can tell that it's pushing the system a little hard now there are other games that are somewhat demanding that don't have any issues at all but i think for most people this is perfectly good for even gaming now if you're looking at the pixel 4a you might also be looking at the iphone se and potentially the oneplus nord depending on the region you're from now i'm not going to get into like a sweaty technical comparison between them i do want to mention some kind of wider scoped thoughts about them though pixel 4a i think that this is the phone as great as it is i think that this is a phone that's going to show its age the fastest uh for one it doesn't have 5g capabilities but it's also the slowest of the bunch and i think in like four or five years time this will feel slower than the other two but it'll still take better photos the iphone se now this is the phone that thing's going to last the longest i think it's built the best it has waterproofing and it's just a better built phone than the other two in terms of materials it's also equipped with a flagship processor and it's apple so it's gonna have many years of software support i feel like in 2025 five years from now there's gonna be so many iphone ses around still lots of them will have cracked screens and batteries that could probably use some replacing but they'll still work remarkably well for a five-year-old phone it doesn't have 5g though also so if that's something that matters to you it really shouldn't right now but if it does it doesn't have it either uh oneplus nord this is a bit different this is a phone that is clearly focused towards enthusiasts it's not as hardcore as a regular lineup but this is filled with features that enthusiasts care about like fast screens fast charging but those features bump up the price and not everyone wants that stuff but if you're an enthusiast and you might be because you're watching videos like mine this would probably be for that crowd uh it does not have the best camera though if you're looking like you saw the photos earlier right okay uh but that's basically my thoughts on these three phones they are all good in their various rights but just depending what you want what you need it's you got to make that choice now i want to close off this conversation with this topic that i mentioned earlier of google's position right now the pixel phones have never had strong branding like when i think about all the pixel phones over the years they've they've changed like they've had like so many different directions of how they want to take it where they want to go with it are they premium are they budget and it's it's you know for them google they're an experimental company right they try lots of things they have such a big bankroll that they can try stuff like this not make money and not even bat an eye because for them it's just like a learning experience the thing is for consumers it's a little bit weird right we've seen like here's here's a great example we see this phone pixel 4 this was an 800 phone at launch and you see this phone pixel 4a 350 at launch this phone looks so stupidly overpriced beside this like anyone who bought this at full retail probably doesn't feel great looking at the price of this because they're just so similar they're certainly not 800 and 350 dollars worth of phone inside these things like there's just there's something weird going on in terms of their pricing and i think for google that the thing that i'm seeing right now google with this phone the launch of the foray i feel like they've they've landed on something i think they realized that they don't want to be in that ultra premium segment anymore they discontinued the pixel 4 like they're not making any more and they're stopped selling them off of their website they're out of stock and a lot of it the pixel 5 that's coming out soon doesn't even have like high-end snapdragon chips that like what a pixel device always had the fastest snapdragon right they're not going for it this year they're going for just more budget-friendly options and i think google's realized this is where they this is where people want them to be this is where they want to be this is where they need to be because they've had so many years of trying this stuff ultra premium phones that just didn't sell really well and i think they're shifting gears anyways what do you think about that whole this is a theory right this is what i think of what's going on with pixel's kind of direction right now i think it's a cool direction though i think it's the right move for them um okay that's the phone i mean if you're looking at the pixel 4a it gets my whole-hearted recommendation i really like it but just be aware that it's not a perfect phone right people that are looking for a snapdragon 10 000 in a 350 phone it's not gonna happen all right hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
