this is the xps 13 from 2020. it's the 9300 and i have a very special relationship with this product line it was the very first laptop i reviewed on this channel like the 2015 xps 13 and it's also the device that i often recommend to people when they just asked me hey dave what windows laptop would you recommend for people that just don't know a lot about computers they just want like an easy recommendation i often lead them to this xps 13 because it's just a really good product line from dell it's not super expensive they improve on it every year and just most people can enjoy this product quite readily so i look at this thing critically i look at this thing through the eyes of someone that would actually want to use this thing as my main computer now they revamped the xps 13 this year i didn't expect them to last year was already really good but they completely redid it and they improved on a lot of features but they actually made a few things less good but let's get into it first thing design and aesthetics this thing is incredibly nice looking it's small it's compact it's lightweight but this year actually went for the black carbon fiber model so last year i had like the white one uh this year went for like the black finish there's something about the way that dell does their carbon fiber that is very unique it's soft to the touch it's durable it's inviting to use i think a lot of people enjoy the way that the black carbon fiber feels on this device so i went for it again this year the white models they look really nice but they're not as nice to use because they don't have that soft touch material that the black carbon fiber does now on the surface of this device i'm running a dbrand skin this is the black matrix i just do it for the looks but it does have a degree of protection if you kind of bang your device around okay ports this year they only include two usb ports there's one usbc on the left and then one usbc on the right that's it last year's model had a third usbc now i can give it a pass with two i mean like there are some devices out there like that 12-inch macbook that only have a single port but if you're someone that connects a lot of devices to their laptop you're gonna have to get some adapters there's also a headphone jack on the left and an sd card slot or a micro sd card slot on the right if you'll notice they're actually missing the light indicator for battery so they used to have this button you could press to check on battery life and now it's gone i don't think people often relied on that button to check on the battery status of their device it's just something that's existed on so many older xps 13 devices it's weird to see it gone okay one thing i did notice on this machine that was very unique or new this year you can open the device with one hand and it seems to be something that people wanted i've personally never found it super important or super valuable to have that feature but i can see it being useful in certain scenarios especially if you're holding something with the other hand you just only have one hand to do it it's nice it's more of the fact that they spent the time and effort to engineer the hinge so it could be done like that like they certainly didn't need to add this feature at all right all the xps 13s in the past they'd never been able to do this people still bought them but it's nice that they did it this year now the screen has also been changed this is now running a 16 by 10 aspect ratio instead of the more traditional 16x9 it's just a little more vertical space it's a 13.4 inch screen this is a really nice aspect ratio for this type of device i've always been a big fan of 16x10 ultrabooks the screen is bright it's got pretty good color accuracy it's a really nice screen it does not however have touch sensitivity there are some configurations that do but you have to pay quite a bit more to be able to have that feature the webcam is up top it's in a good spot again this year and the 2020 model supports windows hello so you can log into windows with just your face biometrics it's really nice wonderful screen now if you don't want to use face id you can also use your fingerprint sensor that's at the top of the keyboard so i guess let's talk about the keyboard so this is it's a redesigned keyboard and i really like it now i'm partial to the layout of the xps 13s i've always enjoyed how they've positioned their keys they've tweaked a couple things for one the left and right keys are now full size keys instead of those half keys from the 2019 model so you don't hit the page up and page down by mistake i really like this layout but i can see how some people won't uh if you're someone that uses page up and page down frequently and you are used to the position and you wanted physical dedicated keys you now lose that you now have to hit function up function down but i love the layout on this thing i think most people will enjoy it the keys themselves they feel awesome now maybe it's because i've used so many bad ultrabook keyboards in the recent years these feel wonderful they're bigger keys than last year's model they're responsive the key travel is nice i think a lot of people will enjoy this keyboard okay the trackpad this is also slightly bigger this year than it was last year it's not a huge trackpad i think it's appropriately sized for a 13-inch ultrabook the tracking is good it's got windows precision drivers but the click it's different this year it's like a thumpier quieter sound still feels solid like compared to last year's model this is the 2019 one it's just a louder sharper click versus the thumpier okay speaking of sound the speakers on this model okay here's the thing over the years laptop manufacturers have ruined laptop speakers because they always market them with these like fancy names and these fancy brands to make people think that their crappy speakers actually sound good this year these are actually good they're way better than last year's model and way better than the vast majority of ultrabook speakers out there and i think it's because of wattage these are two watt speakers instead of your standard like one or one and a half watt speakers they are not as good as macbook speakers but i think that if you care about sound you won't be disappointed by these [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] in terms of performance i think dell did a really good job considering what's going on here in a thin and light ultrabook like this it's running 10th gen intel chips these are similar in cpu performance to last year's stuff but the graphical performance is noticeably better it's still not great for gaming right even something like overwatch not a particularly demanding game doesn't run all that well like it's playable but it's gonna stutter here and there if you want to do heavier stuff it still can't compete with an h-series chip from intel and i would really like to see an amd chip in this chassis that would be awesome but performance on the whole is quite good and i actually think the thermal system on this year's bottle is slightly improved compared to last year's model so if you take a look at the inside there's quite a few things that have changed but even the back panel has been upgraded a little so this grille here used to be made out of plastic and it was something that could be easily broken when you're opening the device it's now part of the machined aluminum bottom panel so inside we see two fans that are in a different position this year than they were in previous years they're now on the left and right so you get more even heat dissipation the wi-fi card is on board you can't replace that unfortunately it's a killer wi-fi card which i know it's based on intel's hardware but it's got some software stuff you have to finagle with the ram is soldered on can't replace that but the ssd thank goodness is still replaceable i thought that they would bake these things on board because their newest xps 13 21s had them built into the motherboard but this is still replaceable the ssd they include is from sk hynix but you can easily upgrade that if you want and if you look on the left and right you can actually see the antennas they just have them out in the open on this particular model now the battery down here 52 watt hours they haven't changed the size but i'm still getting a comfortable 10 hours on this particular battery if you get a higher resolution screen it's probably gonna be less but 10 hours on the 1080p model without a touchscreen the other thing i noticed on this device is that the headphone jack assembly is separate from the motherboard instead of a jack that's just built into the motherboard it's this separate assembly that sits inside the bottom panel and then when you close it up there's pogo pins that connect it to the motherboard and i don't know why they did it like this maybe it was like a space-saving thing but i've never seen anything like this i thought i'd just show it to you guys because it's pretty cool okay i want to close this discussion off with the pricing and the configurations of this new xps 13. so on the website they have the cheap model starting at 999 but that thing is four gigs of ram and i've said this before in previous videos i gotta say it again you should not sell a premium device like this an xps 13 with only four gigs of ram it just it doesn't make sense it's disrespectful to the consumer to have something like that available on your website like when every other manufacturer out there is putting eight gigs of ram as a minimum in their base models don't sell a four gig one like when phones like you can buy a 20 20 smartphone with eight gigs of ram for 250 bucks what is this 4 gig model doing it doesn't make sense anyways aside from that weird ram configuration on their website i really feel like they did a really good job on this year's xps 13. they did a whole bunch of improvements it is a really nice looking machine and i really recommend it for anyone that's interested in a device that does all the ultrabook stuff okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] [Music] you
