okay so this is a video that's been a long time in the making i've wanted to do my anti-rgb setup for a really long time but there were always these issues that kept popping up like i couldn't cool certain components properly in this case and there were peripherals that just i couldn't get them to match my design aesthetic that i was going for so i just waited i waited until everything lined up nicely before i made this video and that's where we are today because stuff has lined up nicely let's start off with the case this is a case that i've showcased several times on my channel this is the ghost s1 from a company called low key it is in my opinion the best looking small form factor case right now it's eight and a half liters so it's very small has room for a full-size gpu and it's very easy to work in for a case that is of this size there's a new cooler master case that i thought was quite interesting the nr200 i believe it has a very similar design aesthetic but it turns out that is a much larger case that thing's 18 liters versus eight this is like half the size so yeah i wanted to keep it small now building in this case has never been difficult in terms of fit but it's always been difficult to cool well now last year i was running the intel 9900k an 8 core cpu but i wanted to get this thing even more juiced up i tried to run the amd 3950x way too hot couldn't cool this thing on air at least not without like the extra top hats and stuff i just wanted to keep it small like this i also tried the 3900x still too hot i ended up settling on the intel 10900k now that's a cpu that's still really hot it's 10 cores and i had to lock the cpu boost to 4.8 gigahertz i don't let it go past that it runs hot it's still like 87 88 degrees but it doesn't break 90 and it doesn't ever throttle and that's really the only goal i had with this system i don't think i can push this case running on air without the extra top hats and stuff i don't think i can push it harder than this this is the most powerful system that i can personally build in this case i actually had to use an angle grinder on the motherboard heatsink to be able to fit the cpu cooler this time it was tight so we have 32 gigs of ram and it's all sitting on a gigabyte z490i motherboard with all the rgb lights turned off the gpu is the rtx 2080 ti this is on its last legs in terms of like being the king of gpus this is two years old at this point but i also had to do some mods on this thing so the geforce rtx font at the top turns green and it's really bright so i popped off the front plate on the cooler to access the rgb lighting and there was no way to easily disconnect it or so i thought so i cut it and then when i tried to actually remove the cable i pulled that connector right off that pcb it ended up working perfectly though there's just no way for me to easily reconnect the geforce rtx logo back to the lighting system but i'm good with that now the performance on this machine is excellent 10 core cpu rtx 2080 ti i mean what do you expect right it's going to push out some excellent numbers and the thermals are acceptable to me for the size of this system now this setup uses one display panel and it's a really nice one so my old set of videos i've always had this 38 inch wide screen from lg it's a 38 uc99 i've used it for three maybe four years fantastic screen but it was starting to show its age they finally have a new one that fits my needs perfectly so this is again 38 inches wide screen but better color accuracy and 144 hertz with one millisecond response time it's super fast it's the perfect screen to me it's g-sync compatible if that's your jam it is so nice this is really the screen that i've always wanted over these years like it's this gr it's a screen that's good for gaming and for doing work right it's everything in one panel it's bright it's color accurate it is so good i love it i think i'm going to replace all of the displays that i have in the studio with more of those 38 inch screens they're so good i highly recommend this display and they also have good speakers if you notice in my setup i don't have external speakers now this is something that is just my personal taste i don't need external speakers as long as the ones that are built into the display sound good and these ones are nice and it keeps the whole desk clean now if i'm ever playing games i don't rely on externals i use these ones this is the new surface headphone 2 from microsoft i've done like a mini review on them because of bluetooth 5 and just i guess new hardware from microsoft there's no noticeable latency i can comfortably play competitive shooters with the surface headphones too so let's talk about the mouse and keyboard next i feel like this is the last part of the of the setup okay this is a mouse most people have not heard of this is something that has a bit of a backstory to it i was sent a kind of engineering sample or prototype of this mouse sometime like january or february of this year and when they sent it to me they were very hopeful they wanted me to do a video on it and i didn't like it at the time i was like the idea is cool but there's issues with it like there's some build quality issues i didn't love and like the wiring wasn't ideal i just told them i'm not going to make a video on it then i ended up buying the retail unit like i think the retail ones came out sometime in the spring and they fixed a lot of stuff that i talked about and i just i feel bad that i shut him down earlier so this is actually the mouse i've been using for the past few months and you guys have seen them in videos and people have asked what is that mouse i've never done a video on it or anything but this is the pwnage ultra custom it's the world's lightest wireless mouse if you're into counting grams but it's a really good mouse now i wouldn't put it in the same category of performance as like uh gpro wireless or like the viper ultimate from razer those i would consider to be better mice but this has two advantages number one it's cheaper it's 100 bucks two it uses usbc charging this is a feature that i do not understand why so many companies refuse to put onto their gaming by still like there's 200 gaming mics out there that are brand new that still use micro usb for whatever reason this uses usb-c and in an era where like all of my devices are usb-c it's nice to be able to just connect it up to juice it up so 40 hours of battery life it's a really good mouse personally i actually can't tell the difference between the sensor between this and let's say the g pro wireless but i would say that if you're super competitive like mlg pro you might notice a difference but i think most people will really like the performance on this mouse and you can also remove the back plate like if you don't like the smooth finish you can pop it off and throw on honeycomb material for a decreased weight but yeah solid mouse now uh there is i'd say one main disadvantage to this their software sucks it's super ugly and it's not particularly intuitive but because you just have to install it once set it up to the way that you want it and then it'll work you just remove that software when you're done and i just turn off all my rgbs because that's how the anti-rgb setup is now the mouse pad okay we got to talk about this mouse pad so this is made by razer and it comes from their new work from home lineup it's called the razer pro slide no glide and it's a really simple mouse pad it's 10 bucks but you know how rare it is or how hard it is to find a gray or white mouse pad that doesn't look stupid these guys did it and it's got this nice gray material on the bottom the rubber with a nice hexagon pattern if you're into hexagons this is an awesome mouse pad i love it and i'm probably going to buy a bunch of these i highly recommend this thing and it uses the same kind of soft surface as their regular gaming mousepads it's a good one the last piece of the setup was the keyboard and i'm very picky about keyboards i couldn't use my regular massdrop control or master up alt keyboard that's a keyboard that really depends on its rgb to look nice if you don't have that stuff the keys are even hard to read with those key caps it's not a good keyboard for this particular setup the truth is i never found the perfect keyboard i have one that's being made by nathan from teja keyboards but in the meantime i've settled on this this is the razer huntsman mini and there's there's so much i like about this keyboard it's not perfect like you can hear the problem right there the stabilizers are not ideal at rattles but the typing experience on this is solid and i love the size it connects with usb-c so i can use that keyboard cable to connect into the mouse to juice it up whenever i need to and i feel like this is a keyboard that doesn't need to light up to look good right it's got a very clean aesthetic optical switches and it just looks really nice in this setup now it's also a nice size i like smaller keyboards and it's i mean it's for gaming like you tilt it and it lets you move your mouse without it getting in the way but that's my anti-rgb setup and i hope it inspires some of you guys to build systems that are not rainbows because rainbows are a little too much sometimes okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time
