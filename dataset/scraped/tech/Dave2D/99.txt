[Music] all right so at the time of recording this this is literally the most powerful gaming laptop available on the market this has the fastest amd cpu available it has the most powerful nvidia gpu available and it's all packaged into a 15-inch gaming laptop that quite frankly nothing even competes with from the intel camp like if you see videos or products out there they're like hey this intel laptop is the fastest no like it's not even close so this is it's a testament to how good gaming laptops have become over the years and also it's a testament as to how much amd has done over the past couple of years to really bring something special to the gaming laptop or just high performance laptop market so at the heart of this product is the 5900 hx it's the flagship amd laptop processor eight core 16 threads and this thing is fast like super fast it's fast in games it's fast for work and if you compare it against other gaming laptop products that have intel chips in them there's just no comparison this is so much better and so much faster than anything that intel has to offer and even on their desktop level like normally laptops and desktops you'd separate them right in terms of their performance but this thing is able to deliver better multi-core performance than every single desktop chip that is made by intel that has eight cores and this thing can sustain it 4.1 maybe 4.2 gigahertz sustained performance for an unlimited period of time that's with the gpu running full tilt that is what amd's able to deliver right now in early 2021. now the gpu in here is also really powerful it's an rtx 3080 this one is a 130 watt version it's very powerful but it's not going to be as good as like a desktop rtx 3080 in terms of just raw gpu performance but gameplay on this thing is awesome you're getting excellent frame rates in even some of the most demanding titles on the market right now and because the gpu is being fed 130 watts this is near the limit of what this gpu can even deliver right i'm sure there's some devices are going to come out eventually that have i don't know 160 170 watts like they're just pumping that in but it's not going to be much better this right the whole diminishing returns with gpus it's going to be a little bit faster but this is near the limit of what an rtx 3080 can deliver and this is all packaged in a 15 inch relatively thin device right this isn't like super chunky this is a well engineered piece of equipment and the best part there's no throttling the whole thing can sustain the fast speeds and all that stuff without any dips in performance and the reason why is because of how they've engineered this this is the zephyrus duo with the pop-up secondary screens you get some nice airflow behind there and it's running liquid metal but they've also tweaked some elements of the thermal design so you just get a really powerful system it's running amd's newest stuff but it's cooled really well this has cooled better than last year's intel version and it's significantly faster now the panel up top on this model is a 4k 120 hertz now they claim that it's a three millisecond response time when i measured it was coming at four and a half still super fast it's an awesome screen it's bright and it's colorful the secondary panel is also 4k across but it's obviously not as tall this is a touch screen and you can do whatever you want with it you can put your videos on it you can put secondary information on it you can have it up when you're playing games it's so much more useful than you might think just looking at it like when you own something like this or you just have access to a second monitor having screen real estate is always useful and the way this is designed like it's just a regular laptop slightly thicker than a regular laptop but yeah this is just in my opinion a really smart way to have more screen on a laptop now they do have a 1080p option so it'll have a 1080p top panel i think it's 300 hertz as well as a 1080p bottom panel and if it were my purchase decision like somehow is in the fortunate position to be able to pick up one of these i would totally go for the 1080p option instead of the 4k like the 4k panel is nice obviously but you have a higher battery consumption but you also lose a lot of the benefits of a 4k panel at a 15 inch screen like you just again if you're just doing photo and video editing and that's why you picked up this thing then sure but if you're playing games i'd go for the 1080p for sure now there is something cool that they've adjusted this year on last year's model i noticed that if you did get the 1080p top panel the secondary panel is still 4k and if you've ever experienced multiple monitors on a computer and they're different resolution it's a pain in the butt especially when they're stacked on top of each other there's just a it's just a resolution thing the way windows handles it like it just doesn't scale it nicely especially for all tabbing between things now they match them so if you get the 4k panel the bottom will be 4k but you've got the 1080p panel the bottom will also be 1080p so i think it's smart for asus to do that but yeah the screens they're good we just got to choose wisely the battery in here is pretty big it's 90 watt hours but because this is such a powerful system and it's got two bright 4k panels it doesn't last particularly long i got four and a half hours with my regular test if you disable the secondary screen and i just did it out of curiosity i got five and a half hours which was longer than i expected like that's i don't know almost 20 with just a strip of screen being removed so if you're bringing this out for work you could probably extend it a little bit by disabling the screen and this is all with the 4k panel if you have a 1080p panel it'll probably last a little bit longer so battery life is good for what it is but it's not like a full day battery at all the ac adapter on this unit is pretty big because it's got the most powerful configuration it's 280 watts it kind of has to be to fuel this thing but on the lower wattage configurations the ac adapters are smaller and if you want to and if you need to you can power this thing with 100 watt uh power delivery through usb-c but obviously you can't run this thing at full tilt using the usb-c connection okay uh now the rest of the internals in case you're curious there's a couple things i want to point out so there's two nvmes and they're configured in raid right out of the factory and there's also 16 gigs of ram that's baked onto the motherboard and you have one slot so you can upgrade it up to 32 and there's also an upgraded speaker system so there's two that's down here and then there's two up at the top they sound better than what i remember from last year but they're still not amazing i think it's just an issue of bass there's a distinct lack of lower frequencies when it comes to any gaming laptop to be honest but yeah it's slightly improved but don't expect too much and that wraps up the inside now there is one other thing that i thought was kind of neat in the box so when you purchase it the ac adapter comes in this kind of like cardboard box thing and maybe this was on last year's model as well but it didn't really realize it but you can do this so you take it's just cardboard right very unassuming we place it down and now if you want to use this thing connect it up to an external keyboard or an external mouse you can place it onto this dock i wouldn't call it a doc it's more like a stand and it's in this really nice position and angle like the screen is at a great height the secondary screens at this really nice angle you have your external mouse external keyboard and you're just you're doing stuff you're just getting stuff done because this is a weirdly nice orientation slash configuration but it's unfortunate this thing is cardboard it would have been nice if this was some kind of plastic for some durability but it's that perfect angle and they've kind of repurposed the packaging for that i'm sure there's other ways to do it like you could probably get a legit laptop stand that wasn't this but it comes in the package if you want to try it out okay uh ports real quickly there's a minor change to this year's model so there's a micro sd that they've included and there's also an update to the usb a ports they now support usb 3.2 so the keyboard and trackpad now in order to be able to get this kind of pop-up screen and this kind of airflow you have to shift the keyboard and trackpad down and i'm okay with the keyboard i actually like typing on this thing they include a wrist rest but i'm one of the weird people that just i don't mind typing on this thing without the wrist rest but the trackpad i don't like it's been i don't know several years that this type of trackpad on the right has existed i've never grown used to them i think if you're forced to use this every day you will go crazy like you will not enjoy this experience you're just gonna have to have an external mouse i think the secondary function like having the number pad is really its main purpose and if you need to you can use as a trackpad in a pinch but that is the new zephyrs duo and it is it's just so much better than last year's model partly because the new amd chips with their excellent performance but it's also because of price this has dropped down in price by 500 bucks it's now starting at 2200 it's not cheap by any means but you're just getting a lot for that 2200 price point this goes up it goes up i think to like over 3000 bucks if you really want to spec it out but i just think that this package because of what amd offers like even at the base model it's an 8 core cpu that outperforms the vast majority of desktops out there like this amd stuff is just so good right now but that is the zafraz duo and yeah it's literally the most powerful thing i've seen in the studio to date okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
