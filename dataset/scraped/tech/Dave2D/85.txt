[Music] all right so this is the new lenovo legion phone it's the dual 2 and it's just on a whole nother level so we've seen some really nice high performance phones come out this year already right the rpg phone five is one of them comes to mind this is a gaming focused phone where they have an optional accessory a fan like a cooling system that you can clip onto the phone to improve the thermal performance of this device but what would be even better than a clip-on fan than one that is built right into the phone so this has two fans an intake and exhaust but when you have a cooling system that's built into the system that was engineered as part of the device itself it is way more efficient than having something that's a exterior accessory right because you're able to make contact with the thermal components directly when you have a cooling system like this so when you have a system that's actively cooled like this you're able to squeeze out the most possible performance you can from the chipset which is a snapdragon triple eight and this device is very focused on performance it's configured with some powerful components but it's also equipped with this side-mounted pop-up front-facing camera i've never seen anything like this and i got to be honest it's kind of cool maybe have a soft spot for pop-up cameras in general but it makes perfectly good sense now to get a grasp of what's really going on here we have to talk about the aesthetics of this device so this is a very unique looking phone it's aesthetics are built for gaming it's symmetrical right down the middle so when you grip it it has this controller-like experience i mean that's what they're going for it doesn't feel like a controller it's not even close but it's significantly more comfortable more ergonomic in your hand than a regular slab phone the curves and design lines on this phone make it a little bit easier to hold when you're holding it up in landscape mode for playing games or watching any kind of media and then because this whole thing is about that landscape life they got to keep it symmetrical and they don't want bezels or hole punches that'd be too easy you got to go for the front-facing side mounted pop-up camera it's the only way to go so this thing is 44 megapixels it can do 4k at 30 frames per second and it can do background removal for live streams it's very powerful hardware and when you're using the phone in normal portrait mode and using it for like a video call it comes out at the side and at first i thought it'd be weird right but it's actually a it's a nice location for a front-facing camera for one your eye like if you're looking at someone on the screen your eye is really close to the lens itself right so it looks like you're looking at the person you're talking to it's a bit of a bonus feature but it's also usable as a face cam if you're streaming off of this phone now they've mounted the hardware in a manner so that it maintains the proper aspect ratio like a regular phone so even though it's coming out of the side and it looks like it might be kind of rotated because it's coming off the side it's actually still a portrait image when it's upright and then when you're in landscape mode the image is landscape like a regular phone just in case you're wondering now the back cameras they're nothing special they're decent even in low light but you're probably not buying this phone for its photography capabilities now on the back of this phone there's also some rgb lighting the y logo lights up as well as the two fans both the exhaust and the intake fan and you can change the color and the kind of pattern of this light in the software now if you're wondering what happens if you place this thing flat right because doesn't that cover up the fan and it does but i think this secondary vent over here allows air to go through and then out the exhaust even if it's lying flat on a table and there's also shoulder buttons so there's four on the top two on each side as well as two rear mounted ones and there's also some built into the screen but i don't find those as useful you can configure those however which you'd like and there's also two haptic motors so there's one on like each side of the device so if you're playing games any kind of vibratory or haptic feedback you can feel it in a stereo manner is that even a word stereo haptics but yeah there's two haptics so you can feel it in a left and right manner it's actually fairly noticeable in driving games and stuff you can feel it i don't know if it's applicable to every game out there right some games just wouldn't make use of dual haptics but you have it in here now playing games on this device is awesome it's snapdragon 8 running at full tilt because of the cooling on the device surface temperatures are lowered the frame rates are very consistent this is a fast phone the performance is fantastic and the screen is also really nice it's 6.92 inches 144 hertz 1080p and a touch sampling rate of 720 hertz it's crazy responsive that means it's looking for input pulling the screen 720 times every second so it's one of the most responsive screens you can get on a phone right now now in terms of software there's a performance mode to improve your gaming experience and there's a slew of battery health focused stuff so you can reduce the charging capacity or bypass the battery completely when you're plugged up playing games on it and the battery in here is a big boy 5500 milliamp hours with two usb-c ports to charge it up and if you're using this thing lightly like you're not playing games you can comfortably hit like eight maybe even nine hours of screen on time just because the battery is so big but when it's time to juice it up this thing can take up to 90 watts of juice so 45 on each side and it'll power up the two batteries in here ridiculously fast it took 14 minutes to get to 50 and just over 31 minutes to fully power up the battery from zero to 100 like that's that's a fast charge if i've seen one now there are some things that aren't perfect on this thing there's no headphone jack which i don't like seeing on a gaming phone and the water resistance at first i thought there would be none right i mean there's a fan in the back but supposedly this fan system is water resistant which would be very impressive if that's true but the sim tray doesn't have any kind of gasket or any kind of seals there so if this thing goes in the water chances are it won't be good that's what i'm guessing okay but that is the legion phone dual 2 from lenovo it's got to be one of the craziest phones i've ever seen on this channel it's a big boy but it is stacked with all the goods okay hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did one of the easiest things to do support this channel is give it a thumbs up okay thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
