okay so this is a video about the new logitech g pro x super light it's their new gaming mice and i normally don't unbox things on this channel right normally when i get products that i'm personally really interested in i like to enjoy that experience of opening it up and just trying to figure out how it works and stuff like that that's just how i roll right so i don't want to sit in front of a camera and have to think of things to say to interact with you guys i just want to enjoy that in a very normal and organic way however when these things came in there was something about the unboxing that i did want to share with you guys so i came into the studio last week and the way that we handle packages is that there's just there's a pile of boxes that just collapse up right and on a particular day of the week i'll bust them open just to see what's going on inside them and then i'll choose what videos i want to do now for this particular package i didn't notice it right away i knew that it was coming in right i had been told that the new logitech gpro wireless mice were coming in but i didn't know it was that particular day so i come in and i see a really big package and i examine it it's the new amd gpus very cool and i look around and i notice another package it's the apple devices it's the m1 macbook and the mac mini like okay that's the thing that's really cool i'm probably gonna pop that open first but then i see this box it's got the g logo on it and i recognize that this is probably those new logitech g pro wireless mice and this new one was supposed to be lighter with a new sensor and new features and it came in this white color like you know i like my white mice if you follow my channel so i'm playing around with it looking at the bottom of it noticing that the kind of ptfe feet look a little bit different than the way the original one did and then i noticed the charging port why why do they have to put micro usb on a mouse of this caliber in 2020. okay so i'm not gonna do a hardcore technical review on these mice i'm just gonna talk about them from the perspective of someone who really liked the original it's like one of my favorite mice of all time and just kind of some impressions and thoughts about them so the first thing i want to talk about is their weight they are marketed as 63 grams it's on their packaging it's on their website and they weighed in lighter so i measured them at 60 grams and i thought it might be the scale so i measured a bunch of my ultralight wireless mice and they're all measuring at the advertise spec but these ones come in at 60 maybe 61 grams it's a little bit lighter than their advertised specification now you notice the weight reduction especially for a mouse that doesn't have any honeycombing or perforations on the shell it's a fully solid back mouse and it still weighs 60 63 grams it's a very light mouse they've changed a couple things on the interior to reduce that weight and they've also removed the right mouse buttons well not the right click but the buttons on the right side of the mouse and they've also removed the rgb lighting there used to be a light up g logo right in the middle and you can change the colors on that thing but it's gone now you only have this single indicator led when it's charging and indicate the battery status but the aesthetics of this mouse otherwise are very similar to the original now on the bottom you'll notice a fairly different configuration of the feet there's a big and wide ptfe piece up at the front as well as this c-shaped one in the back and then there's that ring of material around the sensor but this feels noticeably different than my old or original g pro wireless and it could just because you know the material is new but i don't think it's just that i actually feel like there's a perceptual difference in smoothness with this new configuration of feet i like it you also have the option of removing the center cover and replacing it with a very similar size and shaped piece but this has ptfe material on the bottom but i don't really enjoy the experience when this is installed it just feels like there's a little more drag and when you have it on it's actually quite easy to scratch this material because when you remove it you're just kind of hitting it with your nail and you will very likely scuff this thing up quickly if you're removing it often and you might because that's where you store the dongle for the wireless connection so the sensor is their new hero 25k sensor it's extremely high dpi 25600 i feel like very few people if any play at that kind of dpi setting if i'm being honest i personally can't tell the difference between this sensor and their original hero sensor like this feels awesome but so did the old one i feel like if you're an ultra high level player like maybe shroud he does use this mouse if i'm not mistaken maybe he can tell the difference but it's a good sensor there's no doubt about that the battery life has been bumped up a little bit it's now good for 70 hours of wireless use and the charging is micro usb it's just like the old one it's got these prongs on the side of the cable that help stabilize it but micro usb now there is one other addition that they've added this year it's the inclusion of grip tape in the package it's this black rubbery feeling tape that you apply right onto the surface of the mouse buttons or the side of the mouse and i've never used anything like this before and i don't know how long it'll last but it gives the mouse this nice rubberized grip without adding much weight to the device the grip tape feels like this nice value add that they throw into the package now this thing comes in at 150 us dollars it's expensive it's definitely on like the upper echelon of wireless gaming mice the thing that makes this special is really it's really low weight 60 63 grams with a full back like no perforations it seems quite difficult to hit this because all the other companies that are making mice at this weight point have holes all over the shell so it's actually a pretty unique option i like the design aesthetic i've always liked the feel of the logitech g pro in my hands and i really like the color of the white one like this looks so nice what do you think [Music] [Music] you
