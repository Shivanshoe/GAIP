all right so this is my first video with one of these new Intel 10th gen gaming laptops that's also running in videos new r-tx super video cards and because this is my first video I've done with this type of processor with these new tenth trend chips just real briefly the 10 things you need to know about Intel's 10th changeups in 10 seconds they are good but MD stuff right now in terms of their 4000 series ApS are they're just better in terms of value these get eight cores for a lower price they have lower wattage lower temperatures and because it's a cooler running chip you can package that into smaller devices which we have here this is the G 14 from Asus so the advantages on the intel slide 2 things come to mind number one if you have like single core applications this stuff can go a little bit faster on single core and also if your workflow can take advantage of Intel specific stuff like quick sync in Adobe Premiere then these chips can be advantageous but I think for many people maybe most people AMD stuff is just gonna be a better value but like I've said in previous videos it's as if these chips don't even matter the truth is right now in 2020 it is very difficult to buy any kind of high quality gaming laptop with these chips in them so right now everyone's still using Intel next year I think we're going to see some changes but if you want to buy a gaming laptop in 2020 it's probably gonna have an Intel chip in it okay so this one is the aorist 15 G from gigabyte and it's had a pretty major redesign from the previous year's model it's in this space gray color well it's just gray I don't know why I coloured Space Gray but the main feature the most kind of unique feature about this device is its keyboard this has a new mechanical keyboard that's running these brand-new arm run switches now on this channel I've reviewed at least a half-dozen gaming laptops sort of had mechanical keyboards in them and they're never like super appealing to me they feel different like there's a particular tactility to gaming laptops with mechanical keyboards but I've never really had a strong preference for them so when they told me that this was coming in with this new keyboard I wasn't super excited about it right because I just had you know lukewarm experiences with these types of devices and when it came in I got to be honest I didn't love it because there's there's something different about this type of keyboard that I really wasn't used to but having spent over two weeks with this thing I think I really liked it but there's a really really steep learning curve and when I say like steep you got to use this thing for a very long time to actually get used to it but once you do I think the vast majority people will really like this keyboard now the reason why it's so hard to get used to I was trying to figure it out before I shot this I was like what made this keyboard so weird and so like abnormal okay it's three things the first is the kind of elevation of the keys so when you have a mechanical keyboard on a gaming laptop you can't make the keys pop up above the kind of rim of the device right otherwise when you close the screen it would just crush the keys or depress them into the screen that's not how this could be done so they have to sync them in but they're trying to give you a lot of key travel at the same time so these go down two and a half millimeters which is a lot for a gaming laptop and you just have to your fingers just don't move in a regular way and the other thing is that the layout of this keyboard like the actual physical layout like the location of the keys is fine right this is like a kind of standard layout but there's a pretty sizable number pad on the right and these keys on the number pad are full size like they're the same size keys here so it's this super packed keyboard with a lot of keys on this thing in a relatively small space and everything just gets squished down and it just took me a long time to get used to the spacing before I was able to type on this comfortably and the last thing that you have to get used to is the actual switches themselves these Omron switches are different from anything else i've typed on like they immediately feel nice like when you first click on this like individually you it's like yeah you know what this feels sturdy this feels clicky it's a nice solid keyboard but it's just a different sensation than any other laptop I've used before so all three of those things made this a really steep learning curve but once you get used to it it's a kick-ass keyboard and I just spent like 10 minute talking about a freaking keyboard on a laptop but because it's the it is really the thing that makes this thing unique I thought it would just go into it a little bit more in-depth okay now if you want to you can change the lighting and the software you get very bright and colorful lights and there's also fan control as well as CPU wattage control in that software so the performance on this machine is okay let's kind of break it down into gaming performance and then we'll talk about some thermals so this is running the eight core i7 and boosts up to five point one gigahertz there is a cheaper six core variant which would probably be similar to this for most games but the performance is really good like we're talking crazy good frame rates for the vast majority of triple-a titles and most of that is from the GPU the new r-tx 2070 super max Q which is a decent bump up from the previous non super models and there's also a corresponding bump up in performance for stuff like Adobe Premiere but it's not like a huge jump right if you're expecting this generation of r-tx super GPUs to be like massive it isn't I don't think that anyone should have expected that but it's like a it's a bit of a spec bump now the pricing for this stuff hasn't gone up a lot like if you look across the brands it seems like Nvidia is only putting these r-tx super GPUs into the most expensive and premium gaming laptops like the mid tier and cheaper gaming laptops got regular r-tx or gtx cards only the like the best stuff gets the supermodel so the existence of these super cards doesn't seem to change the pricing for most gaming laptops alright the thermals on this device are also quite good it is an aorist device they usually have good thermals to go along with their brand but their fans have to get quite loud to achieve those numbers you do get very granular control of those fans in that software but it's just something you need to keep in mind like your if you want a well cooled system in a package like this you're gonna have to pay up in fan noise so to get inside it's relatively easy access you have a bunch of screws and you'll be able to access your two RAM slots your two nvme slots and your Wi-Fi card if you want to swap that out this is a killer card which I personally don't love you also can see the four heat pipes they exhaust at the back and the side and this is the type of thermal system I like seeing because there's just there's a lot of stuff going on in here to remove the heat off the chips and to expel it out and in order to get a thermal system like this so you need something thicker right this isn't like a super thin device and they've done it quite well I did notice in the software I couldn't under voltage you for people that are into that like to try to lower temperatures I don't mind one just locked out because it's like an early unit but yeah the eight core i7 from Intel on this unit just I couldn't under voltage so there's that okay battery life so this is a ninety four watt hour battery and I got a little bit less than seven hours of battery life with the screen at 215 it's the speakers on the side sound not great I didn't expect them to and they didn't sound great so there's that I mean they just sound like your standard gaming laptop speakers they're relatively small and baseless okay Anna close this up real quick the ports there is an SD card slot reader if you're into that there's also three USB a's and one USB C that supports the Thunderbolt 3 as well as an Ethernet jack so if you're gaming and you want to be plugged in into the line you can okay uh overall thoughts on this device see I didn't talk about the screen yet the screen this is I mean it's nothing new this is a 240 Hertz 1080p panel that's bright with good color accuracy it's a really nice all-round gaming screen we've seen these types of displays from ARS before they often have really good screens and this one doesn't disappoint and there's also a webcam on the bottom that has a privacy cover if you want to protect your privacy but the viewing angles on this thing are not great because it's shooting from below but the overall device is solid in terms of performance and stuff my only complaint about the air is 15 I got to be honest is I don't love the design I know they spent a lot of time designing this thing and it feels well built but it's just not my favorite kind of look for a gaming laptop but it's an aorist device that's just been refreshed to the 20/20 hardware with a very unique keyboard that I would say is probably the best mechanical keyboard in a gaming laptop right now okay hope you guys enjoyed the video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
