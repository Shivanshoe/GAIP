all right so there's been this growing conversation around how oneplus now sucks as a company and this conversation started off years ago a smaller conversation then but it's grown to the point where now i see it everywhere i see it on reddit i see it in videos that are not even about oneplus the commentary around this has grown quite a bit and recently because there's the public announcement of how oppo was merging with oneplus it's just gotten even more people riled up and i wanted to chime in on this so i feel like oneplus has done a few things that to the public's eye they can criticize her so number one and it's the biggest one is pricing over the years they've started off you know selling three 400 enthusiast level smartphones and now they're selling thousand dollar enthusiast level smartphones right it's a big difference in price and it's just gotten people jazzed up and the second thing people have been concerned about is their software so when oneplus first hit the market years ago that's what they were known for really good software not just cyanogenmod or oxygen os but the updates right they had frequent updates that were trying to tweak and adjust the product so the user experience was better that's not the way it is anymore right we have two-year-old phones that have had bugs since the beginning it's the weirdest thing but their software updates have definitely slid both in frequency and in motivation from the company to try to like adjust things as they as they've popped up now the third thing is a kind of general statement about the company because they used to be so focused on the you know the smartphone for the enthusiasts and now they seem to be focused on not that right they have a huge spread of phones they have 250 smartphones being sold at carriers for people that are not crazy into tech it's a shift in the company that i think people perceive as you know they don't care about the user base anymore they don't care about their fans anymore and then the fourth one it's their marketing they've had overly aggressive marketing from the beginning and maybe it's just the one plus way or the kind of bbk way but it's you know right from the beginning never settle flagship killer the oneplus and hasselblad partnership they promise a lot and when you promise so much it's really easy to disappoint people if you under deliver it's it just feels weird for the enthusiast who trusts your brand who is supportive of your brand and maybe bought into the market a little bit it's very easy for them to feel let down when you under deliver but the thing that to keep in mind is that oneplus is a company and they've had one goal from the beginning it's to be a business and to make money that's two goals you get the point uh and if the path to that is through having a diverse portfolio of phones right to have cheap phones mid-range stuff expensive stuff then that's the correct way to do it right if that makes more money that's a better business decision if the removal of a headphone jack makes them more money that is undoubtedly the correct business decision so this whole idea of making these cheap flagship killer phones and then selling them to enthusiasts that's not a business model that's a terrible way to make money that's not even a business model that's a marketing tool right you you do this gimmick get your foot in the door make a name for yourself and then hopefully build off that so the problem was people bought into that marketing people bought into the idea that oneplus cared about enthusiasts that they never settle and that they they they're trying to cater their products to the to the tech enthusiast no man that's just marketing nonsense and if you believe it you get sucked into it and that's when you feel salty when stuff like this happens when companies grow into what they were destined to be what they wanted to be right from the beginning now for me the reason why i've always been drawn to oneplus phones was because of oxygen os i've really liked the android skin right from the beginning it's super clean super fast and it's a wonderful operating system but because of the oppo oneplus merger there's a very real possibility that oxygen os gets removed sometime in the future now pete lau has gone on the record saying okay oxygen os is gonna be on these uh one plus phones but who knows you know considering the track record of the parties involved i don't feel like oxygen os is gonna last for much longer i my guess is two years two years time oxygen os gets replaced with coloros or whatever they have in the future but i don't think it lasts forever but i'm gonna go back to the original question does oneplus suck not that that was the question but this is something i want to answer i think a lot of people are saying oneplus sucks now right it's no longer a good company don't buy from them i think despite all the stuff i've complained about oneplus in this video i think that they still make fantastic phones i think their marketing sucks i think their pricing has crept up aggressively over the years but i don't think that you can fault a company for being what they were they wanted to be to be a company and to make money because this like the path that they're on right now is a great way for them to make money and considering how short of a period of time it took them to get here like if you think about it six seven years ago they had one phone that's it right one plus one that's it and seven years later they're making a slew of phones every year with a whole bunch of stuff going on i think right this this is this is a regular smartphone company with smart watches and wireless earbuds and even tvs they are so different from what they used to be that the question of does oneplus suck now doesn't even matter because if they can make a good phone that's a good phone and that's really the only thing that should matter how good is that phone when you're looking at it okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
