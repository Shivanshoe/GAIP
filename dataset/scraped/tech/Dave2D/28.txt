all right so two weeks ago i got this device in and i had planned a completely different kind of video i wanted to do just a simple unboxing video on it right i just wanted to open it up and share that unboxing experience with you guys as i discovered the product then it was a fun video i shot it i know i'd edit it and it was like a it's a good video but then after i shot that thing i started to use this thing as my regular device because i really liked it it was just a way more impressive phone than i had originally anticipated but after using for a couple weeks i was like that like that is not what you guys deserve that unboxing experience as cool as it is as fun as it was this is a product that deserves like a more comprehensive kind of thoughtful video so that's where we are two weeks later i'm like i'm gonna reshoot this thing because that's what i felt like you guys deserved instead of just an unboxing thing so i really like this phone and it boils down to two things the screens well there's two screens there's an outer screen there's an inner screen because it's a foldy boy but it's also the form factor the way this thing holds and fits in your hands um let's start off with the screens so this display on the front is a five and a half inch uh it's an ammo led 60 hertz nothing super special but the size of it is really nice we'll come back to that in a second but the inside is where the kind of foldy magic happens this is a 120 hertz panel but the thing that i noticed like right when i popped this thing open was that there's no seam in it there's no crease that you normally see when it comes to foldable devices and this is not something that i really care about like the truth is a lot of people complained about it when foldable text started coming to the market i've always been on the side where like you if you're looking at good content no one really cares about the screen or the seam on the screen but they somehow removed it and i find it strange because samsung the guys that make this foldable screen technology they don't even have it on their current generation like the samsung fold one and two it was very evident on that but this is a fold three and even on this device like you can see that crease it's pretty obvious um this one so there's no seam per se let me catch it just right there's no crease but there is a bit of like a imperfection it's like a bit of like a wobble in the middle of the screen and the way they've done it is through the hinge which we'll come back to in a second but the thing i really like about this screen the inner screen is just the usability of it the moment i pulled this thing out of the box like this is the way that foldable screens should be where they're landscape where they're like wider than they are tall and this is right out of the box wider than is tall so like you're using the device you open it up it's like bam you want the width right on a regular full device i say regular but on a fold device like you pop it open it's like it's portrait you got to rotate the device to be able to get that width that most like most people want width on a screen right like look at any device you use that's wider than it is tall and i don't know i just like right off the bat when you open this thing i was i was in love with it okay so the screen usability is fantastic on the inside but then the outside screed dude this was like weird when you pull it out of the box and you fold it up you're like this because no other foldable phone is like this right now it's a fully usable front screen so let's use the fold three as the best example here so this is a device that is probably the the biggest screen on the front in terms of the standard foldables or the more popular foldables and even this version of it it's like this vertical screen that it's kind of narrow so if you're looking at a calendar or anything that is kind of like a wider format it's not particularly nice you're kind of inclined to pop it open and if reachability is awful like if you want to hit an app icon at the top or kind of pull down menus you got to like you know this is not the way that phones should be uh any kind of slab phone even the big ones are quite one-hand usable this dude this is like it's like the perfect size it's like this small compact phone great reachability usability on that front screen and when you need it open it's like bam you got the big stuff now when it comes to like practical use of a wide screen like this it's best for multitasking like having two apps open at the same time you get like gmail on one side and then like a browser on the other side whatever you want like it could be you know a zoom call and twitch whatever it is is just the ability to have multiple apps open at the same time and be able to interact with them at the same time it's really nicely done on a bigger screen like this i don't think that the media consumption experience is that much better on this device like if you compare this screen once you take into account the letterboxing it's not like a significantly better viewport i will say gaming on the find end is kind of hit or miss it depends on the game but most games are developed for widescreen formats right like a regular slab phone in landscape mode with a wide screen this is a square-like display it's not one-to-one but it's more square-like than most screens uh and just your either you're gonna have big bars on the top and bottom or you're just cropping in and losing out on a lot of the image that you're supposed to be seeing so on something like gentian impact you're losing out on a ton of the screen that you should normally be seeing and it's unlike pokemon unite this is my favorite game right now like the abilities are going off the screen like you just can't you can't play it properly so if gaming is your thing i mean folding phones are never really great for that experience but it's the same on the find end you often have to manually adjust the aspect ratio of games be able to use the inner screen properly and even then you have ladder boxing on the top and bottom now i mentioned earlier that the find end has a fairly crease free or seamless experience on the inside and the way they've done it is through the hinge like so this hinge it bends it or rolls the screen in a more gentle kind of u-shape instead of the kind of like traditional fold looks on the fold three it's like a more it's a more acute bend like it's kind of hard to show on this camera but you can tell like when you close it it's got a fairly acute band but on this one it's it's just like a more gentle u shape to it like the curvature is more gentle and the consequence is that you just have a i don't know a a crease free experience relatively crease free experience it's not perfectly flat it's supposedly ultra thin glass on the top layer and not plastic and it's also supposed to be rated for 200 000 folds which is many years of frequent folding i do think it's the same kind of rating as the galaxy fold devices and these are also 200 000 folds a pop but i think like those numbers are ambitious i feel like i've seen videos and pictures of people folding their devices for like two three years and there's like some crease damage but i don't know maybe with the more gentle curvature on this one it would last longer only time will tell okay the hinge isn't ip rated but there's supposedly a degree of water and dust resistance to it but i think on any kind of folding foam when you have a hinge that's got moving parts like this there's a gap right there has to be a gap for any kind of movement and i think any kind of dust water there is some kind of ingress point it can never be as water resistant or waterproof as a slab phone because there's no moving parts on the outside of that but again time will tell i will say that this hinge looks nice it is a thicker phone though it's a bit of a chunky board like if you look uh you know you compare them side by side between the newest fold three versus the find n it's a little bit thicker it might be from the way that they're folding the screen like on the apple device because that curvature is a bit more gentle on that bend maybe they need a little more z height to be able to pull that off but on the samsung device maybe because of that sharper bend they're able to keep the device a little bit thinner now on the samsung device there is a bit of a gap like all of the folds have had them like this gap between the upper screen and the bottom screen once it's folded up but on the oppo it's just like flush right up to the two screens uh there is the other advantage of this hinge it's like when you want to you can use it as kind of like a i don't know way to like prop up the camera if you so choose uh and i was also for like the inner cameras if you want to like i don't know do kind of video calls with people you can hold it up and now you have some kind of makeshift stand like slab phones can't do that but i think this is like uh it's a feature a lot of the folding devices have nowadays but this one can do it as well now in terms of battery life it's decent but it's nothing special it's like a five maybe six hour screen on time it requires a charge every day for sure at least with my kind of usage uh i think though the device is it's just so nice it's a premium feeling device it's got this excellent size and form factor to it i love the usability of that front screen like i cannot describe to you like maybe this video isn't doing it justice but you compare the usability of a screen like this compared to like one of the slim tall screens that the folds have it's just this this makes so much more sense it's kind of weird now that i've used this that samsung went with that design for their devices like i feel like this would be the more obvious choice right that usable full screen on the front and a just bigger version on the inside i don't know maybe they're same thing something i'm not uh it is a little bit heavy it's not like super heavy but foldable phones are like that uh and i like just the aesthetic of it it's like this nice finish to it matte on the back this nice texture to it very premium finish to it it's a nice looking phone a nice feeling phone and a good phone overall however this thing is not cheap i think this thing goes for the equivalent of like 15 1600 uh in us dollars in china i think right now this is a china exclusive now it's running oppo's color os 12 based on android 11 and i don't love that skin i feel like it's a bit messier or busier than i'd want it to be uh i i mean i like my stuff cleaner i like one plot or like the older one plus skin and i like the pixel skins this one's it's not bad there's definitely stuff i like i like the way that they skin their icons like i don't know there's a bunch of stuff that they do right but it's not my favorite skin if i'm being honest but product it's good overall now the camera system i didn't spend a lot of time on it the main shooters are pretty decent but the face like the front facing ones they're okay i feel like the colors are a little bit washed out on it and it's the same like so the outside camera and the inside camera are the same camera it's just there's two of them it always feels a little superfluous when it comes to folding phones i have two of the same camera on the inside and the outside but that's just the way it has to be right now when it comes to folding tech okay oppo's find n really nice device okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
