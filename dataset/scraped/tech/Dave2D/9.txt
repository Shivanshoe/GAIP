making a performance laptop really thin is super hard i was once told by an engineer from a laptop company that at a certain point if you want to shrink the height of a laptop by another millimeter it's an extra million dollars in r d it's very difficult to do and the thing is a lot of companies chase it they want to make these thinner and thinner devices and it comes with problems right you get thermal issues you get keyboard issues you get just limitations with the device when you go super thin but every company chases it and last year msi was guilty of it they made two devices i got them in they were way too thin the performance wasn't great i didn't even cover them but this year they didn't fall into that trap and they made these devices so much better so first we have a gaming device the ghost gs77 which is a little bit thicker and completely redesigned it's so much better and there's also the newly updated z16p so this is also a little bit thicker with the vapor chamber and it's a way better experience than it was last year so let's start here the gs77 it's an all-new design and honestly i think it's about damn time because every year i've reviewed the ghost gs whatever it feels like the company was always so tunnel visioned on weight and thinness that it just took away from the product it just made the build quality suffer because of that pursuit of thinness and low weight this time around both the top and bottom panels are much more sturdy and the hinge even though it's mounted a little bit closer to the center it is a very solid feeling hinge supposedly it's got some zinc alloy for the components inside to make the hinge but you can just tell when you open and close this thing it just seems like a properly built hinge but the more prominent example of like better build quality is the cpanel like the keyboard deck every year when they make a ghost product this deck up here has some kind of perforation or grill where the air flow goes in they've completely redesigned the thermal system so they don't need to rely on a grill anymore and just the top panels are so much better it's something that's bugged me forever about these devices it's good now finally the internals this time are also a more traditional layout so in the past the ghost products have had this flipped motherboard which i think kept the device a little bit thinner but it made serviceability much more difficult this time you have access to both ram slots your drives your wi-fi card you have access to all of it and you can see that there's two big fans instead of a series of smaller fans and i think it helps just with the entire thermal system the keyboard's also been completely revamped it still has a number pad on the right but the keys are just a little bit more square more chiclet a little bit larger it's a nicer typing experience to me the rgb lighting is controllable in the software but it's not a particularly bright or vibrant series of rgbs that's i don't know more muted than you would expect on a device like this uh the trackpad's a little bit bigger this year and i don't think there's anything i would complain about it's a kind of average trackpad there is a fingerprint sensor on the rights which i don't love the aesthetics of it but it's there if you need it now let's talk about performance this is running a 3070 ti with the 12700h from intel and it's a great performer it's really good for 1080p gaming it's great for 1440p gaming the gpu however isn't the highest wattage option out there so there's going to be devices out there usually thicker that will have better performance with the same gpu but i think they've done a really good job balancing performance with the thickness of the product and what's also interesting is the fan noise so traditionally when it comes to this product category like the ghost gs products they have loud fans of the top end and it's not something you can avoid right super thin device with hot components you gotta crank the fans this time around it is so much quieter than i expected now on one hand i like that i'm someone who appreciates quiet systems and this is a quieter gaming laptop but on the other hand this is msi this is a company that so frequently pushes their systems hard and loud to get the best possible performance and i'm surprised they capped this gpu at 105 watts like i felt like if you squeeze the fans a little bit harder it could have gone another 10 or 15 watts this system does not have a mux switch though i mean some people get super sweaty about this stuff for the games that most people are playing at this type of resolution a muk switch isn't super important but still would have been nice to have seen the panel itself is a really nice gaming panel it's not as color accurate as the creative devices but it's super fast response time and refresh rate are top tier it is a 16 by 9 aspect ratio though so you do get a pretty sizable chin i personally like this type of aspect ratio when it comes to gaming laptops but everyone's different and there's also a 1080p webcam up top the port layout is also quite different this year they really did change everything uh you got three ports on the back so you got your ac adapter your hdmi port as well as your ethernet and these are the ones that you don't disconnect and reconnect frequently right this is just stuff you have plugged in or not and that's just you know going out the back of the device keeps your sides clear and then all the removable stuff goes on the side so you have uh two usb a two usbc and a full size sd but the overall product is just way better than the ghost line has ever been it's like finally properly made for a gaming device now i honestly think that they went down this trap of like the pursuit of thinness and lightness and it just made the whole like manufacturing engineering process for this product line stupid like they were just trying to chase something that was not achievable and i think every year people complain like you know this is a great device except it's not well made and the thermal issues and there's limitations it's all gone i think they fixed so much stuff of it this year um it is a big device if you're looking for a 17-inch device though this is a really solid one also the pricing so i don't know exact pricing yet because it's pretty early on in the launch cycle but from what i've seen this thing starts at eighteen hundred dollars and when it comes to thin performance devices of this caliber that's actually definitely one of the cheaper ones all right that's the gs77 next up where did i put it i'll be right back the z 16 p and this is a device that's a little more my speed so this is a great gaming device but it's also a great device for content creators so last year they had the z16 cool looking device very similar aesthetic to this but it was really thin to the point where they could only put an rtx 3060 in it and that was capped at 65 watts this year a little bit thicker vapor chamber now they've bumped up that gpu limit to 95 watts and you can get up to 3080 ti it's just a way more thermally capable system now what separates this device from the average gaming laptop out there is two things first is the design aesthetic of it it's a much more kind of elegant looking more muted kind of matte gray finish to it it's got a nice kind of machined elegant look to it but it's the screen this is the main difference between every other gaming laptop out there so this is a 16 by 10 aspect ratio screen but it's got amazing color characteristics it's super color accurate very bright but it still has a 165 hertz refresh rate so it's awesome for playing games on it now it is a glossy panel if you can catch it yeah you can see that reflection up there of the light it is a glossy panel and it's like macbooks right they have like the glossy finish it's something that not everyone's gonna appreciate and if you're playing games on it only and you have like super bright environments and you can't control the lighting then this can be annoying but for me personally i love glossy screens i've done videos on this in the past but it's just the option of having really nice color like the moment you put on any kind of matte finish you're just throwing a diffusion layer on the screen right and just colors are gonna be less vibrant having it glossy like this is i love it but everyone's different now for creative work this is awesome and also this screen goes all the way back so if you have the pen you can use it for digital illustration and you have a nice glass surface to work on and if you'll notice when i open and close the device you can see the hinge just kind of raises the device for some better airflow on the bottom but it's a overall way better performer than the z16 last year now performance wise we're looking at a fast cpu and a fast gpu but because this gpu is capped at 95 watts it isn't going to be as fast as that gs77 but for a 15 16 inch device this is a very solid performer now there is the same perforated grille at the top of the keyboard like last year's device but the z series never had the same build quality issues as the ghost gs products did so this has always been a very solid feeling device the keyboard isn't my favorite like it types well but it does feel a little cramped to me to have a number pad on a 15-inch device the trackpad this has a nice texture and it's a nice size it's big but there's a weird friction when you click on the pad i don't love it uh not that this is super important but it's something that is not ideal when it comes to this particular trackpad okay the internals there are two nvme slots two ram slots and the traditional two big fans the fan noise is actually very quiet now msi usually doesn't have super loud systems when it comes to their creator devices and this one's no different but the overall product is quite different in profile from like their gaming devices if i had to kind of make a recommendation if you only play games and that's like what you do i would never pick up one of the creative devices the advantages that you get with this like the screen and the nicer build and the kind of different aesthetics they just make no difference for gamers if anything having a 16 by 10 aspect ratio screen is arguably worse for gaming but if you make videos or you work with photo or any kind of video content or just anything like visual content this is a way better screen for that the other thing is battery life the z16 p doesn't have a huge battery but battery life is a little bit shorter than expected the gs77 the ghost that has a fairly average battery life for a device like that but overall these are so much better than they were last year okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time [Music]
