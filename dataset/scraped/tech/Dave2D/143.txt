all right so let's talk about the samsung galaxy z fold 2. this is the most expensive phone i've ever had in the studio at 2 000 us dollars this says a monster of a price tag it has one it's really the defining feature the 120 hertz folding bending screen and the technology like i've seen this so many times now but it's just super cool to me and it really is what defines this entire product category right it's why these things are priced the way they are now i'm gonna do this video in just i guess four or five parts i'm going to start off with the outer screen and i want to talk about the inner screen and then i want to talk about software and then price and kind of the future of the where this whole product category i feel like it's going uh okay now before we get into this i want to mention one real quick thing about the galaxy fold one when this thing first came out one of the things i said in my like early reviews or early discussions about this thing was that even if you had the money to buy this phone back then last year i just did not recommend it to anyone because i knew everybody knew that this would invariably be replaced by second generation one in like 12 months time which is now i thought that this was clearly i mean i didn't think everyone knew this was a first generation product right now that the second generation one is out it just makes this one look dated for lack of a better term i will say right off the bat i don't have that same kind of hesitation this time around i feel like if you are someone who has two thousand dollars burning in a hole in your pocket and you just want to spend it on something this feels ripe now ripe not right ripe because i feel like it's ready for for consumption okay let's start off with the outer screen this screen is so much better than last year's small screen i mean look at the size of this thing this thing has the largest forehead ever on a smartphone it just looks so dated but this new one looks so much better it's just it's just like a normal looking phone i mean forget about the thickness of it but forget that it even folds just as a display it's like a normal looking phone and it looks really good and it's very functional it's very one-handable because of its relatively narrow size it's a little bit wider than the first generation galaxy fold but i think everyone's going to prefer this screen over that first one it's just so much better now i had this thought though when i pulled this out of the box the first thing that came to my mind was obviously it's a much nicer screen but the second thing that i thought of is i think they could have done this last year i think they had the tech and their ability to make this like full screen front i think they could have put this on the galaxy fold one but if you think about like the the product life cycle of this thing they knew they had to make a second generation one in a year if they don't put this derpy looking screen on last year's phone how do they sell a second generation one because this front screen is like the defining difference between the two right obviously there's features throughout the whole phone that make it a better phone the second generation one but this front screen is the thing right this is the thing that most people will notice right away as being this is the new one this is the better one and i feel like they just they did last year's huge chin and huge bezel on purpose so that this one could be right i'm not knocking samsung for doing this it just feels like it was done with purpose with intent so that this transition from first generation to second generation would be very obvious to the even untrained eye let's talk about the inner screen this hasn't changed too much in my opinion just in terms of functionality and usability obviously there's now a punch hole camera instead of that big cluster from the previous generation but the biggest difference is the visual fluidity of the whole thing like the 120 hertz display is a very noticeable thing for people that are sensitive to it and it's just a feature that literally no one else has a folding screen 120 hertz is this is it this is the one to get if you want that now the screen itself like the actual visual experience of it i've always thought it was nice i've never found that seemed to be a bother i know this is something that keeps popping up in comments especially from people who've never even seen the device or used it this is my take on it like a real honest like is it even a hot take this is just the reality if you're fortunate enough to be in the position where you can own or purchase one of these devices and you're using it and for whatever reason you're bothered by the seam you need to be looking at more interesting or more valuable content like if you're right if if that's what you're tunnel visioning on the imperfections of this display you need to find some better stuff to watch because i mean it's there it exists but there's no way that someone's purchasing this is gonna care right obviously we all wish it wasn't there but it is so not a significant thing like it never was for anyone who actually owned one of these things i really feel that way the camera system has been updated it's still using three lenses but i'll get in more depth once i've spent more time with the phone um okay let's get into software because this is probably the most important thing about not just this phone but foldables in general or any kind of folding device it's what really separates the devices right it's why the surface duo is different from this and which is different from you know the huawei mate x it's really the software because the whole purpose of a folding phone the whole reason why you want to get a folding phone not just for the cool factor of it is because you're you're trying to achieve functionality right you want it to have purpose you want the folding screen to deliver an experience that a regular phone can't this phone has decent software to take advantage of the folding screen but it's not like a ton of developers have written apps that take advantage of things like flex mode and the various features that the galaxy folds have the software is good but it could definitely be better i wish and this is something that you know keeps coming up people ask about like pen use on this thing there's no way that like at in this stage where you're still putting a soft kind of surface on top of that super thin glass that they would put pen support on this right you just scratch the heck out of that surface with a pen so maybe in the future but until then you're gonna have to rely on note products for the s pen uh so let's talk about price because this is a two 2 000 machine um i mean clearly it's not for everyone it's it's actually see when you talk about price especially on a platform like this where my viewers come from a huge range of you know social economic status and what they're willing or even want to spend on a phone it's difficult to talk about price and to try to give a a fair analysis on this kind of stuff my personal take on it is i think for what you're getting and the market they're going for and all the you know all the moving parts when it comes to pricing stuff like this i think it's fair i know it sounds crazy how can how can a 2000 phone be fair i get it it's stupidly expensive but it's a stupidly advanced piece of technology that is really not for most people right it i'm not gonna buy this thing as much as i want one even though i have a tech channel i talk about tech things there's no way i'm gonna spend two thousand dollars on a phone it's just it's not for me but for the people that are willing to spend two thousand dollars on phones this is this is a good one it's definitely better than last year's galaxy fold which was also around two thousand dollars another thing i like about this generation is that i don't feel like the third generation like next year's model because there's likely going to be another one next year i don't think that the jump will be as big right like i said in the beginning of the video last year when you look at this one you know that this is built to be first generation it's built to be something that can be improved on the next year this one obviously it's going to make some improvements but look at the front screen they're not going to change this that much right they can't it's it's already a full screen so with the insides what can you do with the insides i think they're going to change the z-axis they're going to make it thinner next year but it won't look it won't make this one look obsolete the way that this one made the first generation look obsolete but this is my early look of this device clearly it's not particularly comprehensive but this is you know early thoughts after a day with this device so far i like it super expensive super super expensive but feels good this year okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time wow that's just thunder that kicked in you
