get over here all right so the oneplus nord 2 is launching in a couple of days and the leaks of this device look really good almost too good now oneplus had their senior product manager available for an interview his name is sam twist and i thought to myself hell yeah i got questions why not go straight to the source about this stuff right so here's my conversation that i had with sam twist about the nord two okay well first of all thanks for even doing this i feel like this is a it's a rare opportunity and a privilege so thanks um okay i'm just going to jump into the questions let's get into the rip okay uh all right so i understand this is all done before your announcement this conversation we're having so obviously some of it you gotta hold back but i'd like to pry as deep as i can um so the rumors i've seen so far nord two with a mediatek 1200 chip 90hz display imx 766 so that same camera sensor that we see on the oneplus 9 products uh warp chart 65 and seemingly it's still a good price point like 350 400 bucks so how much of this can you confirm or deny always a tough question with pre-launch um so i can confirm all of that we're not gonna be discussing anything to do with price because i would be uh taken away um i think spencer would have words for me okay uh yeah we can confirm the mediatek 1200ai chip okay see the 90 hertz amoled display that camera sensor you're saying the 766 warp charge 65 and the 45 uh 100 milliamp hour battery and i think all of them have been officially confirmed apart from the warp charge and the battery and confirm them for you today all right so last year when the nord one launched i remember carl showed this it was like a prototype and i think it was a design that it just didn't look anything like oneplus at all right it didn't look like any kind of previous product but it looked cool it looked i wonder what's the word it's not it looked so unique right in the sense that no one else has that and if nord had gone down that road if that was the design language that nord had used it'd just be more recognizable as you know that's a a brand x phone or whatever and i when i look at even the oneplus 9 phones and the new nord 2 photos it feels so much more generic it and not to rip on the image of what you guys are going for right it just looks like you guys have the capability of making something super unique and super cool but it feels like this is a more safer choice and is there like uh is that what it is like a safety pick yeah sure i'm guessing you're one with like the the three rings yeah it was like squares too yeah yeah yeah but it is cool i'm sure that's hiding away in a draw somewhere with uh hundreds of other prototypes it's not the weirdest or the most wonderful one i've seen either there's a there's more that won't reach your eyelids but yeah i think um so so for one obviously there's that kind of design language there's design because we're not a massive brand right when you when you show one plus phone to people often you're gonna get it's going to go one or two ways and be like maybe i don't know them or oh my god i love them it's kind of my personal experience um but we've got to try hard to create a kind of brand identity um and i think that's kind of coming out in our products maybe it's not as unique and we're kind of sharing something which is striking and stands out for reasons that it just goes completely different um but we are there just trying to create this kind of hierarchy in our products and that kind of design language and dna that really make a brand a brand um so i think from the industrial design team that's probably their thinking and i think it comes up a little bit in the colors as well um to differentiate the two lines uh the first nord very blue right it's a bright blue color uh i find and this isn't just with one oneplus it's like a lot of brands do this they'll put like their their flagship products have like more muted colors like kind of like grays and just like darker flatter tones and then their mid tier or budget lights like they're just they're crazy they're bright they're colorful and like the really cheap brands they do like these really eye-catching textures and patterns on them in my brain and this is why i'd love to hear your thing it's like wouldn't you want the reverse of that if you're gonna have a flagship product wouldn't you want it to be recognizable and like and flashy but the right so what let's hear what what are the thoughts on your what are your thoughts on how to color things i've run a number of color studies um across europe of america and i mean color is just so subjective it's impossible almost to create something that that everybody is really going to connect with in a cheaper line like nord then [Music] to be honest you've got to create something which is gender neutral that's not appealing to one half of the world it's appealing to everybody um and the aesthetics at that kind of lower end price point they are a little bit bolder um but yeah if you if you look at the original nord for instance that blue marble you'll be super disappointed to hear dave that it wasn't in homage to you and it was actually more of an experiment um that went right users loved it the community loved it and yeah we've taken a little bit of that language obviously through to node two um but being a little bit bolder i think at that price point is is a bit more playful and it appeals more to the audience that are more likely to buy or their target audience for that device um but you've got to keep that link right you can't go completely one direction and completely another direction of your flagships you need to have something tangible between them um so i think that's what's really coming through in node two it's got like a it's kind of reminiscent of the flagship devices but it's got its own slightly bolder style all right work charge so warp charge 65 and a 4 500 milliamp hour battery right uh so is it the same tech as in the so the same speed same thing so the double battery everything's the same same cells same dual cells okay and yeah at 65 warp charge okay and still no wireless charging no wireless charging yeah so it's the same technique for the wired charging um down on the on node 2 which is great you know for me i'm a 9 pro user right now it saved me on a number of occasions obviously it's like a day's power in 15 minutes plug it in panic's over and then yeah it's super useful and kind of fundamentally does change the way you use devices for me that's a feature that out of the box is just yeah okay my favorite part of the phone based on the specs we've seen is the camera system that imx 766 the potential for that it it's big right especially at this kind of price point now my my question would be if it's running the same sensor as the oneplus 9 series so number one i'm assuming there's no hasselblad partnership here right that's just okay but do you guys have to tune the nord2 camera down like intentionally or is there any kind of right like limitation because you got right same camera sensor you could do a lot with it but you have the king product and then you have the lesser king product how do you guys play with that yeah it's a tremendous sensor and we we're doing no tuning down at all the nine series device obviously it's got all the hasselblad technology in it it's got the color grading all of the fantastic technology that comes with that um and then we've got this the same sensor in on this note 2 device um and yeah it's phenomenal when you compare it with the original uh one we had in indored it's 50 more light ois 50 megapixels like it's a beast um and so you're taking great photography and but combine that with a lot of this kind of like ai and ml stuff that we've been working on with mediatek um not only are you going to take great stock out of the box like sunny your normal photos um a lot of the what we call situational photography has improved as well um so things like nightscape um all of that is is leveling up um based on the the mediatek work and obviously the phenomenal hardware that we're putting in and i guess going back to are we here like worried about stepping on or like flying a little bit too close to the flagship so i think like as a in the product division and in this industry you are going to be disrupted and it's nice to be the disrupter it's not nice to be disrupted um and they're always going to have it and it can come from a third party or it can come internally and it's nicer that we're the ones pushing we're the ones pushing out what's kind of challenging ourselves um and i think we've kind of done that with the nord 2 device but yeah it's nice to look around the office and know that the toes you're stepping on are are in the office or looking around the zoom call okay i'm looking forward to it good luck with the with the launch uh yeah i'm looking forward to review this thing it looks good you
