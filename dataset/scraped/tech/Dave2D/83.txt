[Music] all right so apple announced a few new products but i'm gonna be talking about two of them that are of particular interest to me air tags and the new colorful imacs and of the two the one that's most interesting to me is actually the air tags because these came out to be a product that is quite different from how i imagined them to be a tracking tag from apple right so these are 29 they're just small tracking tags and first of all the price 29 for one or a hundred dollars for four pack and at that price point it's actually a little bit cheaper than the kind of standard going rate for a tracking device like this like the ones from samsung a little bit more expensive tile trackers are similar maybe a little bit more expensive i just did not expect apple to deliver something that was reasonably priced with a user replaceable battery that lasts a year in fact i thought this would be like a 40 or maybe even 50 accessory from them but apple being apple this air tag if you look at it has no loop or hole or any kind of mechanism on it to be able to connect it to your keys or whatever it is that you're trying to track at least not elegantly like unless you're using duct tape to stick it onto things so you have to buy accessories apple's really thought of everything when it comes to making money now keep in mind that in order to use precision finding like the ability to track an item extremely accurately you do need one of the newer iphones like iphone 11 or 12 because the older stuff can only connect with it through bluetooth and so you get close like maybe 10 meters in terms of accuracy but if you want the most precise location tracking possible you do need one of the newer iphones but this is where things get cool the way that this tracking mechanism works is quite special so it connects with the huge network of the millions of iphones that are out there to be able to locate stuff so as an example let's say i have a set of keys that had an air tag on it if i lost those keys like i said i left it on a park bench or something a random person walking by who has an iphone in their pocket would be able to connect with that lost set of keys and be able to send that location data to me all anonymously and encrypted and securely but that is a huge network of tracking tools without installing any kind of apps it's actually pretty neat now the other thing that interests me is privacy so when you look at a device like this a tracking tool like this it could be used maliciously like let's say someone took a tracking device and put it into your backpack or into your purse or like duct taped it to the bottom of your car so this type of scenario even though it's not something that's going to happen very often it is something that obviously is of concern right now you have these tracking devices with this incredible network that's capable of locating it so accurately people could use this in a malicious manner so apple has this thing where if an air tag has left the proximity of its owner and it's following me or keeping up with my movements it will notify me it'll send a signal to my phone and iphone and it'll say it'll tell me that this unknown air tag doesn't belong to me is following me he's keeping up with me and i have the option of disabling it like let's say it's i'm borrowing something from a friend i'm boring someone's car it's like hey there's an error tag that's just been following this whole time yeah it's cool it's you know i'm aware of that tracking mechanism it's fine right but if it's not if it's not someone that you've borrowed something from or if it's an unknown source now you know and you can disable that person's air tag so you can turn it off so the tracking ends that's pretty cool now if you don't have an iphone unless you have an android phone and obviously you can't there's no like find my app on android phones it will emit a signal it does this automatically regardless of which phone you're using but it'll let out an audible signal just be like i'm here it'll notify you that this tracking device is no longer within the vicinity of its owner and just to make you aware and i think that is very very smart it's just well thought out now another thing is if you lose an item let's say have a pair of keys and i've have an air tag on it i've lost it now right if some other person finds an air tag they can take their phone as long as an nfc enabled device an iphone or an android phone bring it up to the device it'll pop up a clickable link on the phone so you can go to a website and it'll show the serial number of the error tag as well as any information that you as the owner have put onto that site so if you've lost it you can now activate you know i've lost it and you can now put up some kind of burner email or burner phone number or some way for a finder to contact you how cool is that now i've actually found a tile before i found a tile tracker that a set of keys on it this was like a couple years ago and i was like what do i do i actually looked it up right i have tile i have a tile tracker with keys looked it up the only way that for me to be able to connect with its owner is that i had to install an app like a tile app and it would communicate with the network now similar to this kind of thing like a whole network of users but there's just it's so much more friction it's so much more involved to be able to get this thing that i found and get it back to its original owner so this nfc feature feels so much more elegant so for 30 you get a pretty well featured tracking device if that's your jam okay let's talk about imacs these new colorful imacs so the first thing i got to address is the aesthetics of it because this is i mean that's it seems to be the main point of this whole device how it looks so these have very colorful bags and we're talking like vibrant versions of each color and i think they've pulled these six colors from the original six colors on the old school apple logo so the green yellow orange red purple blue but if you look at the green it's more teal like i love this color it's my favorite color but i would have expected a more green like green considering the palette that they pulled from but i'm not going to complain that teal looks awesome now on the front you have the controversial white bezel as well as a fairly sizable chin and this whole front area is covered in a single pane of glass so that chin area isn't the aluminum finish that we've had from previous imacs it's also a glass covered segment but this whole design now that i've had a data process it i feel like it does exactly what it was meant to do like this isn't the product that's going to go into render farms or go into like hardcore work environments this is a consumer product that is meant for consumer environments right it's supposed to look good it's supposed to be it's supposed to like match your living space to match the decor and color of the places that you're gonna be placing it it's a very aesthetic focused product that is meant to be iconic and memorable so that you can you're gonna remember this you see it you recognize exactly what it is like how many other all-in-one devices have white bezels you see this you know it's the imac you know it's the new imac and all the colors it's exactly what it's meant to do it's not going to please everybody right it's not going to be this super sleek professional thing that's like stealth mode it's not it's not for that it's meant to pop in just the right way for people that are into that kind of thing and it's super thin 11.5 millimeters like if you look at your phone it's maybe seven and a half eight millimeters it's barely bigger than that it's strangely thin for a computer of this caliber the whole thing is clearly focused on aesthetics that's why they have the color matched keyboard the color match trackpad or the color match mouse and even the power cable that connects to it is color matched it's magnetically attached very cool but color matched and also the lightning cable the thing that they include in the box to charge the keyboard or charge the mouse is color matched to the device i wouldn't be surprised now that i'm thinking of it i wouldn't be surprised if the stickers that come in the box are also color matched i don't know but that's my guess that they match the color of the device but in this pursuit of aesthetic glory there's one that kind of surprised me is that the performance of these m1 imacs is the same as their macbooks and like the mac mini and normally traditionally when it came to imacs they would run just more powerful chips they would run desktop chips right the macbooks would run mobile versions of intel chips but the imax would run desktop versions because there's a little bit more room in there and you have it plugged up to a wall you don't have to worry too much about power consumption or thermal constraints there's just ability to do more when it comes to an imac but in this case it's the same now granted m1 performance is good right really good so it gets a pass but it's just strange that they didn't do anything extra when it came to this different kind of form factor they just really focused on keeping it thin and really nice to look at in regards to the white bezels i think i'm in the minority here but i think it does it does what it's supposed to do right it's supposed to look a certain way it's supposed to be memorable and iconic and recognizable and it does all that with the white bezels and personally i like it right i obviously i like a lot of white colored and silver colored tech that's if you follow my channel but i think i think this was the right choice going black would have been i don't think it would have been the move for this particular product because of the target market that they're going for now in terms of pricing so it starts at 12.99 and you pay a little bit more 200 bucks it's actually pretty substantial you do get a couple things that are noteworthy so you get touch id on the keyboard you get an ethernet jack on the power supply you also get two extra thunderbolt ports as well as access to more color options for the device but you also have a slightly improved m1 chip so at the base model 12.99 you get a seven core gpu kind of like the macbook air but if you pay that 200 premium you get the full 8 core gpu that is like the full m1 experience but that is the imac i think it's a very colorful device and think for the people that are into that kind of thing they want that consumer level product i think it hits for a lot of people i think it's gonna be pretty popular okay if i'm doing full reviews on this stuff if you're interested in it be subscribed okay hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music] you
