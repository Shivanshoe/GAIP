all right so three years ago i made a video on this channel on this product the mass drop control keyboard and i titled the video i found the perfect keyboard because at the time this thing was super special had usb-c connection it had hot swappable switches it had cool rgb lighting it was a metal build it wasn't super expensive this was very special at the time it was very suiting to that title but three years later it's completely not the case this is remarkably overpriced for what you're getting and it's like an underwhelming product considering the market because over the past few years the whole mechanical and custom keyboard market has just blown up we've seen so many players come into the game so many companies making good stuff at better pricing and this here is the kikron q1 and this is the epitome of what happens to a hobby when you have a big enough audience and enough competitors coming into the space to try to make and outdo each other with better products cheaper products and this keyboard at 150 for the bare bones kit is what i would consider to be the best value you can get in the custom keyboard market right now so if you've ever been interested in the whole custom keyboard world like you want to personalize or modify your keyboard or tweak it to make it sound a certain way look a certain way this is what i would consider a really good starting point and the question is like why would you want one for me and i think for a lot of people that get into this the biggest difference is sound so i'm going to talk about this keyboard in its stock form first i'm going to show you some things i like about it some things i don't like about it and i'm going to show you a mod that i've done to it that i think just makes it a better overall experience for the average person so for the 150 price tag you get a bare bones kit or if you're inclined you can pay an extra 20 and you'll get switches and the keycaps as well now the keychron q1 is a 75 gasket mounted keyboard it's got hot swappable switches it has a usbc connection it also has a switch to swap between mac and windows the paper specs of the q1 is great now the lighting is not the main focus if you look on the outside there's no exterior light bars or underglow or anything like that it's only a subtle rgb lighting system you can tweak it on the software you can use either via or a qmk to control it now if we take a look at the insides there are a few things i want to draw your attention to the first is the back plate so this is an aluminum backplate i do believe that they'll be offering other materials down the line but on the starting launch it's going to be just aluminum and then we're looking at a piece of poron so this is the pcb foam that they're using and then we're looking at the pcb itself now the first thing here is the stabilizers i much prefer the stabilizers on this than what was seen on the gm mk pro so this is a very popular keyboard i was sent to review and i never did the video on it but the stabilizers on these were weirdly sticky and even if you did mods like removing the lube it was just weird that a company like glorious would deliver a product that had stabilizers like that i like the keyboard but the stabilizers on here way better they're gatron they're properly lubed they're good and then the pcb itself uses a five pin modular type so you can swap out whatever switches you like in there it's a very like widely compatible type of pin as well as a south facing led so you can use most switches and just have a proper shine through in this type of keyboard configuration now in the top right corner there is a interesting thing going on so if you look at the keyboard itself like the constructed keyboard you'll notice a badge there like it's got my logo that they put on it but this is a customizable area so you can put a badge in it if you so choose you can add another key there or you can add a rotary knob so this is something they showed on their website in the earlier stages of their launch this idea of a dial that you could attach to the keyboard it does not exist yet it's something that they plan on adding supposedly but it's not as easy of a swap as you might think like it doesn't just hot swap in you have to replace the pcb because the current board can only support either the badge or a key it can't do that rotary knob it needs a separate piece of pcb to do it or just a completely different board so i don't like that i feel like that image was a little bit misleading in the beginning i love the idea of the dial because on the gm mk pro this is awesome the ability to control your volume or if you're in premiere you can program it to do whatever you want it's awesome but it it doesn't work or it doesn't exist right now on the q1 so the switches you can get on the pre-built right now are gateron phantom switches and they're essentially lubed versions factory-looped versions of the gadaran switches you can get them in brown red and blue i have all three in terms of just like the variations of the switches i have a strong preference for the brown switches i will show you one thing though so if you'll notice right here this is the phantom brown switch it's got this brown tint to the whole switch so if you have any kind of lighting it has to shoot through that brown tint before you can see it and it just colors the lighting in this weird way and you'll notice it on the red and the blue and obviously the brown versions and i really don't like that i feel like your rgb lighting is going to look off and also the keycaps these are not good they're supposedly double shot pbt still but there's something about them that just feel really sloppy they're you know slightly askew when there's a little bit of bloom on all the characters i don't love them now if i was making a suggestion for you guys if you're interested in this keyboard if you can swing it i'd skip the 20 like edition for that kid i would just go for the bare bones and use your own switches and your own keycaps the switches are good like i like the way they type the reds and the browns and the blues they type like a lubed version of whatever you'd expect right factory lubed but it's not for me it's not for me okay uh there's one other thing i want to show you underneath the pcb is and get this off a piece of poron okay now before we do the sound test i want to mention one thing i do not like the sound of the q1 at stock it has this resonant ping to it that i don't particularly like but it is very easy to fix so i tried several of the popular mods people do to improve the acoustics of the custom keyboards like i tried pe foam on the top of the pcb i tried taping on the bottom and none of them produced sounds that i really liked and then i stumbled upon this i used a thicker piece of pe this came from a laptop uh package actually and it's probably what three maybe even four mils and i place it on the bottom like on top of the case foam and then the pcb goes on top this is super untraditional i would never have even thought of doing this but the only reason i tried is because there's so much space on the bottom like maybe this will work and i think it sounds really nice that's a nice sounding keyboard to me i particularly like the spacebar it's this nice deep thunk i like it i think it sounds better than the gm mk pro so i've spent a lot of time modding this thing tweaking it i could never get this thing to sound the way i wanted it to so and the stabilizers are a little bit weird i just i never loved this device from my personal preference but yeah this sounds nice it doesn't sound as nice as te has bauer i think that nathan made me from te had types this thing is uh that's on a whole nother level that's a lot more expensive but there you have it key chron q1 it includes a coiled cable in the box with an aviator connection that's seemingly included with the q1 but if you picked up like a gm mk pro it's a separate additional purchase so there you have it kikron q1 it's got a lot of stuff going for it and at that price point i feel like you can't go wrong and i think that if you're interested in picking up a keyboard like a new keyboard you're looking at something high-end from another brand like i don't know like a razer or corsair product or like a logitech product you're gonna spend 150 180 bucks anyways take a look at the customs it's a cool world out here okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
