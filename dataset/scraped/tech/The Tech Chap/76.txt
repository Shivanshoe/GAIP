hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is the new xiaomi 11t pro now i must admit it does feel like there's a new xiaomi poco redmi me actually not me anymore they've dropped that branding but a new one of these phones every sort of five minutes it is kind of hard to keep track but this is basically not the flagship because the uh me 11 ultra from about five six months ago is still the top of the line phone which costs like a grand this 11t pro will cost you about 600 pounds and it sits on top of the new 11t and the 11t light i think that's right and so for 600 quid this goes up against the likes of the oneplus 9 or perhaps their upcoming 9t and it packs in some pretty impressive specs including a snapdragon triple eight a 120 hertz amoled screen with a 1000 nit peak brightness and also gorilla glass vactus on the front then around the back we have this triple camera setup with a 108 megapixel main lens along with an ultra wide and a two times telemacro we also get some great sounding stereo speakers which have been tuned by harman kardon as well as a very fast side fingerprint reader which is built into the power button although i found it perhaps a little too sensitive as it would often unlock when i put my hand in my pocket now on the inside we have a very healthy size 5 000 million power battery which gets me a full day easily and by about 11 pm i still have a good 30 of my battery left so very good battery life but really the big headline is actually this guy this 120 watt hyper charger and apparently according to xiaomi this will charge your phone from zero to 72 percent in just 10 minutes and not to 117. that's insane and sounds a bit like a challenge so with about one percent on the battery i plugged it in set my timer and you can see straight away from this charging animation just how quick this is going to be so 10 minutes in and we're already at 72 percent which is actually bang on what xiaomi claimed even though we did start at 1 95 charged at the 15 minute mark and actually just before 16 minutes 30 it's fully charged 100 not too shabby that is very impressive but my first thought was are we just going to destroy the battery life by charging it that fast every day well according to xiaomi they've built in over 30 safety features with the battery and also it has this tuv rhineland fast charge safety certification but they also say that over a two year period or so about 800 cycles of charging you'll still have 80 of your capacity left which considering just how fast that is and that's well if you charge it once a day a bit over two years that's not too bad now design wise this is very similar to the 11 series earlier this year and it's a fairly understated style aside from that pretty big camera module on the back i have to say though the back cover does feel quite plasticky to the touch and also it picks up fingerprints and greasy smudges really easily so i reckon i would actually go with the moonlight white version of this instead of this meteorite gray but you'll probably want to put a case on it anyway so more importantly this screen and it's a definite highlight of the phone because while we do only get a full hd plus resolution not quad hd we do get this lovely amoled panel dolby vision hdr support 120 hertz refresh and a very impressive 480 hertz touch sampling rate so particularly for gamers you'll get a more instant response to your touch and obviously paired with that snapdragon triple eight this is going to breeze through anything you throw at it and while it's not the super duper latest triple eight plus that's really only about five percent faster and not something you really need so with the m11t pro we're getting android 11 out of the box and naturally their miui skin on top now my only complaint really is the crazy amount of bloatware pre-installed although you can hide or remove most of these but on the whole i do quite like the software you get the google news feed left of the home screen xiaomi's unique looking vertical recently used apps menu there's a good amount of customization including lots of ai image enhancements if you want sharper and more vibrant photos and videos but most importantly it feels fast and responsive okay let's talk about this camera and the main lens is using samsung's iso cell hm2 sensor just like the flagship me11 ultra it is 108 megapixels but it uses pixel bending so we end up with sharper 27 megapixel shots now if we bring in the galaxy s21 ultra which to be fair does cost twice as much you can see actually image quality is quite similar until we get into that zoom where well the s21 blows it away but in terms of overall detail i would probably say the s21 looks a touch more natural with the 11t pro often going for a more vibrant and punchy look there are some subtle differences in dynamic range and color but on the whole considering as i say the samsung costs twice as much the 11t pro does a really good job up front we have a 16 megapixel selfie camera which i must admit i found a bit inconsistent in the right lighting it nails it but other times it does look quite flat and also over sharpened and that's despite turning off all the beauty modes and filters switching over to video and we can shoot it up to 8k although as you can see it's not stabilized so most of the time i'm recording at 4k30 and video looks great it does a pretty good job of smoothing out my footsteps and so on the whole i would say video quality is very good so the big question should you buy the 11t pro which i keep wanting to say me 11t pro but they've dropped that me name and i would say yeah actually for 600 pounds this is a very good phone and i think it's an easy recommendation a couple of downsides firstly i don't think you'll be able to buy this in the us which is a shame also it would have been nice if we had a three and a half mil headphone jack and also a micro sd card which this doesn't have and also this design as i say in this me to your right grey isn't the most exciting and also does get very fingerprinty as you might be able to see there now versus something like the oneplus 9 which has very similar specs and also a very similar price it's a tough one i would probably go with oneplus just because i prefer the oxygen os software although i would say the camera on this is a little bit better but there's not a whole lot between them i think the bigger issue about whether you should buy this is actually xiaomi's own competition they've made the poco f3 which i reviewed i think back in march i still maintain is one of the best budget phones of the year we get the snapdragon 870 which is almost as fast as the 888 as well as that 120 hertz amoled screen the camera isn't quite as good but it is more than half the price of this was it less than half the price it's like 280 pounds this is 600 so actually i think maybe the poco is still a better option if you are on a tighter budget but certainly versus something like the me11 ultra which is like over a thousand pounds i think this is a much better buy so if you do fancy checking it out i will leave a link in the description below i believe xiaomi are also running a 50 pound off pre-order deal at least until the end of september so that's probably worth checking out but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of these let me know what you think in the comments below and if you did enjoy this video which hopefully you did and i'm guessing you did if you watch the whole thing um a cheeky little
