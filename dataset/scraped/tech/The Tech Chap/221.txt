this video is very kindly sponsored by nvidia and ebuyer.com with the new asus taf15 gaming laptop stay tuned and i'll tell you more about it later in the video [Music] hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the new lg 38 wn 95c and i reckon for me at least it could well be the perfect monitor although it does look exactly like my old monitor in fact i've been using its predecessor the 38wk95c for the best part of two years now and in that time i've tested a whole bunch of different monitors but i've always come back to it so now i have this one which i first got hands-on with back at ces in january and now i've got it set up in my home office and it takes all the boxes for what i want but as you would expect it's not cheap so for about 1300 pounds or so you can get this giant 38 inch curved ultra wide monitor now it is big but you quickly get used to it and even going back to a regular 34 inch ultrawide now feels a little confined for me then we have the quad hd plus resolution that's 3840x1600 so you can't quite watch 4k content back natively but it's close and it is still reasonably sharp given the size we also get what lg called a nano ips panel which covers 100 srgb 90 adobe rgb and an impressive 95 dci p3 it also supports visa display hdr 600 so while it normally peaks at 450 degrees of brightness with hdr content though i measured a peak brightness of 622 nits and we also now get a thunderbolt 3 port which is ideal if you're hooking up a macbook or a laptop with a tp3 port as it'll carry the video output data transfers and up to 90 watt charging all with the same cable and that's along with two hdmi 2 ports a displayport 1.4 a couple of usb 3s power and headphone ports but aside from the slightly higher hdr 600 and also the addition of the thunderbolt 3 port the big upgrades this year with uh the wn95c are actually mostly for gamers we now get a 144hz refresh rate one millisecond response time and nvidia g-sync compatibility now i think it's fair to say a lot of professionals out there probably couldn't give a monkeys about you know gaming stuff and g-sync and 144 hertz and that's fair but actually even if you're not playing to do any gaming on this just general desktop use your scrubbing through the timeline or you know anything you do feels a lot smoother and more responsive thanks to that higher refresh rate not just for gamers and i'm sure you'll agree if you have a high refresh rate monitor at home going back to 60 hertz is hard but as a youtube creator person thing whatever it is you call what i do who actually also mostly works from home i actually appreciate having those gaming features because after a long day of scripting researching and you know staring at premiere pro all day long i actually quite like to kick back with a couple of games of war zone and while i must admit i'm still pretty terrible 144 hertz is a big help for those quick reactions and trying to get those headshots plus we get g-sync and while it's only the basic compatible version as opposed to juicing premium or ultimate which are a little bit better optimized it still does a good job of reducing screen tearing and input lag which again is really useful for gamers what makes a great gaming laptop for me it's something that has great specs and offers good value for money so that's where the new asus tuff a15 comes in i mean we're getting an rtx 2060 ryzen 7 4800h 144hz screen massive 91 hour battery and it doesn't cost a fortune i'm averaging 80 fps in call of duty playing warzone and 105 fps on average in death stranding with dlss 2 enabled thanks to the rtx graphics card ray tracing dlss ai upscaling a faster encoder having an rtx graphics card makes a huge difference the best bit though if you buy an asus laptop with an rtx graphics card right now you get a free copy of death stranding so check out the link in the description for more on the asus tough a15 as well as e-buyers full range of asus laptops but if you are trying to get those ws in warzone though or play any game really then you can just press the little joystick underneath go to game mode and then put it in fps or rts mode and this basically puts it into game mode with the fastest response time overdrive it brightens everything to help you see the bad guys although you can still adjust all that in the picture profile settings so i really love the fact that i can just jump between my dci p3 or srgb color profiles which i use when editing straight into fps i'm good to go for gaming since it is such a big monitor though you might actually want to use pvp or picture by picture mode which splits the screen in half and means you can output from two different sources at the same time but let's talk about the design of this thing and we have a matte white plastic back a pretty substantial metal base although the exterior of the stand does feel a little bit plasticky we also get almost flush bezels around three edges with a slightly thicker plastic chin which feels a little bit less premium than the rest but overall i think you'll agree it's a pretty stylish and also professional looking monitor it doesn't scream gamer there's no fancy rgbs or sharp angles so you can easily use this at the office i'm also really impressed by the speakers in this thing it's not something you usually write home about with you know monitor reviews so let's go for a little movie trailer just to demonstrate a bit of bill on ted [Music] it looks terrible but i actually can't wait for this [Laughter] here's a real idea for you be role models not bad at all from a monitor going back to the design and we get a good amount of height adjustment as well as tilt and rotation so it's pretty flexible actually i do have a couple of minor issues though the first one is really not a big deal at all but as you can see you can rotate it by about what was that three or four maybe five degrees it's not much and maybe it's helpful if your desk is a bit slanted but then i wish it had a kind of pivot lock so that i knew uh when it was back to normal or i'm sure there's a better word for that you know straight again and my other gripe as you can see as i'm playing with this is there's quite a bit of screen wobble even just a little tap the whole thing moves around a fair bit and while it does securely fasten to the stand i've got no complaints there well it doesn't feel like a 1300 pound monitor in that regard and finally i've seen on reddit a couple of posts about qa issues with this monitor now i've not had any problems myself no dead or stock pixels or anything there's only a very minimal amount of light bleed and ips glow it's barely noticeable so that nano ips panel is doing a good job but one other thing i've seen mentioned is at the top left and right corners you can see the slightly curved bezel exposes what's behind it which is a glossy silvery material which almost makes it look like there's a screen protector on or something you can peel off it's only just noticeable though and it really isn't a big deal in my opinion so overall i think this is as close as i'm gonna get to a perfect monitor anytime soon it is very expensive though and it may simply be too big for some of you guys but if you are looking for a large color accurate and super fast monitor for work and for play honestly this is an easy recommendation for me but what would be your perfect monitor would it be this or maybe a 300hz super high refresh display or maybe a 4k monitor um once you know the next-gen graphics cards come out 4k 120 gaming with next-gen ports may actually be something we can consider or maybe even a tv for example lg's new 48-inch oled the c10 maybe a 48 inch tv wouldn't be the end of the world i'm not sure if i could get away with it on my desk so for now i think this is uh yeah this is everything i need but hopefully you found this review helpful if you've got any questions at all let me know in the comments below i'll do my best to answer them cheers for watching guys and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech [Music] chat
