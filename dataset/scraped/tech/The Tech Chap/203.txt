hey guys i'm tom of techchap and as you can see here it is the new rtx 3080 from nvidia is this worth buying so to help you out if you are thinking about upgrading i mainly want to see how the 1080 versus the 2080 versus the 3080 compare and you know have a look at that three generational difference to see what kind of improvements we're getting and obviously then if it's worth upgrading but as well as that i'm also including the tti and also the 2080 ti which was the previous flagship 1200 card just to give us a bit more context about how this new card performs but let's start high level and after averaging all my results how does the 3080 compare with the 1080 and the 2080 overall well starting with the 1080 and in rasterized meaning regular non-ray trace games because the gtx series don't really support it the 3080 is a massive 191 faster at 4k and if you're coming from a gtx 1080 and you play at 1440p which i think is pretty common you can expect almost two and a half times the performance and then finally at 1080p the 3080 is about twice as fast as the tasty but what about versus the rtx 2080 well in rasterized games we'll come to raytracing in a second the 3080 averaged 39 higher fps at 1080p and almost 60 more at 1440p and 4k sticking with 4k this time with rt on in supported games i saw a massive 89 boost but that's high level let's dive a little bit deeper and see how this performs in each game and where better to start than with the new pc melting champ it's not a case of but will it run crisis anymore but will it run flight simulator 2020 i mean fair enough this game looks amazing especially at 4k on ultra which is what i've tested here but importantly frame rate totally depends on the terrain and the weather conditions if you're up high away from the cities then i saw 60 fps at 4k with the 3080 but i also saw as low as 30 fps over cities i think if i can ask nvidia for one thing for christmas it would be a dlss patch for flight sim but to keep things fair i've been using the same landing challenge to test each card so the 3080 gives us a 56 improvement compared with the 2080 at 4k the performance difference versus the 2080 ti isn't anywhere near as significant but then remember the ti was a 1200 card whereas this is a 700 card the 2080 and the 1080 offer enough performance for an enjoyable experience at 1440p though and even the older 1080 is fine at 1080p on ultra though interestingly the 3080 actually doubles the t's performance at 1080p so how do you get 4k 60 with a 3080 at 4k in flight sim well i had to drop down from ultra to high end settings and also reduce the terrain detail to get me a solid 60 and to be honest image quality was still great alternatively dropping the internal render slider down to 80 had the same effect and meant i could stay using ultra settings okay next up rainbow six siege and this is kind of at the opposite end of the spectrum to flight sim because siege runs really well on pretty much all modern gpus so the 3080 is total overkill here and the numbers are just insane it is a whopping 65 percent faster at 4k versus the 2080 and 36 faster at 1440p although at 1080p we can see that both the 2080 ti and the 3080 are being bottlenecked by the cpu next up we have call of duty which i've tested in rasterized mode as while it does have a raytrace shadow mode it's kind of a performance hog to be honest i can't wait to play the upcoming black ops cold war though as that gets proper rt as well as dlss support anyway at 4k ultra settings the 3080 is 46 faster than the 2080 and over 150 faster than the 1080 but it's also a good deal faster than the 2080 ti and not just at 4k but the gtx 1080 is definitely starting to show its age here and once again we see that in purely rasterized games the 2080 wasn't really that much of an upgrade over the older 20 ti okay moving on to our first dlss supported title death stranding this uses the much improved dl says 2 technology and given this is only supported on 20 and now 30 series cards this is where we start to see them really pull away from the 10 series so turning on dlss renders the game at a lower resolution and then upscales it using an intelligent ai and nvidia's tensor cores which is less demanding than rendering natively it makes very little difference to image quality so if you have the option to use it and could use the extra frame rate and why wouldn't you then i don't see any reason not to use dlss 2. to be fair this isn't technically an apples to apples comparison with the 10 series but rather comparing the reality of how you'd probably use this card with dlc turn on so the 3080 is an absolute monster here especially at 4k and 1440 although it looks like it's bumping into cpu limits at 1080p so the 3080 is 50 faster than the 2080 at 4k both with dlss on and almost enough to max out my 4k 144hz monitor but how about wolfenstein youngblood which is another game with dlss but also ray tracing well to get some context let's look at regular rasterization first and like rainbow six siege the numbers here are kind of crazy so this is with dlss enabled but it's the 4k rt numbers that really stand out here and as you can see the 3080 delivers over two times the frame rate versus the 2080. it's even 45 faster than the 2080 ti that was a 1200 card okay next up control and this game has definitely grown on me over time and it's a good demonstration of both dlss and ray tracing but starting without ray tracing but with dlss on the 20 and 30 series the 3080 is 60 faster at 4k than the 2080 and 5 times faster than the gtx 1080 which is quite a lot but ray tracing does make quite a big visual difference if we turn it on and then use its high setting across all resolutions we see a pretty significant 40 drop in frame rate across the board with ray tracing not even the mighty 3080 can hit 4k 60 although it's still way faster than the 2018 just for fun though i also ran this on the 1080 annotated ti at 4k and well we're getting three and four fps piece so not exactly playable next up we have shadow of the tomb raider and here the 3080 is almost 70 percent faster at 4k than the 2018. 74 faster at 1440p and around a third quicker at 1080p it's also almost two and a half times faster than the 1080 at both 4k and 1440p so if it's 144hz 1440p you're playing at then only the 3080 will manage with maxed out settings and switching on rt also turns on dlss which explains why performance actually goes up compared with regular 4k and we're looking at about a 55 performance boost with the 3080 versus the 2080 but next up let's talk about minecraft rtx and to be honest ray traced minecraft sounded ridiculous to me until i saw the difference it makes which is pretty astonishing now there are only select rtx enabled levels for now but they look amazing and you do need a 20 or 30 series card you also really need rt with dlss turned on here because ray tracing alone brings even the 3080 to its knees so with dlss as well this is what nvidia have probably been waiting for me to say but the 3080 with ray tracing and dlss turned on is around twice as fast as the 2080 at all three resolutions the 2080 ti is still a very capable card here but the 3080 is still around 50 faster at each resolution so that was going to be all the games i was going to test for this video until a couple of days ago midway through this review and epic games released an update for fortnite which added support for rt so ray tracing and dlss and considering fortnite i think is a reasonably popular game i've definitely heard of it um i thought with the 3080 it'd be definitely worth a quick test at 4k with rt on the 3080 is a whopping 90 faster than the 2080 nearly twice as fast but having dlss on is an absolute must here but if you do want a solid 4k60 with rt then you'll definitely need a 3080 a bigger deal for me though is the inclusion of dlss which can be enabled without rt and setting it to performance mode on the 3080 this basically doubled my frame rate at 4k enough to max out my 144hz screen at 1440p and then 1080p it boosted my fps by 68 and 44 respectively and i'd expect similar percentage boosts on the 20 series as well as for thermals i never saw this card go above 74 degrees celsius in both my firmark and 3dmark times by loading tests which is actually 9 degrees cooler than the 2080 ti and three degrees cooler than the 2080s so not a major difference between these two but versus the ti uh this is significantly cooler and as we've seen also significantly faster which is pretty impressive and just shows how effective this new cooling solution is with the top and bottom fans this whole card is basically just one big heatsink and as we've seen it seems to work really well so bringing in the 2080 and as you can see uh while it's a similar width it is a good deal taller it's about 18 millimeters taller and it's also a little bit thicker so uh it's a big card and as soon as we start to see these uh third-party cards with big triple fan colors on top then uh yeah it's gonna be a three slot card we also get this new 12 pin power connector so you actually need to use this splitter which just plugs in there and then you've got your two a pin connectors on the end you always have this can of ugly braided black cable hanging off your graphics cards so aesthetically while i think this is a gorgeous looking card that takes away just a little bit from it i think as for ports we get three displayport 1.4 a's along with a single hdmi 2.1 which is actually pretty crucial because that means that you can now plug it into monitors and probably right now more likely tvs that support 2.1 and get full 4k 120 144 hertz even 8k at 60. so that hdmi port is probably what you're going to want to use in the future although right now for most people there are very very few 2.1 monitors out there you're probably going to want to stick with displayport so by now i probably bought you all to death so i won't go into too much detail about some of the bonus features you get with the new 30 series cards such as rtx io also uh their reflex technology i'll save those sort of extra features uh for a bit more of a deep dive video when i make my buying guide uh so when i get the 3017 also the 1390 i want to do a big sort of triple graphics card test to find out which one you should actually buy and i think in that video we'll dive a little deeper about what those new features mean as well but the takeaway from this video is that this guy the 3080 is a true generational leap forward in graphics performance and crucially at the same price point so versus the t this is about three times faster at 4k about two and a half times faster at 1440p and about twice as fast at 1080p which i think in anyone's book is a solid upgrade versus the 2080 this guy is about 58 faster at 4k in traditional rasterized games but a whopping 89 faster when playing games that support rt so i really hope you found this video useful and i guess the big questions going forward are how is this going to compare with amd's big navi the rx 6000 series which we'll see towards the end of october i can't wait to compare that and also of course nvidia 3070 3090 and maybe even the 3060 which they've rumored to uh be coming up with as well i can't wait to see if maybe they are you know better value options because i think for most people this is just overkill so i think maybe the 30-70 uh will be the one to go for which costs about 200 less thank you so much for watching guys and make sure you do hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out on my next video including my full rtx buying guide coming soon as well so make sure you stay tuned and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
