hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and pretty much my entire life right now revolves around making videos it's my hobby it's my passion it's my job and so if you're looking to finally kickstart your video or filmmaking hobby or indeed your career for that matter then you're going to need a solid video editing pc like this one so i've teamed up with the lovely people over at nvidia and pc specialists for this video because i want to figure out what components you actually need what difference they make to video editing and how much you actually need to spend for a good video editing pc particularly a pre-built one like this which means you don't have to go through the hassle of building yourself and crucially means you can get access to the latest graphics cards without paying through the nose or you know having to pre-order and wait for a million years so let's talk hardware and this rig from pc specialist forgoes the flashy rgb and well frankly any kind of aesthetic really in favor of giving us the best specs and performance for the money this is pretty much my recommended editing pc right now and i recreated it using their configurator and it comes in at around 300 pounds and that includes sales tax here in the uk which if you consider the gpu the graphics card retails for as much as 660 pounds on its own makes this a pretty tempting deal and it's also a good deal cheaper than laptops with similar performance but you guys know this your pc is only as fast as its slowest component you can spend a fortune on a gpu but if you don't match it with a good cpu and ram that's fast enough then you're gonna have bottlenecks and you're not gonna get that editing experience that you want so firstly let's talk about the graphics card and while you can edit with just the integrated graphics on the processor it'll be painfully slow so i would recommend an nvidia 30 series gpu it'll make a massive difference to scrubbing through the timeline any render speeds night and day difference so in this build i've gone with an rtx 3060 with 12 gigs of vram and being the latest 30 series gpus we get all the fancy latest tech from nvidia and actually despite being the most affordable in the 30 series desktop range the 12 gigs of fast gdr6 vram is ideal for 4k video editing in short the more vram you have the smoother the experience when you're scrubbing through lots of high-res clips but there are also other rtx benefits that i'll come back to so we've got our graphics card but then what about the processor because if you have a slow cpu then you're still going to get stuttering and rubbish performance on your edit and also as i say it is a balance about not bottlenecking one component over the other and generally when it comes to editing i would say core count the number of calls is slightly more important than their speeds and for 4k editing i reckon a six core 12 thread cpu should be your starting point and apps like premiere pro and davinci can utilize the extra virtual cores as well and so for my money the amd ryzen 5600x is one of the best value chips for editing and also gaming that you can get right now and importantly it won't bottleneck that rtx 3060. as for cooling given the budget i'd go with a tower style air cooler which is more than capable of dealing with the 5600x so gpu cpu and now let's talk about ram which is also very important when it comes to editing i've gone with 16 gigs of ddr4 in here which i think is probably the minimum for 4k editing however if you are filming at high bit rates or with long multi-layer projects then 32 gigs is probably the sweet spot i also think 3000 or 3200 megahertz ddr4 is fine the ryzen cpus can benefit from faster ram if you can stretch your budget for it and then there's storage and when you're working with large video files this is one area where fast ssd storage really pays for itself so in our editing rig here i've gone with a one terabyte pcie three ssd this is my main windows boot drive and there's plenty of space for small to medium projects and the speed of this will keep clips loading and preview times nice and snappy more expensive drives are faster and have larger capacities with pcie 4 ssds being the best for large video files although at this price point that's not really essential alternatively a slower satur m2 or two and a half inch ssd will get you more storage for a lot less money it is slower but you can get say a four terabyte drive for about 300 quid and it's a good halfway house between an expensive pcie ssd which is faster and a traditional hard drive which is by far the slowest although those are still worth considering if you just want tons of cheap backup storage now as for the motherboard this shouldn't really make that much difference to performance as long as it is compatible with all your other components and a good quality value oriented motherboard like this asus prime i've got in here should take all the main boxes for our rig i think realistically you'll want at least one pcie 3 or pci4 m2 storage slot also fast usbc and usb 3.1 gen2 ports are crucial for when you're plugging in fast external storage drives which i do a ton when i'm moving between edits on different devices also even basic motherboards have decent on-board sound these days and also if you're transferring clips over a network then make sure it does have gigabit ethernet as well now as for the power supply if you were building well a pre-built rig then i would suggest a partial or fully modular psu but since this is a pre-built front pc specialist i can save some money on a non-modular but still good quality corsair psu and then pc specialists can worry about the cable routing 650 watts is about the minimum i would go for although i think 750 watts would give me more headroom for future upgrades and finally i would probably add a wi-fi 6 network card i'd also go for probably a different case on this one with a mesh front for better airflow and let me even add a couple extra fans as well and also if you are transferring a lot of video onto external drives then it might be worth making sure your case has a front mounted usbc port and that is about it at a hair over 1400 quid all in with those extras again including rv80 here in the uk that's a pretty good system a good all-rounder if you will pardon the horrible cliche and it's not only a pretty capable gaming pc but is absolutely perfect for 4k video editing of course if you spend five ten grand you will get even better performance get yourself a rtx 3090 or something but realistically there are some level diminishing returns and this is all about the best value all-round system and so firing up one of my own 4k projects on here i use premiere pro mainly you can see how fast and smooth everything is sometimes when i have more complex sequences or some video effects i'll drop the preview res down to half and i do still use proxies when shooting 10 bit 422 4k footage on my sony a7s 3 but only because that's an absolute pick to work with and it even brings my top of the line 5 grand editing pc to his knees sometimes so don't be afraid to still use proxies they are a good option now to give you an idea of what difference investing in a good graphics card makes to your edit while in premiere pro exporting a five minute 4k 60 video took the rtx 3060 with its nvent encoder 8 minutes and 23 seconds at the same point in cpu only mode so not using the gpu it had only managed seven percent of the export which means with the 360 the export time was around 11 times faster the gap is smaller for 1080p projects but the gpu mode was still around five times faster to export and it was a similar story in davinci resolve we went from around 31 minutes to just over three minutes nearly 10 times faster with the gpu although remember you do need the paid version of davinci resolve to get that gpu acceleration now of course any graphics card would boost performance over using just the cpu but as well as the end link encoder and of course the power of the 3060 with its ampere architecture we do have some other benefits including nvidia studio which is all about giving creators and professionals the best experience so you can download the specific nvidia studio drivers which still incorporate the game body drivers but they're more widely tested with creative and professional apps whether it's the adobe suite davinci blender cinema 4d maya the list goes on some pcs and laptops also come with an nvidia studio certification which means that particular set of hardware has been tested and optimized to meet nvidia's standards and of course as well as the raw horsepower of the graphics card and these specific drivers another aspect is we also get specific gpu accelerated features that in many cases use ai to boost performance whether it's auto reframe in premiere pro which makes it incredibly easy to track a subject and also very handy when switching aspect ratios particularly going from say a 16x9 to a 916 social aspect then it keeps the subject in the middle you've also got scene detection for when you bring a regular video file into the timeline this analyzes it and then automatically cuts and tags each new scene into clips to make it easier and faster to extract the footage that you actually want it even puts each new clip into a new folder in your project and again the whole process is faster if you use nvidia gpu and that's just a couple of examples in premiere in davinci resolve the rtx and ai acceleration makes using speed warp a whole lot faster you've got a very cool ai masking feature in photoshop and lightroom where there's also a super resolution feature that actually upscales photos and all these kinds of features are faster when using the latest nvidia gpus and lastly don't forget that while we've been talking about video editing and creative apps we've also got a pretty capable gaming pc here with the rtx 3060 and the ryzen 5600x in halo infinite on high settings i'm getting 107 fps at 1440p and 135 fps at 1080p and in forza horizon 5 on ultra i get an impressive 73 fps at 1440 and 92 at 1080p and also in games that support it make sure you use dlss it is simply magic i say that every time but this is where the game renders at a lower resolution but then using nvidia's deep learning super sampling it up scales it back up to give us a big boost in frame rate with minimal if any visual impact it's basically free performance but i guess the last thing to think about is should you build your pc yourself or go for a pre-built like this well there are pros and cons to both building yourself is well for some people fun for others a absolute nightmare but it does mean that you can be more selective with the components and the brand of components that you use and in theory it should be cheaper building it yourself but as you guys know that's not particularly realistic at the moment with chip shortages and the prices of components particularly graphics cards so there is a strong argument to make for going with a pre-built like this not only are components in stock but you're not paying over the odds for them you actually take out that hassle of building it you also get technical assistance and a warranty on the whole system unlike the individual components if you build it yourself and then of course you could you know destroy it as you build it which i have done previously i think i've wrecked two or three motherboards and a couple of cpus in my time and particularly on pc specialists you can use their configurator to build your perfect pc or those configurable pre-built systems for creators with nvidia studio certification so hopefully that was useful and if you do have any questions at all about video editing or building these kind of pcs let me know in the comments below i'll do my best to answer and also leave links in the description to pc specialist and also nvidia's studio website thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
