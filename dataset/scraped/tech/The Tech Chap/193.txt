i think this may be the most unexciting color of smartphone i've seen in quite a while but we'll give it a go we'll see what it looks like as i unbox the new pixel 5 5g this actually turned up about half an hour ago but i didn't want to waste any time in bringing you this unboxing and quick hands-on full review and comparisons and all that good stuff will follow so make sure you are subscribed but let's get straight into this and see what we're getting with the new pixel 5 5g which has actually sold out online all the pre-orders are gone so i'm pretty happy that google sent me this review sample so we've got the phone this is in sorter sage which i will reserve judgment for for the moment but let's come back to that in just a second and elsewhere in the box let's have a little look got some uh paperwork from google there very exciting uh the charger this is still an 18 watt charger along with a usb c to usb c cable and a little usba to usbc adapter if you want to transfer your files from an old device and here it is the pixel 5 5g which you can see looks very similar to the pixel 4a and of course also the new pixel 4a 5g which i also have here and i'll be reviewing in a separate video but the first thing you'll notice is it's a small phone this is not your typical flagship two-handed device which you can barely fit in your pocket this is actually just a six inch screen which by today's standards is pretty small but i have to say i really do like this compact size and then on the back you'll notice we have this new color which google is calling sorter sage the other option is just black which i think if i'm honest is probably the one i would go for it has this kind of recycled cardboard feel and aesthetic to it it's actually an aluminium body but we've got this bio resin on top which actually helps with the wireless charging and also the reverse while it's charging so you'll now be able to top up other devices other phones or maybe even your fancy new pixel buds which you can see have not even unwrapped yet but this will now charge wirelessly from the phone but what do you think of this new color sort of sage would you pick this or just black let me know in the comments below so i say air quotes flagship because this is the pixel 5 and obviously this is the once a year big new phone from google but not this time because google i think have been very smart or maybe just because they realized no one was really buying the pixel 4 and the 4xl but everyone was buying the 3a and i think also the 4a is doing pretty well but offering the combination of an incredible camera with you know really slick stock android software obviously this runs android 11 out of the box uh but for a more affordable price tag that maybe would make the flagship pixel sell a little bit better or you know at all so this is actually just 600 pounds which is 70 less than last year's pixel 4 and actually a whopping 220 less than last year's 4xl and speaking of which there is no 5xl or at least not yet this is the only pixel 5 phone on offer so if you do want a bigger screen pixel then well you're out of luck so to give you some context the new pixel 5 costs 600 pounds whereas the new pixel a5g costs 500 pounds so there's a hundred pound difference there and then imagine i have the pixel 4a the standard one here that costs 350. so 350 500 600. so let's run through the specs why is this so cheap well the main compromise is the processor rather than the flagship snapdragon 865 we actually get a snapdragon 765 which of course is 5g as it says quite literally on the 10. so the 765 obviously isn't quite as powerful as the top end chips but of course along with stock android 11 here everything still feels super fast and responsive which is exactly what you want from a pixel phone so as i mentioned six inch screen it is still a 90 hertz refresh rate and actually if we jump into the display settings where is it there we go go to advanced and smooth display so you can't actually change anything other than just turning it off but you can see it does switch between 90 to 60 hertz depending on what you're looking at so it's 90 hertz and it is an oled screen so watching videos and movies looks great on this and also compared to the pixel 4 from last year in the 4xl the bezels are much smaller it's very very similar list to the 4a if i turn it up obviously speaking in japanese i can't understand a word of it but we do kind of have stereo speakers this one at the bottom is much louder but it also seems like we have an under screen speaker here because there's no obvious grille and it's certainly not as loud coming from this side so you're not getting a fully even stereo effect but it is certainly better than just a single speaker firing out the bottom we also get gorilla glass 6 on the front we get ip68 water resistance and to say being such a relatively small phone it weighs just 151 grams and it's just 8 millimeters thick so if you are a fan of one-handed used phones then i think you're gonna love this we also get this rear fingerprint reader rather than in screen one which quite honestly i'm okay with and i think given the size of the phone when you pick it up your index finger kind of rests there anyways and i think this will be more reliable than just a basic optical reader here this is kind of silly i've got this obviously front camera here i've got another one above me and i like this plan being here for the front shot but then the vertical shot's a bit boring so i like to bring that in just for a bit of color so between the shots between my takes i keep moving this plant back and forth there must be an easier way anyway back to the pixel and along with the snapdragon 765 we also get eight gigs of ram and 128 storage it's just the one sku there's no other storage or ram options now as you guys know last year's pixel 4 and 4 xl one of the biggest criticisms uh what i had at least was with the battery life out of the box it was pretty bad actually credit where credit's due it did improve over time i went from having like 20 of my battery left at the end of the day to about 35 after a month or so so you know the ai machine learning stuff that happens behind the scenes it did improve the battery life for me and i'm sure we'll see the same with the pixel 5 but importantly they have put in a bigger battery we've got a 4080 milliamp hour battery which is up from the 3700 million power battery on last year's 4xl that was the bigger version and yet this still has a bigger battery and of course that was also quad hd and 90 hertz so bigger battery and also because this is full hd plus rather than quad hd plus i think also along with probably some software optimizations i'm expecting this to be actually pretty decent for battery life although of course that's something i'll test properly for my full review and finally we have the camera which i think for me well i think most people is the biggest reason to buy a pixel phone aside from maybe just the stock android software now the big addition this year is the fact that we get an ultra wide lens you can see it's zooming out to 0.6 times so they've actually swapped having the telephoto lens from the pixel 4 to the ultra wide on the pixel 5 which is a bit of a shame that we can't have all three like we do on a lot of phones but i think most people would agree that the ultrawide is more important is more useful and actually when i tested the 4a the digital zoom is actually very impressive it's got one of the best sort of ai hybrid zooms out there so even though it hasn't got a dedicated telephoto lens is suddenly better than most phones when it comes to a digital zoom but aside from the new ultrawide the hardware itself is pretty much identical uh to the pixel 4. we've still got a 12 megapixel f 1.7 main lens of course we now have this new 16 megapixel f 2.2 video still tops out at 4k 60 although the front camera here still only shoots like 1080p 30 which is a bit disappointing 4k 30 would have been nice and this is an 8 megapixel f 2.0 selfie camera so of course this is just an unboxing video and like the battery life i'll also be testing the camera properly uh for my full review but i don't expect it to be that much better really at all than say the pixel 4a although of course we do have the benefit of that ultra wide lens so all together then we've got smaller bezels this new solder sage color of course this now supports 5g we've got the new snapdragon 765 chip which while newer is probably technically a step down from even the pixel 4's 855 although i have to run some tests and benchmarks myself to see how they compare android 11 out of the box although of course you can always upgrade your current pixel phone right now to android 11 and i think probably most importantly a bigger battery that 4080 milliamp hours sell but of course being 600 pounds there are a few compromises which makes this a bit more sort of upper mid-range than proper flagship for example as i say there's only 128 gigs of storage uh you can't get 256 or anything else it's also ufs 2.1 not ufs3 or 3.1 so the storage is also a little bit slower there's no wi-fi six there's no bluetooth 5.1 and there's still no super fast charging or anything it's still 18 watts but first impressions honestly i love this thing i love the size i love android 11 the camera is great and finally have that ultrawide lens and the fact that they have put some effort into improving the battery life i think is going to really pay off this is kind of like the ultimate pixel phone and it doesn't cost an absolute fortune which i think is probably the best thing they've done in a long time i do kind of wish there were more color options i'm still not a fan of this sort of sage and also maybe an xl 5xl would have been good to see even if it was 100 pounds more but just to have a bigger screen size option and perhaps a little bit more storage that would have been nice but what do you reckon do you think google's made one too many compromises with this and do you think the competition's got stronger and maybe the pixel 5 will struggle to stand out let me know what you think in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and make sure you have hit that subscribe button and stay tuned because next week i'll have my galaxy s20 fe versus oneplus 8t versus pixel 5 video which i can't wait to show you that's going to be a good one so stay tuned for that and i'll see you guys next time right here on
