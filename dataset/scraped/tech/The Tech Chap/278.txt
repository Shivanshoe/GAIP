hey guys Anton the tech chap and I want to show you around the new Samsung Galaxy Z flip or should I say Zed flip here in the UK and here it is in all its flipping glory but what do you think what are your first thoughts for me well actually ask my partner Sarah what that little handheld think that women keep their powder makeup in the thing with a mirror apparently it's a makeup compact and I can't really unsee it now on a serious note though I'm actually a lot more impressed by the flip in person that I thought I would be the six point seven inch folding screen is actually made of glass rather than plastic which we get on pretty much every other folding device out there and you can barely barely see the crease it's much less noticeable than the Galaxy fold we do still get a slightly protruding plastic bezel around the edge of the phone and Samsung are now using a new fiber shield to prevent dirt and debris getting in around the hinge apparently leave tested the hinge for 200,000 flips but we'll have to wait and see about the long-term durability I have to say though it does feel well-made and not too fragile Plus given what they've learned from the fold I'm not too worried so the flip comes in three colors mirror purple mirror black and in some markets mirrored gold I actually really like the purple one but it's an absolute fingerprint magnet I've never whipped out my cleaning cloth this may times been filming a video just quickly guys a big thank you to audible for sponsoring this video I team up with audible a lot because I actually listen to a lot of audiobooks taking the train to London or flying to events around the world putting my headphones in counseling out the outside world and just enjoying a good book it's so nice from audio dramas like locking key which I'm listening to at the moment or checking out an audible original podcast like the dark web so get involved and start listening with a thirty-day audible trial you can choose one audiobook and two audible originals absolutely free plus you get one free audiobook credit every month so visit audible.com slash tech chap or text tech chap to five hundred five hundred and Gabe audible or try so when the flip is closed it's actually surprisingly chunky it's even thicker than the galaxy fold but the advantage is it's much shorter it'll easily fit in your palm to be honest though I'm not entirely sure how useful that is I mean don't read into this next sentence too much but I'd rather have something long and slim in my pocket than short and fat that sticks out you know what I mean I suppose if it was any more rectangular or taller been folded it would create such a massively tall screen when opened it would just be too uncomfortable to use once unfolded or flipped open we get a super tall 22 by 9 screen and you know what unlike the Galaxy fold you actually forget all about the fold and just use it like a regular albeit quite tall phone you really don't notice the crease it's comfortable or hold and the tall screen is great for browsing through socials websites and of course having two apps side by side in fact there's actually three ways of using this open shirt and in Flex mode when closed we get a tiny one point one inch cover screen that shows you the time messages some app notifications they're really cool bit though is you can actually use it as a tiny viewfinder either for taking selfies or for your friends to see how they look when you take their picture I think it's a great idea but I really wish it was just a bit bigger you may end up with a lot of squinting eyes and your photos as people try to see themselves in it then you can open it up and use it in Flex mode so the hinge is more like a laptop than say the galaxy fold and that you can actually have it open at different angles so it becomes its own little pop socket stand and comes in handy for everything from hands-free photos and videos to video calls and using apps in split-screen for example in YouTube you can see when I go from fully open to Flex mode it puts the video on the top screen and in the comments and other recommended videos on the bottom I really like that although apps will need to be optimized for this so don't expect everything to work this seamlessly out of the box then you can use it like a regular phone when it's fully unfledged despite its height it's actually pretty usable one-handed well with a bit of finger gymnastics sometimes but thanks to Android 10 and Samsung's 1 UI 2 it's a lot easier to use for example we get to swipe in from the edge to go bag gestures so you don't always have to keep your thumb at the bottom of the phone there's also a dedicated one-handed mode that shrinks the screen and of course you can always use it in landscape mode two-handed where it feels more like a Nintendo switch so I really do think the flip is the best example of a folding phone we've seen so far and I think that's mainly because of the glass screen and the refined hinge but the fact is you are making a lot of compromises to get this the main one is the price considering the specs you're definitely paying a premium for this the flip will set you back a cool 1,300 pounds or $1,400 which is the same price than galaxy s 20 ultra but you're getting a lot less for your money for example the flip uses last year's snapdragon 855 chip there's no 120 Hertz screen it's full HD plus rather than quad HD plus there's no 5g the 3300 million power battery is relatively tiny and I'm a little bit worried about how long it's gonna last it only supports 15 watt charging and we're gonna get two cameras on the back a main and ultra wide lens which is fine I mean I think they're the most important lenses but again compared to any of the s 20s especially these similarly priced ultra the flip misses out on a log there's also only one model of the flip with eight gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage which is financially more than the base storage of the s20 ultra which is a bit strange but there's no microSD or any bigger storage option on the flip side sorry I had to do that at least once we do get stereo AKG tuned speakers wireless charging the latest software and the fact that you know this is a flippin phone it hasn't been this satisfying to hang up a call in about 15 years back to the cameras for a second and it's a similar setup to the base s 20 will be it without a telephoto lens we get new 12 megapixel main and ultra wide lenses with the improved sensors that we get on the s20 along with new features like single take and night hyperlapse although since we're using last year's processor there's no 8k video and I'll have to test camera quality in the real world to see if there's any difference between the S 20 and the flip as for selfies again like the s 20 there's a single 10 megapixel hole-punch camera on the front so then first impressions well it is expensive and you are missing out on a bunch of features compared to the s20 ultra for the same money and I am kind of worried about battery life however with all that said I still really like this thing I love innovation it's just something different I mean the galaxy fold cost about two grand last year and I'm sure we'll see a fold too later this year as well this is a lot cheaper and a much better implementation of a falling screen it's also definitely targeted at a younger more stylish audience you'll definitely turn a few heads getting this out on the tube or in a cafe and I think for a lot of people that's kind of the point oh and compared to the Motorola RAZR I think this is lightyears ahead in terms of design specs and overall quality make sure you are subscribed though for my full review coming soon and let me know what you think of the flip in the comments below would you buy one or is it just an expensive gimmick again a big thank you to audible for sponsoring this video check out there awesome range of audio books
