hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and i've had the new xbox series x for a little over a month now and the series s for a couple of weeks it's all been pre-release software and frustratingly i've only had a handful of anything like next-gen gaming experiences there's loads more games coming out soon i'll talk more about those in my upcoming xbox vs playstation video but despite my early adopter restrictions i think these are genuine worthwhile upgrades and i'll tell you why in just a second but first i want to start with why i actually wouldn't recommend the series s it is a good idea in theory and for some people this will make more sense i mean for 250 pounds or 300 this is actually 200 less than the series x which is pretty significant and it's really aimed at the majority of gamers who still aren't playing in 4k you can select up to 4k 120 if your tv supports it but most games on the series s will cap at 1440p some may upscale higher some maybe 1080p whereas the series x with its extra graphical horsepower because largely the hardware between these two are the same they've got the same fast ssds the same processor it's really just the graphics that's different but with a series x you have that extra horsepower to play at 4k so you may well be thinking well i'm not that bothered about 4k anyway i haven't got a 4k tv so actually for me this makes more sense however with the series s you only get half the storage of the series x just five 12 gigs and actually only 364 of that is actually usable compared to 802 gigabytes of usable storage on the series x and considering the new call of duty black ops will be at least 100 gigs by itself you'll only be able to have a few games installed at the same time now that's not a massive deal and you can always buy the official seagate expansion card which gives you an extra terabyte of storage although this actually costs almost as much as the series s by itself more importantly though is that unlike the series x which as you can see here has this 4k disk drive the series s just like the ps5 digital edition is well digital only there's no disk drive at all on here which of course helps microsoft save money means this can be a little bit cheaper but it does mean you're limited to buying only digital versions of games so you'll always have to pay full microsoft store prices unless you wait a while and it comes out on game pass or a deal but you won't be able to buy and sell or pick up second hand versions of games i mean just off the top of my head i know that once i finish assassin's creed valhalla or say watch dogs legion i'm not even sure i'm gonna be able to finish that one it would be so helpful if i could then put them on ebay or take it to my game store and trade it in but that's just something you simply can't do if you have to buy the digital version of it and finally while you may not have a fancy 4k tv right now you're probably gonna have your new xbox for the best part of the next five years so eventually you'll be able to take full advantage of this so it's just my own personal buying advice but if you can spend that extra 200 pounds or so i would recommend the series x you get the 4k disk drive so you can buy and sell games almost dropped it there you get double the storage and the more powerful graphics so you'll have the best performance in games and if and when you do upgrade to a 4k tv then you'll be able to get the most out of this this is definitely not the best way of holding these consoles but what do you think which one would you go for this series s or the x let me know in the comments now the controller itself isn't really that much of an upgrade this year the triggers are slightly redesigned there's a new more grippy texture on the back and there's a new share button but it's not the same big change as we get on the ps5 dual sense controller but the good news is that new xbox controllers will also work with older consoles and even better your old xbox controllers will work with the new consoles they're both interoperable interruptable and once they were in they both work with both consoles so that means if you are playing with a partner or you're doing lots of couch gaming you're not gonna have to buy a whole bunch of new controllers design wise the series s is definitely a lot smaller and i do like the white i kind of wish we had the choice of black or white on the series x but you can use both standing up or on their side whichever works better in your setup and they're also both almost completely silent coming from my category 5 hurricane that is the ps4 pro it's refreshingly quiet now if you do have a fancy 4k tv that supports hdmi 2.1 there is really only a handful of them mainly high-end 2019 and 2020 models but if you do have one then make sure you use the bundled 2.1 cable that you get in the box this is the only way that you'll have the option to select 4k at 120 in the xbox menu although whether you actually get that in games there's a different question which we'll come out to in a second so let's get back to the games and with any new generation of consoles we're gonna have a period of transition right now there's very few truly next-gen games that will just blow your socks off because unless it's a next-gen exclusive they still have to run on the current xbox one and one x it's easy to get carried away with next-gen hype but the reality is it can still be a real step up much faster load times better graphics higher frame rates if you have a tv that supports it you can play in super smooth 120fps mode which is pretty cool because until now anything above 60 has been only possible on pc well 4k60 is the aim but most games use dynamic resolutions so again as digital foundry tested in gears 5 it can actually fluctuate between 4k and 1080p on the series x and as low as 1440p and 720p on the series s so it'll vary between games but we're still not seeing a consistent 4k60 although it's not too far off i mean if you consider that you'd need at least a rtx 3070 to get anything like that kind of 4k 60 performance on a pc which actually coincidentally i actually do have running in that pc behind me but that by itself costs the exact same amount as the series x one graphics card or an entire console so there's absolutely no doubt that these consoles do offer incredible value for money but right now for me at least i think the biggest reason to upgrade and buy the series x or the s if you prefer is how it makes me want to play all my current gen games again both consoles have the same super fast ssd storage so load times are much much faster in my tests the series x shaves off almost two minutes from my metro extra save and final fantasy xv loaded a full minute faster even respawning or restarting chapters is quicker plus we're getting the full 12 teraflops of power on the series x so all that extra horsepower helps to boost or at least stabilize the frame rate in all your old games and with extras like smart hdr which does a pretty good job of giving us high dynamic range in games that were never optimized for it and quick resume so in just a matter of seconds you can switch between games even without a ton of next-gen or even cross-game games to get that excited about just yet it really does make me want to fire up a bit of red dead redemption 2 again or give metro another go and the crazy thing is all these xbox one and even xbox 360 games haven't had any like development or optimization it just works better so then when you do have games and developers that put some time into optimizing the games for next gen the upgrades are even better with the likes of gears 5 destiny 2 rainbow six siege forza horizon 4 fortnite and no man's sky next generation to name just a few and we're seeing 4k 60 across the board on the series x better graphics and physics a higher player cap in multiplayer in some games and of course much better load times in no man's sky next generation they're promising 5 to 10 times faster loading than before the series s will see similar boosts but sometimes at lower resolutions for example fortnite is 4k60 on the x but 1080p 60 on the s and i think going forward we're going to see a lot more of these sort of older games being optimized for the new consoles not quite a remaster but just you know an enhancement and so far they've almost all been free which is pretty cool and then finally we have new actual cross gen games like watch dogs dirt 5 black ops assassins creed fifa and madden 21. games that are coming to both current and new consoles but have been properly enhanced and have their own dedicated next-gen series x or s version so again we're looking at 4k 60 or even 120 fps options better graphics and in some cases even ray tracing plus they all take advantage of the crazy fast ssd my point is that even though it may be a good six months or a year before we start to see some proper next-gen games that really tap into the full performance of these consoles even from day one it's the best way to play all your old games we're seeing a bunch of games get free upgrades with better performance and graphics and pretty much every new game coming out will look and play better on the new consoles as for the definitely not controversial question at all about xbox versus ps5 well we'll be doing a full video comparing the two but really as you guys i'm sure would agree it all comes down to the games what i would say though is that on xbox at least all their exclusive titles will also be coming to pc so if you actually already have a gaming pc it may be worth going for a ps5 so you have access to the broadest range of games now just a couple of quick points to end this review and i've seen lots of people talking about how they're a bit disappointed that not more games are offering 120 fps and you know is even next gen if we're just getting 4k 60s still well to that i would say wait a little bit this is obviously just the first wave of launch games i think we'll see better optimized games coming soon and also don't forget that unless you have a fancy new tv with hdmi 2.1 that supports 120 or even a pc monitor that's high refresh like 120 144 hertz then you simply won't be able to take advantage of 120 anyway and speaking of monitors both the series x and the s support 60 or 120 at 4k 1440p and 1080p so honestly i wouldn't worry too much about waiting for a new hdmi 2.1 monitor that gives you full 4k 120 support no game really offers that anyway so i think your best bet if you are thinking about using a pc monitor with the new console is to probably go for a 1440p high refresh 120hz one the current hdmi 2 will support that and there's loads of options out there that don't cost a fortune so i've got loads more xbox and ps5 videos coming soon where i'll be testing more next-gen games so make sure you have subscribed and stay tuned for that but what's your plan xbox series s series x or ps5 or none of the above and just wait and see what happens and maybe you'll get a discount next year when there's actually some proper next-gen games out let me know in the comments below so hope you found this video helpful thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time right here on the tech [Music] chat
