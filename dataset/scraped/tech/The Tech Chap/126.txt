hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is the new xiaomi me 11 lite 4g this is the entry level aka the cheapest model of the 11 series and i'm going to run you through everything you need to know and if you enjoyed the video a like and subscribe would be lovely so right now all the fuss is over the flagship me 11 ultra but the light is still worth a look especially if you're on a budget inside we have a clear case a 3.5 mil adapter so i presume no headphone jack and we're also getting a usbc cable and a 33 watt fast charger now the problem is for me at least is that this isn't coming to the uk this 4g mi 11 light is having a global launch but not here in fact we're getting a me11 light 5g which obviously is 5g and also comes with a snapdragon 780 so it's a little bit more powerful than this so with the mi 11 lite we're getting a 6.55 inch amoled full hd plus screen with a smoother 90 hertz refresh rate which is great to see inside we get snapdragon g chip nothing particularly special there but capable enough along with 608 gigs of ram and 128 storage around the back there's a 64 megapixel triple camera setup uh with a main ultra wide and a tele macro lens with a 16 megapixel selfie camera we're also getting stereo speakers a side fingerprint reader and a dual 4g sim card slot although sadly no micro sd support or a headphone jack but with all that said the highlight for me with the mi 11 lite has to be the design i'll tell you what though the first time you picked this up you really are a little bit blown away by just how thin and light this is it weighs 159 grams and it's just 6.8 millimeters thick or should i say thin it's incredible you really do have to pick this up for yourself to get a proper idea of how it feels in your hand i know the cliche is it feels good in the hand but it really really does and actually even putting in your pocket you just don't notice it it's so incredibly thin and light although you do notice all the smudges and fingerprints on this mirror glass back particularly in this black model but it looks pretty smart it's quite a subtle design but yeah bring a microfiber cloth with you or put a case on it as for the software we get xiaomi's miui version 12 on top of android 11 and it's nice to use and with the faster 90 hertz refresh rate everything feels really responsive my only complaints really are the hefty amount of bloatware that we get pre-installed as for performance well it's fine the snapdragon 732g is about a year old now and actually in my geekbench five tests it's neck and neck with the even lower tier 720 g in the latest realme 8 pro and so i think considering we're getting the snapdragon 780 in the mi 11 5g and also phones like the poco f3 get the brand new snapdragon 870 it's a bit of a shame we're stuck with the older chip in here however it is also important not to get too hung up on the specs and the different processors because this easily handles call of duty mobile with high settings and pretty much any game or app i threw at it i'm also amazed that they've managed to cram in a 4250 milliamp hour battery into this body there must be a little bit of magic there i think you'll easily get a full day of use out of this plus you can top it up with the fast 33 watt charger but let's talk about this camera and again like the battery i do need a bit more time with this uh to get a good idea of how it performs in all conditions but first impressions look good the 64 megapixel main camera is pixel bend four into one so we get 12 megapixel photos although you can shoot in the full resolution if you want then we have an 8 megapixel ultra wide and a 5 megapixel tele macro for close-up shots so this really is just a very quick look at the mi 11 lite 4g because didn't send me any information about this at all and what it did send me was for the 5g model which isn't that helpful because it gets a different processor and isn't exactly the same phone so i've had to figure most of this out for myself just by using the phone and so i do apologize if i've made any mistakes i will of course pin a comment with any updates or changes downsides well there's no headphone jack or micro sd card support that snapdragon chip is also looking a little bit long in the snapdragon tooth we're also getting some adverts and bloatware on the phone although most of those can just be hidden in a folder or removed and finally there is of course a lot of competition even from xiaomi themselves so uh it will be interesting how this stands out against those but for now let me know what you think of this in the comments below for now i only have euro pricing but it'll start from 299. thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
