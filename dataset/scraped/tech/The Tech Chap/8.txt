the macbook air is ridiculously popular and for good reason it's basically the world's default laptop and now here i am at apple park having a play with the brand new 2022 macbook air and it is a huge upgrade we get apple's new m2 chip a bigger and brighter screen a 1080p webcam it's thinner it's lighter we have mag safe now plus faster charging better speakers more and faster ram and obviously most importantly it comes in four colors including a very snazzy new starlight and midnight which is kind of like a matte black with an ever so slight blue tint to it i must admit i'm kind of torn between them i'm not sure which i prefer which one would you go for now one downside of the new air is it is 200 or 250 pounds more expensive than the current m1 air which you can still buy and of course that's also before you upgrade your ram or storage however on the flip side if you were thinking about buying a macbook pro 14 while this won't be quite as powerful and we'll have to wait until i can get this back in the studio to properly compare it and also we don't get that 120 hertz promotion considering the air is 800 cheaper it's going to be a much better option for most of us now the first thing i noticed is that we've lost that familiar macbook air tapered design it looks very much like the new pro 14 and 16 and actually one slight issue is it can make it a little bit tricky to pick up sometimes but overall apple says it's actually 20 smaller in volume than the current air and it's also 50 grams lighter and a little bit thinner overall and that's particularly impressive considering we also have a bigger screen it's now 13.6 inches up from 13.3 although that's mainly down to the much thinner bezels and so yes like the pros we have that notch it is a compromise of the design but the trade-off is we get an incredible webcam the resolution's been bumped up to 1080p and with the m2's improved isp or image signal processor we get even better video quality and especially in low light now i'm here at the wwdc conference and i actually brought my current m1 air and also my pro 16 to the event and initially i started making my notes on the air but because we were outside it was a little bit tricky to see the screen so i switched to my pro 16 which is brighter so i'm really happy to see that they've actually bumped the brightness of the new air from 400 to 500 nits which makes it a lot easier to use outdoors it is still the same resolution though which is roughly halfway between full hd and 4k which i think is a good balance and it is also still 60 hertz there is no pro motion here but it is a touch bigger it's brighter and actually more color accurate so it's still a pretty big upgrade magsafe also comes to the air now which frees up the other two usb thunderbolt 4 ports as you don't have to use that for charging anymore now i did ask apple and sadly the new air still can only output to one external display that is something that you'll need to go to a pro model for but magsafe does also bring with a faster charging option now by default you get a 30 watt charger but for 20 dollars more or it's free if you go for a higher spec you can get the new dual usb 35 watt charger it charges the air in the same time but you can plug in your phone or your air pods or whatever else to top up just from the one plug now personally i think i would go for the new 67 watt option but it doesn't have the two extra usbs unfortunately basically because this is the same charger already available for the pros now the keyboard and touchpad haven't really changed much although the function row is now full size whereas on the older air the keys were a little bit smaller we do also now get quad speakers that's two tweeters and two offers and while i haven't yet been able to test the sound side by side if the new air is anything like the pros it's gonna sound incredible so far so good then but what i'm most excited about is this new m2 chip the macbook air along with the also refreshed macbook pro 13 are the first two devices to come equipped with the m2 now speaking of the pro 13 here they are side by side the new air and the new pro 13 it's virtually identical to the outgoing model on the outside it even still has a touch bar and along with the chunkier bezels it is starting to look a bit dated and it has an active cooling fan the macbook air is still a fanless design so under sustained longer loads like gaming or if you're rendering the pro 13 will be a bit more powerful but i'm keen to test that in practice and see if there's really that much difference but that does also mean the air is completely silent no matter what you're doing so what does the m2 bring to the table well battery life remains the same apple say you can get up to 18 hours of video playback and you know what that's fine it's already very good instead we are getting a nice boost in performance the m2 has an 18 faster cpu a 35 faster gpu at full power and also a 40 faster neural engine compared to the m1 so it's not quite the radical difference we saw in the transition from intel to the m1 but it is still a welcome upgrade and together with up to 24 gigabytes of unified memory which also now has higher bandwidth and also together with a new faster media engine that makes it a much more capable video editing laptop i'm really keen to see if anyone actually needs to shell out for a macbook pro this might be all you need of course all macbooks will be getting the new mac os ventura update when it comes out later in the year and i will be making a separate video on the new os upgrades as well so make sure you stay tuned for that but it wasn't running yet on these particular laptops so for twelve hundred dollars or slightly annoyingly twelve hundred fifty pounds it is about twenty percent more expensive student and teachers get 100 off that but it's still a lot of money and also when you go for a higher spec which i would recommend i think 16 gigs of ram and 512 storage is the sweet spot it is quite pricey i say that because i have found on my old air with 8 gigs of ram it often runs out of memory and i have to close applications so it does depend how you use your laptop but i would suggest going for 16. however one thing i can say about apple products is that they are very well supported in terms of software they last a long time and also they retain their value quite well for trade-ins or selling it down the road so considering you can't upgrade any of the components yourself if you can i would pay the extra upfront to get the better spec but also maybe hold off until as tech reviewers can properly test it and compare it to the old air the pro 13 and also the pro 14 and also the windows competition like the zenbook 13s oled and the dell xps 13 plus but first impressions are very positive it is a big overhaul inside and out but what do you think are you tempted to buy one when it comes out in july or not convinced let me know in the comments below and also if you have any questions so that was fun i am genuinely very excited for the new macbook air the colours are great it's much faster much much nicer screen with that thinner bezel which it didn't need and as tim cook is being swamped over there i think people are gonna be swamping into apple stores to buy the new macbook air as well but stay tuned full review coming very soon and if you've got any questions at all let me know in the comments below now i'm going to try and get a selfie with him without being too annoying
