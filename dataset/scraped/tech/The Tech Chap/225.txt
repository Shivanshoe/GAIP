hey guys I'm summer tech job and this is the new Dell XPS 17 and also the XPS 15 here's one I made earlier so you may have seen my comparison with the MacBook Pro 16 if not definitely give that watch after this but I wanted to give the 17 here the proper full review treatment as well as compared to the XPS 15 as I know a lot of you guys myself included are wondering which is better so just like the MacBook Pro video I've bought both of these myself these are proper retail samples Harley because Dell take forever to offer me XPS review samples and I want to bring you guys these videos before you may actually want to go out and buy them to give you a better idea but also I wanted to match the specs as closely as possible to see if the upgrade to the 2060 max Q or the 8 core processor or you know the new vapor chamber cooling system makes that much of a difference so if you do appreciate that you do want to see more from me don't forget to hit that subscribe button a little like icon ding the bell all those youtuber cliches that we all hate but you know it does make a difference so that would be awesome so let's get the specs out of the way first in the US it starts from just fourteen hundred dollars although that is with the full HD plus screen integrated your HD graphics and a smaller fifty six hour battery then for 1900 you get the i7 a much bigger 97 watt hour battery and the GTX 1650 ti graphics card however if you really want to get the most out of the XPS 17 then you're gonna need to pay a thousand dollars more to get this guy and that gets you the r-tx 2060 max q graphics the 4k plus touchscreen alongside 16 gigs of ram and one terabyte of storage 16 gigs around does seem pretty stingy for that kind of money although you can spec it with a 2 or even 6400 I think what I recommend is actually upgrading yourself both the RAM and the 2 m2 SSD slots are upgradable so if you want to go for a lower spec and then upgrade it later that's always an option now vs. the XPS 15 the entry-level model are the 17 with the same specs is actually only $100 more but then in the top-end like this one here it's $800 more compared to a similarly high-end XPS 15 but let's put money to one side for a moment and I'm sure you'll agree these are both stunning looking laptops this really is just the bigger brother of the XPS 15 I think Dells refresh of the XPS my lab this year is pretty much one of the biggest I've seen in about four years I mean this profit edge to edge screen they've got rid of the bottom bezel the tall a sixteen by ten aspect ratio which I'm a huge fan of as well as the bigger trackpad richer sounding speakers the fact that we get both the fingerprint reader and face unlocking as well as the shift to USB see only and of course the upgrades on the inside with Intel 10th gen processors and faster 1650 Ti all 2016 max Q graphics cards so the 2020 XPS laptops are genuinely a big upgrade but the question is is bigger always better well they both fit in my pretty standard North Face backpack although we need a tighter squeeze for the 17 and I think with a sleeve or a case I don't think it would quite fit in the laptop compartment the 17 is also a fair bit heavier comparing the two with the bigger batteries and the touchscreen is the 17 is two and a half kilograms or five and a half pounds so I think for me as much as I do love the big screen on this and also the performance which we'll get to in a second the portability of the XPS 15 is more important to me I mean I already have a desktop PC at home and so this is primarily my work laptop for when I'm traveling or go into tech shows and you know making videos on the road but then again if this is a proper desktop replacement for you and it's just gonna set in your desk at home world the office all day long then you may as well go for the bigger screen as you would expect though the 17 and the 15 have a lot in common the keyboard and the touch pad are exactly the same which is no bad thing at all I love using them and that massive precision touchpad is incredibly smooth and responsive the only difference really is we get this widest speaker grille flanking the keyboard on the 17 now you may have seen in my micro comparison video the issue I was having with the 17 speaker the good news is I have managed to fix it by uninstalling the realtek audio drivers and then going on to Dells website and downloading the latest ones again that did fix it but it's not something you should really have to do for a nearly three grand laptop hey guys I'm a tech job and I've got two of the very best laptops you can buy basically I've got a new MacBook Pro 16 with the brand new you can buy basically I've got a new MacBook Pro 16 with the brand new 5600 M graphics card that's both big improvements over the last year but still not quite up to the standard of the MacBook Pro 16 when you turn the volume above say 80% it does start to distort on both so speed quality is good but not great as for the webcam well we get 720p video from the little cameras on the top there's also at least it's not looking on your nose but as you can see the quality isn't fantastic it's noisy it scared doc it's not the sharpest so yeah not ideal and actually there's the same camera same quality between both the xpr-50 and the 17 so not great but it'll do also like the MacBook Dells gone full USB see here we get four thought about threes and an SD card reader on the 17 compared with three and a card reader on the 15 plus the headphone jack and Kensington lock on both but when you open up the 17 or even the 15 there's a real wow moment with that edge to edge screen and paired with a 4k plus touch screen it's genuinely one of my favorite laptop screens out there now interestingly they actually have the exact same resolution despite a size difference it's 38 40 by 2400 so we're looking at 260 pixels per inch on a 17 versus 291 on the 15 so it's slightly sharper but not something you'd really see in real life aside from that they're exactly the same though with the same high color accuracy which makes them great for editing as well as 508 peak brightness displays gr 500 and Dolby vision HDR support so obviously this is a little bigger we get actually USB C port but really the big difference between them is what's on the inside well let's jump into a few benchmarks and starting with Cinebench our 20 versus the XPS 15 the 17 is 32 percent faster in Geekbench 5 single core performance is almost neck and neck actually but in multi-core the 17 pulls away when a 28% leave then in Geekbench is graphics test the 17 is a whopping 51 percent faster in OpenCL and 50 percent faster in CUDA and then in the 3d mark time spy benchmark the XPS 17 is 44 percent faster than the 15 but what about real-world tests well starting with a few games and you can see the XPS 17 is significantly faster in all four in fact between them on average it's 40% faster so while both are pretty capable gaming laptops once you drop the rest to 1080p the 17 is a lot quicker Plus as the 2060 is an RT X card we also get access to ray tracing DSS and the faster n think encoder which helps with video streaming so you get a bunch of extra bells and whistles with the RT X card more important for me though is video editing performance so I've tested both of these in Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve studio scrubbing through the actual timeline in Premiere Pro feels pretty similar on both and they can comfortably handle 4k video but what about export times well with the same fairly complex 10-minute 4k project in Premiere Pro the XPS 17 took 11 minutes and 19 seconds versus 11 minutes and 50 seconds on the 15 so it knocked off 30 seconds but it's not a huge difference then in DaVinci Resolve studio the 17 was just 4 seconds faster than the 15 although the real winner is DaVinci and just how ridiculously fast it is compared to Premiere Pro I'm seriously tempted to switch but I do think the 16 gigs of ram may be a slight bottleneck IDE spec or upgrade them with a 2 gigs of ram so far then the 17 is significantly faster in benchmarks and gaming and a little bit faster in video editing although as I say I think 32 gigs of ram would really unlock the full performance of this but what about cooling because this is something the XPS series have struggled with for well ever really so starting on the outside and I actually found there wasn't that much difference in temperature but then on the inside running the 3d mark times by benchmark the 1650 Ti and the 15-inch peaks at 82 degrees Celsius versus just 73 degrees on the 17 inch with the 2060 max-q that's pretty significant and shows just how good this vapor chamber cooling system is as for the processor with Cinebench and called tempering both laptop side cause that peaked 100 degrees Celsius although in the benchmark the 17-inch dropped to a low of 2.92 gigahertz versus three gigahertz on the 15 that's despite a 300 megahertz higher clock on the 15 so relative to their advertised clock speed and along with the two extra cores the 17 is just faster and also cooler so that's a lot of numbers and figures but the point is the 17 with the vapor chamber cooling system makes a big difference over the 15 it still gets hot to the touch and I'm sure there's still some throttling but you don't see it as quickly as you do on the 15 but I think will be a really interesting test is to see the 1650 TI in the 17 with the vapor chamber because I'm sure you get better performance in here than you do in here so if you are gaming or doing regular high intensive workloads then the 17 does make more sense but I did find the fan noise was exactly the same on both the 17 didn't seem any quieter and finally one of our battery life well they both have two different battery options I've got the bigger versions in these guys I've got the 87 watt hour cell in the 15 versus in 97 watt hour cell in the 17 and over the last couple of weeks I've been testing these and getting about six hours of use from the 17 and about five minutes or five and a half from the 15 so not a huge difference but the 17 will give you slightly better battery life so this XPS 17 review has definitely turned more into a versus video but I think for me as I say the extra portability of the 15 kind of outweighs the extra performance and also better cooling you get with a 17 plus that's a higher end it's a good deal cheaper so I think personally with my use case I would go with a 15 but if you're a gamer a streamer or you know portability isn't the number one factor for you then the 17 is absolutely way to go and I really really hope we see this vapor chamber cooling system in the next-gen XPS 15s and maybe even the 13 so it really does make a difference what do you reckon which one would you go for between these two or just normally above let me know in the comments below as I say if you
