okay so here's the deal i have about 2 000 pounds or about 2 500 to spec and build a gaming pc but there's a twist it has to be a mini pc so xbox game pass for pc are kindly sponsoring this video and giving me the budget to build this pc to mark the release of an awesome new game called grounded from obsidian which you play as the smallest character i've ever seen you're literally tiny and by the time you watch this it'll be available to play on xbox game pass with pc so they challenged me to build this tiny pc which i can then play grounded on and it will then be compared to other creators builds from around the world and then on twitter you'll be able to vote for who you think did the best job so follow me at the tech chap to get involved and i'll share the poll when it's live but the first step is actually to figure out what kind of a pc i can build for about two grand it's a pretty healthy budget but we have to keep the pcs small and i don't want to compromise on performance so i did my research and came up with this shopping list what do you guys think would you change anything up i will need to shop around a little bit for better deals and some amount of stock parts but i'm gonna go with the nzxt h1 case which is roughly the size of the next gen consoles and it comes with a power supply and all-in-one cooler pre-installed then one of the brand new b550 mini itx motherboards an amd ryzen 7 3800 xt processor 32 gigs of ram a one terabyte sabran pci4 ssd and an nvidia rtx 2070 super all in and after shipping i've just about hit my budget so fast forward a couple of days everything's been delivered which means i think it's time for a build montage [Music] [Applause] and here it is i'm really happy with this build and while it may stretch the word tiny a little bit compared to my mid tower pc it's pretty small and not much bigger than say the upcoming xbox series x i am pleased i managed to get the new b550 motherboard in here though as well as amd's refreshed ryzen 3800 xt which has just come out it's a great all-round chip but the real highlight here is that asus origi strix 2070 super which i must admit was a very tight squeeze in this case now of course as cool as this small build is there are always some compromises for instance you kind of have to go with a mini itx motherboard which limits your options and also can increase the price plus you have to be a bit more careful about cooling because there's just not as much space for good airflow and as i say i only just managed to fit this asus graphics card in there it is a 2.7 slot card so it's a big guy but the point is while i do love a compact pc and it does look more like a games console in terms of performance and value for money a mid tower or a full tower pc is always going to be a better bet now with everything up and running let's run a few quick benchmarks i haven't overclocked anything yet but in cinebench r20 we're looking at just over 5 000 points then in time spy just under 10 000 and then we've got the results from geekbench 5 cpu benchmark on the left and the opencl gpu test on the right so far so good then but the second part of this challenge now i've built the pc is to play obsidian's grounded with xbox game pass for pc so the idea is for just three pounds 99 a month you can sign up to xbox game pass for pc and then you can access a catalog of over 100 games on your xbox or windows pc new ones are added all the time like grounded and there's upcoming games like flight sim and halo infinite which i genuinely can't wait for but let's jump into a bit of grounded and i've never played anything like this i'm definitely living my honey i shrunk the kids fantasies right now so basically you've been shrunk down to tiny size and you can choose between four different characters and then you explore craft items solve problems and fight off killer ants and spiders and actually as you play through grounded story and you craft and unlock more skills the world evolves so there's always a challenge and new things to explore plus there's a multiplayer mode which i reckon will be the most fun when you're working and exploring together and taking on the biggest spiders and ladybugs but the big question is how does our little mini pc here actually performing grounded well with maxed out epic settings at quad hd plus i'm averaging a smooth 73 frames per second dropping it down to full hd plus and it jumps up to 108 fps not too shabby especially since i've been playing a pre-release version so performance may improve when it comes out any lessons learned from this build well next-gen graphics cards are coming out around september so that would certainly improve performance also if i were building this mini pc out of my own pocket then i'd probably have gone with the ryzen 3 300 x 16 instead of 32 gigs of ram and a pcie 3 rather than 4 ssd for gaming these changes wouldn't have made a huge difference but would have dropped the price by about 400 pounds i do love this h1 case though and i'll put links to every component i've used in the description below if you fancy building something similar for yourself and do let me know in the comments what your dream mini pc would look like but a big thank you to xbox game pass for pc for making this video happen so definitely check out the link below and if you see if you like it so if there's any games that you like uh definitely check out grounded as well it's a lot of fun thank you so much for watching guys i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
