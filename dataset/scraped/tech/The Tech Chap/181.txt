hey guys i'm tom of techchap and peak design got in touch asking if they could send these over for me to have a bit of a play with so you probably know peak design for their backpacks their tripods and a whole host of other bits and bobs they're never exactly cheap but it's all about high quality and smart designs so this is their latest venture it's called mobile by peak design aka phone mounts which actually sounds kind of boring but they send a whole selection of the new accessories over i had a watch of their fancy promo video on their kickstarter page which will probably do a much better job of explaining how this works than i will but after a week or so of using them i'm sold it's basically a way to connect your phone to a whole range of their accessories be it mini tripods car and bike mounts wireless charging stands and it all works together with this magnetic slim link connector so you just pop one of these universal mounts onto the back of your phone or you can use one of their cases and it magnetically attaches or for the more rugged accessories it uses a combination of magnets and physical catchments for a tougher hold so i think it's fair to say that most uh phone accessories that you buy online are you know cheap plasticky rubbish that'll break as soon as you look at it but that is definitely not the case with these this is the bike mount it's made of metal you can tell they really pull a lot of thought into the design it's just refreshing to see one simple ecosystem of accessories that all work together that's all premium and well made that's not going to break instantly and well looks kind of good as well and the best news if you're an apple fan is that the new iphone 12 phones with their magsafe connector will be fully compatible with the final versions of these add-ons so you won't need to use a universal adapter one of their cases to connect them so this is the everyday case i've got the iphone 11 one here but right now you can get it for all iphone 11s 12s and galaxy s20 range and it is quite a nice case actually made of a weatherproof nylon canvas gives you decent protection but it's not too thick and it also supports qi wireless charging if you don't have an iphone or s20 though then you'll want this universal adapter it's got a sticky adhesive like a pop socket basically that you can then put on the back of any phone and it works with most phone cases as well although not as well with silicone or leather ones so now you've got the slimlink attachment on your phone you can then choose from a whole range of accessories the mobile tripod is actually really cool i mean when have you seen a fully articulating ball head on something this small you can use it in landscape or portrait and in the past week or so i've used it for taking photos some instagram stories and it's just handy to have plus it folds up so you barely notice it they also sent a couple of these guys it's just a tiny little wall mount has both a sticky adhesive layer and also magnets so you can stick it on pretty much anything including metallic objects like your fridge so you can then place this wherever you want maybe a kitchen bathroom if you want to watch stuff while you're on the toilet maybe your home gym i'm not really sure but you can do something as simple as that if you want live demonstrations never usually work but this seems to be going okay so you can use it like that you can even you know put it horizontally pretty seamless i have used this in a few different places now but uh bear in mind because it's got the sticky adhesive on the back that you're probably reducing uh how tough and sticky that is each time you pull it off and remove it so i'd probably recommend finding where you want to put it and then keeping it there the car mount is actually one of the most useful for me though there's also a charging version of this but unlike every other car mount since the beginning of time this one actually looks pretty smart on your dashboard and it's really low profile and most importantly even my heavy note 20 ultra never fell off there's also a couple of bike mounts mini wallets that doubles as a stand a whole mobile creator kit if you're one of those influencer people they're building a whole ecosystem basically one of my first thoughts though is that there's a lot of stuff here a lot of packaging uh but i have been reassured that actually every single one of these products uh it's not going to fall down is 100 recyclable and peak design as a whole is completely carbon neutral and they also give a lifetime guarantee to all these products uh so obviously that says something about how confident they are in it but it also means that you're probably not gonna have to keep rebuying them as you might have to if you bought some cheap crap off amazon for your phone now the kicker is you can't actually buy these just yet it's technically still on kickstarter but with nearly a million pounds raised and under 50 days to go it shouldn't be too long now i mean these review units seem pretty retail ready to me as for the all-important pricing well the universal adapter starts from just 20 the everyday case is 40 and then all the add-ons range from between 30 and 80 dollars so i think for me i'll probably treat these like i switched my smart lights in my home i probably get one or two at a time and just sort of slowly expand my collection my only feedback would be maybe to have more color options for the cases different textures too would be nice and hopefully they'll keep expanding the range i'd love to see camera lens attachments maybe with some of their moment lenses that would be awesome if they could the only downside is unlike regular phone accessories if you have a partner or a friend they'll of course need a universal adapter or one of these phone cases as well or they won't be able to use any of the mounts but what do you reckon would you be tempted to invest in this ecosystem and if so which would be the first add-on that you'd buy thank you so much for watching guys and i will leave a link to all these in the description so when it becomes available and also when i get file pricing i'll obviously update that so you have the best info and if you want to see more from me don't forget to hit that little subscribe button and i'll catch you next time right
