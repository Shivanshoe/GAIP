hey guys Anton the tech chap and I've had the chance to get a quick hands-on with a new 2020s a predator Triton 300 which has just had a pretty serious upgrade including Intel 10th gem processors up to an RT X 2070 max Q graphics card as well as a 144 or 240 Hertz screen and also apparently a new cooling design that's inspired by owls so this is the Trident 300 and he weighs a lot less than I thought it would well okay I'm being silly if you saw my Swift 5 video from a couple of days ago then the same situation it happened where they send it to me for about three hours and then I had to give it back and I'm filming this after I tested it so I'm now talking to thin air but I shot tons of b-roll I tested it right a couple of games so when I still give you my sort of first impressions and a quick hands-on with the Tri 300 but you could have to use your imagination for these shots so the Triton 300 is one of aces relatively more affordable upper mid-range gaming laptops coming in above the new nitro 7 and alongside the updated Helios 300 but the Triton goes for a fin enlight all SSD design while the slightly larger helios gets a beefier cooling solution and an SSD and hard drive setup 240 Hertz screen with the three millisecond response time that's great so let's dive into the specs and we now get Intel 10th gen h-series processors up to the i7 10 750 H that's a six core 12th red chip which can be boosted to five gigahertz so there's a choice of four new GPUs the 1650 Ti the 1660 ti the RT X 2060 and then the top spec RT x 2070 max Q you can also spec it with up to 32 gigs of ram and it comes with one nvme SSD and room for two more m2 SATA drives as for connectivity we get a single USB 3.1 type C 3 USB 3.2 taipei's kill Ethernet a mini DisplayPort and HDMI and like last year we also get Wi-Fi 6 as well as this one button GPU overclocking which I'll come back to in a second so far so good then but as always it all comes down to pricing and tumulus in the past the Trident series while as I say relatively affordable haven't always been the best value and now more than ever they've got some serious competition I recently reviewed MSI laptop the packed in an RT X 2060 for about a thousand dollars so the fact that the new Triton 300 range starts from 1200 pounds off $1300 although right now as I'm filming this I don't have confirmed pricing for the whole lineup but I'll put that in the description when I know for sure but straight away eighths is gonna have a bit of a challenge on the hands when it comes to value for money I think but let's put the price to one side for a second and talk about this design which to be honest hasn't really changed that much and it's still a mistake ibly a gaming laptop especially with this predator branding on the lid but at just under 2 centimeters or naught point 70 inches thick and weighing just 2.1 kilograms or 4.6 pounds it's actually surprisingly portable to be clear this is a marketing version as opposed to a full final retail model although it's a pretty good indicator of what we can expect and as you can see the screen does have quite a bit of flex which feels a little cheap but then I guess it also makes it a lot less likely to break in a backpack or as you pull it across the room and have ragequit situation as for the screen it's a 15 inch 1080p panel with a 144 hubs refresh and a new option for up to two fully Hertz now to fully Hertz will of course cost more and I think for most of us 144 is still the better option as don't forget to take full advantage of it you're gonna have to get 144 or 240 FPS in your games now annoyingly I'm not actually allowed to talk about exact performance figures yet but my unit here has it the 2017 max Q and if you look at other machines with similar setups that should give you some idea I did play overwatch and Call of Duty warzone for around an hour and it was smooth as you'd expect given the specs but that's all I can say right now of course being an RT X car the GPU also supports ray tracing and DL SS 2.0 which is actually pretty usable these days and it doesn't completely destroy your frame way like it used to so with the upgraded CPU and of course that new GPU is actually powerful enough to be a pretty capable content create content creation like editing laptop who says content creation in real life I don't know it'll be pretty powerful for video editing although of course bear in mind though while the hundreds and sRGB is pretty decent color accuracy and in mice to test Adobe or p3 gamut so I don't think they'll be quite up there so I'm not sure be like the best screen to edit on but certainly got a performance there now what are the Tritons best features I think is this turbo button and also the predator scent control software you can hit turbo at any time and it'll automatically overclock the GPU by between 150 and 200 megahertz predator sense also gives you overclock fan speed and RGB keyboard lighting control and allows you to monitor temperatures and clock speeds going back to the start and how exactly do hours figure into all of this well Asus a they've improved the Tritons cooling by adding extra copper heat pipes and one of the two cooling fans is aces fourth gen AeroBlade 3d metal fan where the trailing edges of the fan blades are serrated to reduce noise just like an owls wing does apparently so yeah trying 300 now with owl technology that said pushing turbo does bring with it some pretty intrusive fan noise you'll definitely want to pair a headphone to this on the keyboard works well though it's backlit with RGB zones and it felt comfortable to type on and you know play games with the WASD keys the touch pad is also a decent size and felt pretty responsive it is really off-center to the left though which felt a little weird at first I did get used to it but it still feels a bit odd although of course most the time you'll probably want to use it with a mouse anyway and the Triton 300 should be available pretty much right away but us customers will have to wait until September so first impressions well it's a sort upgrade in terms of performance the design is exactly the same and hopefully that new cooling technology will keep things well nice and cool but as I said earlier it all comes down to the pricing starting at 1200 pounds or $1,300 I guess it is relatively affordable but we'll have to see how expensive it gets we do spec it with at 20 70 or 245 screen I would have also like to see maybe an AMD version with a you know 48 or 4900 CPU we saw that in the observer SG 14 and while that did get very hot in this bigger chassis with aces new cooling that could actually be a really good chip but as I say for now we're stuck with as they stuck with it so a great processor but we've got Intel 10th Jen chips which is absolutely fine it really all comes down to the graphics card anyway when it comes to gaming performance but what about you
