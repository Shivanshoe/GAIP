hey guys Anton the tech Jeff and this is the new soos Chromebook flip four three six and as you can see it says on the tin it's got a 360 hinge this is a flipping Chromebook and actually you know what it's a flipping good Chromebook as well so from the outside it doesn't look a whole lot different to last year's Chromebook four three four which I really really liked it's all my favorite Chromebooks of 2019 the bezels are slightly thinner in a suits are saying that this is the world's lightest and thinnest 14-inch Chromebook but really it's what's on the inside that counts here and we've got new tenth generation Intel processors at the i3 i5 and i7 and also this is one of the first Chromebooks to actually tick all the boxes for Intel's project Athena innovation program it made a whole video about that and basically what that means is this is a pretty future-proof laptop we've got Wi-Fi six Bluetooth five we've got an SSD a touchscreen Intel's 10th gen processors fast charging through USB C now in terms of pricing the Coen Chromebook flip four three four starts for about five hundred pounds or five fifty dollars and although I haven't had confirmed pricing for the four three six it is expected to jump up quite a bit with two models coming out in late February for $800 and $1,000 although the starting price is still 200 less than Samsung's newly unveiled Galaxy Chromebook which starts at a thousand I have to say though it is a bit disappointing to see such a leap in price I mean for me Chromebooks have always been about value for money and being accessible to those on a budget particularly students also a few more color options will be nice this fancy white design does look good but apparently it's gonna be limited to the higher-end model where the cheaper version going for a more basic silver i'd love a rose gold or matte black so quick-fire new features and starting with the screen we actually get the same 14 inch 1080p IPS touchscreen as before although the bezels are slightly thinner looking at 85% screen to body ratio it's also pretty color accurate as well we've got a hundred percent srgb so if you aren't doing some photo easing and Lightroom but actually you can rely on what you see on the screen as I say we also get the new 10th gen Intel processors and that's paired with up to 16 gigs of RAM and 512 gigs of SSD storage we also get bluetooth 5 Wi-Fi 6 although you will need a Wi-Fi 6 compatible Reuters or router in the States to take advantage of that we also get a fingerprint reader built in the power button which is a new feature on this as well as stylus support port selection is a bit of a mixed bag because while we do get two USB sees which we also use of charging so you could actually use your phone charges well with this although it would charge a bit slower as well as a headphone jack and a micro SD card port unfortunately they have actually dropped the full size USB a pop which we got on last year's Chromebook flip so you made to buy an adapter if you are still using older USBA peripherals and somehow even though this is more powerful than before they've also managed to improve the battery life as suits claim will get up to 12 hours from this which is up from 10 hours on last year's model obviously that's something I'll test properly in my full review but Chromebooks are famous for being all-day laptops and so I don't think I've seen reality it will be too far off that number and we also get improved Harman Kardon tuned speakers which do actually get very loud although the quality isn't the best it does start to get a bit tinny the higher volume you go but it's fine for watching the odd movie or YouTube video although generally I'll stick in a pair of headphones and you can see as you've been watching this video that I'm just throwing it about a lot and that's because it really is very lightweight you really wouldn't feel this in a backpack if you're taking it to school or college so I think for students this could actually be a great option and well for me I probably wouldn't get a whole lot of use out of the 360 flippin hinge you can of course use it in stand mode 10 mode or flip all the way back and use it as a tablet which feels a little weird because you have the keys on the back but it is nice and lightweight and if you do buy a stylus to go with it then you've got a nice RT doodly device as well well what do you make of the new chromebook 4 3 6 would you consider buying something like this or do you think maybe if you are looking for a Chromebook you'd go with a higher-end more premium galaxy book let me know what you think in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and if you enjoyed the video and want to see more from me then make sure you hit that little subscribe button below and I'll catch you next time right here on tech Jam
