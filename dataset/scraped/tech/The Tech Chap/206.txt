hey guys i'm tom of techchap and as you can see here i've got two samsung galaxy note 20 ultras they are identical phones except for the color difference and except for the chip that they use inside so this mystic bronze version of the note 20 ultra is from the uk and it comes with samsung's own exynos 990 processor whereas this mystic black version comes all the way from north america and has the snapdragon 865 plus and the reason i'm making this video is because a few months ago i compared the two chips in the s20 phones and i found that the snapdragon was faster it had a longer battery life and even took better photos so here we are with the note series and if you guys watch my review or my early handbook i was going to say unboxing hands-on unboxing video uh you'll know that i was feeling pretty frustrated that it felt like we were getting a bit of a bad deal here in the uk the xml 19 was already slower than the snapdragon 865 in the s20 but then samsung went and put the a65 plus in the american note 20. so it felt like the disparity between the two was going to be even greater than before so qualcomm very kindly heard my ranting and complaining and sent one over from north america this mystic black one so i could put it to the test this video isn't sponsored this is an unbiased look at the two phones i'm going to run through a bunch of tests including performance battery life and also the camera to see if i've just been getting upset over nothing or if there is a genuine difference and let's kick off by looking at the performance and starting with the geekbench 5 cpu test the snapdragon is a whopping 21 percent faster in multi-core but then switching to the opencl graphics test and surprisingly the xnos version comes out way ahead honestly that actually really surprised me and i wasn't sure if maybe there was something wrong with my uh qualcomm version of this so actually i got my friends uh michael josh from gadget match david cogan from the unlocker and also enabong from board at work to send me their results from geekbench from those snapdragon versions and they were all broadly similar actually so for some reason in the geekbench opencl test the exynos is way faster but then when we move on to 3dmark's slingshot extreme test and actually even before we get to the results side by side you can tell the note on the left is definitely running more smoothly as for scores and again there is a significant difference with the snapdragon model giving us a 16 faster open gl score but let's move on to actual games let's see what like real world performance is like between them and considering we're getting 120 hertz screens and flagship specs inside these phones you'd expect a pretty flawless and also pretty similar experience well let's start with call of duty mobile and i'm using an app called game bench here to get the fps at the top left and it also measures the average frame rate as we go so this is the black snapdragon model and bar the odd drop to 59 you can see it's a pretty consistent 60 fps and then switching to the exynos while it still hits 60 pretty regularly it does seem to be less stable and it can go down to 57. i then took a screenshot of my results from the tests which show a 60 vs 58 fps average so a slight difference but not the end of the world but then if we fire up a bit of armor mobile ops which supports full 120 hertz and is a pretty demanding game it does play well on both phones although you can see the fps varies quite wildly on both looking at the results again there's only a 2fps difference so the snapdragon is faster but not significantly so and then finally in asphalt 9 which is capped at 60fps and after playing a few races on each phone looking at the results the snapdragon is 3 fps faster so all three games were fast on the snapdragon but only by four percent on average but i know what you're thinking those are just short bursts of gameplay what about longer gaming sessions well i went back into armor mobile ops and played the game in the exact same way for half an hour on both phones which i think is a pretty reasonable gaming session if you're up say on your commute and then we do see a bigger 6.2 difference in frame rate 113 versus a 120 average but what's really interesting is if we go from the 30 minutes of gameplay followed by a quick benchmark and then we go to check the cpu temperature you can see the snapdragon is at about 48 degrees celsius versus 57 on the exynos so even if performance was on par between the two chips the exynos will likely have to throttle sooner in longer gaming sessions now having said all that the xnos version isn't exactly slow i mean if you're just scrolling through menus or opening up simple apps honestly you really can't tell much difference however in games you do see the snapdragon mod load a second or two faster which isn't insignificant but at the same time it's not something you'd really be able to notice unless you had them both side by side like this [Applause] so we've talked a lot about performance but the next question is battery life how long do they last and i think for me at least this is more important than having an extra couple of frames per second in your games so let's look at the screen on time to start with and both phones were set up exactly the same way and i use them both in a similar way over a two day period the snapdragon gave me six hours and 32 minutes of screen on time versus just four hours and 31 on the xnos which died four hours earlier now of course there's a whole bunch of variables there and i can't exactly duplicate how i use the phone so let's do a good old-fashioned battery rundown test and to save you from getting you know bought to death here are the results after running through a pretty intensive youtube gaming and social media binge and as you can see the snapdragon model here still has seven percent of its battery left when the exynos gives up so again not a massive difference but seven percent will probably give you another 45 minutes of charge plus looking back at that screen on time test which showed a two-hour difference hopefully this gives you an idea that while not night and day necessarily the snapdragon which is also more powerful does last a decent amount longer and finally is there any difference in the camera quality between the two phones well i don't expect that to be a huge difference the cameras are essentially the same however the isp or image signal processor that does well as it says on the tin a large part of the processing of the image is built into the chip so that is different and while the photos are very similar you can see the snapdragon shots are actually a little bit brighter particularly in the shadows and there's also slightly more detail which is interesting often it's hard to tell them apart but with these photos of my wife sarah again you can see the overall shot is a bit brighter on the snapdragon plus the orange sleeve on her t-shirt is more true to life on the snapdragon the exynos is closer to red again you wouldn't really know the difference unless you had them side by side but there is a difference and overall i'd say the snapdragon's photos are slightly better it does seem weird that i've made this whole video about two phones which should be near enough identical i mean they're marketed in the same way and aside from some currency variation they're priced in the same way so the fact that one of these two phones is faster lasts longer and even to a lesser extent takes better photos doesn't seem exactly right the only mitigating factor is that samsung does give us 256 gigs of storage on the base model of this exynos version compared to 128 with his snapdragon but i just think if samsung was more transparent about this or maybe even gave us a slight discount on the exynos version because it's well objectively not as good that would go a long way having said that it is good that we are seeing some competition from samsung i mean qualcomm aside from apple and you know some media tech phones pretty much have a monopoly when it comes to good uh smartphone chips so more competition is good and for that reason i do appreciate that they are making their own chips but then until you can make them pretty much exactly the same in terms of performance don't give some people better phones and then other people not as good ones based purely on where they live fingers crossed though that the rumors of the next gen x knots with amd graphics coming in 2021 comes true overall though i don't think i go as far to say as don't buy a xnos version of the note 20. it's still a fantastic phone but it does feel like we're getting just a bit of a bad deal here although i do appreciate the extra storage but what do you reckon should we be boycotting samsung until they you know give us better chips or at least the same chip between the phones or am i just making too big of a deal of this and in real life you know the average person wouldn't really be able to tell much difference anyway you could argue that this whole thing's a moot point because unless you're willing to pay for international shipping and you can find a website that does ship internationally then well you're kind of limited to buying the one that's in your region
