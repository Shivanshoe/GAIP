[Music] hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the very shiny new xiaomi mi 10t pro and it costs 600 euros which is about 550 pounds and for that we're getting some pretty beefy specs including a ridiculously smooth 144hz screen a snapdragon 865 processor this triple camera setup with a megapixel main lens 8k video a massive 5000 milliamp hour battery 5g of course and it doubles as a handy travel mirror very nice so xiaomi very kindly sent this over about a week ago for me to have a play with and test it and the first thing you'll notice when you do pick up the mi 10t pro is it's a bit of a chunky monkey i mean it's 9.3 millimeters thick and 218 grams but then again we are getting a massive battery in this thing we also get stereo speakers which is always good to see well here and they sound good we get a dual sim card tray at the bottom on the right side we have the volume rocker and the power button which actually doubles as a fingerprint reader up top there's an ir blaster which is a nice extra and you don't see very often these days and then around the back we have this lunar silver color and then finally at the top here we have this pretty imposing camera setup but we'll come back to this in a second the real highlight is that screen though there's only a handful of phones right now that give us a 144hz refresh and those that do are almost all dedicated gaming phones which then tend to have pretty terrible cameras or other compromises so it's genuinely good to see a screen like this in a well-balanced phone the only real compromise with this is the fact that they've gone with an ips lcd screen rather than oled or amoled but that's the trade-off they've made in order to get that super smooth 144 hertz refresh rate can you tell the difference between a 120 and 144 hertz screen on a phone i don't think so maybe if it's side by side or if you're a bit of a pro gamer but for the average person i don't think so plus there's really only a few games that actually support that right now so i think it's more about having those bragging rights although having said that as developers do start to develop and optimize their games for high refresh rate phones then it may become more useful in the future i think if we had the choice though most of us would probably go with a 120hz amoled screen as opposed to a 144hz lcd but then again it is an ips lcd so it's a good quality panel the only way you can really tell is the viewing angles aren't quite as good you kind of get a bit of sort of color shift and it goes a bit gray off angle but how often are you looking at your phone like that anyway so most of the time it doesn't really matter and it is nice that we have the option to switch to p3 and srgb profiles if you want the best color accuracy and actually because it's adaptive refresh it'll adjust based on what you're doing i mean you don't need 144 if you're just browsing the web or watching a video at 30 hertz and so that does help to save battery but this screen paired with a snapdragon 865 and 8 gigs of ram while the mi 10t pro feels incredibly fast to use we also get android 10 out of the box with xiaomi's miui software on top it's definitely one of the more heavily customized skins and it's good but probably not my favorite if i'm being honest sometimes it can get a little bit busy but you do have loads of settings and customization options to play with as for battery life well for me this is one of the biggest selling points of the phone and you can easily get two full days i tend to have around 45 of my battery left at the end of a normal day so perhaps with a tiny bit of rationing you can get two full days and of course that big battery comes in handy if you're going to be playing lots of games so i jumped into a bit of armor mobile ops on this for an hour it's not the best game ever lots of go faster micro transactions you know the usual mobile stuff anyway after an hour while the top of the phone did get a little toasty although you wouldn't really feel it if had a case on it used 19 of the battery up so you'll get a good five hours of intensive gaming from this turning this into an unboxing video very quickly uh we also get a 33 watt power adapter in the box so we get pretty fast charging although unfortunately uh this doesn't support any kind of wireless charging now let's talk about these cameras because alongside that fast screen and the big battery for me this is the other big reason to consider the mi 10 t pro so the 108 megapixel camera uses pixel binning to combine multiple pixels into one so we actually end up with sharper 25 megapixel photos although you can choose to shoot in the full resolution if you want although i must admit i can't really see a great deal of difference i think overall when we have good lighting photos can look great with good dynamic range evening out the brighter highlights and the darker shadows switching to portrait mode while it was getting a little bit darker at this point my wife sarah had to take a bunch just to get a couple that look good well as good as you can get taking a picture of me in lower light i definitely recommend switching to the dedicated night mode though as the longer exposure seems to make a big difference to how bright and evenly exposed everything is alright well welcome to market day on this slightly gray day here in england i'm shooting this at 4k 30 although you can actually shoot an 8k if you want to in fact let's do that now this is 4k and this is 8k so if you're watching this on an 8k tv then you can uh well watch it back natively but the first thing you'll notice is you do lose a bit of that stabilization so i think really you're going to want to use this if you're staying perfectly still and then maybe extract some high quality screen grabs from it but i think most of the time i'd stick with 4k video and as you can see it really is quite smooth actually i can't switch to the ultra wide lens unfortunately but i can zoom in or that's just a digital zoom so yeah what do you think and who's up for some halloween puzzles and arts and crafts and finally around the front we have a 20 megapixel uh selfie camera say hello there you sarah perfect yeah it's pretty good actually i do think it's a bit of a subtle dig at one of their rivals here as on the side it says meet nt pro with easy access to the google apps that you use most uh unlike some other brands that perhaps do not have access to google but anyway the xiaomi mi 10t pro which is a bit of a mouthful to say is actually a very impressive bit of kit it's not perfect i mean an oled screen would have been nice to have and the cameras are good but not the best out there but keeping that price in mind of 600 euros which works out to be about 550 pounds or so they haven't officially confirmed uk pricing you are getting a lot for your money and also the little extras like wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.1 and faster ufs 3.1 storage all that up just to make this a really good well-balanced phone so i'll put links to this in the description below if you want to check it out but let me know what you make of the me 10t pro i'll never get tired of saying that in the comments below would you be tempted to buy it and also do you think 144 hertz is useful or just a bit of as i say bragging rights let me know in the comments
