hey guys i'm tom the tech chat and i want to show you some of the best and most exciting laptops of 2020 so far and also some cool tech that's just round the corner with weird and wonderful designs extra screens new hardware you know laptops that make me feel good about tech in a year that can just otherwise go away so first up we've got the new samsung galaxy book s but not the normal one this model has intel's brand new lakefield hybrid chip this is intel finally finally making a tiny ultra efficient soc to take on arm's low power mobile chips like qualcomm snapdragon 7c and 8c for super thin and light laptops and the result is decent performance for everyday tasks and also longer battery life than your usual intel laptop and they've chosen to demonstrate the chip's layout through the medium of lego which i think is brilliant so they've got a new low-power hybrid chip so what well the big deal is these lakefield chips can run regular windows 10 programs as it's based on the same x86 architecture as other intel and amd cpus whereas arm chips that you get in the likes of the surface pro x can't do this as their code base is completely different and so the vast majority of programs have to rely on emulation where performance and compatibility is well spotty to say the least right now so we'll need more time to see if intel's promises are real and if lakefield can revolutionize the thin and light laptop but this looks like a move in the right direction and the galaxy book s is a lovely little laptop so there's definitely potential there but what's got me excited about laptops right now are actually amd's new 4000 series of chips which means we're finally seeing some proper competition with intel's 10th gen cpus which is great news for us when it comes to choice and value for money and i've just got my hands on the new acer swift 3 with a ryzen 4300u and while it is built more like a budget machine and the price is a tad more than i'd like at 800 pounds the performance and better gaming potential make it a great all-rounder laptop speaking of which for the gamers among you i think the asus rog zephyrus g14 specked with the eight-core ryzen 4800 hs and the nvidia rtx 2060 max-q ticks almost all the boxes for the perfect portable gaming laptop and i think the combination of team red and team green for the cpu and gpu respectively works really well the g14 does get quite hot under sustained loads though and it's not the cheapest but for me it's still one of the most exciting gaming laptops of 2020 now moving on to bigger and better things one of the big surprises this year for me was the new dell xps 17. compared with the already brilliant xps 15 which is one of my favorite laptops it turns out i actually like the 17 a lot more it's still a powerful pro level creative workstation but thanks to the super thin bezels and a clever new cooling system it's a lot lighter and more compact than most other 17-inch machines it also gets some pretty decent upgrades over the 15 with eight core intel 10th gen processors and up to an rtx 2060 max q along with a better and quieter vapor chamber cooling system to be honest it's the only machine so far this year that's tempted me back from the macbook pro 16 which is also an incredible laptop and hopefully we'll be seeing a 2020 spec refresh soon also if you like the idea of a big beautiful 17-inch laptop but don't need all that power then the crazily lightweight 2020 lg gram 17 is also worth a look now if you're a regular on my channel you know that i work with surf shark vpn a whole bunch because well it's the only vpn provider that i actually use and it's so handy for watching us netflix and hbo shows while i'm in the uk and most importantly for staying safe when i'm browsing as it helps to prevent ads tracking and malware all that bad stuff it's so simple to use and there's a surf shark app for pretty much every device however this is almost your last chance to get a whopping 86 off and three months extra free of surf shark when you use the code tech chap or just by clicking the link below as they're changing their pricing in mid-september so sign up now to

future are sort of weird and wonderful designs and different form factors for laptops like the asus zephyrus dura 15 or the acer concept d7 easel starting with the bonkers zephyrus duo and this is as premium as creator slash gaming laptops get topping out at an eye-watering 4 thousand pounds but for that you get ridiculous specs and the biggest surprise to me at least about adding a second 13 inch 4k touchscreen to the keyboard dock is that somehow it doesn't completely ruin a laptop it pops up when you open the screen and it feels really solid i ended up using it for watching streams alongside games or putting my project files there when i'm working in premiere pro and just general multitasking the extra screen space really comes in handy compatibility is a bit hit and miss when it comes to scaling and the touch pad and keyboard arrangement is slightly awkward then we have the acer concept d7 easel and i love this design now i haven't had one in for review just yet but my good friend sarah deechi got her hands on it and at first glance it looks like a two-in-one workstation but then open up the second hinge and you can pretty much position the screen how you like which is brilliant for digital artists the specs are pretty beastly too with 10th gen 99 processors and rtx 2080 super not that i can really afford either but i'm torn between this and the zephyrus duo 15. if you had the money which one would you go for i'm also looking forward to getting my hands on folding and dual screen laptops like the upcoming lenovo thinkpad x1 fold and maybe even microsoft surface neo lenovo claims the x1 fold to be the first true foldable pc as the oled screen itself bends round folded flat it's a 13.3 inch screen and it comes with a pen and magnetic keyboard that you can drop onto one half of the screen so it becomes more like a regular laptop and it's running windows 10 pro and one of the new lakefield chips that we talked about earlier then we have microsoft surface neo which unlike the smaller surface duo phone it's more of a tablet small laptop with its two 9-inch screens that can fold either way so you can still use it like a tablet when folded this also comes with a fold-over keyboard to turn it into a familiar laptop design the surface new is due to use microsoft's new windows 10x platform which is better optimized for dual screen machines but its development is currently on hold unfortunately what you can by now though is the microsoft surface book 3. the design hasn't changed but we get updated specs and the same unique detachable tablet screen it is very expensive and a little bit heavier than most laptops in his class but with a fantastic screen good performance and when paired with a surface pen it's an awesome creator laptop now not strictly a laptop but the ipad pro with a new magic keyboard is a good alternative to the macbook air you're still limited to ios apps of course but the gap between this and a normal laptop is getting narrower all the time thanks to new ios features and of course this fantastic keyboard now of course value for money is the number one most important thing to me when it comes to recommending laptops but sometimes it can be fun to look at the crazy money no object laptops out there and this is one of them it's the asus pro art studio book one and it's a steal at a mere 10 000 with a top of the range nvidia quadro rtx 6000 workstation graphics card and which nvidia claim is nearly as fast as the desktop version which costs four grand by itself crazier still and nearly all the main components are actually in the lid behind the screen the back of which flips out when you open the laptop for cooling it's an absolute beast and i love the innovative design as much as the crazy specs but for 10k i might just get the one so that's pretty ridiculous but now i want to show you a couple of laptops that actually offer good value for money and first up we have the 14 inch lenovo ideapad 5 which starts from just 430 pounds it gets one of the new ryzen 4000 processors with radeon graphics we get long battery life ssd storage and even wi-fi 6. the screen does let it down a little bit even though it's 1080p and ips it looks a bit washed out but for the price there's not much that can top this alternatively the huawei matebook d14 or the honor magicbook 14 are great budget laptops although unfortunately these are tough to get hold off in the us right now so they're basically the same laptop and they feel much more expensive than they are they're thin and light and good for everyday tasks the big downside is that they use last year's ryzen 3000 processors but they're still well worth the price chromebooks are also a great value option and really good news for gamers on a budget is that nvidia's geforce now streaming service is now supported on almost all chromebooks which i can't wait to test out properly but if you do want something a little bit more high-end but still without breaking the bank then these are two of my favorite laptops of 2020 so far first up the dell xps 13 and it just does everything so well it's lightweight and compact build quality is great and this year we get a taller 16 by 10 aspect ratio which makes working on it feel much less cramped it's not the cheapest although i'd argue it's actually good value for what you're getting then there's the macbook air which also just had a major upgrade for 2020 and for starters apple have fixed the keyboard issues in fact we now get the macbook pro 16's magic keyboard it also gets intel 10th gen processors which are now quad core on the i5 and i7 models and come with much faster iris plus graphics there's also faster ram and double the base storage on the entry level model making it a much better option before so far so good then but there's also a few little exciting things coming in the next few months if we jump back to cpus for a moment and by the end of the year we should start to see intel's new 11th gen tiger lake u-series chips arrive intel are promising big performance gains thanks to a radical new super fin transistor and something i never thought i'd hear myself say but i'm also excited for intel's new integrated graphics intel says their new integrated xe graphics will offer up to a 50 increase in performance compared with 10th gen but i think what's most exciting is these will be going up against apple silicon which are apple's custom chips based on arm which we'll probably see first in the new 12 or 13-inch macbooks towards the end of this year honestly these could be a total game changer when it comes to battery life and better integration with apple's own software i mean sure we can have a few years of transition to apple silicon in their laptops but hopefully this will give you know intel amd and qualcomm a swift kick up the ass and hopefully make them even more competitive which is great for the consumer so while 2020 has been a pretty year for most of us at least there's been some pretty cool tech to get excited about and there's even better stuff just around the corner but what are you most excited about apple silicon or dual screen laptops let me know what's the next big tech innovation that you can't wait to see uh in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you want to see more from me then don't
