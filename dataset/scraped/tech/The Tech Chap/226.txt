hey guys Anton my tech chap and I've got two of the very best laptops you can buy basically I've got a new MacBook Pro 16 with the brand-new 5600 M graphics card that's the 700-pound optional extra so the most powerful graphics chip versus this guy it's the new XPS 17 from Dell so the question is if you do have you know the best part of two or three grand to spend on new high-end laptop which one of these should you go for but I should say I've actually bought both of these myself these are both retail samples they're not review models so as you can probably guess this was a very expensive video to make so if you guys do find it useful then a little like and even a subscribe would be amazing I've come out to pricing mmm of cross valley for money at the end but to give you an idea this mobile Pro 16 cost me three and a half thousand pounds whereas this XPS 17 set me back 2,750 but before we get into this comparison let me just put this to one side for a moment and bring in this guy here's one I made earlier this is the new XPS 15 I just want to show you side-by-side with a 17 why I've got them both here so I review this guy a couple of weeks ago I'll leave a little pop-out banner if you're gonna watch that after this but do let me know the comments if you'd like to see a full video comparing the 15 versus the 17 because well I've got both maybe that'd be pretty interesting but yeah let me know if there's something you'd like to see so let's dive in and first of all I'm sure you'll agree these are both beautifully designed laptops however as you can see the XPS is a little bit thicker and also depending on the model you go for quite a bit heavier so there's actually two models of this one with a 56 watt hour battery and then this one with a 97 Montera battery the lighter one is 2.1 kilograms this is two point five kilograms which is pretty hefty I mean it's not bad at all for a 17-inch performance laptop but compared to the MacBook Pro 16 which weighs just about two kilograms the XPS is a good deal heavier and Krita Apple they've actually crammed in a massive 99.9 watt hour battery now obviously if this is going to be your desktop replacement and you just keep on your desk all the time then it doesn't really matter what it weighs but if you're taking this to college or work with you and you're putting in your backpack then that weight might make a bit of a difference this is definitely a little bit more portable but build quality is top-notch on both and which looks better really comes down to personal preference with this space grey all aluminium Moberg versus the couple and fiber design of the dell now I do appreciate there's only so many ways you can make a good laptop but it does feel like Dells taken maybe a page out of Apple's book this year with the speaker grilles flanking the keyboard the much bigger trackpad and also the shifter full USB see both laptops offer fingerprint readers but the dell also gives us bass mocking with the windows hello webcam as for the webcams well to be honest they're both pretty ropey 720p on both and when you've come from something like the iPad pro any of the Microsoft service line up at least you know they're both on the top bezel which is nice but I think the MacBooks slightly better at the Dells very noisy evening quite good light so no they were great but I guess they'll do so actually when it comes to ports they're pretty much identical we get four USB C Thunderbolt 3s and a headphone jack on the MacBook Pro and also for us pcs Thunderball threes on the XPS 17 I forgot what I was talking about there along with the headphone jack but also Dell did one up the MacBook by adding a full size SD card reader which as a video editor myself is a pretty handy extra although generally for both I'm going to want to carry on and adapt to anyway as for the keyboard and the touchpad they're both lovely to use and again it really is subjective the Dells Keys have a softer more rubbery feel whereas the MacBook feels well for want of a better word more classy I can't fault either though and they both have gigantic touch pads but I guess just given how slick the gesture support is with Mac OS I'm slowly leaning towards the mag but aside from maybe the service book or a think pad laptop these are two of the best laptops to use now for this play of the video I'm going to talk about speaker quality but there's a problem let me see if you can hear the difference when I play the same clip on both laptops let's start with the the macbook and my mic is here for reference hey guys anton the texture and i just finished building this guy it's my new video editing slash gaming setup sounds pretty good go to the dell not quite as good there's clearly something wrong with my XPS 17 which is a real shame so I can't do a properly speaker comparison although right now at least for my experience have not heard a better speaker than what we get in map or 16 but just listen to that I've updated it I've even yes turned it off and on again there just doesn't seem to be anything I can do so I'm gonna have to return and exchange this model because well the speaker's broken essentially hopefully it's just this one I've not heard any other report from anyone else although if you do buy one of these yourself and you do have that issue as well let me know in the comments and hopefully we can get idea of how widespread it is but yes that's a point to the my book anyway moving on and for me there's three reasons these laptops stand out the design the performance and also the displays which look absolutely stunning on both and also impressively color accurate although the MacBook leans towards four DCI p3 Gama whereas the XPS is more accurate in terms of Adobe RGB so they both look great but there are some important differences between the screens most notably the XPS 17 which first of all in this model is a full 4k watch a 4k plus display and we get a touch screen so that's pretty handy and if you pair it with Dells active stylus pen then if you enter your digital drawing or like me maybe just your doodling or note-taking then that is something you just simply can't have on a map a pro right now the XPS also supports display HDR 500 and Dolby vision HDR which is a nice extra for watching or even editing 4k content however good news for Apple fans is in the upcoming Mac OS Big Sur update Safari will support proper HDR and Dolby vision as well so the fact is the XPS is sharper you can watch and edit 4k natively and the touch screen makes it more versatile the downside of course of that resolution is it impact battery life but we'll come out to that in a second now it's not to say there's anything wrong with the micro pro screen it's still incredibly sharp and has the same peak brightness of 500 nits but it just likes a few of the bells and whistles of the 4k Dell I think something we can almost all agree on though is the preference for this 16 by 10 aspect ratio or even maybe like three by two like you get on the surface laptops or them probably meet books I really do hope we see this trend continue when we get more of these taller laptops alright let's get to the good bit let's talk about performer now compared to the XPS 15 the 17 here gives us the option for a more powerful 10th gen i7 1087 5 H processor we also now get the option for the nvidia r TX 2060 max q I've also got 16 gigs of ram and one terabyte of storage in here both the which are upgradable on the Dell and I'll probably add another 16 gigs down the line but that's something you can't do on the MacBook as for the pro 16 we still have last year's ninth gem processors along with 16 gigs of ram and one terabyte of storage but importantly as I say I expect this one with the newer and faster aim the Radeon pro 5600 M alright so that's the setup but let's jump into a few benchmarks starting with the processor and in Cinebench are 20 the XPS 17 is five-and-a-half percent faster in Geekbench five single core performance is neck-and-neck although surprisingly the XPS 17 pulls away with its multi-core score with its seventeen and a half percent lead over the MacBook but what about graphics performance well in Geekbench is OpenCL test the r-tx 2070 max Kuna Dell is nearly eighty percent faster than the 5600 M and then in uni Engine Valley it's an older benchmark player checks out and using the extreme HD preset with OpenGL the MacBook actually performed better at 72 FPS versus 62 on the Dell so finally in the Nova bench test the MacBook scores 2309 versus 3208 on the XPS so what exactly have these benchmarks told us well not a whole lot if I'm honest because well it seems pretty clear that at least in terms of multi-core CPU performance the XPS 17 does win and as you'd expect considering the 10 cm versus the ninth James in terms of graphics performance I think there's just too many variables of which we got windows versus Mac and video versus AMD the fact that I have to use some older benchmarks because not everything is available on both so it gets a little tricky although as a rule of thumb I'd say that the graphics kind of perform within 20% of each other but depending on the test so really it's gonna come down to real world performance so let's start with some games which I know obviously isn't really the main reason you buy these laptops these are more I'm gonna Sai hate to say but you know creator laptops or work laptops now I did the best I could with the limited range of games available on both but here were the results playing shadow of the Tomb Raider and Total War 3 Kingdom with high settings at full HD Plus but what about video editing that's the most important thing for me well I ran the same 10-minute 4k export test on each laptop in Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve plus Final Cut Pro on the Mac and the results are really interesting the XPS took less than half the time of the Mac in Premiere and even knocked off a good 30 seconds in DaVinci Final Cut is still incredibly well optimized for the Mac though I know for a lot of people that's a big reason to go for an Apple laptop so really it all comes down to what program you use and finally in terms of battery life it's a pretty clear win for the MacBook we get the slightly bigger battery inside plus of course that lower resolution all helps it last a couple of hours longer than the dell so we're looking at about eight and a half hours with average use on this guy versus about six hours on the XPS 17 which is about the same maybe half an hour longer than the XPS 15 also the 4k model but if you are on the go and traveling a lot then the battery life of this does make it a better option but before we finish let's talk about pricing because this is where things get a little tricky at least in terms of adèle because there's so many different options available and also it's very hard to get the same SKU in the UK and the US so right now in the UK the XPS 17 starts at 2600 pounds but in the US it starts from as little as $1400 but that's just with integrated graphics and an i5 if you want this model I have here it'll say you back two thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds or two thousand eight hundred fifty dollars in the US now compared to the map of pro 16 which starts at 2400 pounds the same in dollars or for this model with the 5600 M it costs three thousand five hundred again the same in dollars although that is with the more expensive I 9 with an i7 and the upgraded graphics it's $3,200 but either way a good few hundred more than the Dell and still with last gen processors but altogether I think for me mainly because I used to use Premiere Pro for editing I would probably go with the XPS 17 but you can't go wrong with either and of course it all comes down to how you use it so what about you which one of these guys not only above would you go for let me know
