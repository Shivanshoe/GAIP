hey guys Anton attack and I've been driving the Tesla Model 3 around London for a week including two places I probably shouldn't have but you know I wanted to get some nice shots of the car [Music] so by now you've probably already seen a billion videos on Tesla's I mean the model 3 started shipping two and a half years ago the model Y is coming out this summer which is basically just an overinflated version of the model 3 and next year in 2021 we get the ridiculous cyber truck but while there's obviously a lot of hype around Tesla's they're kind of like the iPhones of cars I can't think of another car that two and a half years after it came out people are still making videos I'm still making videos about their features and their tech and that's where I think Tesla's secret weapon lies software updates which sounds really boring but over-the-air updates have added everything from silly new games and Easter eggs to real-world speed boosts and then there's full self-driving that keeps getting better and better so right now we're on version 10 point of the model 3 but again like phones you can actually opt-in to the beta to get the latest updates first so let me show you some of my favorite new features that have come to the model 3 via software updates starting with well a few fun ones so along with Netflix YouTube and Spotify which was also recently added we now get the twitch app for pretty obvious safety reasons you can't watch it while driving but if you're waiting in a charger now you can catch up with your favorite streamers although I do wonder how many people that own Tesla's watch twitch streams now if you fancy channeling your inner James Corden or enjoy a bit of karaoke then you'll love karaoke launch it from the media menu pick your favorite song and then you can tap the microphone icon to add or remove the vocals depending on who you ask this is either the best or the worst thing they've added there's also a whole bunch of games you can play you probably see most of these already but they keep adding new ons Cup heads is one of the latest but the best bit is you can control them with the steering wheel and pedals moving on and let's say you're sitting in a Tesla showroom car park in London shooting b-roll with your partner for the video then you should definitely check out romance mode you get a roaring fireplace on the screen the heat turns up in the car and it plays a selection of mood music I think that's date night sorted there's also a whole range of silly apps and Easter eggs like the whoopee cushion which is endless fun turning the car into Santa's sleigh changing the maps to the surface of Mars even naming the cop hat see for a Monty Python Easter Egg so lots of fun stuff but it is also great to see Tesla actually listening to customer feedback and then making changes for example you can now toggle the regenerative braking to low you'll see a drop in range but the trade-off is a more comfortable slowdown when you take your foot off the gas like you'd get in a normal car another addition is dog mode say for example you have to go to the store for just a second you can turn on dog mode in the climate settings obviously you shouldn't leave your dog in a parked car for too long but it fills the screen with a dog mode notification for passers-by and it won't get too hot or too cold for your little dog Oh they've also updated sentry mode using the auto pilot cameras and sensors around the car it's kind of like a next-gen dash cam and there's loads of videos popping up on YouTube of Tesla owners sharing their sentry mode footage including one awesome example of using the summon mode to maneuver the car out of a parking space when another car had parked too close to the driver's door so there's fun stuff there's quality of life improvement stuff and then there's the stuff that fundamentally improves the performance of the car for example I think my favorite upgrade is the acceleration boost in the Tesla app you'll find an upgrade menu which is kind of Awesome in of itself you can pay for an acceleration boost which cuts the nought to 60 time by half a second I don't know would you pay for that would you pay $2,000 to knock half a second off your car's not 260 I'm not sure though the pole at the top right and let me know certainly off my Ford Fiesta it wouldn't make any difference at all so probably not but on a Tesla where we're kind of at supercar performance two grand maybe isn't that bad of a deal what do you think and then of course we have full self-driving so as standard all Tesla's have autopilot which means the car can steer accelerate and brake automatically or you can also buy the full self-driving package for around fifty eight hundred pounds or six thousand dollars so it can automatically drive on motorways on and off ramps interchanges and even overtake cars plus automatic driving on city streets not just highways and motorways and as Tesla keeps improving their self-driving tech it'll get better smarter and importantly safer over time with dates so the point of all this is that Tesla's keep getting better and better with updates I mean if some said to me they could come and do a software update on my Ford Fiesta and add Netflix or twitch or make the naught to 60 half a second faster that would be crazy I would love that and paired with this super charging infrastructure including the rollout of their new faster v3 charges I do genuinely think and this video is not sponsored at all that if you want to buy a fully electric car right now a Tesla is the best choice but having said that I can't wait for the competition to heat up this year I've definitely got my eye on the upcoming VW id3 which I might actually be able to afford but what about you would you buy a Tesla right now or maybe you're waiting or maybe you've got your eye on a different car let me know in the comments below and if you'd like to see
