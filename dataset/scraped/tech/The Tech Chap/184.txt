hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the shiny new rtx 3070 and it'll cost you 470 pounds or 500 so it's about 200 less than the 3080 and considering nvidia have claimed that this guy should be at least as fast if not faster than the previous flagship the 2080 ti then this is pretty exciting actually the thing is as impressive as the 3080 and the 3090 are they are very expensive and i think a little bit overkill for the vast majority of us especially if you're still playing at 1080p or 1440 which is why i think the 3070 here is gonna be the sweet spot especially for 1440p gaming i mean to be honest i think nvidia may have made your buying decision a bit easier anyway because even if you wanted an rtx 3080 it's been almost impossible to buy them they've really messed up their launch unfortunately because as impressive as this card is even if you wanted to throw your money at them as the future on a meme goes they've just been out of stock everywhere the situation is getting better and i have been told and the reports i've seen suggest that the 3070 launch will go more smoothly they have learned their lessons but i think if you have been waiting to upgrade your pc but actually anyway the 3070 could be a better and cheaper option for you so this is the 3070 and then if i bring in the 3080 next to it and move my laptop out the way a little bit you can just see straight away that huge size difference between them and then just for a bit of context let's bring in its predecessor the rtx 2070 and you can see these guys are pretty similar size so both the 3070 and the 3080 have this new flow through design although with the 3070 here we have both fans on top but the principle is the same the left fan pushes hot air out through the extra large vent underneath and the right fan pushes air through the card towards the back and then out here as well and actually we'll come to gaming stuff in just a second but i tested the temperatures on both the 3070 and the 3080 and found that they were pretty much neck and neck at idle they were both averaging 33 degrees celsius and under load while gaming about 74. there may have been a one or two degree difference in it but within the margin of error which is interesting given the fact that obviously the 38 is more powerful it's more power hungry so i think basically nvidia have tuned the fans for the same thermal limits but what it means is this actually is a lot quieter the fans do not wear up anywhere near as much as this we're looking at about 1750 rpm on the 370 versus about 3 800 rpm on the 3080s and so under load i measured this at about 42 decibels versus 54 on the 3080s so quite a bit louder you do notice the difference and i think that's going to be especially important if you're going to put one of these in a more compact save living room pc although when idol both cards were pretty much silent the fans only kick in when you start doing something a little bit more demanding now in terms of ports we have the exact same selection as the 3080 we get three displayport 1.4s and one hdmi 2.1 it's also just a single 8-pin power connector this time although you still need to use nvidia's love or hater adapter which then goes into the 12 pin port on the actual side of the card so 1 8 pin versus 2 8 pins on the 3080 and as well as that the 37d actually uses a full 100 watts less of power we're looking at about 220 watts versus 320 although nvidia on the back of the car i do still recommend that you pair it with a 650 watt psu in your system which again as i say goes back to my sort of compact mini itx pc build ideas for this if you're going to maybe put it with the fantastic nzxt h1 which comes with a 650 watt power supply then again i think this will be perfect but let's get to the good bit just how fast is this and is it worth paying the extra 200 or so for the 3080 well here are the specs side by side i am also working on a big buying guide video later this week which will include the 3090 as well but let's start with a few synthetic benchmarks and actually it does appear the 3080 is quite a bit faster than 3070 between 25 and 45 in these three tests but of course it's all about the games and this is where things get pretty interesting let's start with just the 3070s results and i tested five games at 1080p 1440p and 4k all with maxed out settings and with ray tracing and dlcs turned on in fortnite and wolfenstein now versus the 3080 same game same settings same test bench and it is quite a bit faster although the biggest gains are to be had at 4k for example at 1080p the 3080 is just 15 faster jumping up to 1440p it's a respectable but not crazy 23 faster but at 4k the 3080 is a whopping 34 faster than the 30 70. so really which card you should go for comes down to well a your budget how much you can afford and b what resolution and frame rate you're playing at the 3070 like the old 2080 ti is fine for 4k gaming but at that resolution i definitely pay the 200 extra and get the 3080 as it's over a third faster but for most of us i think the 37t will be best paired with a high refresh 1440p monitor like a 144 hertz if you are still playing at 1080p though which to be fair a lot of people still are then i would actually hold off even further because i expect while not confirmed we'll probably see a rtx 3060 come maybe in the new year like january time although as i say not confirmed but i think that would be the perfect 1080p card even this is a little bit overkill for 1080p unless you're going with a super high 240 or 360hz refresh monitor so i think for the price the 3070 here really is easy to recommend this is the fv but of course third party cards with beefier coolers and overclocks will be coming out soon as well so keep an eye out for those if you are thinking about upgrading though remember it's not just about raw performance because if you don't already have an rtx 20 series cards then upgrading to this will also get you ray tracing in dlss hdmi 2.1 nvidia's reflex and broadcast features plus support for the future-proofed av1 codec so there's a whole bunch of extras over and above just a higher frame rate the big question though is how this and this will compete with amd's rx 6000 series so it may be worth holding off just for a few more weeks to see how they stack up but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy the new rtx 3070 or maybe spend a couple hundred more on 3080 when you can actually finally buy one let me know in the comments below and do stay tuned for my big buying guide
