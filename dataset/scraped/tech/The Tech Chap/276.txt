[Music] hey guys Anton the tech JEP and this is one of the craziest days I've ever had at the office as you can see I'm not in the usual studio I'm actually at MacLaren's Technology Center just outside London not just on any normal day but actually they've just revealed their 2020 Formula One car the MCL 35 in a gorgeous-looking new matte papaya orange now I do love my cars but obviously this is a tech channel so while I'm here for the McLaren launch as well I also want to talk you through this a bad boy it's the one plus concept one phone you may have seen some videos of this some photos from CES but I want to kind of get a bit more of a deep dive and it show you how this very cool invisible camera works you can see that it's actually using tech from the Sun roof of this McLaren GT here but it's not just a pretty face because actually this also acts as an ND filter before we talk about the phone and the tech I do just want to fire this up there's not many times you get a chance to start up a mclaren CC they can't tell me off this is very very cool so it's not all about playing around though it's a little bit about playing around so if you happen to have fun a Noah spare a hundred and sixty grand or so you can never go of this yourself but in both the McClaren 720s and the McLaren GT that I have here at the touch of a button you can adjust the tent of the glass sunroof it's called electrochromic glass and basically there's a thin layer of film inside that conducts a low voltage of electricity and as the current passes through the film the particles are there align all they disperse which then lets more or less light through so basically oneplus took that technology shrank it right down into their concept one smartphone it's just for the camera at the back here so you can see first of all it's completely smooth and if I turn it off all the cameras that disappear if I double tap the power to turn it back on the camera lenses appear again now you might be thinking well is that just a bit of a gimmick like who cares if the cameras disappear well I actually think it's quite a big deal and not just from a design point of view although I must admit I really do like the look and feel of this with MacLaren's signature papaya orange leather cover and the glass strip running through where the camera lens is hiding underneath plus you can just imagine if you can make the whole back of your phone transparent so you can see everything inside a bit like something jerry-rigged everything will make that would be pretty cool but what I'm most excited about is how it also works as an ND or neutral density filter something most professional photographers use on their cameras I actually use an ND filter on my main video camera and it's a lifesaver when shooting outdoors or in bright light and it works by reducing the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor so I can keep a low f-stop and have that nice depth of field without everything being really blown out until now the only way to really replicate this on a smartphone is with a third-party little clip-on filter but it's not exactly an elegant solution which brings us back to the concept one and in the camera app if you switch to the pro mode you'll see the little nd eight icon at the top right which you can integral on or off a quick caveat though because this isn't a retail product you would actually be able to buy the concept one and the software isn't final so right now the photos and videos have a slightly unnatural blue tint to them I asked oneplus about this and they said it was simply down to the color tuning but aside from the color you can see a difference using the ND filter we get more detail in the bright areas like the clouds for now the concept one has a fixed nd8 filter but their proto designers have told me that they're also looking at variable filters going forward as well so answer a couple of questions that I had about this going in firstly it takes just Noor point seven seconds to transition which is actually quick and the time it takes to open the camera app and second it does drain some battery oneplus didn't give me an exact figure but they said it was less than say how much battery your phone uses for 4G data so while megapixel sensor size and AI processing are all important when it comes to the camera I can't wait to see built-in ND filters in next-gen phones I think it could genuinely transform smartphone photography I maybe even lead to some really unique phone designs it's so cool seeing different brands like oneplus and McLaren working together and coming up with all sorts of innovations I mean it's crazy to think the trickle down obtained ology that starts off in maybe at for me the wall or supercar can end up in the phone that you and I might have in our pocket so what do you make of the oneplus concept one and the idea of having an ND filter built into your phone's camera let me know in the comments below a huge thank you to one plus a McLaren for working with me on this video and giving me the chance to see the unveiling of their car meet their incredible drivers Lando and Carlos and just being able to you know no doubt for a day with cool cars and next-gen tech I really hope you guys enjoyed the video hit that like button if you did and subscribe if you want to see more from me I'll catch you next time right here on the tech jam [Music]
