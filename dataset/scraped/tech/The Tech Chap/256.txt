hey guys Anton tech jab and welcome to my camera comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S 20 altra the new one plus eight pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max and we're kicking off with some weird video this has been shot at 4k 30 with the rear cameras on all three phones and I'm also switching between the microphones ekeus a little speaker icon now I'm not a professional photographer by any stretch but I'm gonna give you my thoughts about the cameras as we go along but I also want to hear what you think as well so the end of the video I'm gonna put a poll so you guys can vote which one you think was the best and then also let me know white in the comments below so let's kick off with some video again being shot at 4k 30 on all three full disclosure I'm using my ones daily lockdown walk to get this footage and I am all by myself as you can see though stabilization is actually really impressive across the board but what stands out to me is the s20 is noticeably darker and it also has a slightly warmer color profile as if someone's put a more cinematic LUT over it to my eye the 1 plus an iPhone look more true to life now let me show you how the video compares between the different lenses this is being shot with the main lens but then if we switch out to the ultra wide you can see that 1 plus sake isn't nearly as wide as it is on the other two phones then if we go back to the main lens and then zoom in to two times on the iPhone 3 on the 1 plus and 4 times on ES 20 and then pinching into 10 times to zoom on all three and finally up to 50 times to me as 2013 the 1 plus and 10 on the iPhone yes 20 is certainly the most detailed but it is also much darker alright let's do a focus test and see how quickly and also smoothly the transition and I'd say the oneplus is the fastest the iPhone is the smoothest and the s20 is well inconsistent at best I am using the latest software as of mid-april but I think maybe the Exynos chip maybe someone to blame here in lower light straight away and drawn to the iPhone for its dynamic range the Sun isn't as blown out while everything in the foreground is brighter and better exposed in the others we're also starting to see a few more jellies in a stabilization most noticeably I think on the s20 now at nighttime just look how different all three phones are when it comes to color and actually I'd say the s20 is the closest in real life it really is an orange streetlamp the iPhone is a close second then the HDR helps even all the highlights on a streetlamp but while the oneplus is sharp the color is way off as I'm walking you can see the s20 is juddering more than the others the stabilization can't keep up as well turning the corner though it's interesting because it's a white not blue light at the end of the street the oneplus seems to have corrected white balance and so now is the most accurate and the iPhone looks good but it's slightly lacking in detail alright let's move on to look at a few photos starting with the ultra wide lens and then on to the main and then the telephoto lens with their respective optical zooms I think the iPhone offers the most natural colors here or that we do get the shortest zoom then up to 30 times digital zoom although the iPhone maxes out at 10 times the s20 is clearly out in front here and then finally if we jump up to it's crazy a hundred times space ooh but also digitally cropping on the other two to match the s20 is the zoom champion now what about a couple of completely candid definitely not pose for portrait shots well there's obviously a different look to each of them and I think the iPhone comes out on top in terms of natural skin tone and the color of my t-shirt and how it handles the reflection highlight on my forehead the iPhone again has the most realistic colors of both my skin tone and the white cabinets in the background I think that's enough of my face for a few minutes so back to some regular photos and all three look great there's not a whole lot in it here the iPhones HD are consistently brings up the shadows and gives us a more evenly lit although arguably flatter looking photo sometimes it looks good sometimes it can look a little fake and for example here the grass looks a little unrealistically bright and lacking in shadow and depth yes 20 definitely loses the most detail in the darker areas particularly the bottom left by the wooden pole the oneplus offers a good bounce I think and has the most natural colors here you can definitely see this pattern from left to right of darker to lighter shadows I am impressed by the oneplus is bounce though between the other two in fact the iPhone is definitely overexposed here and looks a bit unrealistic it really is interesting how in some shots particularly in good light there's very little in it between the three phones what you can do with yes 20 + 1 + though is shooting their full resolution there's not much change although particularly on the s20 it does become noticeably sharper and more detailed the oneplus is surprisingly soft even at 48 megapixels and the iPhone stuck at 12 while reasonably sharp is the noisiest I think the real test of modern phone cameras though is in trickier lighting so as the Sun Goes Down I have to say I think the oneplus has nailed this the iPhone has overexposed the foreground and so the sky is completely blown out the s20 is just way too dark and we lose a lot of detail on the tree ok back home now it's about 8 p.m. and I think the iPhone wins here in terms of color and also detail not just of the flowers and the VARs but you can also make out a texture on the blinds at the back so I'm playing a bit of the ff7 remake at the moment if you've played it I'd love to hear what you make of it in the comments and I think the s20 has struggled to focus a little on the bright foul fantasy text it's much crisp on the oneplus and the iPhone just looking at the blue light on the ps4 controller though you can see how strong the iPhones HDR can be it does better expose the plant and the wall a bag though but I kind of like the bounce you get from the oneplus I actually do use a microfiber cloth to clean the camera lenses before every photo but only the oneplus doesn't show any haloing and while all three are in regular photo mode not portray or aperture to his credit the s20 Zep sensor is proving its worth you can see how the keys are less blurred than the background it's that gradual bokeh you get with a proper DSLR I don't know what to say here this is an absolutely horrible photo across the board but it's a lot like portrait shot and I think I hate all three of them although I'm tempted to say the s20 is the best the iPhone is selling the brightest although again the super-powerful HDR just gets rid of all the shadows so I think the s20 is the best of a bad bunch so then let's compare night mode firstly this is a regular photo and I specifically turned off the iPhones automatic night mode it genuinely is almost pitch black and although the oneplus is brighter it is at the expense of a lot more noise then with my mode the iPhone really comes into its own it's almost magic how good it is the oneplus is reasonably bright but it's noisy and the colors are way off and the s 20s night mode didn't really do much now this is a really interesting night mode shot and yes 20 doesn't seem to handle the ambient light as well giving everything a purple hue the Google hub on the iPhone is blown out though but the rest of the photo offers more detail than the others just look at the cards against humanity' text for example another night mode photo and again the s20 is struggling is colors are off it's over sharpened it just doesn't look good I like the bokeh on the oneplus and the colors are nice too but I think the iPhone is the best overall again there's a lot more detail on the texture of the word in the baseball but let's go outside for a second again using night mode and I had to double-check I had mixed up the photos here but in a complete reversal of a lonely video we saw earlier the s20 iPhone shots a pitcher of traded places with the s20 now looking flat up a bit of exposed the oneplus again just gets the color wrong and the iPhone now has blown out the highlights this time using night mode with the ultra wide lens again the s20 comes out on top bright well exposed good detail the oneplus is still let down by coloring and the iPhones is far too dark now this is very tricky lighting but I think the oneplus actually wins here seriously these phones keep trading blows but everything on the oneplus is exposed correctly the color is the most natural the iPhone has really struggled with the highlights credit to the s20 as well although there's an unnatural yellow tint to the colors how about astrophotography well on a tripod all three pointing straight up in no mood plus turning on the oneplus is tripod mode in the settings I think the iPhone is the clear winner and none of these are edited but then I wanted to go a step further and bring in the YP 40 Pro and the pain sophomore excel again all phones are on a tripod in their respective night modes I actually thought the p40 pro would do a better job here as I had been impressed by the mapley Pro last year but the pixel fall as you would expect from us ridiculous four minute long multiple exposures is breathtakingly good with the iPhone in second place and I think actually the oneplus coming in third now how about selfies starting in low-light and actually the oneplus is clearly the most detailed although I do like the iPhones more natural color I have to say though I'm shocked by the s20 I've not edited any of these photos but I genuinely think giving my recent eggs not supposed to sound dragon video that maybe it's the eggs not to blame in better light things do improve them across the board but with the oneplus I think coming in last place it hasn't a natural purple hue to it I kind of look ill yes 20 knife own do a much better job switch into a portrait mode selfie all three have a nice depth of field although again I can't ignore the pretty bad colors from the oneplus another example and I think the iPhone wins the oneplus is sharp but still the colors are off and with the s20 I have to say I've been struggling with focus issues for a while on it and particularly with the selfie camera one more selfie portray and this time the s20 has got the focus right and it looks good the oneplus is disappointing again my t-shirt skin tones it all just looks really washed out the iPhone has the narrowest field of view but I think the best-looking selfie and finally a quick selfie video now both the s20 and iPhone are being shot at 4k 30 here was the oneplus a pro still maxes out at 1080p with a selfie camera so I think I've subjected you guys to enough of my selfies and portrait shots for one day but which camera do you think came out on top overall yes 20 ultra the one plays a pro or the iPhone 11 pro max both my little polar top right and let me know why you think so in the comments below as you could probably tell these videos do take quite a while to make so if I could get a little thumbs up and maybe even a cheeky subscribe for you guys that would be incredible well I've got you guys just a quick shout out to Ryan over a beginners tag he's an awesome dude who normally has a great channel although I can barely and say anything he says thanks to his college accent but why beau cos is definitely not in the best position if those kind of look up your nose but it's a good friend and also an NHS nurse who's been transferred to help coronavirus patients if you've got a second give them a serve let's get into a hundred K so we can get that fancy youtube flag and hats off to everyone out there who's a carer nurse doctor or anyone that's helping others
