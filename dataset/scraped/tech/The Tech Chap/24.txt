hey guys i'm tom with techchap and i want to answer one simple question can this top spec mac studio with an m1 ultra and 128 gigs of unified memory really beat my desktop pc with a ryzen 9 5950x and an rtx 3090 i must admit i do think we have a bit of a david and goliath situation going on here i mean in terms of size and portability well i think we know which one wins and maybe that's a deciding factor for you or maybe it doesn't really matter but actually it does highlight that however the mac studio ends up performing compared to the pc it is tiny and realistically this should go up against the mac pro apple's desktop which we're expecting a refresh for after wwdc in june so really that's the two that will go head-to-head but for now because we've got the new m1 ultra while this is arguably a bit academic it's also a bit of fun so let's see which is faster although first let's talk about price because this mac studio on my desk right here is the best part of seven thousand pounds it's 6800 although that is because it has four terabytes of storage if you stick to the standard one terabyte with the m1 ultra it's 5800 pounds however bear in mind that you cannot ever upgrade this and you can't really even open it to clean the fans or anything but let's go with that 5800 pound price tag for the time being and compared to my desktop pc which i did actually build myself i have just now specced a pretty much identical system with a popular uk retailer and it comes out at about four grand now it is a bit tricky at the moment building your own pc because of component shortages particularly gpus and getting a rrp graphics card is just not really realistic right now but still even a custom pre-build seems to be significantly cheaper than a mac studio and of course with the pc you have infinite upgradability you can add more ram storage switch out the cpus and gpus you can upgrade it bit by bit over time which is a lot more affordable now to be fair i do only have 64 gigs of admittedly quite fast 3600 megahertz ram in the pc you could go crazy and add 128 gigs of ddr5 which would make a small difference but it's still not really comparable with the unified memory we get in the mac studio or on any m1 powered mac but anyway overall in terms of cost and flexibility really i think that should be two points for team desktop pc i say desktop pc i do appreciate this is also sitting on my desktop and a mac is a personal computer but well you know in terms of power usage though it is a big win for the mac because this is rated at 370 watts all in and that's actually the same for both the m1 max and the m1 ultra versions whereas i actually have a thousand watt psu in my pc mainly because it is good practice to have a psu with a higher wattage than you need especially as we don't have the benefit of the super efficient non-fragmented apple system which we have in the studio here in the pc different components from different brands and offering different speeds all impact how much power it draws but to give you an idea the 3090 founders edition which i have in this pc is rated at 350 watts which is almost the same as the entire mac studio and that's before the 105 watt psu and then the ram the ssd and all that extra stuff all together we're looking at roughly two to two and a half times the power draw on the pc versus the mac that's crazy and while i would say the advantage there is that it will save on your electricity bills which it will a little bit chances are if you're paying between you know four and six grand for a machine then that's not really your top priority okay let's get to the good bit which one is faster well let's start with a couple of benchmarks and in cinebench r23 amazingly they're neck and neck the mac studio is just one and a half percent faster in multi-core which is kind of incredible considering how vastly different the architectures are and also the fact the m1 ultra has 20 cpu cores to the 16 on the horizon okay next up geekbench and i know knowingly likes this benchmark so i'll keep it brief we are seeing a 48 higher multi-core score on the mac which is pretty huge but then in the geekbench compute test the rtx 3090 is 150 faster okay let's move on to some proper tests and firing up a bit of blender i've got this quite demanding ripple demo project here and i wanted to see how long it would take for each of them to render 1000 frames and it turns out it's a pretty big win for the pc it takes around half the time of the studio this is definitely where the rtx gpu is having a big impact because in this bmw cpu only test the pc is just five percent quicker but then in the gpu version of the test the pc is around three times faster so a pretty big win for team pc when it comes to blender but what about video editing well i think it's fair to say if you shoot in prores and edit in final cut then you are going to get a better much more optimized experience with the mac but for my workflow i shoot with a sony a7s3 recording 10-bit 4k 60 video and then i had it in premiere pro and i'm also using the latest beta version so a basic question for me is always which one will export my project faster well exporting in 4k h.264 with the max render and max depth settings checked it's a big win for the mac seven minutes 50 versus 10 minutes 30. now same thing but this time exporting in 8k and we're looking at 12 minutes 40 versus 18 minutes 15. now a good all-round 4k and 8k use case test in premiere pro is running the puget extended benchmark and once again it's a pretty decisive win for the mac only the gpu scores slightly higher on the pc wow okay so if you're editing in well final cut of course or premiere pro a cross platform industry standard video editing app then the mac's your best bet but what about adobe lightroom well i loaded up 500 of my finest raw photos and then exported them to jpeg where the mac studio took one minute and four seconds to the pc's one minute 48 so another win for the mac now i do have a bit of a suspicion that the pc will be winning the next test gaming not only because of the obvious difference in the sheer volume of games available on pc versus mac but the rtx cards have a ton of gaming focused features including extras like ray tracing and dlss support plus we also have extremely good drivers so firing up a bit of shadow of the tomb raider at highest settings of course and at 1080p we're getting almost double the frame rate on the pc although that is still a decent showing from the mac but it's in a totally different league in metro exodus the pc is around three times faster and that's without dlss of course you can cloud stream games on both mac and pc which realistically i think is the best way of gaming on a mac even with the performance of the m1 ultra simply because the games the drivers and the optimizations just aren't there so obviously i could test a million apps and programs and it might all be a bit different your workflow how you use your computer may be different but from my tests and my experience so far is the mac studio actually faster than my desktop pc well specifically is the m1 ultra graphics faster than the rtx 3090 graphics well no it's not however as a whole is the mac faster than the pc well yeah it can be notably in my adobe tests now to be fair we are expecting to see a rtx 1390 ti released very soon although the report suggests it may have up to a 450 watt tdp or something like that and of course also uh maybe the 4 000 series cards coming later in the year so there could be some big gains there but also after wwdc in the summer we should see a refreshed mac pro desktop which as i say at the beginning of the video is really what you would be comparing to this desktop windows pc so it will be worth revisiting this video then but right now i do have to give apple credit for designing something this small that uses roughly half the power of this and is also basically silent the entire time and in some cases it can still significantly outperform the pc so where does that leave us well i think you're going to be buying a system based on the software whether you want mac os or windows rather than these sort of form factors and whether you wanted rtx 3090 or a mac studio with an m1 ultra but it is very impressive the efficiencies the performance that we're seeing with this and i cannot wait to see what apple can do with a mac pro so there isn't really a clear winner obviously in terms of gaming and most graphically demanding tasks you will want a pc with a high-end gpu but for my workflow it turns out the mac studio is significantly faster and so i can tell you over the last couple of weeks since i've had this the pc has been on the floor i've only put it back up to make this video and maybe play some games but what do you think if you could take one of these home with you right now which would you go for let me know in
