hey guys i'm from the techchap and as i was coming home from apple's big wwdc conference which was incredible by the way it's my first time there i got this message which i think is the question we're all asking after they unveil the new macbook air m2 is the m2 worth buying or should you maybe just save some money and go with the what's got so many laptops here go with the m1 which is still on sale and a bit cheaper or is it actually worth paying more and getting macbook pro 14. there are a lot of questions and also since my hands-on where i sort of gave my first impressions i've had a few more thoughts now if you have been living under a rock the headline upgrades with the new macbook air m2 is well as it says on the tin we have the new faster m2 chip it's also slightly thinner and lighter we get a brighter screen up from 400 to 500 nits also much thinner bezels complete with the level heated notch but it does mean we have a slightly bigger 13.6 inch screen now up from 13.3 we also have a new and improved 1080p webcam we get magsafe you get better speakers there's two new colors starlight and a very snazzy midnight and also slightly less exciting but also a full height function row on the keyboard the question is though is it worth paying 200 or 250 pounds more than this this is the current macbook air m1 which is still on sale for 999 they haven't discounted it uh although across all models if you're a teacher or a student you can get 100 off but this is still going to be on sale side by side with a new m2 the problem is though and perhaps one area i got it well a little bit wrong in my hands on video while suggesting that if you are going to buy a new macbook air m2 is that you're going to want 16 gigs of ram and maybe 512 storage that was a sort of sweet spot the only reason i said that particularly for 16 gigs of memory is that on this one which has eight gigabytes often i do get errors saying it's run out of memory and i have to close applications although i am curious if the higher bandwidth speeds of the new unified memory in the m2 version will make much of a difference or if indeed it is still worth going for 16 gigs but anyway my original point once you spec the empty ware up to that sweet spot you're only 250 pounds shy of this the macbook pro 14. i'm gonna have to make this quick i've only got five percent battery on this but the macbook pro 14 is still quite a big upgrade over the macbook air even with the m2 because we've got the mini led screen so much deeper blacks and also it's much brighter up to a thousand nits this supports hdr the macbook still doesn't also we have the 120 hertz promotion and the m1 pro chip so the big question really i think is what is the difference in performance between the m2 and the m1 pro that is something of course i'll be testing properly when i get my review units the pro also gives you more ports we have the full size sd card reader full size hdmi we get extra usbc thunderbolt and also unique to the pros is the ability to output to more than one external display it's one of the first questions i asked apple in my hands on could the new macbook air m2 output to two displays and the answer is no still not that is reserved for the pro models could be worth paying the extra for the pro 14. there is also another elephant in the room and it's called the macbook pro 13 which also comes with the new m2 chip but otherwise has not really changed now i don't know who's gonna buy that i think honestly it's gonna be a lot of people going into stores thinking hey i want the pro model this is the cheapest pro model i'll take that but it's not going to be really the best option i think for most people the only real advantage to it over the m2 air is the fact that it has a fan so under sustained loads if you're gaming or you're rendering you may get slightly better performance but honestly for my tests of the current generation macbooks between the fanless air and the fan pro 13 there isn't that much difference it's just like a few percent so i really don't know who's going to buy the macbook pro 13. hopefully i'll be getting a review sample though may be some redeeming quality or some sort of price advantage but that's something left to test in the full review but then there is this this is the dell xps 13 plus which i would say is probably the closest competitor to the new macbook air m2 there are other options like the new asus zenbook 13s oled which i also reviewed recently and i'll leave a little link to if you fancy i'm going to be reviewing this as well but you have to admit that is the most futuristic looking laptop i think i've ever seen function road lit up at the top reminiscent of the touch bar not necessarily a good thing and also i'm not sure if i love the keyboard here there is no gap between the keys it means the keycaps are bigger but it's a little bit hard to sort of figure out physically where your hands are anyway it took me a while to get used to but with a 13 plus we're getting a touchscreen it's also an oled display we're still lcd on the air it still doesn't even support hdr which is a bit disappointing and also well i just love the design of this however the upside of the air and i am pointing towards this but i'm referring to the new m2 air is that we have a much better webcam there really isn't a better webcam on a laptop at that price it's also completely silent because there isn't a fan inside and as soon as i was setting this up uh in windows and downloading updates i could hear the fan were up going from the air that just kind of feels like a dinosaur i also love the scissor mechanism keyboard we get on macbooks it is my favorite keyboard at the moment and one big advantage of both the m2 and also the m1 to some extent is that we have that video rendering engine so when it comes to my workflow which is primarily editing these videos in premiere pro and using photoshop and lightroom there are no other laptops like the macbooks that can scrub through my 4k 10-bit h264 video like a macbook even the air now i tend to use the pro 16 as my main uh laptop i actually have a pretty high-end desktop over there with a 3080 and a 12th gen intel processor but for editing i always want to go back to the macbook or maybe the mac studio this is pretty much the same price as the macbook air and two there are some slight differences uh depending on what country you're in and also on the higher spec this actually comes out a little bit cheaper in the uk but really it's gonna come down to what software you prefer mac os versus windows 11. so there's a lot to think about but i think for most people the overarching question will be should i go for the m1 macbook air and pay a little bit less or the m2 assuming of course you don't already have one of these well i can't say for sure until i get the new one to test but one of the big advantages that i think will influence people's decisions is that new webcam as we're all working from home and hybrid working and of course the new m2 air has that new 1080p webcam with better low light uh image quality because of the isp in the m2 however all new macs will be getting the mac os ventura software later in the year which along with ios 16 on the iphone allows you to use your phone's camera as a webcam i haven't probably been able to try this yet but it would sort of negate one of the advantages of the air if you are just happy to use your phone as the webcam instead it's also interesting that the battery life hasn't really changed with the new m2 air according to apple in terms of video playback and light use cases it's about the same they quote 18 hours of video playback although when it comes to graphically demanding tasks because the new m2 air i think can actually draw up to 15 watts compared to 12 watts here that may actually reduce battery life a little bit although the flip side of that argument is if it completes a task quicker say rendering then maybe it doesn't draw as much battery because this takes longer but to be honest with you i'm not bothered at all battery life is already incredible on the m1 air and actually the transition from the intel air to this i think was the most revolutionary upgrade in a laptop i've seen in the last 10 years it really is insane and yes i know this has slightly chunky bezels the webcam isn't the best in the world but this is still the absolute best all-round 13-inch laptop you can buy and if you are a teacher or student you can get this for 8.99 which is insane it is all you need obviously the new m2a will be a little bit faster it's a little bit sleeker we've got the better webcam although you can always use your phone going forward so i just don't know if it is going to be worth paying that 200 250 pounds more for the new air i think for most people this is still gonna be all you need and for anyone who needs some proper pro levels of performance along with that mini lady 120 hertz screen and all the extras then the pro 14 or 16 is still gonna be a better option so where does that leave us as i ramble along for 10 minutes well i don't know we'll have to see no judgements just yet until i get my samples in to test properly there's a lot to talk about but whether it remains the best value option for most of us we'll have to see thank you so much for watching guys if you do want to see more from me including all my upcoming reviews and comparisons make sure you hit that subscribe button
