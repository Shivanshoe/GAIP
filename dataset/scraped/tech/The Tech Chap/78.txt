here it is all right here they are the new iphone 13s not physically in my hand just yet but apple have just announced the new mini 13 13 pro and the pro max mostly i think what we expected and i think it does feel a bit like a 12s in terms of nothing sort of revolutionary different but there is still quite a lot to unpack and while of course i will be doing full reviews and comparisons and all that good stuff so make sure you have subscribed this is my kind of first reaction here at apple ted lasso is at the center of everything we do so apple have just taken the wraps off their new base ipad and the upgraded ipad mini as well as the apple watch series seven although surprisingly no new airpods and of course also no new macbooks although that was expected for an october event anyway so while i think the ipad mini is actually pretty exciting i really can't wait to get my hands on that it is of course the iphone 13s that we've all been looking forward to so the headline upgrades across the board for the 13 series include brighter screens although only the pro series have the new pro motion 120 hertz a slightly smaller notch it's about 20 smaller a whole new range of colors although sadly no lavender or pacific blue the a15 chip the marketing is quite funny the iphone 13 and mini have chips that are faster than the competition but the pro and pro max have the fastest chip ever in a smartphone and that's because the pro models have an extra gpu core it's a 5 core gpu rather than 4 core in the 13 and 13 mini so a little bit faster the layout of the cameras on the 13 and 13 mini which just have the two lenses on our diagonal rather than on top of each other which is not the most significant change but a slight visual difference so you can identify the new models we also get improved cameras across the board with bigger pixel sizes so it lets more light in and therefore hopefully we should see a much better low light performance also all iphone 13s get the sensor shift ois which previously was exclusive to the 12 pro max but even the mini has that now we're also getting this very fancy new cinematic mode which does seem quite interesting as it automatically shifts focus between subjects or you can do it manually and also i think exclusive to the pro series you can actually adjust the focus and also the bokeh after you've taken the video which is pretty crazy on a smartphone the pro series can also now shoot 4k30 prores but going back to that cinematic mode and actually in the sort of tnc's about it it is limited to 1080p 30 which isn't 4k so obviously that is a bit of a compromise but it will be really interesting to see just how smart that auto focusing is and if it's really worth using because just like all the other pro video modes on pretty much every other phone we've seen cool idea not something i've ever actually ended up using but hopefully this will be different same price across the board actually no price increases which is surprising given the fact that we had the chip shortage and there were a lot of rumors that apple had to pay more for the silicon but apparently it's not being passed on to us so same prices as the iphone 12 series which is great to see and also a new one terabyte storage option so throughout the apple event i was making some notes and a few things stood out for me firstly there isn't really any uh exclusive feature now on the pro max which we used to have on the 12 series for example uh we had that sensor shift ois on the 12 pro max which the 12 pro didn't have so there was a actual reason you might want to go for the biggest most expensive version other than just the bigger screen but now it seems that the pro and the pro max share all the same specs except for battery life which does still appear to be a good deal longer than even the 13 pro so for a hundred pounds or a hundred dollars more than the pro the pro max gets you the biggest 6.7 inch screen versus 6.1 and also that much longer battery so maybe a reason to pay that little bit extra but you know what fancy new chips and upgraded cameras to one side the biggest upgrade with the 13 series i think is the battery life and if any of you guys have used a iphone 12 mini the battery life is a bit rubbish so even adding an extra hour and a half to that will make a bit of a difference so apple spent a lot of time talking about the cameras and i think that is one of the most sort of exciting upgrades that we all look forward to and across the board we should be looking at as i say better low-light performance but there are a couple of other upgrades including the fact that the ultra wide lens can now double as a macro so you can get super close to subjects again i'm not quite sure how often i would use that macro mode but having the extra flexibility is nice and also just with the quality of the iphone cameras generally this could be the best macro camera we've seen outside of the actual sort of microscope lens that we had on the oppo find x3 pro one thing that hasn't changed though is that with the telephoto lens we're still getting a three times optical zoom so from uh the ultra wide up to the telephoto there is six times zoom essentially i kind of had hoped as someone who uses the s21 ultra as their sort of everyday phone that maybe would have seen a fourth lens giving us perhaps a five or ten times zoom maybe they've used some sort of periscope lens i know that was a bit of wishful thinking but in terms of the iphone's photography abilities i think the only area falls down a little bit is with the zoom one cool feature i do like the idea of though are these new uh photography styles there are four of them and they give you a little bit of control over how the photos come out without just having to take a normal photo and then put a filter on it so you can switch between sort of standard and vibrant modes and kind of get a different style and hopefully we do see these expanded or maybe even more customization added later on so i think for me the three big upgrades are the improved cameras i was going to say the a15 chip because no doubt it is more powerful but it's harder and harder to really visualize and see those speed boosts outside of perhaps the fact that the isp unlocks new abilities for the camera so i'm going to stick with the camera upgrades the longer battery life and also that 120 hertz promotion on the pro and the pro max i know it's a really stupid thing to say but it's one of the reasons that i haven't really switched over to iphone yet but once you have gone to uh 90 or 120 hertz going back to 60 along with the pretty long animations that you get on iphone it does feel a bit slow in my opinion so i can't wait to get my hands on the 120 hertz promotion and the fact that it goes from 10 to 120 and it will dynamically adjust based on what's on screen and how you're using it means like the ltpo panels that we get on something like the s20 ultra the fact that it can go down to 13 even 10 hertz depending on what you're doing may actually improve battery life over the standard 60hz that we had before the question is though when i come to do a big battery test am i going to have them all at 60 hertz just because the 13 and the 13 mini are still at 60 or finally can i set them all to their default high refresh modes like that i think they should be because that's how people actually use them but then i get told after doing one area that does feel a little bit dated now i say a little bit a lot is the fact that we still have the landing port there's no switch to usbc which is not something we expected there was of course rumors about apple removing the poor completely which maybe they will do next year assuming the magsafe ecosystem takes off a bit more than it has so far but when you consider the only ipad remaining that still uses a lightning port is the cheapest base model even the ipad mini has usb-c which they made into a big feature and a bit of a selling point the fact that the iphones all of them the brand new iphone still use lightning is a bit frustrating it's not the end of the world for a lot of people who you know wirelessly charge they upload everything through airdrop anyway so it's less of a big deal than it used to be but come on just give me usbc so even if there is no giant revolutionary upgrade with the 13 series if you do fancy yourself buying one of these or you'll do an upgrade which one should you go for well you probably already have an idea based on what you're currently using and also what size of phone you want because that is a differentiator as well but if i was going to go out and buy one i will personally i'd probably go for the 13 pro max because i want the longest battery possible because when i'm out you know on a long day shoot then having that battery really does come in handy but when my friends ask me what iphone should they buy i would say go for the 13 pro it's about 150 pounds more than 13 but we get the telephoto lens we get the pro motion 120 hertz you get the lidar sensor it's less of a big deal but you're also getting that slightly faster five core gpu you're also getting three hours longer battery life according to apple's video playback claims and also the screens a little bit brighter they all have the same 1200 nit peak hdr max brightness but actually in everyday use the 13 pro and pro max can go up to a thousand nits versus 800 on the 13 and the mini the standard 13s also miss out on night mode portrait shots it doesn't support apple's pro raw or even the new upcoming pro res camera options so nothing really crazy different this year but i am looking forward to testing them properly and also seeing what those new cameras can do so make sure you have hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out my hands-ons unboxings reviews comparisons and also of course the new series seven apple watch and the new ipads which means i'm gonna have to make a whole new ipad buying guide again but so stay tuned for that so my final thought really is your move google let's see what the pixel 6 can do at the heart of it all the morning show which starts this friday
