[Music] nope stop everything this is not a tick tock video but this is the oneplus 9 pro and it's in this very fancy morning mist color which is supposed to look like the fog on a mirror fading away to be fair i think that's pretty spot on so i've got both new oneplus 9 phones with me here in their unique tall red boxes and you can see they're both 5g and have the new hasselblad camera branding i've got the 9 in this winter mist color which has a really nice purpley gradient to it each phone has three color options but i think they both look really good in the box we get the usual gubbins of some paperwork a simple case usb-c cable and i'm happy to say we're still getting a power adapter bundled in the box and it's the latest warp charge 65t charger how much do you ask well the oneplus 9 costs this much and the 9 pro will set you back this much which is not bad actually yes oneplus phones keep getting more expensive and the 9 pro is about 30 pounds more than last year's 8 pro but this is their flagship phone and it's in the same ballpark as the standard iphone 12 and the s21 and if you consider the galaxy s21 ultra costs 320 pounds more than this while it is expensive for a traditional oneplus i think it's really good value for money although i'll get to this at the end i think the oneplus 9 may actually be the one to go for so for this video i'm focusing on the 9 pro and i think there's four big upgrades really firstly it's faster with the latest snapdragon triple a processor and together with oxygen os 11 on top of android 11 i think this may actually be my favorite phone to use it's just so slick and fast while still offering a good amount of customization it's kind of like stock android but with the extra bits that you want oh and you can also now turn a photo into a canvas drawing for your always on display it is a bit weird if you use your own face though and it also doesn't like cats for some reason secondly we've got this new design as i say i've got this morning mist version but it also comes in pine green and stellar black we get griller glass 5 on the front and back not the latest victus unfortunately aluminium frame ip68 water resistance there's a corner hole punch selfie camera with a notification light next to it which also helps you see where to look at when you're taking selfies we're still getting oneplus's handy alert slider on the right hand side dual sim card tray on the bottom 5g of course although no micro sd support and we're also getting improved stereo speakers actually if i bring in last year's 8 pro you can see this is quite a departure from what we're used to we're back to a glossy finish and now with a much beefier camera module in the corner the 9 pro is actually a little bit smaller as well with a 6.7 inch screen versus 6.78 inches although i think a more significant change is the curved screen is now well less curved which i know a lot of people will prefer the third big upgrade is this screen it is still a quad hd plus 120 hertz amoled same as the apro but it's now using an ltpo panel which not only gives us faster response times for gaming but crucially it also supports variable refresh rates between 1 and 120 hertz so it can dynamically adjust based on what's on screen and oneplus says this cuts the screen's power use by up to 50 but actually i think the biggest upgrade with the 9 series particularly the pro is the camera and also this oneplus is partnership with hasselblad now every year we say how great the oneplus phones are but again and again they just can never quite keep up with the latest pixel galaxy or iphone now oneplus knows this so they've finally have put some proper effort into stepping up their camera game and so they got into bed with hasselblad hopefully mrs hasselblad is okay with that but it's exactly the right move and not just because we now have an orange shutter button that makes this classic hasselblad camera sound the million pound question though is what makes a good photo now i'm not a professional i will admit that i think you guys probably know but what i do know is that it's the combination of hardware so megapixel sensor size and the software the processing and the color science let's do an experiment let's see in a blind test if you will be able to pick out the difference between the oneplus 8 pro and the 9 pro so here's a couple of photos no edits or filters straight out of the camera one from the 8 pro and the other from the nine pro but which one do you prefer how about this one in tricky lighting i mean there's pretty big differences between them and finally a selfie now to be clear a and b are the same camera throughout here i'm not switching them up but do you reckon you know which is which well let me know if you got this right in the comments but a is the eight pro and b is the nine pro i think for this portrait shot it's a pretty clear win for the nine sharper much more natural colors and you can also see we're getting a slightly wider field of view as well this nightscape photo was a little harder to call but i think aside from a slightly flatter look it is the more realistic white balance and colors that stand out and finally the selfie and i think there's definitely a pattern emerging that the biggest difference between them is the color from the green t-shirt to my skin tones now if you said you preferred a on all of them then maybe oneplus and hasselblad need to go back to the drawing board but if you're like me then b was a clear winner so what's different well on a hardware level we're getting an all new 48 megapixel main lens which is pixel bin down to 12 megapixels but it uses a brand new custom sony imac 789 sensor and that's alongside a 50 megapixel imx 766 ultra wide lens which also doubles as a macro we're also getting an 8 megapixel telephoto with a 3.3 times optical zoom and finally a 2 megapixel monochrome sensor which gives you better quality native black and white shots if you're feeling a bit artsy and this new sensor brings with it faster focusing dual native iso 12-bit raw photo support and together with the new isp and the snapdragon chip when it comes to video we're now getting 8k at 30 frames per second and my personal favorite 4k 120 which is the first time i've seen this on a phone but the new hardware is only half the story and actually it's the software processing that's just as important and a big reason why the pixels and the iphones are so good although they do also have millions of photos uploaded to google photos and icloud that they can train their algorithms from oneplus doesn't but by asking hasselblad to help and developing a new natural color calibration as they're calling it the idea at least is we'll get more well natural photos now oneplus have said that this is a three-year partnership and with the 999 pro hasselblad have helped tune the software but there's no hardware changes so i am excited to see what comes next but for now i can certainly see an improvement and you can see here with my super professional color scene setup the 8 pro is a little bit over saturated especially the red box and actually if i bring in a photo from my sony a7 iii camera while there are still differences looking at the table and the banana the colors on the 9 pro are closer to the more professional camera and then in low light shots not only are we getting better dynamic range but the whole scene is better exposed and the cooler white balance is more true to life and it's not just the main lens that's had an upgrade the 50 megapixel ultra wide has an all new sensor and it uses a new freeform lens which reduces distortion so you get less of that fisheye look for me the only thing the cam was missing other than maybe a second zoom lens like we get on the s21 ultra is night mode for selfies now speaking of modes we're also getting a revamped pro mode uh with that hasselblad look and feel where you can tinker and get a fine control over the camera and there's also this new tilt shift mode which gives you a cool miniature feel to photos what i'm more excited about though is swiping over to video you'll see we get 8k 30 and 4k 120 so what's the point of 4k at 120 well firstly because we have a 120 hertz screen you can watch it back on the phone in hyper smooth 120 fps or what i like to do is slow it down to 25 speed in your video editing app of choice i use premiere rush and then you get this really cool 4k slow motion it's not something you'll use every day but it's a nice extra as is the support for ak-30 which is handy if you want to pull out a high-res 32 megapixel still so the camera is definitely a step up although i am working on a big nine pro versus s21 ultra versus iphone 12 pro max camera comparison to see how it really stacks up against those guys so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss it okay moving on and let's talk about battery life because usually the pro model gives you the best of everything right but in this case since they both have the same size 4 500 million power battery actually the standard oneplus 9 lasts a little bit longer after an hour of gaming youtube and instagram the 9 had 57 of its battery left versus 55 on the pro that's a full hd with 120 hertz so the 9 does benefit from the smaller screen although it doesn't have the ltpo panel on the 9 pro which offsets the difference a little bit and also reduces the impact of switching up to quad hd i wouldn't say it's best in class battery but it's still pretty good and that quad hd and 120 hertz which is how i tend to use it i'm finishing the day at 11 pm with about 30 of my battery left and we're looking at about 6 hours 15 minutes or so of screen on time but we are also getting faster charging the 8 pro from last year only offered 30 watt charging although the 8t introduced 65 watt but both the 9 and the 9 pro support warp charge 65 t which has the same maximum speed as the 8t but it can sustain it for longer because the battery is now a dual cell design so not to 100 takes 29 minutes plus on the pro we get 50 watt wireless charging which is faster than most wired charging on a lot of phones and it takes 43 minutes to go from zero to a hundred so there's lots to like here but as with anything there's always room for improvement and uh i guess it would have been nice to see the latest gorilla glass victus as i say we've got five on the front and back um this also doesn't support wi-fi 6e which is a shame also this isn't something i'd normally talk about but the screen protector which is on this by default is a lot thicker than i'm used to with your nail you can really feel it's a bit squidgy compared to other phones and i have found this made me miss a key press or two on the edge of the phone as i mentioned earlier a night mode for the selfie camera would be good to see and also selfie video still tops out at 1080p we're not getting a 4k option and i've also found the auto brightness a bit frustrating it always seems to be a little bit too dim so i found myself manually upping the brightness during the day but this is mostly nitpicking none of these are deal breakers so that's the 9 pro but what about its little brother the standard oneplus 9 which one should you go for well i think this deserves a full video by itself but the main differences are it's a little bit smaller with a 6.55 inch screen which is also flat rather than slightly curved it is still 120 hertz but we don't get the quad hd resolution or the ltpo panel importantly though they share the same ram same storage processor and battery and also the same fast wired charging but i think the biggest difference is the camera it's still a 48 megapixel main lens but it's using last year's imx689 sensor although we are still getting the hasselblad software and color improvements but we are also missing out on the telephoto lens but i think considering the standard nine is 200 pounds less than the nine pro starting at 6.29 if i was going to recommend one of these to a friend or you know you guys you're my friends that sounds very lonely but i would probably suggest going with oneplus 9. yes quad hd is nice as is the slightly newer main sensor the telephoto lens faster wireless charging but no those i think fundamentally changes the way you use your phone so for me i would go with the oneplus 9 but because oneplus kindly sent both i'm probably gonna stick with the nine pro but what about you which one would you go for the nine or nine pro or none of the above let me know in the comments below but i do still think that the likes of the s21 ultra and the iphone 12 pro max which of course are a lot more expensive do still outperform the nine pro when it comes to the camera but i am working on that big camera comparison also a full battery rundown test so make sure you have subscribed and stay tuned for that if you've got any questions or anything you'd like me to test let me know in the comments below and i'll see you guys next time right here on the tech chat thanks for watching
