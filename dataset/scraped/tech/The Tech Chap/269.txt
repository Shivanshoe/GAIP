hey guys Anton the tech chap and if you've just bought yourself a shiny new Galaxy S 20 yes 20 plus or s 20 ultra these are my top tips for setting up properly and getting the most out of it so I'm using the ultra right now but most of these tips will apply across the range and if you haven't already make sure you hit that subscribe button and turn on that little bell icon so you don't miss my next video all right so let's start by getting it set up properly firstly let's shrink those app icons a little bit so we can fit more on a page just pinch in or long press on the home screen tap Settings and then change homescreen grid to 5 by 5 or 5 by 6 now you'll notice by default that you have to reach all the way to the top to swipe down for the notification panel which is a pain on a huge 6.9 inch s 20 ultra so again jump into the home screen settings and turn on swipe down for notification panel now you can swipe down from anywhere on the home page to open it for the next tip open up the panel and then tap the little 3 dot icon at the top right and go to quick panel layout and if you turn on to show brightness on top then you can adjust it in the quick shortcuts rather than having to fully open a nav panel while we're here if you tap the 3d con again in an open status bar this is where you can toggle to show the battery percentage at the top I really don't know why this isn't enable the standard moving on and to save some battery and make all menus a little easy on the I jump into the settings go to display and in turn on dark mode if you prefer you can go into the dark mode settings and schedule when it comes on either by the Sun or your own timings but I tend to keep it on all the time number five and one of the big new features on the S 20 range is the 120 Hertz screen but it's actually not turned on my default so jump into the display settings again tap motion smoothness and then switch it to high refresh rate 120 Hertz this makes everything from swiping between screens opening apps and playing games that support it feel much faster and smoother however it does drain your battery about 25% faster than having a 60 Hertz personally I do like the extra smoothness so I keep it on but if battery life is more important to you than keep it at 60 speaking of speeding things up while the s20 czar incredibly powerful phones we can make things feel a bit faster by speeding up animations firstly go to settings then advanced features scroll down and then enable reduce animations once we've done that go to the above phone tab tap on software information and then tap build number seven times to unlock the developer options you see I've already done this scroll right the way down and then change wind animation transition animation and animated duration to either 0 or 0.5 times which is where I have it handled together this should make your phone feel a lot nippy oh just quickly guys a big thank you to Starbucks for sponsoring this video now I love my job but researching filming editing it can all get a bit exhausting sometimes so recently I've been drinking Starbucks is new double shot in 10 so which is just a caffeine boost I need to keep me going you can't miss the bright red bottle which is actually resealable if you want to save some for later and a hundred percent recyclable as well now I tend to drink my coffee black so I go with the double shot intense Oh black but if you prefer a splash of milk there's also the dark option they only cost one pound ninety-nine and you can pick them up in Saint Sui stores here in the UK check out the link below to find out more and why not grab a couple of Starbucks double-shot intensives next time you're in store okay next up let's turn on gestures by default we have these nav keys at the bottom but if you go into settings display and then scroll down to navigation bar tap on full screen gestures to turn them on so with Android 10 on the S 20 we get the latest gestures so now you can swipe in from the edge to go back which is very handy plus we get that a little bit extra screen back at the bottom where the nav keys used to be now Samsung's 1ui software is generally pretty good actually but there's a couple of things that I find a little bit annoying firstly we have Samsung daily which is the little newsfeed to the left of the home screen I just find it a little bit annoying sometimes when I accidentally swipe over when it starts to be freshing everything if you're like me and prefer not to have it just pinch in and then tap the little toggle icon on the top to turn it off now for some reason by default when you hold down the power button it activates big speed which absolutely no one wants to happen it's a power button so go to settings advanced features tap on psyche and unchanged press and hold to power off menu then it works as you'd expect it to while we're here though you can actually customize what double pressing the power button does as standard it opens the camera which is how I like it but you can make a shortcut to open any app you like all right let's move on to the camera and Samsung have moved things about a little bit here if you swipe over to the more tab you can then drag the camera modes you want to use like life focus or slow motion down to the main carousel so they're much quicker to access also while we're here new to all s 25th year is the ability to shoot in 8k with a rear camera which is kind of crazy actually however I'd avoid using a k' as well it's obviously incredibly sharp it's not a stable the frame weight is lower and the file size is a huge one minute of 8k is 600 megabytes I think it's more of a technical showcase than something you'd actually want to use right now another new camera feature is single take you can use it with either the front or the back cameras and over 10 seconds it captures a bunch of photos boomerangs filtered shots video it's kind of fun for messing about with but for more serious photos and avoid using it as you don't always get the shot you want it's up to the AI which one it picks now exclusive to the s20 ultra are the 108 megapixel where and 40 megapixel front cameras by default these super high res cameras actually combine pixels together so you end up with more manageable 12 and 10 megapixels respectively but if you want the full high resolution perhaps for zooming in on or if you're making a billboard ad for some reason tap the little aspect ratio icon and you can switch to the full resolution when it comes to unlocking the s20 we get an in screen fingerprint reader and face unlocking you can set both up but why I would recommend is registering your face and fingerprint twice as it adds more data and makes unlocking the phone a bit more reliable for face unlock adding an alternative look is useful if you wanted to recognize you with say sunglasses or a hat on there's also a cool feature called quick share that lets you transfer photos videos and files to other phones really quickly using Wi-Fi direct it's kind of like Apple's airdrop but for samsung phones and uniquely lets you share with up to 5 friends simultaneously I tested it on my s10 and no 10 and to give you an idea a 500 megabyte 8k video I'd shot me as 20 took just 12 seconds to transfer to my s10 not too shabby another handy feature is pinning apps open so they always open instantly in the recently used apps menu if you tap the icon of the app and then select keep open for quick launching then it'll lock could be a pin place so the phone won't close it and I'll stay in memory so then you can go straight back into it without having to reload you can only do with three apps all the way believe the 16 gig model of the ultra can do with five and then you can tap the little lock icon on the bottom to unpin it okay so that was 15 tips but I'll throw in an extra bonus one just because you guys my favorite so let me show you link to Windows which lets you use the phone on the screen of your laptop or desktop PC just tap the icon in the shortcuts menu sign in with your Microsoft account and then on your Windows PC openly your phone app and follow the instructions to connect them you can then use your phone through your laptop replying to messages making calls even copying photos and videos across with a simple drag-and-drop it's definitely easier than picking up your phone every few minutes to see if you have any new notifications so I really hope you guys found this video helpful and if you think I've missed out on any good tips then
