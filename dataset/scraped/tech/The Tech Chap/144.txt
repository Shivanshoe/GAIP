okay this is weird so i've got two galaxy s21 ultras with me here one with the exynos 2100 chip from the uk and one with the snapdragon 888 from the us and as you guessed from the title i want to figure out which one is better and if we can finally get some parity between the two models or if once again those with the xmos variant are just getting a bit screwed over i've been making these videos for a few years now i get the two phones which should be the same but then it turns out they're not and historically the snapdragon variant is quite a bit better um but now here we are with the s21 ultra and not only are my results not what i expected but they're not even what other people are getting i mean i've watched the runes excellent video on this and a few others but my results tell me that actually these two are pretty neck and neck which is actually great news because you don't really want a winner in this video these should be the same phone they're both s21 ultras and i'd say that it's as close as it's ever been although there are still some important differences okay let's start with performance and when i ran my tests and started to realize that my results were not the same as say mr who's the bosses i wanted to replicate one of his tests exactly so these two phones are set up identically and i fired up the antutu benchmark and from round one the scores are well pretty neck and neck but of course the big question here is about sustained performance so altogether i ran this test five times straight after each other and if i bring up all the numbers you can see that they trade blows throughout and surprisingly by the end the xnos is in the lead so a pretty surprising win for the exynos which is not what i really expected to see nor is it what i've seen other people talk about so i wasn't quite sure what's going on but i wanted to make sure there wasn't maybe something wrong with my snapdragon version so i actually uh went out and bought another s20 ultra myself and had it reshipped over here internationally as fast as i could which cost quite a bit of money but i wanted to make sure this video was as fair and as thorough as possible so with the two snapdragons and the one xnos they've all got the latest software all set up the same let's do it again let's go through five runs of antutu and from what i'm looking at there's two big takeaways firstly if you look at the two snapdragon phones i mean these are identical devices pretty much yet we're getting slightly different results secondly the exynos is slightly behind throughout but if we look at run 5 it's bang on the average score of the two snapdragons what is consistent though is that the exynos chip does run hotter it's a solid 8 degree celsius hotter before we even start the test and it's about 12 degrees hotter by the end so that is a bit concerning but so far at least it doesn't seem to be having any major impact on the results what's really interesting though is if i take my laser thermometer and then take an external reading of the two phones the snapdragon model is about 1.5 degrees hotter now these are different colors we've got the phantom silver versus the phantom black and that could slightly skew the results but even so we're not seeing that big internal difference in temperature reflected on the outside and in how hot it feels to hold but antutu is just one test and so after a half hour break so they've all cooled down properly i ran geekbench five and here they're all within a percent or two of each other within the margin of error really switching to opengl which is more of a graphics test and the exynos is way out in front speaking of graphics though let's run the 3dmark wildlife test because this is one of the latest benchmarks and should give us a good idea of the potential graphics performance and the exynos comes out in front by about four percent i then run it twice more and after the third test while they've all dropped a couple of hundred points the exynos is still winning although only by a few percent it's not really a big difference but there's still that big question of sustained performance and so after running the tests and then a 20-minute wildlife stress test on all three the scores are well pretty similar to perform the two snapdragons are within a percent of each other so again margin of error but the exynos has higher best and lowest loop scores okay enough benchmarks let's see how this translates into a real world performance will you actually notice a difference in using them every day well let's start with a good old-fashioned app launching test and going through a couple of games and a few lighter social apps and i did this test three times for each phone of course closing all the apps between the tests but in all three run throughs the xnos was just a tiny bit quicker by about three seconds again it's not something you'd really be able to notice in day-to-day life but from the three times i did this the exynos was faster every time even if it was only between two and four seconds okay moving on and let's see how they fare with a video export challenge i shot a minute long 4k video on both loaded it into premiere rush added a film color filter and some text at the start on the end and then timed the 4k30x board [Music] now my tapping of the timer is a little bit delayed so i'm going by the video footage as i'm editing this but the exynos takes a hair over 2 minutes and 18 seconds versus 2 minutes 37 on the snapdragon and i think one of the most significant results we've seen so far now throughout this video i'm trying to be as thorough and as fair as possible so running it again and the times are within milliseconds of the first run and again the snapdragon is 13 slower but what about gaming well i downloaded game bench pro fired up a bit of armor mobile ups which is quite a demanding game and it also supports 120 hertz and starting from the same load point on both i played the game for 15 minutes on each phone doing as close to identical moves as i possibly could and at the end if i put the results side by side you can see the median frame rate on the snapdragon is 115 versus 120 on the exynos the battery drain is exactly the same though at minus 8 per hour but we'll come back to this in a second but it seems to be yet another small win for the exynos however raw performance aside the ubiquity of the snapdragon chip does give it some advantages including developers potentially optimizing it better in their games for example in pubg you have to use the lowest smooth graphic settings to get 60 fps whereas on the snapdragon you can get 60 with the high or hdr settings plus you have the option of the ultra hd although that then does bring you back down to 40. but either way you're getting more graphics and more frame rate options with the snapdragon model so that's a lot of information to take in but my takeaway when it comes to performance not only have samsung caught up to the ten to twenty percent deficit we were seeing last year with the exodus 990 but it's consistently slightly outperforming the 888 in my tests cpu temperatures are higher on the xnos and in some games like pubg they just play better with a snapdragon chip due to the optimizations but if i had to say which is faster overall from my tests at least i've got to give it to the exynos which is not what i thought i'd be saying at all and i do appreciate it's contrary to what a lot of other people are saying but i can only share with you my results and i've tried to be as scientific as possible including buying additional phones uh for this video hmm so that's performance but what about battery life and if you're hoping this would be more clear-cut well it isn't unfortunately now you may have seen my big iphone 12 versus galaxy s21 rundown test from a few days ago and in that video where i go through hours of social media gaming 4k camera recording and video playback tests in the end the snapdragon model lasted 22 minutes longer than the exynos although given that's the difference between 9 hours and 4 minutes versus nine hours of 26 which works out to be about four percent difference it's not that significant funnily enough though when i ran all the benchmarks earlier the results were the other way around with the exynos a couple of percent ahead of the snapdragon so it does seem to vary based on what apps you're using now i'm not sure how helpful that was but again when it comes to battery life previously with the note series and even to a greater extent the s20 series from last year we were seeing the snapdragon version last a good hour or so longer than the exynos model but now well at most it's about 20 minutes and a couple of percent but really there's not that much in it now last but not least let's compare the cameras because the different chips also give us different isps so even though the lenses are the same the processing may be different these are shots side by side no filters or effects and without the scene optimizer which i've found can significantly change how a photo looks particularly the saturation and not always for the better but there's a clear difference in the warmth between these two shots and it's a similar story with this portrait photo of sarah the snapdragon leans towards a slightly more saturated slightly purpley hue although when we punch in i am drawn to the snapdragon model which looks quite a bit more realistic and higher quality again these are supposed to be the same phone it's kind of crazy another big difference is when you zoom in if we go through the different lenses when we get to 30 times the exynos is noticeably lighter and the building in the foreground is a lot sharper however at the still ridiculous 100 times space zoom i mean they're both totally unusable but you can see there's a lot of noise reduction happening on the snapdragon so it's smoother and well less noisy but at the expense of some finer detail that we see on the exynos [Music] now switching to low light and actually there's very little difference between them here this is a night mode shot and they're both sharp and have excellent dynamic range but there is a big difference with regular non night mode photos in low light and like when we zoomed in the snapdragon's noise reduction just smoothes everything out with the x-mas being a lot noisier and grainier although it seems switching to night mode does even the playing field here's another example first without night mode and it does seem as if the x naught is maybe going for a higher iso as it is brighter but at the cost of far more noise so i do prefer the snapdragon's regular low light photos but again with night mode it's pretty much a tie but let's switch to video and this is being shot at 4k in very tricky lighting and i actually had to triple check i got these in the correct order because low light video appears to reverse what we saw with low light photos this time the snapdragon is a lot noisier but we are seeing more detail whereas the exynos is overly softened but with a lot less grain so it's kind of a toss-up do you want a more detailed but grainier video or a super noisy but more detailed one so where does that leave us well my results do seem to contradict a lot of what other people are saying uh in other videos and online and all i can say to that is i don't know honestly i actually messaged aaron from mr who's boss uh to talk about these results a little bit he didn't know what to tell me i didn't know what to tell him but our results are just different and i know that we're both doing our tests as methodically and scientifically as possible and i've even tried to replicate some of the tests he's done i've even as i say bought a third phone uh for this test but it does show that performance in particular can vary significantly between benchmarks even between the same phone and so that can skew conclusions and so from my very extensive testing and i've been doing this for years now i have to say that i think the ex-nos is slightly faster than the snapdragon in the tests that i've run however i do still think the snapdragon model just comes out ahead when it comes to the camera but the thing is most of this is academic and a bit of a moot point anyway because unless you're gonna buy your phone internationally and reship it which some people do and i have for one of my phones here so while we can argue maybe debate about which is a couple of percent faster either way it's really not about that it's just trying to be able to prove that uh one territory or region isn't really being uh you know left out compared to another one which historically for the last couple of years at least we really have been here in the uk in europe and wherever we've got the exynos and i can tell you honestly that where i have switched to the snapdragon models of the s20 and the note 20 last year because well frankly i was not happy with the xnos 990 this year i'm actually happy to stick with the xnos s21 ultra so i really hope you guys
