hey guys i'm tom of techchap and in this video i want to give you some of my tips and also recommendations for what the best monitor or display is to pair with your macbook whether it's your shiny macbook pro 14016 or your air or really just any laptop whether you want something budget friendly or with pro level color accuracy for gaming maybe or even just you want the best overall bang for your buck i have also time stamped this video if you want to jump ahead and also i'll leave links to my recommended displays in the description below and if you enjoyed the video a cheeky like and subscribe would be lovely okay first things first how much do you need to spend well you can go from a couple hundred quid up to the best part of seven grand so it's important to figure out what features you actually need so you've gotta consider what you're gonna use it for if it's just a second screen for having discord on the side or watching movies or something it probably doesn't need to be this apple pro display xdr but then if you're color grading and video editing then you are going to want something with pro level color accuracy but before we get to all that the most important thing really and also probably most boring thing is this the cables the connections so right now i've got a macbook pro 16 via this thunderbolt pro cable which we'll come up to in a second uh paired up to this 6k apple pro display xdr this is a lovely setup would highly recommend if you've got like nine grand to spare between the two of them uh so that's not gonna be for everyone without getting too bogged down the best and most expensive monitors will offer a thunderbolt port and that gets you the highest resolution and refresh rates including data transfer and it'll also charge your laptop which means you can have fewer cables and you can keep your desk nice and tidy however if you're on more of a budget then regular usb c ports hdmi or display port will be more than good enough for most of us they all have pros and cons and different limitations and hopefully this table will give you a bit of an idea of what each one can do i'm telling you this stuff can get very complicated and could probably have a whole video just dedicated to talking about the difference between hdmi 2 and 2.1 and usb-c and thunderbolt it's a lot so all recent macbooks from the last few years have usb-c ports that support thunderbolt three or four and effectively they are the same thing again a whole video could be on that there are differences but they have the same max speed and what we're talking about today are basically the same so you've got thunderbolt on your macbook you then need a thunderbolt cable or a high bandwidth usb c cable and then also a thunderbolt display to give you the best of the best we do also now get an hdmi 2 port on these latest macbook pro 14s and 16s which isn't as good as thunderbolt but it can still get you 4k 60 and hdr now of course a screen like this doesn't have an hdmi input so you'll have to use an adapter but you're still limited by what's being output through this so at a very high level you've got thunderbolt 3 and 4 which is the best really you've got hdmi 2.1 which is quite rare especially on monitors it's more common on tvs which we'll talk about in a second and then you've got sort of display port which can come with usbc and then you've got just normal usb-c no display port no thunderbolt which can do sort of 4k 60 and some charging but not the same full amount of charging and then you've got the sort of lowest tier hdmi 2.0 which is to save can still get you 4k 60. that wasn't simple at all was it it is very complicated so it is worth reading reviews and also looking at specs for the particular monitor you're looking for so there's nothing wrong with a good old hdmi 2 monitor they are the most common the most affordable but mostly for this video i'll be recommending uh ones with usb c with external display support or thunderbolt three or four so let's move on and talk about size and 24 inches is still the most popular by far but personally i think a 27 inch screen is the sweet spot without being too big for your desk or too expensive now for me bigger is pretty much always better and with this 32 inch screen or indeed even that 38 inch ultra wide i've got over there you've just got more space for your apps whether you're having sort of side-by-side multitasking or you just want a more immersive experience 16x9 monitors are still the most common but taller 16x10 ratios give you a bit more vertical space or as i say you can go ultra wide with a 21x9 or 21x10 like i've got here or even a super duper thigh 2x9 ultrawide if you've got a massive desk and just want to go nuts the next thing to think about is resolution because you don't want to pair your shiny lovely macbook or whatever laptop you're using with a low quality low res display which just looks kind of rubbish when you've got them next to each other so tp full hd is absolutely fine on a 24 inch monitor but anything bigger definitely try and get 1440p or quad hd for a much sharper picture and if you need to see even finer detail then go for 4k it's absolutely worth it for graphical or video work and outside of gaming because it'll just destroy your frame rate there isn't really a downside to 4k except maybe it's a bit more expensive then there's panel type so rule of thumb avoid tn panels you don't see them as much these days but they're pretty cheap and also not very good at all the best overall i would say is ips you get good viewing angles great color accuracy but it is also worth considering va they often have better contrast even higher brightness but at the cost of some accuracy and then occasionally you'll run into a mini led or an oled option which also have their own pros and cons and are generally a lot more expensive it's also important to consider the color accuracy which means what you see on screen is truer to what you'd see in real life and then more representative of what others will see when looking at or watching your content so having a monitor with at least 100 srgb and ideally a 90 or higher adobe rgb and dci p3 is preferable some monitors like this and also the ultra wide which i use pretty much every day actually have dedicated color profiles you can go into the display settings and change to srgb or adobe rgb or p3 and then you can edit your content that way now this video is very kindly sponsored by the lovely people over at surfsharkvpn because i've been using surfshark for years and i always have it installed on my laptop phone pretty much everything and actually one account lets you use an unlimited number of devices and essentially a vpn hides your ip address and together with their clean web tool you can browse the web more safely and it helps to prevent tracking malware ads and other nasty stuff plus you can access region logged content so for me jumping between say uk and us netflix is actually really useful but the best bit is if you click the link in the description below or use the code tech chat at the checkout you get a massive 84 off and four months extra for free with a full 30 day money back guarantee so why not give surf shark vpn a try and the last thing to think about before we come to my recommended models is the refresh rate and normally this isn't something most people think about especially when it comes to second external displays especially for productivity but since apple introduced the 120 hertz promotion on these new macbooks which we also have on the likes of the surface pro 8 and the msi creator z16 more and more pro laptops are now offering high refresh rates and so as good as this is and it is very good as you would hope for well six and a half grand top spec but bear in mind you're going to have your nice smooth 120 hertz on here and then on your second screen it's going to feel slower because you're going to go back down to 60 which is why some monitors again like the one i've got over there are also high refresh it's 144 hertz so going between the two screens feels more seamless and it's just a bit nicer to use when it's a lot smoother so that's worth bearing in mind but realistically you're still fine with 60 hertz yes it won't be quite as smooth especially as we've been now spoiled by this but the vast majority of productivity and work laptops are 60. it's very rare to get something at high refresh unless it's more gaming oriented oh and also don't forget that if you have a recent ipad you can actually use the sidecar feature to make it a second screen for your macbook it's completely wireless and of course very portable it's an ipad so you can bring it with you okay so that is all the background stuff let's talk about some of my recommended monitors there's no room on my desk for this this is the dell ultrasharp u2720q and it is probably my favorite all-round monitor right now it is a couple of years old hopefully to do an update soon and it's not exactly a budget option but in terms of image quality connectivity and features it's a pretty easy recommendation the 4k resolution looks sharp on the 27-inch ips panel it's got great color accuracy the display hdr 400 spec is kind of the entry point for hdr but it's still nice to have downsides well there's no thunderbolt 3 support it is also 60 hertz and it doesn't get quite tall enough uh to sit above my macbook screen without having to go on a stand although the 14 should be fine i think overall it's a solid buy my other favorite is this asus pro art pa278cv which is around half the price of the dell but it's not far behind in terms of quality now i don't have one in the studio with me right now but i've tried it before and i think it's great and it's also a 27 inch ips although it drops resolution from 4k to 1440 and color accuracy is a little bit lower but still impressive and you can also switch between different calibration profiles viewing angles and response times are great and it even outperforms the dell with a higher 75 hertz refresh rate with adaptive sync vrr so everything feels a bit smoother there's usbc connectivity although again not thunderbolt but you do get 65 watt charging although the dell did offer 90. there's also no hdr support and overall contrast is a bit average but it's still a good option overall alternatively dell's s27 22 dc is a similar price and spec and is a more affordable version of the u2720q this is a really good choice if you prefer the dell design language although i think asus probably has the edge when it comes to color accuracy if you're on a tighter budget then check out the vue sonic vp 2458 for around 200 to 225 pounds or cheaper still this dell s24 21nx i know it's another dell but you can get this for about 160 pounds it is 24 inches full hd and you're not getting any of the fancy bells and whistles but you know if you just want a second screen to have your excel spreadsheets or have a better youtube on the side of something this is a really good affordable option and it's also worth mentioning if you are just going to go with a full hd 24 inch display then you don't have to worry about any of this connectivity stuff in fact the first third of this video because you can get everything you need just through a basic hdmi port which you can either do straight from the hdmi port on the new macbooks or via a usbc adapter but what about me what do i actually use well i would consider this but it is far too expensive so i use that the lg 38wn95c the huge 38 inch size and taller 32x10 aspect makes it feel a bit less letterboxy than most ultrawides plus we get decent hdr thunderbolt 3 surprisingly good speakers impressive color accuracy and a 144hz refresh rate with g-sync and freesync it is quite expensive at about 1500 pounds or so and it can be a little tricky to find stock but for my money it is not only the best monitor for pairing with your macbook but it's just the best monitor hands down although bear in mind while ultra wides and even super ultra wides offer a lot more horizontal space than immersion they do take up a lot more desk space especially curved models and also videos and some games will have large black bars either side but as good as that is it is not professionally color accurate in fact very few monitors actually are in terms of the sort of mainstream display market but this is also worth considering the apple pro display xdr as i say it starts from about four and a half thousand pounds and if you want to add this nano texture coating which makes it more matte and also this stand you're looking an extra grander piece together this is about six and a half thousand pounds which is obviously an eye-watering amount of money but if you're buying this as an investment for your business for your work uh then maybe it's worth the investment it's a 32-inch 6k 1600 nit peak brightness monitor with fantastic contrast and also a true 10-bit color panel which is quite rare and also the build quality and style are what you'd expect from apple this thing is a thing of beauty there are a couple of areas maybe that it's starting to fall behind technically for example it is still using an ips lcd display whereas we have the mini led on the macbook so actually we get a higher contrast on here although this does a really good job for what it is it's also 60 hertz still again 120 hertz over here so in a couple of ways maybe it doesn't quite keep up with the brand spanking new screens on these macbooks but then we do have other advantages like it's 32 inches and also because of this uh cooling and actually the two active fans inside which you don't really hear very often it can sustain the higher brightness for longer than even the macbook so actually this peaks at 1600 uh generally looking at a thousand for hdr although ui generally like this is 500 nits and apparently that's something people complained about when they bought this is that why am i not getting that 4 000 nits all the time well the answer to that is in mac os the ui is always limited to 500 nits but when it detects hdr content like youtube videos or your workflow and lightroom or premiere or davinci or final cut then for the content it'll boost it up to a thousand or 1600 in its peak and that's how that works and also we do have different color profiles on this as well it is absolutely stunning though and i kind of would recommend if you can i mean you're paying this much anyway to go for that nano texture glass it does really give you that matte effect and interestingly rather than just putting a matte film over the top or extra layer like most displays they actually etch into the glass to scatter the light and reduce reflections alternatively the lg ultrafine oled pro is a mere four grand and again this is aimed at professionals but the oled screen offers perfect black levels as each pixel can turn itself off individually and they're fantastic at displaying vivid and accurate colors the lg also gets usbc with display and 90 watt power delivery and plenty of adjustability slightly more reasonably priced though is the still great 40 inch dell ultra sharp u4021qw and if you're into photo work then the benq sc321c photo view has great color accuracy a big 32 in 4k screen and usbc as for gaming well this probably isn't your number one priority particularly if you have a mac yes you have the apple arcade some games on the steam library and maybe even you could stream it through geforce now or xbox cloud gaming but generally most people don't play a lot of games on the mac but if you are gaming then of course all these will be fine but to get the best experience you're going to want a high refresh ideally 144 hertz or above refresh rate and finally what about using your tv as an external screen instead so tvs use hdmi inputs so you need to connect directly to hdmi on your laptop or via usbc to hdmi adapter and actually tvs are a cheaper route to bigger screen sizes but they can take up a lot more space on your desk and sitting up close to one it can be tricky to see everything also if you're using an older 1080p tv then sitting up close won't do the sharpness any favors and also slower pixel response times can make the motion on some tvs blurrier than regular monitors but then if you're sitting in a distance with a long adapter cable then the exercise could be useful so those are some of my top picks and if you think i've missed out any great
