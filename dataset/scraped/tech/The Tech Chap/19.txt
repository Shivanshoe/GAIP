so many phones but the question is which one of these lasts the longest hey guys i'm done with techchap and it has been a while since i've made one of these big battery comparisons but i have been here hunched over this desk for well over 10 hours actually babysitting these as i try to figure out which one has the best battery life and if you do find this video helpful then a little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated now of course i do wish i could include every phone in this test although i don't think my desk would be really big enough but we've got some of the big players here including both s22 ultra models we've got the exynos and the snapdragon we've also got the two best iphones along with the pixel 6 pro the latest and greatest from oppo real me xiaomi and oneplus we've got the battery percentage at the top we've got some specs below and first thing to do is make sure that they're all set to the same brightness using this lux meter including turning auto brightness off for consistency which for the iphone is actually a setting hidden in the accessibility display menu also wi-fi only fresh restart background apps closed we've got 100 battery health all phones are set to their default display settings which is basically 1080p and adaptive 120 hertz plus all the phones have been used for at least a few days as battery life can improve over time as the software learns your usage patterns well firstly you can see that the iphones do come out front in terms of performance and the xiaomi 12 pro actually comes in last for stability because it does get quite hot and therefore it throttles more so already that made quite a dent in the battery lives but let's jump over to a bit of instagram because for this test i want to make it as real world as possible i appreciate i'm not fully outside using mobile data and actually using this in the streets but there are so many variables then and so going through social media gaming video recording all that good stuff hopefully this will give you a bit of an idea of what you can expect although of course as always your experience may vary and also it comes down to what apps you use now i do appreciate that all these phones support high refresh rates now uh adaptive refresh rates in fact with many of them supporting the latest ltpo2 technology so they can go between 1 and 120 hertz based on your usage which will save a bit of battery including the real me gt2 pro which does support that and this is actually the cheapest phone we have on test here okay so we're about an hour and a half into this test but one thing i do want to include for the first time actually is a standby mode test because it is now after nine o'clock at night way past my bedtime so let's see how much battery these lose overnight or over about 12 hours interesting look at that so most phones lose between sort of three four five percent over 12 hours although the iphone 13 actually lost nine percent which does seem like a bit of an anomaly i must admit i don't use the 13 pro as like my daily phone or anything so there's no hidden background draining as far as i'm aware so bit of an odd one that but let's see if it can regain some ground so let's jump into temple run two uh which is a sort of moderately demanding game so we'll run that for sort of a good 15-20 minutes or so and at around the two hour mark of course not taking into account the 12-hour standby time because that would just throw off all the results the iphone 13 is actually currently in last place now switching over to tick-tock which i must admit i am now on and if you don't follow me i am tom at the tech chat on tick tock and i try to make some videos but i'm pretty terrible at it but if you haven't already give me a follow then also on instagram at the tech chat but what is interesting is the different chips and the batteries that these phones have so most of them use the new snapdragon 8 gen 1 except for the s22 plus and the s22 ultra here which i have the exynos 2200 versions and also of course the two iphones use the a15 and we've got google's own tensor core chip in the pixel but in terms of the actual size of the battery a lot of them are now 5 000 million power that's a really good size except for the xiaomi 12 pro and also the s22 plus which are a bit smaller and of course the iphones which are the smallest on test and maybe suggest why the 13 pro isn't doing as well but then again the 13 pro max is in the lead with the second smallest battery and that just goes a long way to show the optimizations of the hardware and the software that apple can do but whichever phone you use i would definitely recommend putting a case on it which is why i've teamed up with the lovely people over at casetify who are very kindly sponsoring this video and where i designed these very snazzy looking new cases for my s22 ultra which are all nice and slim they use recycled plastic and they also have their unique defensify antimicrobial coating which actually eliminates 99 of bacteria not too shabby but most importantly they keep your phone safe and i actually have a few options here i've got this turtle bay designed impact crush case as well as a custom leather case with the tech chap there naturally and also my own personal top inspired impact crush case so let's try it out let's do a drop test with one of case defy's impact crush cases shoulder height straight onto tarmac and look at that not even a scratch so keep your phone safe and show your colors with caseify click the link below and bag yourself a fancy new case so at this stage the iphone 13 pro max is clearly in the lead it's a little bit concerning the pixel 6 pro not only has the slowest processor in terms of raw graphics performance and also a one of the joint biggest batteries but yet it is still falling behind in battery life again surprisingly the iphone 13 pro still isn't doing that well here and there's a big gap between that and the pro max the truth is though all these phones are very good in terms of battery life and will easily get you through a full day but we are seeing some differences and if you are a power user which i must admit i am and it's not something i ever want to worry about that so far for me has been a reason i'm drawn to the iphone 13 pro max the other thing to consider is that screen on time doesn't really tell you that much because you can see i've got my galaxy fold three on the right hand side as my timer that will actually win this test with the most battery but even though we have the same amount of screen on time it's just using the clock app so really it comes down to what you're using how you use your phone and so comparing screen on times doesn't necessarily tell you how long your phone is going to last now in my experience it is benchmarks and then gaming and then 4k video recording that are the big three drainers of your battery outside of you know the display and general power consumption so if you're not doing any of those three then these phones will last a good deal longer and so as we fly past the six hour mark the pixel 6 pro is in dangerous territory closely followed by the iphone 13 pro the galaxy s 22s are pretty similar actually remarkably i am a bit concerned about this 13 pro at 20 here but as you can see this is winning the latest 15.5 software same as the 13 pro max uh it is also a nearly new phone i've barely used it and we have a 100 battery health and there's nothing really unexpected that's draining the battery so not quite sure why it's not doing very well here and there we have it at the seven hour 22 minute mark we have our first casualty and it is to the surprise of no one really the pixel 6 pro still a decent seven hours 22 but it did come last in this test and also came last in terms of performance so i do love this phone i love the camera i love the software even though it's a bit buggy but it's not the best for battery life but then just over 20 minutes later the galaxy s22 plus runs out of juice at 7 hours 44 this does have one of the smallest batteries on test although a slightly smaller screen as well so a decent showing but still at the bottom of the pack but here we still have four phones in dangerous territory and it is the iphone 13 pro to go next at seven hours 52. i do still think there was a bit of an anomaly with a standby time so this could have lasted a bit longer i think if i were to repeat the whole test but still at nearly eight hours that is a very good time but then we have the galaxy s22 ultra this is the exynos version just shy of the eight hour mark but then there goes its brother the snapdragon s22 ultra which lasted 15 minutes longer so not a great deal more but there was a small difference there although i know a lot of people have different experiences so i reckon it comes down to a bit of a chip lottery particularly with the exynos version as to whether it is slightly better or slightly worse than the snapdragon but realistically there's not a whole lot in it and they'll both get you around eight hours and we are down to our last five until that is the xiaomi 12 pro bows out at 8 hours 26 minutes so a good 10 minutes or so longer than the s22 ultra and not bad at all although as we saw in the performance test this guy does overheat and also the camera isn't my favorite so it's a solid flagship but perhaps not my number one choice currently then a good half an hour later just shy of nine hours we have the oppo f5x5 pro which actually performed better than i expected or at least better than i thought it would versus this guy because in my comparison video they're pretty neck and neck so i'm not sure if this had a good day or this had a bad day but either way from this test at least the oppo lasts a little bit longer and we have our final three and it is close between the oneplus and the real me but there we go the 10 pro kicks the bucket at nine hours 38 which is very impressive for 101 plus considering this is also one of the cheaper phones on test here but look at that the real me gt2 pro 9 hours 42 minutes which gives it the silver medal and is not far behind the iphone 13 pro mouse to be honest this is a real surprise for real me and it is also the cheapest phone i've got here so i am genuinely shocked by how good this is but it does also mean the iphone 13 pro max unsurprisingly has come out on top with eight percent of its battery remaining and in fact it is the only phone to break the 10 hour mark 10 hours 25 minutes and so these are the final results the pixel 6 pro in last place i thought the iphone 13 pro would do a little bit better definitely surprised how well the real me and the oneplus did but of course the winner is the 13 pro max the thing is though love all hate iphones you have to give apple credit for giving us a phone that is not only the most powerful with the a15 chip but also despite having the second smallest battery in terms of the milliamp hour size we are by quite some margin getting the best battery life with this i must admit i had hoped the s22 ultras would have given the iphone a bit more of a run for its money i mean eight hours they're still very very good and of course they do physically have an s pen built in alongside a five thousand million power battery but it's not really any better than last year's s21 ultra in some uh situations i found it's actually a little bit worse so i had hoped that would be better but still very good overall as i mentioned at the start though pretty much all these phones will get better with use over time as the ai and the software learn your pattern usage so particularly i found with the pixel over weeks and months this will get a little bit better but it is still a bit disappointing given the lower performance and the big battery size that it does come in last place come on google you are now using your own hardware you're using your own software and building your own phones like apple i think you can do better so i do hope that was useful if you've got any other comments or if you've got any other phones you'd like me to include in my next battery test and any changes you'd like me to make let me know below and i will see you next time right here on the tech chat thanks for watching oh
