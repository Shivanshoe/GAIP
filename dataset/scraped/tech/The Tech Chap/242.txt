oh that's way heavier than I expected actually I'm probably not good for the MacBook Pro on the bottom hey guys I'm Tom a tech chap and I think if there's one eternal truth about tech it's that there's always something else around the corner but right now I think the tech world have kind of aligned in such a way that it's a great time to buy a new laptop even if everything else in the world right now doesn't seem so great okay so at number one and at the beginning of the year at CES we get to see a glimpse of the tech that's coming and now fast forward a few months it's starting to hit the shelves well virtual shelves take this guy for example it's the LG gram 17 aka the world's lightest 17 inch laptop I first saw this 2020 model with a new processor and bigger battery back in January but now it's out you can buy it yourself and that's the case with pretty much every brand we've got the new lineup of MAG books with all new air and pro 30 models Dells new XPS 13 and 15 laptops around now with the 17 inch coming out in June I've also got the brand new Microsoft Surface go-to with me here and also the surface book 3 is just coming out plus there's new Asus Swift's Asus Zenbook HP spectres razor blades gaming laptops I could go on forever but the point is this is the time of year where you can now buy a lot of twenty20 models of laptops and that brings me to the second reason I think now's a great time to buy a laptop the obturator the new hardware what these 2020 models actually give us starting with processors and every year there's a new Intel stick or any laptop and it means it's slightly faster but this year things are getting a lot more interesting for two reasons but firstly as you can see by this shiny little silver sticker down here we have Intel's latest tenth generation processors and they're a significant upgrade even in the last year I don't want to get too techie talking about ice lake comet Lake you series h-series and clock speeds but to take one example the new MacBook Air and the entry-level 2020 model I recently reviewed with an Intel 10th gen dual core i3 is 27 percent faster in my tests than last year's MacBook Air with a dual core i5 we also get much faster graphics but I'll come back to that at second but as impressive as that is I think it's actually AMD this year that's really stealing the show when it comes to processors their new Rison 4000 series of chips are incredible broadly speaking but these 4,000 chips often be more powerful more efficient and cheaper than intel's laptop processors and so laptops like the Zeus ROG Zephyr is g14 or the new asus swift 3 both with new rising processors offer great performance and also really good value but the bottom line is regardless of whether you go for 1/10 genin tell or a 4000 series risin we're getting much faster hardware and I can really make a difference when it comes to a photo and video editing gaming or just you know having more than 2 chrome tabs open at the same time but most importantly it means your laptop will last you longer you won't have to worry about upgrading for quite a few years but I think it's in the graphics department that things get even more exciting for example on laptops with Intel processors that have a G suffix such as the i7 1065 g7 I have in the gram 17 here we get Intel's fastest iris + graphics which is often around 50% faster than before and it's a similar story with AMD's Vega graphics built into their processors but while it's not exactly going to replace a gaming laptop the performance is pretty impressive given its just an integrated chip and you can get them in super thin and light form factors like this however if you're more of an enthusiast gimr or you're working with applications that need a proper dedicated graphics card then Nvidia's lineup can't be beaten right now on laptops from the GTX 1650 all the way up to the RCX 2080s super there's a lot of performance on offer and importantly there's something for most budgets for example Nvidia is brand-new r-tx super range of cards that in my tests offer a 5 to 15 percent boost in performance over the regular RTS cards while not a huge jump every frame helps especially in gaming laptops that have high refresh rate displays with the latest offering up to 300 Hertz so if you want a super gaming laptop you can now literally get one with a super graphics card but hold on because I think this is kind of overkill for most of us and certainly we're of our budgets so actually what I'm more excited about is how this new hardware is basically giving us this trickle-down technology so that we're getting faster better gaming laptops for a lot less money I mean now we can get an RT X 2060 laptop for under a thousand pounds so faster processors and faster graphics there are two big reasons why now is a great time to upgrade but it's not just about performance and specs there's some really interesting new designs and full factors of laptops that actually kind of make you want to upgrade just based on the designer so this is the Microsoft Surface go-to which I think is officially the cutest laptop in the world well technically 2 in 1 laptop it's had a spec boost over last year but they've also shrunk the bezel given it a bigger 10.5 inch screen and just made it an all around better laptop I love the size of this thing and it's also reasonably affordable starting at 400 pounds although for a decent spec and with the keyboard you're looking at about 700 then you have the new Dell XPS series I've got the 13-inch here the 15-inch should be coming next week and I love the trend towards taller 16 by 10 aspect ratios which gives laptops a bit more vertical space and I think makes them much nice to use coming back to the LG grammed there's thirteen fourteen and seventeen ish models but find me another 17 inch laptop that weighs less than three pounds we get a massive screen great for editing coding working watching YouTube and Netflix but in a super lightweight form factor that's really easy to carry around then there's dual screen laptops which are still kind of rare but definitely a new trend and last year's as Susan book pro duo was so much fun to use and now we have the new 20/20 Zenbook duo UX 41 which is a 14 inch version with later specs and costs about 1,500 pounds and while you may be thinking this second screen seems a bit gimmicky for me I found having my Premiere Pro Media Browser or a YouTube video twitch or discord on a second screen was really helpful so let's definitely want to look out for another option is the iPad pro which together with the brand new magic keyboard make this more into a laptop than ever it is expensive and probably not for everyone but depending what you use it for it could be a good laptop alternative so at this point you may be thinking Todd that all sounds great but I can't afford any of it well the good news is that a lot of this tech is also trickling down to more affordable budget laptops and as we saw with the MacBook Air even if you're getting an i3 or Rison 3 if you try to get one with a new a tenth general AMD 4000 chips they're going to be a lot more powerful than before or even if you don't care about the latest spec but just want something cheap and cheerful then I recently tested the Acer Aspire 3 which cost just 300 pounds and maybe is a second laptop for the house or something for your kids to do their schoolwork on from home it's great so I put links to some of my favorite 20/20 laptops in the description below hopefully you found this video helpful and maybe it's given you some ideas but let me know in the comments below what you're currently using and if you are thinking about upgrading which laptop do you
