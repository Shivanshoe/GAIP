okay I'm doing it I'm finally making this video by putting it off for ages because it seems like there's always been some other shiny piece of tech that's come up that I've had to drop everything in review but I'm finally gonna talk to you guys about Wi-Fi and about Reuters which yes isn't as sexy but it is important actually if you're anything like me well like the quarter of the world's population right now that's under lockdown you've probably experienced some internet or Wi-Fi issues at home so for example let's say you're streaming something on Netflix and maybe you've got a steam game downloading or you've got someone else in the house with you who's watching something or downloading something it can sometimes all crawl to a halt I've actually well I've been a bit of a rookie really I've just been using the basic route slash modem combo thing that came with that ISP the internet provider that I use so I finally done something about it I actually teamed up with the guys at Netgear who are currently sponsoring this video because they provided this guy this is the or B it is a mesh system so I have the routed down here or the router for my American friends plus a new satellite upstairs which I'll show you in a second and behind that we have my original Rooter modem so I'll tell you all about the orbit in a second but this video isn't just me showing off my new router which isn't the most exciting thing in the world but it's because I think now is genuinely a great time to upgrade your home Wi-Fi system because not only our mesh systems more common now like I have with this guy but also we're starting to see the first Wi-Fi six supported motors coming out so if you have a pretty recent phone or laptop the chances are that will support Wi-Fi six but it's no good unless you have a router that supports it as well so first things first let me show you what I'm getting in terms of download and upload just from the skybox the orbit isn't connected yet this is my current Wi-Fi I'm right next to it and we're getting three five and then upload about eighteen and a half then upstairs in my bedroom where I do have the will be satellite here but I've not hooked it up yet I'll probably put that down there so for now this is still just based off my normal route and we're getting 24 ish 23 and a half down I'm probably only about 20 feet away from the root so I've not got a big house 23 down 17 up but now I've plugged in the or B so this is the Wi-Fi 6 router and if I then connect to it on my phone this is the 1 plus 8 Pro which is a Wi-Fi X compatible phone so I'm not even using the mesh system yet this is just a single or B router instead of my previous one I've been using and we're trying to beat 45 look at that 70 71 I actually pay for 70 down that's what is in my sort of contract with the ISP so that's the fastest I've ever seen it at home actually all right let's run it again in the bedroom still not using the satellite just the one routed downstairs and look at that 36 37 38 52 we're still going 53 down that's more than double the speed we were getting before but the next thing to try is the mesh system that's part of the beauty of the Orbeez so this is the satellite you can place it anywhere in your house where you think you have a dead spa you know the furthest away from your main Rooter so let's get this plugged in and set up and see if we can beat the 52 mm EPS down we're getting up here uh-huh it's turn blue and you can now see it says one satellite and if I press on network map you can see we've got the Rooter there and then the one satellite here so let's jump back to the speed test nothing has changed at all except I've added a satellite for the mesh network so we're trying to beat 53.2 66 that's crazy 68 up to 53 now this is the real test because Wi-Fi 6 isn't just about your speeds it's how it handles multiple devices using the incident at the same time does it get clogged up does it through wattles so these four phones plus this one are all hooked up to my older Wi-Fi 5 Sky box so if I then jump over to Netflix so let's go into a bit of peaky blinders we've got a one-hour episode here HD episode so if we download all four of those start the timer and then also play my YouTube stream is just as going through my reviews playlist let's see how long it takes for the four phones to download it and also forget any buffering or issues with the YouTube stream here huh yeah do you see that had to freeze for a second to buffer so these two are done the third ones just about to finish and has taken three and a half minutes for this one to get to the quarter points so let's see if now these are finished if this speeds up and we're done seven minutes three seconds but let's see if we switch to the or be Wi-Fi six Rooter if we can beat this just in case there's any caching by you know we're moving this then we delay in this episode let's go for the second episode see if we can beat seven minutes three seconds so boom boom boom boom start the clock and then start the video see how we get on one two and nearly three almost exactly the same time I don't know what's up with the Samsung s20 ultra today it does not want to download very fast but three done yeah just before the two and a half minute mark let's see how far we get with this and we're done look at that that is the exact same test but nearly three minutes faster that's about a 35 to 40 percent improvement in speed while I've got them here let's just do one quick speed test this is running the older Wi-Fi 5 network so you can see they're all pretty limited there we're barely breaking 10 so we're looking at 8 11 14 and 7 so a peak of 14.2 will be or b or b or me go go go go straight away I mean no other phones before we're breaking double digits 1923 1816 so you went from a high of about was it 12 up to 23 point four so you can see how it's not just about pure speed with your own device if you've got a whole family in your home then this is going to improve everyone's life basically we also get useful features like the or B app which makes the setup incredibly straightforward unless you manage everything you need it also works with a Lex and the Google Earth system so you can use voice commands to control Network so for this video I've been testing the Netgear or B which is their top-of-the-line flagship all-singing all-dancing home Wi-Fi system specifically the rbk 8 v 2 which is the twin pack but you can also get it in a three pack and this will say back 700 pounds so this is a mistake ibly a premium option but if you're looking to invest in Wi-Fi SiC someone the best of the best well this is it but the good news is Netgear also has their Nighthawk range which also supports Wi-Fi 6 and starts from about 200 pounds so while your experience may vary if you're ready coming from a pretty good Rooter then you may not see quite the same upgrades Wi-Fi 6 is a good investment it is the new standard it's gonna make it a lot more future-proof you're not gonna have to upgrade for quite a number of years and of course number of devices that we all have from our phones laptops tablets and all the IOT stuff so like your smart fridge yep smart robot whoo very TV all that stuff the number of devices in our house is only going to grow this can actually support over 60 devices and so that's really where Wi-Fi 6 comes into its own being able to support so many more devices let me know what you guys think of the Orbeez system and also Wi-Fi 6 and if you think it's worth upgrading to a Wi-Fi 6 root is this router system now let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys hit that like and subscribe button down below if you want to see
