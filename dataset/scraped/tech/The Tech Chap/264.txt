hey guys Anton the tech chap and this is the new 2028 Pro I've got the top spec 12 point 9 inch version here with all the bells and whistles so this year is actually the 10th anniversary of the iPad and this is the 4th generation of the pro model and while there are a couple of nice little upgrades here and it goes without saying this is the best iPad yet it still feels just a little bit underwhelming don't get me wrong this is absolutely the best tablet in the world if you can afford it and quite frankly iPods have dominated the tablet market for the past 10 years but there's just not a whole lot new here or at least not that you and I would notice in everyday use so these are the headlines we get a slightly faster a 12 Z processor 6 gigs of ram previously only the one terabyte iPad pro had 6 the rest of four gigs double the storage on the base model a new ultra wide camera lens a lidar sensor for more accurate augmented reality we now get five high quality microphones built in plus the latest Wi-Fi 6 and the LTE model supports more bands than before but there's still no 5g here unfortunately and that's pretty much it same design by the camera module same 120 Hertz LCD screen same battery same accessories same experience really I mean the best bit is the fact that we do now get 128 gigs on the entry-level model up from 64 and it means most of us can go for the cheapest one without worrying about running out of space now you can get this in any color you like as long as it's light or dark grey well silver or Space Gray a few other options would have been nice but it's still a great looking tablet it's just five point nine millimeters thick and for its size it's incredibly lightweight and while some people aren't a huge fan of this sort of industrial aesthetic I quite like it the bezels are as thin as I think you could get on a tablet while still being able to hold it and for unlocking we have the same fantastic face unlock using the front camera and IR sensor I was kind of hoping that we'd see Apple introduced their rumoured upcoming micro LED screens on this or at least jump to OLED because while the LCD screen on this does look really good with the smooth 120 Hertz promotion great viewing angles wide color gamut 600 nits peak brightness it really is a beautiful screen but it still can't match the contrast or the super deep blacks of your phones OLF screen so watching a Netflix movie in a dark scene or looking at the black bars they can look more gray than black my understanding from Apple is the having a 120 Hertz screen with OLED at their size is just too difficult to manufacture or at least too expensive also it still doesn't technically support HDR either apple says the screen would need to be at least a thousand NIT for them to call it HDR although account stream into your 10 and double vision video to your compatible TV so that's fine but we are seeing most 20/20 high-end phones offer a high refresh rate and OLED screen and full HDR support granted they on as big as this but it would have been nice to have so I think the most exciting iPad news is the upcoming magic keyboard with a proper trackpad USBC passive charging and a really cool magnetic design unfortunately it's not out until May so I don't have one to test yet and it'll set you back either $2.99 or 349 depending on which size of iPad you have that's a lot of money in the meantime to give you an idea of how it would work I've hooked up my Magic Mouse to and you can see the little round cursor icon you get it feels pretty intuitive actually and there's a kind of auto aim that helps you lock onto icons it feels a bit like the Apple TV interface now using a mouse and keyboard on an iPad still feels a bit weird but Apple really are closing the gap between tablet and laptop although this is still definitely tablet first unlike say the Microsoft Surface pro 7 or their fancy new Pro X we're just solid laptops but Windows 10 on a tablet is still a bit rubbish still I am excited to try the magic keyboard and they will make a whole new video about that testing it with this when it comes out in May so stay tuned but the thing is it's not actually exclusive to the new 20/20 I pad it will work with any iPad pro so if you already own one of the last three generations of pro then it's not really a reason to upgrade question for you guys though since Apple just launched the new MacBook Air at the same time as this and actually for similar money would you want to see a versus video between the two give me a thumbs up below if you would and I'll try and make that next week so as you know the iPad pro comes in two sizes eleven and twelve point nine inches which is where I have here although I wish they just call it the 13 to keep things simple now I also have last year's 11 inch model side-by-side sighs would you go for I must admit I kind of prefer the smaller one it's more subtle when I'm using it out and about say to watch movies on a plane or train it's just more comfortable to hold plus it's a good deal cheaper now of course most normal people don't upgrade their iPads every year it's probably more like every three or four years so it's unlikely if you own last year's one of these that you would upgrade to this but I wanted to compare the two together to see just how much better the new one is or if in fact maybe a secondhand 2019 model is the better bet well in terms of performance in Geekbench 5 the 2020 model is just 0.5% faster in single core and 1.8 percent faster in multi-core performance it's a little more promising in terms of graphics with a new 8 core GPU but we're still just looking at a 7.5 percent boost you can kind of see why they're calling this the a12 said rather than the a 13 eggs it's a fairly insignificant upgrade and you're not likely to notice any real-world difference but you know what that's okay this is still ridiculously fast especially with a 120 Hertz screen jumping between apps having to in split view playing the most graphically demanding games it never skips a beat and to be honest it's already got far more power than any iOS app needs and that's kind of what's frustrating so this is running iPad OS 13.4 and it's closer than ever to feeling more like a laptop but we asked are limited to iOS apps or tablet versions of desktop programs and that's fine for most of what I need to do Google Docs Office Lightroom social Spotify Netflix YouTube the odd game or drawing app you know the usual stuff but iMovie and premiere rush just don't cut it for me when it comes to video editing and the still no Final Cut Pro logic or even a decent Instagram app however the fact that you can plug in a storage drive or SD card from your camera assuming you have a USBC adapter is really useful for transferring files and then editing or uploading them and then paired with a keyboard and maybe the Apple pencil it really is a very versatile bit of kit now a quick mention of the cameras because we get a 10 megapixel F 1.8 main lens and a new 12 megapixel F 2.4 ultra wide and photos do look good shooting at 4k with the rear cameras I'm not really seeing any difference in quality here if you look at the light bouncing off the wall for my Philip's here you can see there's no real difference in how it handles the highlights so darker areas apologies for the mess it's pretty similar actually yeah it's a more realistic but what you can then do is switch to the ultra white camera which obviously you can't last year's model so white is good but if you also one who uses their iPad for the camera and no judgments then this may be a decent upgrade and a good reason to go for the new one so in this crazy world at the moment I think facetiming video callings can be more important than ever I just wanted to give you a bit of an idea side-by-side of how they compare now one of the most talked about new features is lidar which stands for light detecting and ranging it works in basically the same way as a time of fly or tof sensor that we've seen on a lot of recent smartphones and it's used to measure depth to be honest there isn't really a whole are use for it right now there aren't many optimized apps out there so I will test this again in a few months but right now the best sort of way of showing it off is with Apple's own measure app which now unlike previous iPads doesn't need to be moved around for calibration it works straightaway it's also more accurate it can handle more complicated surfaces and you can zoom in to get more precise measurements it will be interesting to see what developers can do with this but as I say right now it's more of a tech demo than it must have feature as for battery life it's exactly the same as before but you know what that's fine I have zero complaints Apple claim that you'll get 10 hours of video watching from this on Wi-Fi and 9 using LTE and that's pretty much bang on what you get this is out of all the products that I carry around your phone laptop tablet honestly I never worry about the battery on this thing granted I don't use it as much as my laptop or phone but I've never had a problem with this now charging speed using the bundled 18 watt charger it takes about an hour and 40 but you can always buy apples optional 30 watt fast charger or if you have a higher power macbook charger you could use that too for faster charging but it might degrade the battery a little bit quicker over time so then the big question should you buy the new iPad pro 2020 well if you want the best tablet in the world then yeah absolutely but it's not worth upgrading to if you own one of the previous pro models and I think personally I would go with the cheapest 11 inch model of this maybe with a smart cover and then perhaps in a couple of months look into the magic keyboard however if I were recommending an iPad to my friends then I probably wouldn't go with the pro I dressed the iPad air because it's a good 300 pounds cheaper and to be honest the vast majority of people don't really care about 120 Hertz or the super thin bezels or lidar or all through my camera those sort of things they just want a good iPad and while we also have the basic iPad as well as the iPad Mini I think the iPad air is kinda like the best all-rounder right now so while there are a few improvements here and there it's just not that big of not grade this year so I think maybe given the crazy times we live in at the moment if you are looking for a new iPad and you want a pro model maybe a secondhand 2091 is the best value option but what about you do you think apples do enough here and if you were to buy this would you go for the 11 or the 13 inch version let me know in the
