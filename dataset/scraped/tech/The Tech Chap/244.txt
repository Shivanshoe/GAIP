hey guys Anton the tech job and if you're looking to buy a new MacBook Pro 13 which one should you go for so I've got two models here they're both the latest 2020 versions of the 13 but this is the entry-level spec it'll cost you 1,300 pounds or $1300 and essentially comes with last year's specs including an 8th gen Intel processor a slower ddr3 RAM although we do get double the base storage 256 gigs versus last year and also the updated magic keyboard but really the 20/20 model of the pro 13 is this guy which comes with 10th gen processors faster ground faster graphics more fillable 3 ports along with the improved magic keyboard but it will cost you 1,800 pounds or $1,800 so the question is is it worth paying 500 extra for this model well let's break down the differences and starting with the processor because that's the most obvious difference between these guys on the entry-level model which is known as the 2 Thunderbolt 3 version we get an Intel 8 gen I 580 257 u which is a quad-core chip clocked at 1.4 gigahertz versus this guy which is known as the for Thunderbolt 3 model because as you can probably guess from a name we get for Thunderbolt 3 ports versus 2 on this one but we get a tenth gem processor specifically the i5 10:38 ng7 which is a 2 gigahertz quad-core chip so that's part of it we get the latest processor but along with that we also get faster integrated graphics because neither of these offer any cams dedicated GPU options so in the cheaper model it's actually the same as last year and we get the Intel iris + 6 4 v graphics versus what's simply known as Intel iris + graphics in the more expensive one names aside the key takeaway without getting too technical and nerdy and boring you all to death is the integrated graphics in here has 48 execution units versus 64 execution units in this guy and of course I'll test all that in a second but straight away more powerful graphics as well as a more powerful processor we also get faster RAM starting with 8 gigs of ddr3 2133 makers ram vs 16 gigs of DDR 437 33 megahertz Ram I think I've got that right and we also get 512 gigs of storage with this versus 256 here we also get four Thunderbolt three ports on the more expensive one versus two on the cheapest model and actually this one uniquely has what Apple called their display stream compression technology which lets you output to a 6k display which most likely will be Apple's old pro XD our display and so with this one you can output to that at full resolution at 60 Hertz I bet this have become a lot more technical than you thought it would be clicking on the video about which MacBook Pros live by but it really is all about the internal specs so with that all said now you know the difference is let's run some tests let's see if it's actually much faster well let's just fly through these because I don't want to get bogged down in numbers but in Cinebench r20 the 4 thunderbolt ii model was 22% faster engage bench 5 it was 31% faster in single-core and 11% faster in multi-core and then in Geekbench 5s graphics tests starting with OpenCL it was 11% faster and in metal it was 20% faster and finally for a real-world test I loaded up file Cut Pro and timed how long it would take to export a 10-minute 4k h.264 video the highest spec for Thunderball 3 model took 13 minutes and 39 seconds whereas the two Thunderbolt 3 base model took 50 minutes and 10 seconds so it was 11% slower so let's say that's quite significant difference actually but what about in terms of battery life does this extra performance have an impact on your battery well surprisingly no um one hour of 1080p YouTube with 75 percent brightness used 10% of the battery on the high spec model versus 12% on the cheaper one and then jumping into an apple arcade game for an hour which just completely destroyed the battery life on both but I was left with 21% on the high spec model vs. 19% on the cheaper one so while your experience may vary it seems that this while being more powerful isn't any less efficient if anything maybe it's even slightly more efficient with the new tenth gem processors there's not really much in it though I mean 1 2 % battery life and that could be within the margin of error but most importantly it's not significantly more sort of draining on your battery ok enough of me waffling on which one should you buy is it worth paying 500 pounds more for this guy over the base spec well in my opinion yes it is out of the 6 benchmarks I ran on average this is 19% faster than this now of course that will depend on what apps you use and also how intensive sort of the applications that you run are but overall as a solid upgrading performance and I have to say it doesn't quite sit right with me that we're buying a 20/20 refresh of the mapa Pro 13 but getting identical 2019 specs or being with more storage and a much better keyboard it is expensive at 1,800 pounds or $1,800 but I would say this is worth it over this I mean we're getting double the storage double the RAM two extra Thunderbolt three ports and around 20 percent faster performance so who should actually buy this one well it's interesting because for 300 less you could buy the cheapest MacBook Air although the advantages of the pro even this base model is that we get a slightly brighter screen 500 minutes versus 400 on the air we also get a slightly more accurate screen it covers a wider p-3 color gamut we do also get the touch bar on the pro and like the air which just has a normal function key so that actually may be a reason to go for the air because I know a lot of people aren't a fan of the touch bar personally I don't mind it I've got used to it a little bit customisation you can get some extra functionality Alamut but it's not a big deal but well I haven't got all the MacBook Air models to test so I can't see whether the i7 is faster than this I 5 versus at least the base model which is a dual core i3 interestingly though we got a similar single core performance although the two extra cores and the pro-gamers nearly doubled a multi score although in terms of graphics the cheapest pro is 28% faster in the OpenCL Geekbench v test versus the cheapest air but then really if you are thinking about performance and you are thinking about the differences between i3 i5 or i7 s then really this is the one you're going to want to go for because it is significantly faster than this so hopefully that's helped you answer the question of which one you should go for or maybe even made you realize that you don't want to buy either of them now because they're just too expensive either way let me know in the comments below which one you'd buy or yeah if nandi above thank you so much for watching guys and if you do want to see more from me then hit that little subscribe button down below I'm actually getting reasonably close to that 1 million mark so any help from you will be massively appreciated and I'll see you next time right here on the texture
