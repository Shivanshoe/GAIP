hey guys Anton the tech chap went over the past few weeks I've been testing out the new redmi note 9 pro from xiaomi they were kind enough to send it over and also I put a sponsor this video although as always all my opinions or a hundred semi owned now I'll hold my hands up and say that I'm guilty of covering too much super expensive super high-end tech on this channel I mean with more and more phones costing over a grand I know that most of you guys and you know most of my friends simply don't want to spend that kind of money on a phone which is why I'm actually really excited about this guy the note 9 pro which costs just 269 pounds here in the UK so once I give you guys my experiences and impressions of the phone just keep that price in mind throughout and I think at the end I'm sure you'll agree with me that this is stunning value for money alright so let's get the specs out of the way first and what really stands out is that huge five thousand and twenty milliamp hour battery the quad lens camera setup and the fact that we get Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 720 G processor which is kind of an upper mid-range chip but I'll come back to this in a second design why is this really doesn't feel like your ordinary budget slash affordable phone we get this huge six point six seven inch screen with a center hole punch cutout for the selfie camera and despite a slightly thicker chin and bottom an almost edge to edge screen we also get Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back and with this fancy interstellar great model I have here we get this really interesting sort of smokey reflective quality to it I actually really like it plus it's not too bad at picking up smudges or finger prints although it is very slippery so I would recommend a case or the fortunately we get one bundle in the box you'll also be pleased to see that we get a three and a half mil headphone jack on the bottom beside the USB C port and the speaker grille although unfortunately we don't get stereo speakers here now you may be wondering where the fingerprint really is but it's actually built into the power button so with just a single press you can actually turn it on and login which is pretty handy although you also have the option of using face unlock with a selfie camera if you prefer so far so good then but what's it actually like to use well we get Android 10 with Xiaomi's me away 11 software on top and the first thing I usually do with new phone is turn on dark mode which you'll find in the display settings then I switch the Android Nav buttons to gestures although right now with an online doesn't actually support this but the good news is there is an update on its way which will add gestures so I think the me UI software has come a long way in the last few years it's much cleaner and lighter than in the past left of the home screen we get the Google News Feed plus there's loads of customisation options my only criticism really is there still loads of pre-installed apps aka below where although it only takes a couple of minutes to hide them in a folder or just uninstall them what I would suggest though is while it's generally pretty quick to use the animations are quite long so to make everything feel a little bit snappier jump into the about phone settings tap me UI eight times and then in the developer options scroll down and reduce animation times to 0.5 this makes everything feel just a little bit nippy er although to be fair I do this with pretty much every Android phone so the Newton line pro packs in six gigs of ram which is plenty and also combined with that Snapdragon 720 G chip it's actually surprisingly capable firing up some Call of Duty mobile or Mouse fault 9 and it played flawlessly of course we do any have a 60 Hertz screen rather than 90 or 120 but it really goes to show you don't need to spend a ton of money on a flagship phone to play games well speaking of the screen though we get watch yummy cool dead dot display and while it does use an LCD panel rather than OLED quite honestly you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference it looks great whether you're watching videos or gaming now what about that camera well this is definitely one of the highlights and here the specs of the quad lens setup including a 64 megapixel F 1.9 main lens it does miss out on a telephoto lens although for me the ultra wide is more important so here's a few shots I've taken with the new 9 pro over the last couple of weeks and first of all yes you can turn off that watermark that's on by default but keeping that 269 pounds right in mind the quality is impressive so in addition to the ultra wide and the main lens we do have the option to zoom in by two times although it's digital rather than optical also by default the main lens uses a technology called pixel binning to combine 4 pixels into one so we get 16 megapixel photos but there is a mode to shoot in the full 64 megapixel resolution if you prefer to get the highest level of detail the note 9 pro also does a decent job in low-light this is generally where cheaper phones really struggle but the good news is we do get a dedicated night mode which longer exposure so here's a couple of before-and-afters and you can see well sometimes it goes a little overboard on the colors generally it works quite well of reducing blown out highlights and browning up super dark scenes of course it won't quite compete with flagships that cost four times as much but again for the money I think it's more than good enough for most of us and then finally around the front we gay 16 megapixel F 2.5 selfie camera but with decent lighting I think it takes a good selfie it's just a shame about the face so I'm shooting this at 1080p with the rear camera and you can see the quality is pretty good actually and also it is nice and stable there's not a whole lot of Judaism walking in a fairly brisk pace so it's doing a good job of stabilizing the video now what you can't do is shoot in 4k actually which is not something that these sort of budget phones often offer so it's nice that we do get that option but you can see it struggles with the stabilization so I think I recommend sticking with 1080p at 30fps as for front-facing video well if I just have a little walk around my living room and change the lighting hopefully you can get idea with the quality it maxes out at 1080p 30 there's no 60fps or even 4k unfortunately but I think for most people dainty piece that he's absolutely fine especially if you're you know sending these videos to other people then you want to keep the file sizes down but quality looks pretty good even though I'm very backlit there my face is still quite well lit but yeah what do you think not too bad to them okay so here's a question if I were to ask you what the three most important features of a phone are I bet they'd include price camera and battery life i but it's those three and with a whopping five thousand and twenty million power cell combined with an efficient mid-range processor and full HD plus screen I've been getting close to two full days of use from the no 9 pro it's so good to the point where I really don't think about it so I can just watch movies and play games all day well I wish I could I do need to work at some point and also the 30 watt fast charger will top you up to 40% or nearly a day's use in just half an hour so with all that said the no.9 pro is easy to recommend I mean it misses out on a couple of higher-end features like there's no 5g support and also you know it'll be nice if we had a high refresh rate screen although of course that would also reduce battery life but for the money I think this is one of the best value phones you can buy right now oh and even better it's actually on sale until the 28th of June which knocks 20 pounds off the price I put all the details and length in the description below well what do you reckon would you be tempted by the known
