hey guys I'm Tama Tech Japanese probably heard that the camera on the Huawei p40 Pro is very very good I've done a whole bunch of camera comparisons and I would generally say that people who Pro has the best way camera for photography of any smartphone right now and it's not just me it even got the highest score on DxO mark at 128 so when we got in touch and asked if I wanted to make a video of my experience using the camera so far I thought it could be fun and I particularly want to focus on the photography elements and to be clear every photo and video that I'm gonna show you in this video I've taken on this phone no filters no edits and as always all opinions are my own so we get four lenses a 50 megapixel F 1.9 main lens 40 megapixel F 1.8 ultra wide 12 megapixel F 3.4 telephoto lens and the time-of-flight 3d lens for depth sensing and between the three main lenses you can go from 0.7 times zoom with the ultra wide up to 5 times optical zoom 10 times hybrid and then you can pinch in all the way up to a 50 times digital zoom but as you guys know it's not all about megapixels so the p40 pro also packs in a brand new one over one point two eight inch sensor always our yyb technology instead of a usual RGB and it uses pixel binning to combine four pixels into one which all works together to give us brighter sharper and better looking photos for me at least a big part of having a good camera on my phone is that i can just whip it out as they say and point and shoot and take a good photo without you know grabbing my DSLR and making a whole meal of it and the truth is with the p40 pro it is just as simple as opening the camera app and tapping the shutter button the cameras master AI automatically optimizes the settings based on scene and object recognition blue skies greenery flowers pets stage performances text even portraits so you don't have to jump between different modes if it detects the face it'll switch automatically so you get that nice bouquet blur now to be fair a lot of this isn't new but Huawei keeps improving the AI and together with a new camera hardware it means that p40 pro is one of the best point-and-shoots you can buy you can of course turn master AI off if you prefer just tap a little icon in the camera app and it turns off anyway if you switch to the moving picture mode which you need to have on for a couple of features I'll come back to in a second and of course it's turned off in pro mode so you can still take full control if you want what I would suggest though is jump into the settings menu and then turn on the assistive grid and horizontal level it just helps make framing your photo a little bit easier so in the camera app we have the usual range of modes but there's a few I want to highlight firstly we have aperture which is basically portrait mode but not for people it's for when you want that bouquet blur when just taking a picture of any object and you can adjust the aperture so the depth of field can be as shallow or as deep as you like Pro Mode which as it says on the tin is for those of you who like to tinker with the settings adjusting things like the ISO focus white balance and shutter speed plus you can shoot in RAW and at the full 50 megapixel resolution so if you want the highest quality photos possible that you can then edit and pull even more detail from pro mode is your best bet swiping over to the more tab reveals a whole bunch of extra modes and you're probably familiar with most of them I really like the high-res mode which lets you shoot in the full 50 megapixels like you can in pro mode but without worrying about all the other settings then we have dual view which is actually a video mode but it lets you shoot with two lenses at the same time and you can also just the zoom on a telephoto lens I'm not sure how often I'd actually use this but it's a nice option to have light painting is pretty fun as well and here's one I made earlier we've also got slow motion and well yes it isn't on a video mode and I'm mainly focusing on photography here I just had to show you this I was just playing around with slow-mo on my walk yesterday and I managed to get this shot I know it's a touch and I focus but it's incredible what smartphones can do these days and this is at 960 FPS but we could always take it to the next level of 7680 FPS which basically makes the world stand still technically it's interpolating frames from nineteen eighty FPS but still that's the slowest slow motion you can get on a phone and I'm expecting a call from the planet Earth team asking me to help shield Nick series any time now on the p40 pro whether you're taking photos portraits or selfies while you still have lots of beauty options and filters to play around with it's just one tap to turn it off and it's all off now giving you more realistic photos which I do appreciate although with my face maybe I could do a little bit of beautifying there's a couple more nifty things I want to show you and it's part of Huawei's golden snap features for the camera so two of these need moving picture to be turned on and first up there's a i-best moment so when you tap the shutter button it actually records two seconds of 4k video select 60 frames and then recommends the best few shots you can see there's a little crown and what the AI thinks are the best ones for lighting and where it detects I'm not blinking the second gone Snap feature is remove passerby and to avoid any unnecessary risk join this social distancing period this is a clip from Huawei and it's similar to a i-best moment but this time it'll suggest a photo but without anyone getting in the way or you know photobombing it then we have removed reflection and this is one of my favorite features and I haven't seen it on any other phone so for example taking photos through windows you can just jump into the Edit menu in the gallery app and tap remove reflection how well it works varies and depends on the photo but you can see it does make a difference and I can't wait to try this next time I'm on a plane and there's an awesome view out the window so far so good but one of the real standouts of the p40 pro's camera is how light performs in low-light really it was far away who pioneered night modes in phones with a p20 pro with it's longer exposure but what's really interesting about the p40 pro is night mode isn't always better than just taking a normal photo and without waiting for a long exposure I have to say my experience with night mode has been a little bit inconsistent for example I'm taking three photos now one regular photo one with night mode and an 8 second exposure and one night mode on a tripod with a 45 second exposure but bizarrely the longest exposure is darkest and least detailed in some examples I've also noticed the regular photo mode taking a great low-light shot but in a night mode with a 5 or 10 second exposure adds a huge amount of noise and doesn't really improve the photo however in other situations I found night mode worked well I couldn't even see my shoes in real life but 9 mode definitely picked up more detail and in the case of this flower photo the night mode shot is brighter and we get more natural colors it's a similar story with this baseball to be honest though while the inconsistency can be a little bit frustrating sometimes I think the people he pro handles low-light better than any other phone in its regular photo mode which is probably what we'd be using most of the time anyway it's fun to play around with though and genuinely in low-light I'll take both a regular and a night mode show anyway as they'll often come out quite differently although I do just want to show you this moon photo which I took from my back garden straight out of the people he Pro handheld no tripod not even in night mode it's insanely good but is there anything I'd like to see improved say for the mate 40 pro coming up late yeah well it would be good to see maybe a dedicated astrophotography mode like Google did with a pixel where it had multiple long exposures I've also found when shooting video the slider to change the zoom can be a little bit finicky it's hard to just switch between the three lenses without having to manually zoom in and out fully and perhaps some built-in tips for how to use night mode most effectively but other than that the people who Pro has a terrific camera and I think for me it is the biggest selling point of this phone but what do you reckon what do you think of the kwame's camera and also are there any camera innovations that you'd really like to see in the next-gen phones I think for me I'd love to see a built-in ND filter that'd be pretty cool but if you've got any ideas let me know in
