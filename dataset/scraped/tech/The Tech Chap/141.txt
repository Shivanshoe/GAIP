[Music] this video is partly sponsored by surfsharkvpn hey guys i'm tomatekjap and this is actually the only one of these laptops in all the uk right now so i should probably be careful with it but asus very kindly sent me this engineering sample so this is not a final model of the new zenbook pro duo oled the ux582 and i've also got this guy its little brother the ux482 which is a 14 inch laptop but they both have these screen pad pluses these are both dual screen laptops so what exactly is new with this because from the outside it doesn't look an awful lot different to before well really it's a bit of a evolutionary upgrade one of the first things you'll notice is the screen pad plus now pops up a lot further and we've got this new aas plus hinge it's a whole new design of hinge so when it's fully open the whole base of the laptop is lifted up a little bit it's what suits called their ergo lift technology which helps with airflow but also the screen pad is now at a more comfortable angle so not only does that help make it look like we've just got this one tall screen where they kind of blend into each other as you can't really see the bottom bezel of the main screen anymore but most importantly it just makes the screen pad a lot easier to see and therefore use and also crucially it's a lot brighter as well that's one of my issues with the previous gem i think it peaked at about 280 nits for the screen pad now it's up to 400 so it's a lot easier to use it is still lcd as opposed to the oled on the main screen which is partly down to cost but also it does help reduce reflections because this is a matte screen this is glossy so the panels do look a little bit different but i think it's a smart decision so whole new hinge better airflow which also means better cooling we're also getting a bigger battery in here for up to about 28 longer battery than the previous gen which is a big upgrade because previously i was getting about four and a half hours from this car laptop as i say this is an engineering sample so i can't give you foul figures but i'm looking at probably around six hours with this which is still not fantastic but considering you're getting two 4k screens and some pretty beefy specs as well isn't bad at all and speaking of the specs one of the big upgrades is the fact that you'll be to get this with up to an rtx 3070 a 99 10 gem processor up to 32 gigs of ram and up to one terabyte of storage i do kind of think that since this is a more productivity based laptop that having 64 gigs of ram or two terabytes of storage uh options would have been nice to see but still this is an incredibly powerful laptop although i wouldn't really buy this one if gaming is your priority because for that if you want the ultimate gaming experience then that's what the rog zephyrus duo 15 is all about slightly more powerful specs up to a 3080 high res screen options so for gaming that's the one you want this one while still a pretty decent gaming laptop i mean 3070 is no slouch but i think this is more oriented towards creatives designers and just getting work done so new graphics cards new processors a slight redesign with an all new hinge which makes the screen pad more comfortable which is also brighter now as well i'm also getting updated screen pad software because previously while this was a cool idea the ui and the actual experience of using the screen pad wasn't the best it was quite buggy asus have gone to some length to actually improve that make it more responsive and just work better so while those updates will also be coming to all the models of this which is great to hear i think the software side of things is just as important as the updated hardware just a quick shout out to my favorite vpn provider surfshark i use this all the time not just for watching us netflix or accessing websites i can't normally get to here in the uk but for me it's turning on clean web which then helps prevent tracking ads malware and all that bad stuff and considering i'm online about 99 of my day i may as well do it as securely as possible so check out surf shark vpn in the description below or use the code tech

this second screen for now for me as a video creator i spend half my life in premiere pro so for me this is one of the best use cases i've got all my video files my media browser down here so let me show you what i did if i reset the work layout here you can see by default it's not really using it but then what i did was bring the media browser down here and you can see it doesn't auto scale because this is within the app so i kind of had to manually adjust the size of this which is a little bit awkward now i can maybe expand this a little bit bring that down and so i can scroll through my timeline i can then maybe bring in the videos from below and it's all nice and fast and well when this has the updated specs this should be a lot smoother as well so don't take this performance uh to be indicative of how it will be for the retail model so that would be my video editing setup but let's say i want to bring up a bit of spotify there's no real point of it taking up my full screen so i can either use the touchpad my mouse or my finger to then bring it down to the screen pad which automatically fills up the screen but then i can minimize it and like the windows snap feature i can then split it into two halves i could then maybe have discord on the other side or i can bring this over and split the screen into thirds and then maybe bring the web browser down as well so i've got spotify discord youtube going on so i can maybe even switch that to twitch let's say even full screen twitch put it into theater mode and then maybe i could fire up the same game at the same time or watch one of my friends streams on discord so i could be playing it and then seeing what they're looking at as well if you're a student and you're writing or researching a paper you could bring google docs or i've got word here down to the screen pad and then you could bring up your notes or some articles or web browsers whatever you like so i can have my research and my different tabs open on the main screen and then my essay or whatever i'm doing on the screen pads and the best way is if you then set all this up and you have exactly how you like it you can then bring up the command center down here and create a new task group and essentially save this layout and so then with a single press it'll bring up everything you've saved to that task group we've also got the screen navigator which shows you which apps are assigned to the screen pad and then which ones are for the main display so if i were to tap this pc i can then choose to move it down to the screen pad or i can just tap this and it moves it same with say spotify here i could push this up so this is just a really easy way of telling the laptop where you'd like the particular program or app to display main screen or screen pad you've also got a quick hide button which then just clears everything on the screen pad you can also link your phone and connect it to my asus if you want to you can also lock the keyboard so let's say if i'm going to be drawing or using the pen or using my hands this is now locked so this isn't going to do anything and i can then use it as a palm rest essentially and do all my finger gymnastics or whatever it is i'm doing on the screen pad so that's quite a handy feature and then you can just unlock it again to use the keyboard but you've got the usual range of apps as i say handwriting this isn't really new but this could be useful if you wanted to sign documents or do some handwriting to text recognition you've also got number key if you want a calculator uh what else have we got here i've put windows explorer in so quite often i like to just have my documents down here but one of the coolest new features is this control panel this is part of the new screen expert 2.0 ui and you have this customizable control panel which should make using some apps that support it just easier to use you can basically move things around you can adjust what each tool does so that's great but i don't seem to be able to actually use the proper control panel within a program and also it's limited to just photoshop this should show a whole range of adobe apps so some issues there this being a pre-release engineering sample so if i put that to one side and bring in the ux 482 this is a final release version and you can see the control panel is working correctly in fact if i bring up the control panel settings here you can see that we actually have a whole bunch of options here after effects lightroom classic photoshop premiere pro they will expand on this over time but for now it's just these adobe apps you can see here i've got my timeline zoom so if i were to rotate this in i can well zoom in on my timeline i've got time access adjustment so i can very slowly frame by frame uh go through my video and i've just got quick shortcuts and just gives you this really professional feeling interface which you can totally customize all just to make me faster and more efficient on this screen but when this is released and it has all this file software you'll be able to have this on here which should be a really nice experience particularly with this bigger 4k screen size and also the additional brightness which brings me to my next question of which one should you go for the 482 or the 582 well i was a foul judgment for my full review because this is a pre-release model of this but they are fundamentally quite different laptops because the 482 is obviously a lot smaller it's more portable lighter weight it's also full hd across both screens and also matte and lcd whereas on this guy we're getting a bigger 15.6 inch main screen also a bigger 14 inch screen pad they're both 4k also this is an oled panel so with that you're getting the much better almost well a million to one contrast and also support for display hdr 500 but of course you are getting that extra bulk it isn't the end of the world thick and heavy it's about 100 grams lighter and about two and a half mil thinner than last year's ux581 so they have slimmed it down a little bit but weighing 2.4 kilograms and at about 21.5 millimeters thick it is quite a big laptop uh so you'd have to obviously keep that in mind if you're traveling with this so i think the 582 is much more of a sort of desktop replacement whereas this is more of a traditional travel laptop so you're either looking at this thinking that's the best thing in the whole world i can think of a million reasons why i'd like to use this or you're thinking why not just plug it into an external monitor or a second screen or something because that would just be easier which it would but then if you are planning to use this as a laptop you know it's portable then i think this really does help because i can imagine uh the scenario where i'm back traveling again it seems like a million years since i've been anywhere but if i'm in a hotel room editing a video being confined by a regular 15 inch laptop screen isn't the best when i'm trying to edit and color correct and bring in tons of files i can definitely see myself using this if i was working on the go so i don't think it's a gimmick at all really and also i do appreciate the upgrades we're getting this year with the new hardware the better hinge the improved screen pad and while i still don't love the keyboard on touchpad and this particularly is a pretty hefty device considering the extra functionality you're getting particularly with the new control panel which i can't wait to try out properly on this when i get my review sample it all adds up to make this a stunning laptop and i think one of my favorite devices of the year so far but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of these and also how would you
