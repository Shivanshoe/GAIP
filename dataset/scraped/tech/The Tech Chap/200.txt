hey guys i'm tom of techchap and i've just upgraded my home video editing slash gaming pc with one of these the rtx 3080 graphics card i've got the asus tough oc edition here which is about 40 pounds more than the founders edition which i uh reviewed a couple of days ago so on the one hand i'm kind of curious to see how much better or how much cooler uh this uh third-party asus card is versus the founders one uh run a few games like crisis remastered here and give you guys a bit of a setup tour while i'm at it although your first thought is probably crikey that's a big tv are you actually using that as a monitor uh well the answer is yes i made a whole video about this a couple of days ago switching from my ultra wide to this lg 48 inch c10 oled tv obviously we have hdmi 2.1 on both the tv and the graphics card now so it's like all the next gen technologies are coming together at the same time so i'm pretty happy with this setup so for the pc i'm using the cooler master td500 case which i'm a big fan of even if it's not as fancy as maybe a lian lee 011 but i like the smaller size and how we have mesh on the front and the top my only complaint is a lack of a front usb c port on the inside i'm using the amd threadripper 3 3970x that's a 32 core 64 thread chip along with 64 gigs of 4000 megahertz ram 10 terabytes of storage split between two severant ssds with the faster pcie 4 model as the main boot drive i also have an 850 watt asus rog power supply and a cooler ml360 aio so i actually built this pc a couple of months ago when i got that thread ripper chip which to be honest is just totally overkill for my use case although it does come in handy for video editing but i think like anyone looking to build or upgrade their pc in the last six months in the back of our minds we've had uh you know the thought that the new graphics cards were coming so should i put all my money into a rtx 2080 or a ti or something or should i just hold fire and wait for uh ampere cards so fast forward to today and now we've got the rtx 3080 in here which feels like the finishing piece for this pretty epic build which i tallied up to be worth about five thousand dollars so with this setup both the motherboard and the graphics card support pcie iv although gamers nexus made a great video showing that it doesn't actually make that much difference right now but it's a little bit more future proof now this is a seuss's oc edition of their tough card with a pretty beefy cooler although the founders edition 3080 did a pretty good job at staying cool i mean that thing is just one big heatsink so let's put it to the test is this any cooler than the founders edition well i ran the unigen superposition benchmark on both cards and the founders peaked at 73 degrees celsius whereas the asus 3080 here never went above 64. so it's about 9 degrees cooler and that's with an overclock but does that translate into much of a performance gain well slightly it's between one and two percent faster in unigine and wolfenstein although in flight sim running the same landing challenge the tough 3080 was just 2 fps faster and it rendered my 10 minute 4k premiere pro video 8 seconds faster it does pull 340 watts though that's 20 more than the founders but personally i'd say save your money and just go with the standard tough 3080 not the oc as you still get the benefits of the cooler and quieter fans and you can always overclock it yourself but overall other than the aesthetics maybe i don't know why you'd want the founders car this is just better in every way although given the asus is a 3 slot versus the 2.7 slot founders edition while cooler it might be a tight squeeze in smaller mini itx builds like the nzxt h1 although i have to say while i appreciate the aurasync little tough logo here i'm kind of sad the rtx logo doesn't light up maybe that's what you pay extra for with the strix edition just a quick mention of today's sponsor surf shark vpn now

a try it's been a weird few days you know i mean with the ps5 pre-order coming out i actually had to wait up to 1am to get one because i missed the initial rush early morning and of course also the 3080 coming out which seemed to be even harder to get your hands on uh it looked like they sold out immediately on nvidia's website but i think it's worth just keeping a bit of perspective that it's not the end of the world whatever you do don't give those scalpers on ebay who are charging crazy money for these cards and ps5 pre-orders don't let them win just wait i mean i feel incredibly lucky that i've been able to test and have a bit of a play with a couple of different 3080 cards uh so a big thank you to nvidia and asus for sending them over but don't worry they will be coming out soon you will start to have more options on amazon and you know different varieties of third-party 38s to choose from and of course you know games like cyberpunk and the new call of duty aren't even out yet so while it's fun to you know play a bit of crisis or flight scene with the 3080 a lot of the games i'm really looking forward to playing with them aren't actually even out yet so trying to stress keep perspective it's just a graphics card uh but if you do manage to get your hands on one then i don't think you're gonna be disappointed but anyway enough of that tangent let's jump into a few quick games and starting with call of duty at 4k with maxed out settings and ray tracing with this 3080 i'm averaging 115 fps flight sim 2020 gets me a whopping 43 fps when it's maxed out although dropping to high from ultra gets me that 4k 60. and then in crisis remastered which actually has a can it run crisis graphics option although kind of ironically even though they're leaning into the joke it's still a really badly optimized game at 4k i'm getting 33 fps i think update some better driver support will make a difference to crisis but it's kind of funny that in 2020 i'm literally using crysis and flight simulator to sort of test these new graphics cards and they're still struggling now the thing is i wouldn't exactly call this the ultimate gaming pc even though it costs a ton of money and there's some pretty impressive specs inside if i was going to build this again and just use it for gaming i'd probably go with the uh intel i9 10900k because clock speed is a lot more important for games than having loads and loads of cores however when it comes to heavy multitasking rendering or in my case video editing the threadripper comes into its own but actually both premiere pro and davinci resolve heavily use the gpu when rendering videos you can see it using the video encoder and it eats up the vram so that's the main stuff but let me take you off the tripod and just give you a bit of a tour of the rest of the desk so the tv itself here i'm using as a monitor is the lg 48 inch c10 as i say i made a whole video all about this i'll leave a link at the end of the video as for peripherals i'm using the razer is it the death addo or the black widow that i forget which one the razer keyboard uh which i really like although the material here is scuffing a little bit so i'm kind of thinking about maybe upgrading my keyboard if you've got any suggestions let me know in the comments below i've also got the lg g903 mouse steel series arctic wireless pro headset i actually really like this thing although it is quite expensive and that's about it the desk actually is a carl b worktop from ikea with a couple of alex drawers the standard youtuber set up i've also got a philips hue light strip behind the back uh these are actually sonos one speakers but they're not hooked up to this they're actually uh for my main tv over there which is a 77 inch g10 from lg honestly i've got far too much tech for my very small living room oh and this guy is the noble chairs icon so i'll leave links to you know all the interesting stuff in the description below if you want to check it out so let me know what you think of this setup if there's anything you'd add or change for me i think the next steps are to improve my cable management and then maybe i guess if i can put a rtx 3090 in there when they finally come out that could be uh pretty cool but aside from that what do you guys think of this setup and also is this ridiculous or is it pretty cool let me
