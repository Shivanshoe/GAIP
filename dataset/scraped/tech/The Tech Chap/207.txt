hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is death stranding with maxed out settings at 60fps running on a chromebook which is pretty ridiculous actually but it's running with geforce now so this is actually being streamed from the cloud this is how streaming works but it's pretty crazy because obviously normally for this kind of thing you're going to need a high-end laptop a high-end gaming laptop so the question is what's geforce now like on a chromebook how's it compared to a you know traditional laptop experience and should you actually subscribe to this so i'm sure you guys know what a chromebook is but basically they run chrome os which means nearly everything you do is online or in the cloud but importantly most of these laptops are pretty affordable this new asus model is about 550 pounds which is one of the more upper mid-range models whereas this hp is around 450. but they're ideal for students or if you just want a nice thin and light laptop that doesn't break the bank and people seem to love a chromebook sales of these have actually quadrupled in the last year so if you are thinking about getting a chromebook or maybe you already have one that does meet the minimum spec or just a creaky old regular laptop and importantly you have decent connection speeds then nvidia's geforce now is a good option for gaming with high graphics settings at 60fps which otherwise just wouldn't be possible on a low power device like this and better yet on chromebook you don't even need the app installed you log in and play direct through the chrome browser however windows 10 pcs or mac still need to use the regular standalone app for now so what exactly are the main benefits of game streaming well firstly it means you can play games on something with potato specs like this also the games are installed in seconds and you never have to worry about patches or updates plus if you are buying a cheaper laptop that maybe doesn't have a ton of storage you don't actually install any of the games locally onto it so you're not using up any of your hard drive space and of course because we're not actually using the hardware and here to play the games it never gets too hot or you know it doesn't use the battery life which is pretty uh important especially if you are taking this to class afterwards and with a good connection games look and play great on this although i emphasize the word good which we'll come back to in a second but for me it's not quite a gaming laptop replacement because you do have to deal with uh latency the graphics aren't quite as good so sometimes you get compression issues and of course with gaming laptops you may get benefits like high refresh rates or lower response times or other gaming related features so with geforce now there's a free tier which limits you to just one hour play sessions but it's a good way to see if this works for you before you sign up to the five pound or five dollar a month founder's tier subscription which then extends your play time to six hours per session and also adds ray trace graphics and supported games and gives you priority server access so if you think about five pounds a month that's uh 60 pounds a year uh so then say over five years which maybe is a console cycle then that's about 300 pounds so that's still cheaper than a console but then you do also have to buy the games but then you do with the console as well and also they upgrade the hardware themselves in the cloud so you're not going to have to buy a new graphics card just to keep up with the new games because they upgrade their super computers in their server centers wherever they are in the world and the fact that it is a subscription service means you can just you know cancel it whenever there's no massive payment needed to start like you would with a games console or gaming pc like that now you could be forgiven for lumping geforce now in with other game streaming options like google stadia and microsoft's project x cloud and as with those it's helpful to think of geforce now as being your own powerful pc console in the cloud which actually runs the game and then streams it via your internet connection to your device but nvidia have done things a little bit differently because instead of having a game store like stadia geforce now lets you stream the games you already own by linking it with your existing game libraries although this is limited to steam epic and you play for now but this is a big deal because it means you don't have to re-buy the games you already own or pay over the odds for them like you often have to do with stadia and there's some free to play games like apex legends but the problem is it doesn't support all your games from those libraries and video reckon there's about 650 right now with new titles added weekly but some big names like red dead redemption 2 or the latest call of duty are missing worse still titles sometimes disappear from the service as publishers decide to pull their catalogs also finding games can be a bit of a pain more often than not i have to search for them by name even when i've linked my libraries to my account so that's the setup but what's it actually like to play games on a chromebook with geforce now well in the right circumstances it can be fantastic but it lives or dies by your connection speed and crucially how stable it is image quality and input lag can vary a lot depending on your connection speed and if your connection is sometimes unreliable this can result in stutters artifacting or just full-on freezing now nvidia recommends a wired ethernet connection and a 15 megabit down connection for 720p at 60fps or 25 megabits per second for 1080p60 but in my testing it was the reliability of the connection and of your wi-fi that makes the biggest difference all right so we're in wolfenstein youngblood my internet at home is about 70 megabits per second down over wi-fi which is pretty good actually way above the recommended i don't know sometimes it works really really well but then sometimes it kind of falls over itself so i'm playing wolfenstein here and actually right oh that's a good example of it sometimes it's really really fluid and fast and then it kind of just trips up a little bit uh so this is actually the very very high mine leave and graphic settings which obviously it's not something you'd normally do on a chromebook okay so this time as you guys can see we have it connected via the ethernet and actually straight away that has made a difference what a water difference that makes so it shows that my internet speed is fine 70 is small enough this is awesome this is like this feels just like playing on my full desktop pc and we're still looking at 70fps with absolute maxed out settings although of course we still have a 60hz screen so that tops out there but this is awesome come back later i want to keep playing so that's beautifully smooth so if we take out the wired connection okay we're back in surprisingly it's uh it's actually playing really well so you can see it really is all about the consistency of your connection i've not done anything other than go from wi-fi to wired to wi-fi this is obviously playing better now but it just wasn't before so whether you've got someone else in the house you know downloading netflix or you know playing something or using the bandwidth now one of the big questions for me is how is the geforce now experience on the chromebook compared to a traditional proper laptop and away i am noticing the compression and some artifacting with the geforce now as i say we do have this red signal i've restarted it done everything i can we have the wired connection but yeah it's a little inconsistent as you can see so the latency from the input lag doesn't seem to be a major issue it's pretty neck and neck to be honest it all comes down to that connection how stable it is and also of course whether you get the recommended speed the actual gaming laptop is a lot nicer and part of the reason for that is this particular one has a high refresh rate which is pretty common with gaming laptops this is 144 hertz while we do have all the downsides or the cons of a gaming laptop we do get some of the benefits including high refresh rates perhaps lower response time displays as well so that does make a difference if you're an enthusiast gamer but at the same time if you can hear from my mic the fan is whirring away on the asus laptop whereas this is completely silent and also completely cool so you're not really draining the battery you're not overheating and so there really are pros and cons to each setup but i think rather than one being better than the other it's just another way of playing and not everyone can afford a gaming laptop no one wants to carry one around with them all the time it's not as good in terms of a raw gaming experience but it's pretty damn close assuming of a good connection now i actually have another chromebook here with me this one's from hp but this actually has four gigs of ram and nvidia recommends uh for the recommended specs of geforce now eight gigabytes actually i found it to be as consistent slash as inconsistent as this asus one with eight gigs around so while you are gonna need a chromebook from the last couple of years really it needs to be a fairly modern one in terms of the four versus eight gigabyte options here i didn't notice a ton of difference actually really all comes down to that connection and the bandwidth so overall then i think geforce now is a really good alternative to a proper gaming laptop or pc as i say i don't think it's going to replace it and there are problems with this and it all really comes down to your connection if you have an amazing connection then you're gonna love this if you don't you're probably gonna hate it and that's why i think their free trial subscription is actually really really handy give it a go see what your experience is with your setup and then maybe you know look at subscribing to the proper founders edition plus as i mentioned earlier it's always improving so unlike a traditional pc setup where you may have to buy a new graphics card every couple years or upgrade the ram nvidia does all that behind the scenes anyway so while they haven't confirmed it it's pretty likely that they're gonna upgrade all their service to the new ampere graphics cards and that'll mean you get the best graphics settings you know the highest frame rates at the highest resolutions so it's only gonna get better and of course you're just paying for one subscription a month so i think it's a pretty good deal actually it's not gonna be for everyone if you already have a gaming laptop then you don't need it but if you are thinking of buying something as basic as a chromebook or indeed any other laptop the reason i'm making this video now is because it's finally become actually optimized for chromebooks but this also works on macs and pcs i think geforce now is definitely worth considering but what i would like to do and let me know in the comments if you guys would like to see this uh but a proper comparison between project x cloud google stadia you know geforce now maybe even shadow thank you so much for watching guys and if you have used geforce now yourself then let me know in the comments below uh what your experience is so that well i can get an idea of it and also other people if they're thinking of giving it a try so let me know in the comments below and also don't forget to hit that subscribe button and help me get to that one million subscriber mark that's all i ask for just your comments and your subscriptions and that would be amazing thank you so much
