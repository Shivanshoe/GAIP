all right hey guys anton the tech chap and this is the new oneplus nord 2. well actually this is one of the fancy cases that come with the reviewers guide this is actually what it looks like which i'm sure you'll agree is very similar to the nine series you can see where the design inspirations come from we've got very similar looking camera modules uh just without this reflective glass design now was it the dark knight when they say you were dying the hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain because once again oneplus is calling this the flagship killer device which is pretty ironic since they also make flagship phones themselves and one of the criticisms we've had with oneplus over the last couple of years is that they've just got more and more expensive they've you know lost that value for money that we've always loved about them so here they are again potentially killing their own flagships but anyway this is actually the fifth phone in the nord family we had the original nord this guy then we had the n10 the n100 the n200 and most recently the uh nord ce which was a slightly cut down version but now we've got the node 2 5 g it will get a bit complicated but really this is the one you should pay attention to because it's actually very good [Music] so in the box we get the usual gubbins of well the phone a protective case some paperwork also this 65 watt charger it's the warp charge 65 and also a usbc two usb a red charging cable which you'll need because this doesn't support any kind of wireless charging unfortunately design wise it's a pretty standard affair it kind of looks like the nord and the oneplus 9 had a baby but i am pleased to see that we do have the alert slider because we actually lost that on the nord ce for some reason we do also get stereo speakers and this little hole punch corner cut out for the selfie camera in the screen but sadly while it is a dual sim 5g phone there isn't any micro sd card support and also no headphone jack which is a bit disappointing and finally we get a in-screen fingerprint reader but you can also use the selfie camera for face unlocking so far so good then but what makes this really stand out well there's a couple of things firstly the price this will cost you 400 quid which is about 20 or 30 more than the original nord so it's a little bit more expensive plus that has been now discounted because it's about a year old so this is about 70 pounds more but i'm telling you right now and i'll show you this is definitely worth paying the extra because it's actually a pretty big upgrade and the second real selling point of this is the fact that it's the first oneplus phone to ditch qualcomm and their snapdragon chips uh because instead in here we have the mediatek dimensity 1200 ai chip and you know what it was a hundred percent the right decision because this chip and this phone is significantly faster than both the original nord and the nord ce and it's almost as fast as something like the poco f3 with a snapdragon 870 and it's particularly in the graphics department that we're seeing the biggest optic in performance so games like cod mobile run flawlessly maxed out and actually really demanding titles like gentian impact this does a good job with high settings although of course in the higher end phones you will still get higher frame rates so in terms of specs the headline really is that new mediatek chip that performs surprisingly well uh and that can be paired with six eight or twelve gigs of ram and 128 or 256 gigs of storage so in terms of raw horsepower it's a massive step up over the original nord but what hasn't really changed is this display and we're getting a similar sized 6.43 inch full hd plus 90 hertz amoled which is still a great screen although maybe a bump up to 120 hertz would have been nice it's a flat screen there's no curved edges the hole punch is reasonably small and overall i think it's just a really comfortable sized phone now before we get to this camera which i can't wait to show you uh one of my favorite features of the nord 2 and in fact any oneplus phone really is the software this is running oxygen os 11.3 on top of android 11 and as we've come to expect from these oneplus phones it is incredibly slick and fast and lovely to use i know there's lots of controversy about them merging with oppo and maybe color os sort of subsuming oxygen os but even if that happens it's not gonna be for a few years and oneplus are promising two years of android updates and three years of security updates with this there's tons of personalization and actually one of my favorite things to do is remove the text for the apps which you can also change the icons for so actually you can have a really clean unique looking screen but what about this camera well it's pretty interesting actually because they're using the same main sensor in here as they used in the ultra wide on the 9 pro the sony imx 766 it's a 50 megapixel main lens along with an 8 megapixel ultra wide and finally a 2 megapixel monochrome lens so i've had the node 2 in my pocket for a few days now and i took it into my local town it's england's smallest city it's called wells and it's a beautiful place i actually just moved here but as you can see in good light the nord 2 takes some terrific shots actually but you can't really get an idea of how good this is or even how bad it is without a bit of context so to help let's bring in the original oneplus nord and also the oneplus 9 pro so oneplus is flagship phone and straightaway in good light at least there isn't that much between them the nord two in the middle seems to have raised the shadows a little bit so it's a touch brighter which is a similar story with my lovely wife sarah here who is uh very kindly waiting for me to take three photos at the same time i do think the 9 pro on the right comes out on top in terms of overall quality dynamic range colors but the difference between the nord and the nord 2 is quite stark but this is where things get really interesting and by the way thatcher's if you're watching uh definitely open to sponsorships but just look at the white balance the original nord and the 9 pro look very similar actually despite the hasselblad color science on the 9 pro the north 2 looks a lot more realistic and natural so while the note 2 and the 9 pro kind of trade blows the original node on the left is definitely lagging behind there's a lot less detail in the darker areas it's very contrasty not the most pleasing image actually you can see behind the petals there's a lot more information and more detail in the note 2 and to some extent the 9 pro shot but also just look at the texture on the table there's significantly more detail the original nord is just a kind of smooth mess let's move on to some low light shots and these are all taken with their respective nightscape modes this is actually my current setup which i've moved down to my dining room because it's so bloody hot upstairs right now in a bit of a heat wave here in the uk but just look at how dark the original nord is we're losing so much detail with this one i think the 9 pro has taken the best shot but again the white balance on the nord 2 is actually a lot more realistic those colors are much more true to life so it's definitely in lower light and nighttime shots that we see the most appreciable difference going up to the higher end flagship phones but the note 2 throughout does a really good job and it is a massive step up over the original nord and that goes for both the back cameras and the new updated 32 megapixel front camera which is also significantly better than before and in this particular shot arguably i'd say i prefer even over the nine pro as for video it tops out at 4k 30 which is absolutely fine i don't really need 8k on a phone like this and also 1080p 30 with the front camera and i think it does a pretty good job because we do get ois with the main lens eis with the ultra wide and overall i think it shoots some pretty nice video and also the battery life because we're getting a 4500 million power cell which is up from i think 41.15 on the original node so about 10 bigger or so and also we're getting that faster 65 watt charging and battery life is actually pretty good by the end of a normal day at about 11 pm i still have a good 30 left but of course you can quickly top it up with that 65 watt warp charger so overall compared to the original nord which is only a year old we're getting this slightly refreshed design a much faster chip bigger battery significantly improved cameras and also better haptics the rumble when you're texting or playing games feels a lot better on this the screen is the only area that's not really changed but overall it is a solid upgrade so in some ways i feel like oneplus should just stop with this flagship killer kind of marketing they make flagship phones they are better but for 400 quid this is a massive improvement over the original nord and of course the ce which is even cheaper um i think the closest competition to this would be the uh poco f3 and actually it probably is a better buy this is about 100 pounds cheaper now because it's been out for a few months we also get a 120 hertz screen and a more powerful snapdragon 870 so it's faster cheaper smoother screen sort of comparable cameras so really depends if you want to go with team oneplus or team xiaomi well poco but also there are a few other issues i do have with the node 2 for example there is no headphone jack there's no micro sd and also there's no wireless charging there's no official ip rating and also we're not getting any kind of gorilla glass on here all these kind of extras that are nice to have which make a flagship of flagship uh so there may be still some argument to pay the extra 200 pounds or so and go for the oneplus 9 which also gets you a telephoto lens and that faster chip so i think for the money this is actually really good value and i would probably recommend them all too but it's not a flagship killer so yeah what do you reckon 400 quid would you be tempted to buy the nord 2 or maybe the poco f3 or none of the above let me know what you make of this in the comments below and if you did enjoy the video a cheeky little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated especially now because i am sweltering i'm trying to hide the sweat stains on my shirt and wipe my forehead constantly because it's like 30 degrees celsius uh and i am in my sort of dining room because it is so hot upstairs so i've battled through for you guys to bring you this review and uh hopefully you enjoyed it thank you so much for watching guys and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech chat
