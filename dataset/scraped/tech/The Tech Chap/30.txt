hey guys i'm tunnel techchap and i am in beautiful barcelona where samsung are showing off the new galaxy book 2 pro and book 2 pro 360 with the latter giving you that spinny tablet touchscreen experience and surprisingly for samsung who usually take things out of the box this s pen actually comes bundled with it the problem is though there are so many great ultra thin and light premium laptops these galaxy books have their work cut out if they're gonna stand out from the dell xps 13 plus or the acer swifts or sue zenbooks or of course the macbook air which is to a refresh soon so what do these offer well building on the terrific galaxy books from last year we once again have an incredibly thin and light design i mean seriously i'm holding the 15-inch one here one-handed just flinging about we're talking lg gram levels of lightweightness yet somehow without feeling as flimsy or cheap also the stunning amoled display makes a return although this time it is now 33 brighter and certified display hdr 500. although that 500 nits brightness is only when playing hdr content normally it'll peak at 400 nits which is still very good but because the screen is quite reflective sometimes if you have bright lights around you or you are using this outside which you may well do as these are all about portability then it can still be a little bit tricky to see sometimes but it is certainly a step up from last year however what has remained the same is this 16 by 9 aspect ratio with a relatively chunky chin at the bottom now i know not everyone agrees but i much prefer a slightly taller 16 by 10 screen and also it is just 60 hertz there is no extra smooth 120 hertz like we get on say the surface pro 8. now on the inside we're getting new processors in the form of intel's 12th gen p series which samsung say will actually give us a 75 boost in multi-core performance versus last year of course i'm gonna have to test this myself back in the studio but these are the same chips used in the new dell xps 13 plus and also according to some early benchmarks that we're seeing these new p series chips can actually outperform apple's m1 which is great until you realize the m1 has been out for you know the best part of two years now and we're about to get a refreshed m2 and also that's sort of a 10 15 watt chip versus the 28 watt p series from intel so great news that intel is sort of finally catching up and maybe even going beyond the m1 but in the scheme of things i think apple is still well ahead but for a windows laptop good stuff and that's paired with faster ddr5 ram up to 32 gigs of the stuff and also up to a terabyte of storage we also now get punchier speakers thanks to a new smart amp as well as an upgraded 1080p webcam with a wider field of view now 87 degrees up from 77 as well as auto framing to keep you centered the new galaxy box also get thunderbolt 4 wi-fi 6e upgraded security features fast 65 watt charging which will also quick charge your galaxy phone and tablet and of course if you do have say a tab s8 then you can use that as a second screen in a very similar way to apple's sidecar with ipads and macbooks i'll tell you who else has been busy here at mwc though tcl who are very kindly sponsoring this video they've been showing off an absolute ton of new tech including the new tcl 30 series phones with the top of the range tcl 35g costing just 249 euros with this fiberglass material on the back which gives it quite a classy look and also it doesn't pick up smudges or fingerprints in fact the whole 30 series lineup pack in huge batteries and also except for the tcl 306 they all have dual or triple 50 megapixel cameras this also caught my eye it's the new tcl next paper 10 s and it uses an lcd backlit screen but with multiple layers on top giving it a matte papery e-ink aesthetic which also reduces blue light it minimizes reflections it's a really unique tablet but it's tcl's concepts that i'm really excited about these are a pair of their new wireless ar holographic glasses i also got to try these the tcl next wear air which give you a huge 140 inch immersive screen right in front of your eyes and finally these guys tcl are showing off every kind of flipping folding and even rolling devices this is the very aptly named fold and roll which i've never seen before but the screen folds and it can roll out tcl are also working on a new foldable concept so stay tuned to hear more about that but for now click the link in the description below to check out all their latest tech now samsung claimed up to 21 hours of video playback on the galaxy box which is about the same as last year there's no real battery upgrade there although the efficiency improvements with the new intel chips may have an impact that's something i'll have to test myself but either way last year's galaxy books easily lasted me a full day so i'm not worried it is worth bearing in mind though that both the book 2 pro and the 360 come in 13 and 15 inch sizes although the specs are a little bit different for example on the book 2 pro only the 15 inch model has a 5g option samsung told me that adding 5g to the 13 inch book 2 pro would have added to its weight and thickness which they didn't want to do however more importantly only the 15 inch book 2 pro comes with the option for dedicated graphics in the form of intel's new arc gpu on the higher end models plus the 15 manages to squeeze in a full size hdmi port and also a numpad beside the keyboard and i think on paper at least it's the 15 inch book 2 pro that is the most interesting i'm really keen to see what the arc graphics can do and also how much faster it is over the standard intel iris xc graphics that we get on the other models this could end up being a really nice balance between performance and portability which of course is the holy grail of thin and light laptops so there's a lot to like here but i do have a few thoughts firstly the lack of a quad hd or 4k option for the screens particularly on the larger 15 inch which is a bit of a shame although i'm told the decision was made to stick to full hd as battery life is a big priority which is understandable and of course you can always output to a higher res monitor but maybe a 1440p option would have been nice i also really do love the look of these galaxy books particularly this white color although it does come in a more businessy graphite if you need to keep things a bit more toned down but next to something like the new dell xps 13 plus that well level hate it looks like a properly futuristic next-gen laptop i wouldn't have minded a bit of a refresh here but i guess the real magic is just how lightweight this is i'm also really keen to check out the standard galaxy book the non-pro model which samsung wasn't really that keen to show off but it has been refreshed and actually if it's anything like last year's galaxy book it ended up being probably my favorite laptop just for the sheer value for money however the combination of a 500 nit amoled screen so we're getting that incredible contrast and deep inky blacks the ridiculously thin and light chassis i mean the 13-inch weighs just 870 grams and it's 11 millimeters thick with the 15 still only 1.11 kilograms and 11.7 mil although the intel arc graphics option does add a little bit to the size then we're the 12th gen chips the super fast ram a great webcam top-notch connectivity and security and if you're in the samsung ecosystem some nice multi-device features the book 2 pro and the book 2 pro 360 are looking pretty exciting actually i can't wait to get home and test it and review it properly and of course also the standard galaxy book which i haven't had hands-on with just yet and the best bit is if you do fancy one they're actually coming out to even more regions more countries according to samsung this year which is great news but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of them let me know in the comments below and also don't forget to check out the latest tcl tech as well in the little link in the description below thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
