hey guys i'm tummy tech chapman i've got a whole bunch of phones here that all cost under or around the 200 pound mark and i'll put links to everything i talk about and show you today in the description below if you want to check them out uh but let's crack on and in no particular order let's start with the poco x3 nfc this guy it's right at the top of our 200 pound budget but you get so much for your money particularly if you're into your gaming the snapdragon 732g chip is one of the fastest in this price range and i can comfortably play fortnite and cod on this not that i'm any good though and also the big 6.67 inch full hd plus screen has a 120 hertz refresh rate so everything you do whether it's just swiping around or playing games that support it feels a whole lot smoother on this battery life is also really good on this thing we get a pretty hefty 5160 milliamp hour battery which is i think the second biggest on test today so it will last you two days pretty easily downsides well it might not even be a problem for you but it is quite a big phone with that as i say big 6.67 inch screen and it is quite a hefty guy so uh not the smallest most compact you'll definitely feel it in your pocket and also the plasticky body and this sort of go faster stripe on the back may not be to everyone's taste although in this cobalt blue color i think it's actually pretty snazzy looking also the camera isn't really anything to write home about the 64 megapixel main lens is perfectly fine in good light plus we get ultra wide lens and it's probably one of the better camera setups that i'm going to show you today but the added depth and macro lenses don't really add much overall and i think the quality is fine but not the best but i think overall for 200 quid the x3 nfc is a really good option and apparently even uh fred's given it his seal of approval what do you think why is it called nfc well apparently they actually sell the x3 in some regions without nfc i think in india to save some money which is why here in the uk and other parts of the world it's uh got the very catchy name of paco x3 nfc good question fred sticking with poco and another option is the brand new m3 which i've seen as low as 114 pounds on gearbest but also 200 pounds on amazon either way it's supposed to be a cheaper version of the x3 with what i actually think is a slightly nicer design along with that big slab of glass for the camera module downsides it's not as powerful we don't get the 120 hertz screen and the cameras had a bit of a downgrade but we do get an even bigger 6 000 million power battery so the m3 is definitely worth considering especially if you are on a tighter budget but i think uh the x3 is a sort of better all-rounder all right so next up we've got the xiaomi mi 10 tea light not exactly the catchiest name in the world but this is a great option okay technically this is slightly over our budget but i've seen it on sale for 200 and i think even at the full price what you're getting with the me 10 t lite is ridiculously good value for money but it's also the only one that supports 5g and while that may not be a big deal right now for some of you it could come in handy over the next couple of years but the mi 10t lite shares the same big 120 hertz screen the same six gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage as the poko x3 although the x3 does have a slightly bigger battery and also the ultra wide and the selfie cameras are higher megapixels and also depending on where you're buying it it may be a touch cheaper but there's a lot to like here gorilla glass 5 on the front and back stereo speakers a fingerprint reader on the side which doubles as a power button and also we get fast 33 watt charging and a pretty hefty 48 20 milliamp hour battery while this and the x3 are both great options for my money i would probably pay a little bit extra depending on where you buy it and go for this just because that extra performance also the 5g makes it a little bit more future-proof uh and i think i just personally prefer this slightly smarter design than uh where is it the as i say the go faster stripe on the back of the x3 but all things and maybe all prices being equal which one would you go for between these two let me know in the comments below speaking of the me series though i actually recently reviewed its bigger and fancier brother than me 10t pro now this one is definitely closer to flagship territory although they do have some good deals on it but if you've got a slightly bigger budget then definitely check it out all right moving on and i want to show you guys the moto g9 play motorola offers so many different phones it's actually kind of confusing but now we have the latest g9 play and it costs about 150 pounds one of the big selling points here for me is the software it's pretty close to stock android 10 so there's not much bloatware or anything to slow it down it's a lovely phone to use but for the 50 pounds or so you're saving over the poco world of meat nt light there are quite a few compromises the screen is just hd rather than a full hd so it's not sharp it's also got a less powerful snapdragon 662 on the plus side it's not quite as big as the last few phones with a 6.5 inch screen the bezels are nice and thin the design is certainly eye-catching and we get a big 5 000 million power battery so no worries there the 48 megapixel triple camera setup on the back is also pretty reasonable but again the macro and the depth are a bit pointless although the main and the ultrawide cameras do perform well in good light but as is pretty much the case with all the phones here it does start to struggle in low light but i think overall if you're after a cheap and cheerful phone i don't think any of those are deal breakers and so the moto g9 play is definitely worth considering now the next phone i want to show you is the oppo a5 2020 and as i've been researching this video normally this will cost you about 150 pounds or so but actually from pretty much all the retailers i've checked you can get this for just 99 pounds which actually makes this the cheapest phone in this roundup so the a5 packs in the same snapdragon 665 5k battery and 6.5 inch hd screen as the moto g9 play but the camera and software is different and we also have more storage here now depending on your point of view this either looks kind of dull and boring or in my opinion at least a bit more subtle and sophisticated not every phone has to be eye-catching so i kind of like the look of this thing battery is also fantastic on this but we are limited to just 10 watt charging which means it takes several hours to fully charge i must admit it does feel like one of the slower phones i'm testing the small amount of ram means that few apps can stay open in the background so they often have to fully reopen when i switch back as for the camera we get a 12 megapixel main lens 8 megapixel ultrawide and the usual kind of pointless depth of micro lenses we do get 4k video here but without stabilization so you'll probably want to stick to 1080p also the a5 doesn't offer any kind of night mode which is a bit of a shame so not exactly the most exciting phone and that three gigs around on the base model may hold you back if you are a bit of a power user will do lots of multitasking but for that discounted price of a hundred pounds it's an absolute steal which phone should we do next now we've done that one okay okay yeah good idea all right so next phone realme 7 which comes in at just under 200 pounds here in the uk so i actually recently reviewed this and its fancier brother the 7 pro although the pro is 270 pounds so a bit over our budget although you do get an amoled screen and a slightly better camera with that but i think the 7 is the sweet spot because not only do we get a six and a half inch 90 hertz screen it's also full hd unlike the previous oppo and moto phones we get the usual quad camera setup here but the 48 megapixel main lens is actually pretty decent as well as a big 5 000 milliamp hour battery and i think overall it's quite a smart looking phone with this two-tone finish now inside we have a mediatek processor the helios g95 to be exact and your first thought is probably oh mediatek but actually it's pretty neck and neck in terms of cpu performance compared to the snapdragon 720 g and actually faster when it comes to graphics and gaming plus we have the 90 hertz screen so this is actually a pretty decent budget gaming phone it's kind of surprising just how many good options there are for under 200 pounds also the nokia 5.3 is a great option especially as we get stock android with this which all bells and whistles aside the software is incredibly important so i think the nokia is definitely worth a look but in terms of which one i would actually pick and use as my daily driver i think could probably be a tie between the x3 and the mi 10 tea light but what do you think from everything i've shown you today which one would you go for and if i have missed out on any other great budget options do let me know
