i even start because it's a tail [Music] hey guys i'm from the tech chap and i've been given an early look at two brand new acer laptops we've got the swift x 14 and this brighter brigger bigger brother the swiftx x16 these are brand new for 2022 with a whole bunch of upgrades did you just die critical low battery that's what you want to see when you just start a video okay charging via usbc you'll note there's no annoying dc in adapter things or usbc charging but i should also say that these are pre-release models so i can't actually test the processors or run any sort of battery benchmarks just yet but i will be doing a full review on these as soon as i can so make sure you have hit that subscribe button now you could call me a bit of a swifty because well i should do quite like taylor swift but i'm also a fan of the acer swift series they have got steadily more expensive over time so perhaps they're not as great value as they once were and also they don't quite offer the same premium experience as you get on say a dell xps and a susen book or a macbook air but they're solid and reasonably affordable and just good all-rounders as the annoying cliche goes so what is new with these 22 models well again if i bring them back to the middle now that this one's not gonna die because it's gonna have battery life the first thing you'll notice is we have these taller 16 by 10 aspect ratio screens which is a big upgrade for me i think every laptop should have a 16 by 10 aspect you just get a little bit more vertical uh screen space and so it means we're getting a 14 inch and a 16 inch screens in reasonably compact form factors they've really trimmed the bezels both laptops also now come with the latest intel 12th gen older lake processors the p series of chips which again i can't test right now they have just been announced for these laptops well a bunch of laptops but these are one of the first to come with it and these will be up to 14 core chips not only that we're also getting the faster new lp ddr5 ram up from four on last year's model and also faster pcie 4 ssd storage so faster chips faster ram faster storage and also faster graphics although that's where things get a little bit complicated because the swift x 14 can actually be specked with an rtx 3050 or a 3050 ti so a proper dedicated graphics card although i'd imagine a fairly low wattage version given it's going to be crammed into this whereas the swift x16 comes with intel's arc gpu it's brand new again we haven't tested it so i can't say how that will compete with the 3050 or 350 ti that's going to be quite an interesting test for my full review but bit of a difference there in terms of the gpu we're also now getting a full hd webcam up from hd and also the latest wi-fi 6e support so the next question if you are thinking about maybe upgrading to one of these is which one should you go for well there are a few differences uh the graphics as i explained but also well you can see the main one the size difference 14 inches versus 16 inches so obviously this is a little bit more portable it's 1.39 kilograms versus just 1.7 on the 16 which is actually very impressive for a 16 inch laptop it's not quite lg gram territory but i think it's sort of using a metal magnesium alloy chassis it feels a little plasticky they both do but that is a lightweight material so a 16 inch screen 1.7 kilograms is pretty crazy the battery capacity is slightly higher on this i can't really make a comment between them at this point but i reckon they should be pretty consistent but the other thing about this guy is not only does it have that bigger screen but it's also high resolution quad hd versus full hd although they are both 60 hertz ips lcds and also this goes up to 400 nits of brightness versus 300 on the 14 so it's a little bit brighter so bigger screen high resolution a little bit brighter but then this is more portable and also has the option for that 350 and 350 ti which is very strange that this doesn't have that again we'll have to see how the arc graphics compares however the biggest difference and i'll tell you what this is going to be why you want to go for the 14. look at these snazzy colors only the 14 for some reason comes with this there's a couple of options and it actually does look quite good because i have to say these uh swiftx laptops are a bit dull looking they're not the most exciting things in the world they're very functional and obviously quite lightweight as well but a little bit of a little bit of pizzazz on the back there brightens things up and it's just a shame that we don't seem to have that option on the 16 you have uh well all the colors you want as long as it's gray so i've been playing with these two for the best part of about a week now and there are a couple of issues or things i'm not so keen on let's do the opening test well there you go you can see the 16 opens one finger this one does not i'm not sure if that's a big deal to you but it just makes us feel a little bit nicer also both of them i'm not a huge fan of the track pad they are using microsoft precision drivers but it's kind of hard to show on camera if you sort of touch at the top it doesn't move at all but then near the bottom i'm sure if you can hear that i'm not even clicking it this would be a click i'm just sort of like gently tapping it and this is on both again these are pre-release models so maybe there are some engineering tweaks they can do but it's weird that uh it happens on both i used to say that these come with dual speakers and dts audio but quite frankly the speakers are pretty terrible on both they sound tinny not very impressive and also especially on the 14 i kind of wish we did have brighter screens a 300 nit full hd non-touch matte screen is okay but given that this well as well comfortable costs about a thousand pounds you kind of want a little bit more out of your screen asus are going pretty much full oled i think this year with 22 which obviously is much nicer than this in terms of the contrast and also the brightness to some extent and the hdr so the screens are fine but they're just a bit perhaps lackluster compared to some of the uh new competition so the big question then really is how much well the swift x 14 which will come out in sort of late february early march will cost 999 pounds for a 12th gen i5 and also an rtx 3050 whereas this which will come out a couple of months later in april uh will cost 10.99 so about 100 pounds more but we'll have to see how the performance compares and also you can get your hands on this a little bit sooner but that does put these against the likes of the dell xps series although that can be a little bit more expensive sometimes and also suits 10 bucks as a macbook air as well but i am withholding judgment because well this isn't a review and also i can't test the performance or the battery life which are pretty important factors when it comes to buying a laptop but still there is a lot to like here not least these snazzy colors although to be fair this was on last year's model as well but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy the 14 or the 16 and if so which one or if not why not thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
