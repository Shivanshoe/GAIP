hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and i've been holding off for making this video for a little while now because i felt like i needed to spend more time with the fold too and not just rush out a review and that's because i think as much as i do genuinely love this thing i probably wouldn't buy it even though i actually did this isn't a review sample i bought this one myself for the slightly eye watering price of 1800 pounds or 2 000 and really just so i could give you guys this sort of full more comprehensive review of it so if you do appreciate that and you know you do find this video helpful then it would be amazing if you could hit that little like and subscribe button below so i've been using this guy for about a month now and the first thing i'll say is that it really is a pretty big upgrade over the original fold here's one i made earlier and straight away you can just see even from a design point of view it's a lot nicer the bezels are thinner and almost flush now with the bigger 7.6 inch screen the ugly plasticky corner cutout has been replaced with a single hole punch camera the front cover screen is now also much bigger which was actually my biggest criticism of the first one and just the whole design feels more like a folding note 20 ultra plus there's the usual camera upgrades and faster hardware on the inside so as you would expect i mean given the price this is a proper flagship phone with a snapdragon 865 which is actually a rare thing in a samsung phone here in the uk 12 gigs of ram 256 gigs of storage a smoother 120hz adaptive main screen although the cover screen is still 60 hertz 5g triple camera setup on the back which is similar to the note 20 ultra although not quite as good frustratingly it does pretty much everything you'd need but i have to say coming from the note 20 ultra i wouldn't have mind having an s pen with this it feels like it would have worked quite well anyway what's it actually like to use well firstly this is a big phone i mean when it's folded it's about 17 millimeters thick and it also weighs 282 grams so it's a bit of a chunky monkey but when it's in your pocket it's the height that you really notice in fact the new 6.23 inch cover screen has a 25 by 9 aspect ratio that's the tallest screen on any phone as far as i'm aware so even 21 219 movies have letterboxing and while it is much better than the first fold it's still incredibly narrow everything looks kind of tiny and it also means typing can get quite frustrating plus it is a bit of a shame that we only get 60 hertz on the cover but 120 hertz inside you'll also notice that the textures on the screens are actually different because on the front we get gorilla glass victus that's uh their new name for gorilla glass 7 so it's a proper glass screen whereas on the inside we have this plastic screen protector that's sort of built into the screen and you can feel and also see the difference it just feels kind of gross and plasticky like you can actually push it in with your nail it's just like the original fold and the crease is just as obvious as well although you do tend to forget about it pretty quickly i appreciate it probably makes the tablet screen more durable but going between the two does feel a bit jarring now so far for me i reckon it's about a 50 50 split between using the cover screen and the main tablet and generally if i'm replying to a whatsapp checking emails or using it as i'm on the go i'll use the cover screen and while swiping is easier than typing a message it's just so narrow and small it's not ideal although i must say i do appreciate having the side fingerprint reader which doubles as the power button well that's kind of creepy but i think the main issue for me with a fold uh although i will get to the fun stuff in a minute i promise is it's kind of like a goldilocks phone but in a bad way the front screen is too small but the tablet screen is too big there isn't just that sort of happy medium like a regular phone screen which is why i think after this review i'm probably gonna switch back to my note 20 ultra but hold up i'm getting ahead of myself because this genuinely is a lovely phone tablet thing so you basically have an android tablet in your pocket and with the new 120hz screen it's fast noticeably faster than the first fold and overall just lovely to use firing up a bit of call of duty or any game really well there's just nothing else out there quite like this and as i mentioned not having the exynos 990 chip in here is a nice bonus as well however as lovely as the big screen experience is in games google maps looking at photos in the gallery dare i say even scrolling through tick tock it's not perfect the square-ish aspect ratio means you have big black bars when watching videos or movies instagram still doesn't fill up the whole screen it is better than before on the first fold it basically just made stories unusable although actually still on the cover screen stories do get cut off at the edges but while it definitely works on here it all just feels a little bit unoptimized it does feel very futuristic though when an app seamlessly transitions from the front cover screen to the main tablet that is very cool you can have up to three apps at once on the screen if you're a multitasking pro plus there's wireless deck support but i'm a bit old-fashioned and tend to just enjoy having one big app open that fills the whole screen now one thing i love about the fold 2 is that they've added the flex mode features which samsung first introduced on the galaxy flip it does only work in a few apps like the camera the gallery and youtube so you can read and write comments while watching a video which is pretty cool but it's a shame that more apps don't utilize this although it does come in handy for the camera so on my recent trip to this beautiful place called stower head with my wife sarah i was actually able to use the fold in flip mode which not only meant it could act as its own stand so no tripod required but i could then line up a photo set a timer and then jump in the frame speaking of sarah she absolutely loves the fact that you can actually use the front cover screen as a viewfinder for the camera so when i'm taking a photo of her or she's taking one of me because i'm complaining i haven't posted anything on instagram for ages it's so useful that you can basically see yourself and then you can make sure your hair's not weird or you know the background's way off and then you can take a good picture instead of the million pictures that i usually have to take of which none of them are quite right i know it's kind of shallow but this is generally one of my favorite features of the fold and it also means you can take selfies with the good quality rear cameras including the ultra wide which is a big bonus so let's talk about these cameras and on the front we have a 10 megapixel selfie camera and then if we open it up we have another one at the top right here which is exactly the same the same 10 megapixel as the front one i guess it's another selfie although generally i don't tend to use that a whole lot and then on the back if i switch around we have a triple 12 megapixel camera setup with a main ultra wide and a two times telephoto lens the cameras are great but it's a little bit disappointing that in every other respect this is samsung's super high end all singing all dancing phone yet the note 20 ultra does have a slightly better camera setup with a 108 megapixel main lens and a much higher five times optical zoom and up to 50 times space zoom most of the time the image quality is neck and neck though it's really in the zoom where the fold falls behind which i don't think is that big of a deal and actually the plus of using the rear cameras for selfies or for you know instagram stories is actually more useful to me but even if it's not the best of the best camera just viewing the photos back on this screen is glorious i feel like maybe i finally understand why people take photos on their ipads i don't like it but maybe i understand it [Music] [Music] now one question i get asked a lot is do i think this is going to break well firstly 100 000 billion percent put a case on it because well firstly it's a 2 000 phone so come on uh but also it does actually make it more comfortable to hold because it can get quite slippery so definitely put a case on it but to be honest with you i've been using this for a month i've not had any issues and actually where is it gone uh wait it's right here the original fold i've had for a year now also no issues so i wouldn't really worry about it also surprisingly i never worried about battery life i just about get two full days out of this and i usually have around 40 of my battery left at the end of a normal day and based on how i use this i'm getting about six hours of screen on time and i think it does help that the 120 hertz screen is adaptive which is the same as the note 20 ultra so depending on what you're doing on screen it can actually drop and therefore save battery so overall i really do like the idea of the fold and this is a big refinement over the original and i think if you do have very deep pockets and you want a following phone for the first time i actually would recommend buying it but for me at least as i've mentioned i think i'd rather go with a note 20 ultra which i appreciate isn't really the same thing and you are losing that wow factor and you know the fancy flex modes with this but i think the note is just more practical and also as i say a lot cheaper as well but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of these assuming you have a spare two grand in your pocket let me know in the comments below if you did enjoy this video make sure you hit that little subscribe button below i've got loads more videos coming out uh it is techtober
