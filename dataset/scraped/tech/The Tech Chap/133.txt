this is definitely the best way to start a camera comparison cup of tea in hand salon sofa at home mainly because it's a miserable day outside but we've got brand new just unveiled oppo find x3 pro versus the s21 ultra that's the snapdragon variant and hopefully fingers crossed by the end of the video you'll have a good idea of which phone has the best camera so this is a quick side-by-side video test but i really want to kick this video off with the fred test so this is fred the cat uh he hates having his picture taken or at least maybe he doesn't like having phones shuffling his face but getting a good still photo of this cat is extremely difficult but one of the features of the fine x3 pro according to oppo is its fastest shutter speed and its ability to take photos that aren't a blurry mess when the phone is shaking or you've got a cat trying to get away from you and actually it does make a difference of the 13 side-by-side photos i shot with each phone 11 were in reasonable focus on the oppo versus only four on the s21 i mean anyone with a child or a pet knows how important being able to take a photo of a fast moving target in focus can be so points to oppo now quick disclaimer i'm not a professional photographer i have been described as blinds of bats by a comment in a previous comparison so you don't have to agree with me and i'd love to hear which phone you think comes out on top in the comments but spoiler alert you really can't go wrong with either so both phones have the ultra wide the main and the telephoto with a two times optical zoom on the oppo and both three times and 10 times optical zooms on the s21 ultra and at 30 times the s21 is still just about usable although at 100 times well neither look great but the s21 is clearly the long range zoom champion but most of the time you'll be using closer zooms so this is shot with their respective two and three times opticals but the oppo looks oddly flat here both the swan's feathers and the water so the s21 is a lot more detailed and even more so when we zoom in further to 10 times but then at the other end of the spectrum the ultra wide lens also doubles as a macro and they both look great actually albeit with a slightly different field of view here's another example firstly using the main lens and then close up with the ultra wide which automatically switches to macro now a big selling point of the find x3 pro's camera is the fact that both the main and the ultra wide are exactly the same so as i switch between them on paper at least we shouldn't see that much difference although here we can see the ultrawide is a lot brighter and so the colors also shift a fair bit but this is a much better example of it working well although neither phone drastically changes between the lenses if we crop in by 300 from the main lens the photos look remarkably similar in terms of detail with the only difference really being a slightly more saturated tone on the oppo it is usually samsung's phones that we talk about as looking more vibrant or oversaturated but the oppo takes it a step further and here it is certainly more eye-catching close-up still with the main lens not the macro and the detail is incredible on both so far the slightly oversaturated oppo hasn't been a problem but quite simply that foam box did not have any of the pinkish tones to it and that grass or is it the weeds around the bottom looks unnaturally green the s21 just looks more realistic here but aside from the color tone difference we are seeing a pattern of the oppo having brighter shadows so in the entrance at the bottom right here you can see a little bit more detail inside than on the s21 now it's funny because when i first saw these side by side i immediately thought oh i like the s21 shots more but then my wife sarah looked and said she liked the oppo as it was less contrasty and a little bit more flattering and we're seeing this pattern of a brighter image on the oppo and a slightly more contrasty and shadow heavy look on the s21 this is another great example of the pattern we're seeing just look how dark the shadow i'm casting on the wall to my left is on both but while the lighter shadows on the oppo do look more realistic the downside of the brighter image is my forehead and my face are a bit overexposed and blown out it's the same here the s21 handles the dynamic range better by softening the highlights on her face and giving us a more natural look okay let's switch gears or at least turn the lights down and holy moly the opposed white balance is way off with this one and again the s21's dynamic range is doing a better job at evening out the light strip behind my desk now same photo but with the ultra wide lens and despite oppo's claims of uniformity between the two lenses this photo does not look the same it actually looks better although for dynamic range and white balance i'm still giving it to the s21 here's another ultra wide night mode shot and they both look great and the colors are much more realistic on the oppo this time but despite the overly contrasty tone of the s21 we are getting a more even exposure overall from the picture frame at the top right to the lampshade at the top left however i did note that while doing these night mode tests the oppo was much faster it took the s21 several seconds longer each time and in extreme low light literally it's just the candles here they're very similar but the s21s are touch brighter and if you look at the wall in particular there is less noise for this one i actually had to look away from the phones just to confirm what i was seeing in real life as these look so different and it was much closer to the s21 its white balance is hard to beat let's switch to the front camera and they both let you use nine mode for selfies which is great but here the upper looks a lot nicer you've almost got like an iphone look to its brighter and flatter photos now i think i took this at about 1am so it was definitely past my bedtime the s21 is clearly the more detailed shot but it also looks over sharpened it's not very aesthetically pleasing although maybe that's just my face okay that's better in good light we're seeing the s21 handle the highlights on our faces better than the oppo where it looks slightly blown out we're definitely seeing this pattern of samsung selfies leaning towards a warmer yellowy tone whereas the oppo has pinkier reddish hues you can see more texture in our faces on the s21 but if i was going to post one of these straight away on instagram i'd pick the oppo and here the samsung does seem to be struggling with the lighting it's much darker and far too yellow okay last photo of me i promise this is a portrait selfie and you really can't go wrong with either when you have good lighting switching back to video again and in low light while it's taking ages for the oppo to correctly re-expose here but throughout the s21 is a fair bit brighter although the oppo is noticeably more detailed particularly if you look at fine text and when we get close up to these flowers now let me show you how they compare during the day and if we go through the different lenses while recording the s21 can zoom in further but then at the expense of stabilization pulling back out and then switching between the main ultrawide lenses they both do a good job of maintaining brightness and color but then when we pan up to the clouds you can see the s21 is doing a better job at reducing the blown out highlights so you can see a lot more detail in the cloud although switching to the ultra wide and it's not quite as effective but it's much closer to the oppo however one thing that does surprise me is the fine x3 pro doesn't seem to be able to shoot 8k video maybe this is because it's pre-release software but there just simply isn't an option for 8k on the oppo at the moment so that's a lot to take in and of course they do each have their own unique features the s21 has single take and the director's view modes while the find x3 pro can shoot 10-bit raw photos and then also view them back natively on the 10-bit screen although these heif files are difficult to edit and share but i think if i absolutely had to pick a winner and this is just my opinion of course i would go with the galaxy s21 ultra it's just a bit more versatile offers better dynamic range and night mode shots with the more natural white balance however the over sharpening can look unnatural sometimes and on the whole i do prefer the selfie camera on the oppo but i think its biggest selling point is the faster shutter speed don't forget it wiped the floor with the s21 in the thread test and that alone might be a good enough reason to go for the finex3 pro but what about you which phone do you think has the best camera let me know in the comments below and if you enjoyed this video and would like me to make more camera comparisons then give me a thumbs
