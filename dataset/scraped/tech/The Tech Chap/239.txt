all right let's do this hey guys Anton the tech chap and I've got the new Microsoft Surface go-to with me here and I want to give you guys my impressions after using it for the past couple of weeks because the surface go-to is such an interesting laptop well tablet really with an optional keyboard to make yet - and what the fact that this starts from just 380 pounds or 400 dollars and you get this beautifully designed Windows tablet which looks and feels much more premium than the price would suggest and also is gorgeous ten point five inch pixel sense screen is on the one hand incredible value for money but the problem is really what you're gonna want to deal with this is pay a bit more and get it with a new core m3 processor it makes a big difference to performance and also you get more RAM and more storage but once you do that and then you add on the surface keyboard which you're probably gonna want to do they just start to get a little more pricey just north of 700 pounds at that point you could buy some pretty decent laptops so it's such an interesting dilemma that it starts off really cheap but the one you'd want makes it quite expensive but before we get into all that I'm whether you should buy it let me run you through what's new and what it's been like to use so first thing we've got this [ __ ] refresh design it looks and feels almost exactly the same as before but they've trimmed the bezels around the edge thank God because the original one had some pretty chunky bezels I don't think they could have gone a little bit further although of course if you are using it in tablet mode then you're gonna want to use that for yourself thumb rest but what it means is they must have fitted a 10.5 inch screen of from ten cheese on the original go so it's just a slightly sleeker slightly more modern looking tablet but in terms of dimensions and weight and you know build quality it's essentially identical to before we've got this awesome hinge which you can use it any angle up to about there and that's a really nice angle if you are doing some you know digital drawing perhaps you do invest in the surface pen which will cost you a hundred extra and then if you go for the keyboard it just snaps on and then we've got this second layer of magnets which then pop up so you again you've got a slightly better angle for the keyboard as you might expect though using this on your lap isn't the most comfortable experience it's not particularly heavy so it doesn't dig in but I think because of the smaller form factor it kind of feels like it's gonna fall between your legs and yeah it's just not particularly comfortable to use I definitely recommend a table or a desk just quickly guys a big thank you to surf shark VP for sponsoring this video and

extra free so just click the link below or enter the code tech chap at checkout so why not give surf shop a try other changes include a faster USB C port it's still not Thunderbolt 3 unfortunately but now it's USB 3.1 genuine which means it supports 10 gigabits per second transfer up from five on the original go so you can output from this to a 4k monitor at 60 Hertz or dual full HD monitors at 60 Hertz which is more than enough for most people and crucially you can charge through the USB C port if you want so if you don't fancy bringing the Microsoft Surface connector with you when you you know go traveling then you can you also use your PS PC charger for your phone so the port selection is pretty limited just this one USB C port a headphone jack and the surface connector although you can also buy Microsoft Surface dark and I'll give you a few extra port options the 8 megapixel rear camera and the 5 megapixel front camera are the same as before although actually quality is really good the webcams on surface devices are among the best on any laptop or tablet but what is improved now is the fact we get dual far-field what they call studio mics so audio quality for your webcam chat will be better ok here's a question would you call this a webcam or a selfie camera I'm not sure it's a web camera on laptop but then a selfie on a phone I don't know anyway this is being shot with the front facing five megapixel I can speak 5 megapixel camera and one of the things I love is it's just so portable being a tablet that I can carry you around and then plunk it down on a table or a desk at just a stand and then we can continue our super important business meeting or whatever it is we're doing so hopefully this is giving you an idea of the audio/video quality from the go to honestly it is one of the best front facing cameras you can get on any laptop or tablet to be honest so if you are doing lots of web call zoom conferences for Microsoft Team chats whatever it is you do then this really is a sowing point of the go I think we also get faster Wi-Fi 6 previously it was Wi-Fi 5 and also a slightly slightly more powerful processor the forty four to five wine that's up from the forty four one five wide but really the big upgrade in terms of performance is the option to expect this with the Intel Core M 380 100y processor is an 8th gen chip it's still wide series so it's super low power but it's significantly faster than the Pentium so this is where things get a little bit tricky because I've got the one up from the entry-level spec it has the slower pentium processor well me m3 but we get eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage and I'll see you back 530 pounds or $550 by itself that's a hundred and thirty more than the base model but to be quite honest anything beyond browsing the web using edge working in office watching Netflix or perhaps laying your kids to the homework performance starts to become an issue here so if you do need more power for a bit of photo editing or to you know have more the couple of chrome tabs open at the same time then you'll want to pay six hundred and twenty pounds or six thirty dollars for the core m3 model which also gets you double of RAM and storage so personally I'd recommend the m3 speck in benchmarks it's between sixty and a hundred percent faster than the Pentium but really it all comes down to your budget and how you'll use it now in terms of battery life one hour of YouTube used 14 percent that was at 50 percent brightness with power saving mode and over the last couple of weeks I'd say I've been getting about seven hours of general use from this which is okay but I've really not been pushing it very hard because you can't I mean Lightroom kind of chugs hasn't se having more than a couple of chrome tabs open it starts to get slow so you can't only do light use with this but you know with that said it'll still get you through a full day I would definitely recommend buying this with the type cover keyboard though it does add an extra 125 pounds on top which is quite a lot but I think it makes it much more usable if you actually want to get some proper work done I mean this ships running Windows 10 S which is kinda nice if who's gonna give it to you know your kids because it's a more lockdown faster version of Windows although you can switch back to full fat windows in just a couple of minutes and it is free so it doesn't really make a difference there but yeah I would recommend the type cover the fully backlit keys are lovely to type on the same experience really is the proper service keyboard albeit with a little more flex and the precision touchpad is smooth and responsive and a pretty decent size actually but then of course if you don't fancy using can just take it off and then carry on watching your movie or doing your zoom call or whatever it is you do on your computer so the big question should you actually buy the service go to well it depends on you it depends how you're gonna use it I still wouldn't recommend it as a primary laptop because I think it's just a bit too small and a bit too underpowered unless you're doing the most basic of tasks still I would recommend paying that extra I'm going for the m3 model and also tack on one of these guys but then as I say that puts you just above 700 pounds so at that point you can heed to ask yourself do you need a tablet whether it's a you know digital drawing all the extra portability of it because if not you could get a much more powerful clamshell laptop for similar money but there's no question this is a beautiful device with a fantastic screen the peripherals that you can get with a boot the peripherals you can get including the type cover the service panel surface Mouse means that yes well it does start to add up it is a lovely experience and considering the cheapest 380 paddle is fine for students office work and you know basic web browsing then considering the quality of the screen the build quality the fact that we get two cameras built-in and the flexibility of being a two and one if you go for the keyboard it's pretty versatile for the money but importantly this isn't your only option because if you do want that extra performance for a bit of photo and video editing or a little bit of Photoshop then really it's the surface pro 7 that you should be buying which will cost you a few hundred more but there's a cute little tablet laptop during one affordable second device thing for your kids so to do some emails on then this is great it really is all you need and if you do want to make this the ultimate portable device you can also pay a hundred more and get it with LTE support well what do you reckon would you be tempted by the surface go to and if you were gonna buy it which spec would you go for let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat oh and don't
