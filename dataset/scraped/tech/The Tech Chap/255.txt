hey guys Anton the tape job but I want to find out which has the best battery life between these flagship phones now of course I want this to be a fair test so I'm making sure all the settings are the same they all have the exact same brightness on the screen so as you can see from the specs we do have different refresh rates and also in the case of ES 20 the one plus and the oppo different resolution options so what I've done is either kept them at a default setting or in the case of the oneplus and the Oppo set them to auto switch so the s 20 is actually at 120 Hertz at Full HD plus because you don't have an option for quad HD plus with a high refresh whereas one plus and the Oppo have both the high refresh and the resolution set to automatically switch based on battery life the point is this is how most of us would want to use our phones so I'm keeping this as wheel world as possible I'm sure you guys appreciate these videos take a long time to make so if you give me a thumbs up or maybe in a subscribe button below that would be incredible so for this test I'm running through YouTube Instagram tick-tock a couple of games and clean Call of Duty mobile and asphalt 9 as well as recording some 4k video running a benchmark and then rinse and repeating until they die pretty much so obviously is a pretty intensive real-world test and straight away we can see the s20 Ultra is falling someway behind the pack although I do need to make clear that this is the X naught 990 version this is the model I have access to in the UK and actually after this video go and check out my Snapdragon versus X NAS video because it's pretty illuminating actually the X naught isn't very good compared to the Snapdragon and actually in a test with the standard s 20 the Snapdragon still have 13 percent battery left when the X nots died so bear that in mind if you have a Snapdragon s 20 ultra then it will perform a bit better than this but we'll come back to that at the end at this stage though it's pretty clear the iPhone 11 pro max is taking the lead with the oneplus a and the Opera fine x2 pro coming in sort of a close second third place and then a p40 pro and then the pixel for excel the only phone that doesn't have a high refresh rate is the iPhone so I am expecting that to do quite well here because obviously that is a bit of a drain on the battery and the s20 the oneplus and the Oppo go for the smoothness to 120 Hertz so that will have an effect on battery life and also just look at the size of the battery all the way from 37 hundred milliamps on the pixel to five thousand on the s20 but then again we've also got a range of screen sizes from six point three to six point nine again for the pixel and Samsung respectively and then the processor the RAM and of course the battery size all come into play keep an eye on the timer on the right though because while we'll see winners and losers here these are all incredible flagship phones and you can't go wrong with any of them also don't worry I know there's loads more phones out there for example when I get my hands on the Sony Xperia 1 mark - there's yummy meat m-pro and LG g9 among others I'll make more of these battery tests for this video I just wanted to include the latest phone from each of these brands but it seems the s20 ultra is the first one to fail at 8 hours and 20 minutes that's not a bad performance but it is last of the pack here and unfortunately so let's get back into it and see which one's next and if the picks all about five minutes later so we've got four phones left in the pack and actually three of them are pretty close although the iPhone clearly is out in front at the 8 hour 45 minute mark we're on 10% on Huawei 14 in the oneplus 15 on the Oppo and still 28 on the iPhone but then after another intensive game of asphalt 9 the p40 Pro is down to 6% I think we've got our fourth place coming up and there we go during the 4k recording challenge the Huawei P fully pro has finally given up at 9 hours and 8 minutes that's a very respectable performance and consider last year's May 30 Pro had an even bigger 4,500 million power battery I think it would have given the iPhone and run for its money and then about half an hour later at 9 hours 35 that's tape for the Oppo find x2 pro with just 1% left on the oneplus 8 pro 1 plus and the Oppo are incredibly similar phones in terms of design and specs but incredibly even though 1% it just carries on and carries on oneplus ain't Pro will not die in fact it's nearly half an hour later just sitting at 1 percent that the oneplus 8 pro finally gives up and that gives us our second place which no surprise really leaves the iPhone 11 Pro max as the winner of this battery test and just for closure it took another 19 minutes for the iPhone to finally die 11 hours and 30 and if you're watching this and you just jump to the end of the video to get the results then well fair enough work smart not hard so in last place the s20 ultra which I must have met is quite disappointing given that huge 5000 million power battery the fact that is only full HD plus with 120 Hertz but unfortunately I think a big part of the issue is that Exynos chip inside if this was a Snapdragon version I reckon we get an extra hour out of it and it could have come in third place then we have the pixel for egg cell it's the smaller screen but also the smallest battery life but it does have a 90 housed refresh rate if I was a betting man I would have said that was gonna come last so kind of a surprise that it came fifth in fourth place we have the Huawei P 40 pro and I think you did a great job although I think what may be an issue sometimes is not having the most optimized apps for example my youtube test had to be done for the web browser as there isn't a native app so I reckon if you were just using apps from the quarry gallery this would have lasted longer but still a good showing from huawei then in third place the Oppo find next to pro which was neck and neck with a oneplus throughout but then fell short to the final hurdle which gave second place the oneplus 8 pro which I have to say in my experience oneplus phones have always had good but not necessarily amazing battery life but actually in this test this was the best performing Android phone in terms of battery life which I did not expect coming into this but in first place with the appropriately gold color is the iPhone 11 pro max to be fair it has the least amount of RAM it's also the only phone with a 60 Hertz screen but relative to the others the battery size isn't actually that big it's all about that efficiency and optimization between the a13 chip the rest of the hardware and of course iOS 13 but do let me know in the comments which phone you'd most like to see in the next one so I hope you guys found that useful it did taming eleven and a half hours to actually run the test so if I could get a thumbs up and maybe a sub for that that would be amazing thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chure
