hey guys Anton a tech chap and we've now had Microsoft and Sony share loads more juicy details including the full specs of the Xbox series X and the PS 5 although I think the biggest surprise is that vo is still alive so they were expected to come out in November but we still don't know how much they're gonna cost although I'll speculate at the end but for now really we've just been given the techie side of things without a great deal of gameplay and in the case of Sony we still haven't even seen the console or the controller which is a bit disappointing as Microsoft have bed all for the series X ok let's start with the specs and here they are side by side and fundamentally they're based on very similar hardware custom 8 core AMD Zen 2 processors AMD rDNA to point of graphics 16 gigabytes of superfast GDD r 6 Ram and custom SSDs which I reckon will be the most significant upgrade in real terms over last gen consoles what I think is really exciting though is usually with consoles they're just playing catch-up to pcs and they're kind of outdated before they even come out but that's not the case here with the gt-r 6 Ram PCIe for storage the rDNA 2 graphics and all the custom hardware and software it's all cutting edge or not even available in the PC market just yet and actually if you were to try to build an equivalent desktop PC it will cost you at least 1,500 pounds and as I say some of the tech is just not available yet although let me know in the comments if you would like to see a video all about how the consoles compared to pcs and whether you could actually build a PC do let me know and I'll try and make that in the next week so on paper the Xbox does appear to be a bit more powerful than the PS 5 with higher teraflops more compute units and faster processor speeds however the ps5 graphics card has a higher clock speed and we get a much faster SSD a word of warning though because specs don't tell us the whole story let's take the PS 5 versus a ps4 for example this is gonna get a little bit techy for a second but the custom rd- graphics chip in the PS 5 has 36 compute units which run a max 2.2 three gigahertz that gives us ten point two eight teraflops of peak computes the transistor density of the new graphics is 62 percent higher than the ps4 so the PS 536 II use is actually equivalent to 58 on the it's for and on top of that the PS 5s are running over twice the frequency so altogether that is a big boost in performance but it also goes to show how you do have to be careful when you're just looking at the specs on paper not all teraflops are made equal and sony in particular are trying to be more intelligent with developer features like kraken for compressing data and new geometry engine for better optimization and how fewer but faster compute units than the Xbox Series X may actually end up working better in games on a very high level and we just look at graphics performance the PS 5 looks similar to that of the Nvidia RT X 2080 whereas the Xbox Series X is a little closer to the 2080 Super but I think a better comparison will be with aim DS next gen rDNA desktop cards which we're coming out later in the year now interestingly sony microsoft do slightly different things when it comes to the processor with Microsoft they let developers choose between having either a three point six six gigahertz clock speed but that then lets them use multi-threading if they want the game to support it or a slightly higher 3.8 gigahertz clock speed without multi-threading but it always maintains that same frequency whereas on the sony it actually caps at three point five five gigahertz but it is a variable frequency you can go up and down but while maintaining the same power draw it doesn't really make any difference to you and me but it will be interesting to see how that affects developers now when it comes to RAM while both have 16 gigabytes of cutting-edge GDD are six Ram the set up is a little bit different you can see the Xbox has a bigger 320 bit interface but the RAM is split 10 gigs is much faster for games and six gigs is a little bit slower for the UI and background stuff the truth is until we have them right here with me side by side like I do with the current gen consoles it's all sort of speculation on paper the Xbox does appear to be a little bit more powerful but as always with consoles except for exclusive games generally developers optimize their games for the lesser powerful model so you know it will run well on both so I don't think it's really gonna matter that much and regardless if one console is a few percent faster than the other the bottom line is the performance boost means we'll get much better looking games features we've only seen on high-end pcs like ray tracing for more realistic lighting shadows and reflections and of course higher resolutions and refresh rates both consoles through the new HDMI to point one port will support games up to 4k at one 20 Hertz and technically even a que although the game itself and your TV will also need to support them the performance target for both is 4k 60 on the vast majority of games though but by far the biggest upgrade with the new consoles is the jump from slow old hard drives to super fast SSDs or solid-state drives silent no spinning discs and up to a hundred times faster now they both use custom SSDs using the brand-new PCIe 4 standard but it looks like contrary to the early rumors the PS 5 SSD will actually be around twice as fast as the Xbox series X Sony may have a real advantage here but still compared to the 50 to 100 megabytes per second on the ps4 and the fact we now get instant seek times versus between 2 and 50 milliseconds before altogether sony say the PS 5s io will be 100 times faster than the ps4 it's a similar story on the Xbox series X albeit with slightly slower speeds but made no mistake this is a revolutionary upgrade for these next gen consoles and while we have had SSDs on PCs for donkey's years now what we're getting in the consoles is actually way more advanced than pretty much anything you can buy right now for example both consoles will offer expandable storage Microsoft will sell one terabyte expansion cards prices TBC which look a lot like old memory cards and then easily slot into the new port on the back of the series X on the PS 5 it's not as simple you'll need to buy a certified third-party m2 SSD that is at least as fast as the internal SSD so games perform as they should but ideally faster as it won't have some of the custom hardware basically it's unlikely that any SSD on the market right now will work but by the end of the year we may have a couple of options now price is gonna be a big factor we don't know how much Microsoft's expansion card all these third-party m2 SSDs are going to cost probably quite a lot to be honest although at this stage with Microsoft's extra 150 gigs or so internally and the fact that you can then just buy this additional one terabyte card from them and just pop it in the back and you're good to go just seemed like the most simple and streamlined option so what does that all mean well ultra fast boot times almost instant game loading quick resume between different games more developer freedom when it comes to level design and movement speeds faster patch installs the benefits are endless now both Sony and Microsoft are putting a lot of effort into backwards compatibility but at this stage it does seem like Microsoft is promising more with the OG xbox Xbox 360 and Xbox one compatibility on the series x+ they've talked about upscaling the resolution frame rate and potentially even adding proper HDR even to original Xbox games sony hasn't said as much yet but they have said the current backwards compatible ps3 games will work as well as almost all ps4 games both consoles are also pushing next-gen 3d audio focusing on more immersive sound without the need for say expensive dolby atmos speakers before this audio always seemed like an afterthought for new consoles and I can't wait to try it so that's just a quick look at all the specs but Sony are promising a full teardown on the PS 5 soon so we can compare the design the cooling the controllers and hopefully see more real next-gen games I mean that's what it's all about really not just picking through all the tech specs although that is exactly what we've just during this video but of course it's about the games as always though when it comes to the question of which is best which one should you buy it doesn't really matter what the teraflops and the raw specs are as long as they're roughly comparable yes maybe if you're gonna spend five hundred pounds or so you do want the most powerful one that is important but Willy comes down to the exclusive games which is best value for money and also which one you mate to play on so you can play with them online but the good news is well this year kind of sucks right now I think we all know why at least we do have two great consoles coming out probably November that we can look forward to and I can't wait to see what developers do with all that extra hardware and those crazy fast SSDs but let me know which one you're more excited for by voting in the polls all right and also let me know why in the comments below and also how much you reckon the consoles will be under speculating but I'm thinking probably $500 full EPS 5 and maybe 550 for the Xbox but anything more than that I think they're gonna really struggle but then again if you do compare it to a silly spec PC you probably be paying three or four times as much so we've really do end up being a little bit pricey relatively maybe a pretty good value thanks for watching guys stay safe and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat [Music]
