very nice look at that hey guys i'm tom with techchap and this is the lenovo legion seven the world's first 16-inch 165 hertz gaming laptop and it's powered by amd i've got the more affordable base model here although you can spec it with up to a ryzen 9 5900 hx rtx 3080 32 gigs of ram and two terabytes of storage if you just want to go crazy so this is actually the first time i've had a play with this and i've also teamed up with the lovely people over at lenovo legion and amd who are very kindly sponsoring this video because they are immensely proud of this and they just want to show it off and i can't blame them there's a lot to like here on the outside we have this premium understated design with an aluminium chassis this dark gray sort of anthracite color is called storm gray if you were wondering and we've also got this little glossy legion logo giving it a bit of flair also considering this is a 16 inch gaming laptop the fact that it is about two and a half kilograms or five and a half pounds means it is surprisingly portable the first time you open it up you'll be surprised that the screen just keeps going it's a full 180 degree hinge so the screen can lie completely flat and actually having this much flexibility is really useful especially if you're using this on a laptop stand and of course no gaming laptop will be complete without a nice bit of go faster rgb along with the rgb corsair iq keyboard we've got this rgb strip running around the front and sides of the chassis even coming out of the fan vents and particularly in low light it really does make the legion 7 stand out plus you can customize it through the iq software if you don't want a constant barrage of rainbow rgb or you can simply turn it off if it's not your cup of tea but let's talk about this screen because not only is it 16 inches which means you're getting a bit more screen real estate as the phrase goes bigger is better but they've also made the bezels incredibly thin so it doesn't really add much to the size of the laptop but at 16 inches full hd isn't really sharp enough and of course 4k just destroys your frame rate so sensibly they've gone down the middle of the road with quad hd plus or 2560 by 1600 which if you know your resolutions means yes this is a 16 by 10 aspect ratio which i'm very happy about that means the screen's a little bit taller add to that a fast 165 hertz refresh rate three millisecond response time nvidia g-sync and amd freesync premium you can't really ask for more well except it's also pantone color calibrated we get 100 srgb an impressive 500 nits of brightness so it's easy to use out and about as well and support for display hdr 400 and dolby vision hdr not too shabby in the perfect world maybe an oled or mini led option would have been nice to see and also if you are going to be playing the most demanding latest aaa games then i would probably spec this with a 30 70 or an 80 uh one of the highest skus to really max out that 165 hertz at quad hd or you can just drop the resolution to 1080p but even this base model with the ryzen 7 5800h and the rtx 3060 plays really well i mean age of empire's four isn't going to be as demanding as forza or battlefield so it does all depend on what you're playing but we do also get lenovo's legion ai engine so when you actually launch a game it optimizes the hardware the software the drivers and then gives you the best performance possible and uniquely they've actually got 16 custom tuned profiles for the top 16 most popular aaa games which they say boost your fps between 5 and 16 pressing the function key and q together is also a quick shortcut for switching between fan profiles or you can just keep it on auto mode but even after hours of gaming the legion 7 didn't get uncomfortably hot or loud their legion cold front 3.0 tech and the dual fan system we have in here seems to work really well i still think it's pretty crazy that you can do that on a gaming laptop but lenovo say with the legion 7 you can get up to about 8 hours of battery life although obviously not when you're gaming we do also get a fast 300 watt power brick which uh plugs into the back here along with all the other ports although the usbs do also support power delivery up to 100 watts so you can charge it that way but not quite as fast and actually the nice thing about having an amd ryzen 5000 chip is that even this entry level model has eight cores and 16 threads so you can use this for gaming or you can use it for working editing rendering opening multiple chrome tabs go crazy built on a seven nanometer architecture they're fast power efficient and particularly good for thin and light gaming laptops like this for example the top spec ryzen 9 5900 hx has a 31 percent smaller power envelope than a 99 11 980 hk which in turn gives you better battery life and also a cooler quieter laptop and so in battlefield 2042 with high settings at quad hd i'm averaging 82 fps on this entry level spec just a quick mention of ports because we basically get one of everything with this on the sides we have these uh two type c usb 3.2 gen 2s which also support power delivery but pretty much everything else is at the back which is great because and it keeps all your cables out the way including an hdmi 2.1 which is always good to see rj45 ethernet the only thing i maybe would have liked to have seen is a full size sd card slot because i could see myself doing some video editing on this but also you'll notice on the what side is it right side as you look at it we actually have this little uh toggle for the privacy on the webcam so toggling that physically disables the webcam which is always a good option for privacy we also get bluetooth 5.1 wi-fi 6 and the cherry on top with this for me is we get some surprisingly good speakers now i do appreciate this video is sponsored but i never take on one of these projects unless i am genuinely convinced by the product itself and i've been using the lenovo legion seven for the past week or so was my main gaming laptop and i'm really enjoying it what really surprised me is how good the cooling is particularly on a thin and light gaming notebook like this and of course it is also the world's first 16-inch quad hd plus 165 hertz screen i've used a lot of gaming laptops and the legion 7 really does stand out the performance the build quality that screen it all adds up to make this one of the best gaming laptops you can buy right now but i've actually saved the best till last because i get to give away three
