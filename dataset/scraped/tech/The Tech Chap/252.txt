hey guys I'm from a tech jam and this is the new second generation iPhone se I was actually gonna start this video by saying that I'm using the oneplus 8 pro at the moment and how dinky and cute the new se looks next of that but actually had to pause recording because the mailman knocked on my door because this has just come from eBay which I bought a few days ago the original se and you can see actually compared to that this original se just feels like almost like a kid's toy or something and I think that's one of the reasons why the new se is gonna sell by the truckload because the vast majority of my friends and people I talk to they're not spending a thousand on a new phone they want something that's affordable a reasonable size that they can use one-handed you know is going to last them a few years and has a good camera and this checks all the boxes for this but lined up you can see the new se is a little bit smaller than the 11pro but still a good deal bigger than the original se we're looking at a 4.7 inch display and essentially we're getting the body of an iPhone 8 but with vastly improved internals so we have a glass back which does support while it's charging we've got an element you see around the edge stereo speakers it's also IP 67 water resistance which means you can dunk this in up to a metre of water for half an hour there's single camera lens on the back which Apple is very cleverly saying is the best single camera on iphone to date it comes in three colors black white and this product red which i think is my favorite color and a portion of the proceeds goes towards a covert relief charity so when I first unbox this my initial impression was everything feels so small they say I'm using the 8 Pro at the moment which is massive compared to this but if you are using an older of 8 7 6 gen iPhone or even the original IC and this is gonna feel right at home for you actually so with the SCT obviously we had the touch ID button and these pretty chunky bezels which were about as thick as my finger and side by side with the 11pro which just cost two and a half times more it does feel a little bit old-fashioned but you could argue it's a more classic iPhone logo but aside from the size one thing you'll notice is missing on the new se is the headphone jack that is something we got on the original one but it has disappeared here as you would expect really Apple want you to buy their pods so yeah that is something that we've lost so from the outside is a slightly refined iPhone 8 with absorb centralized Apple logo a slightly different camera layout but it's what's on the inside that counts we've got apples latest a 13 Bionic chip that's the same one that you'll get in the iPhone 11 Pro max which costs about three times more which is insane for a phone that costs $400 or 420 pounds and using it feels just like the iPhone 11 Pro to be honest it's got the same 60 Hertz refresh it's powered by the same a 13 chip what does that really mean well you can burn or play any Apple game on this flawlessly and you'll be able to do that from probably several years to come and we get the latest software this shipped with iOS 13.4 it's just lovely to use I kind of forgot how much I appreciate using our phone one-handed it's been a few years but aside from the price I think what really makes the SE to stand out is the camera apple on going into specifics about exactly which sensor its using but the 12 megapixel F 1.8 camera on the back again given the price is incredible and we can even show up to 4k 60 video so here's a few shots from the SE but I also wanted to compare it to the iPhone 11 Pro just to see what we are missing out versus the higher-end iPhones and on the face of it there isn't a massive difference really they both use my HDR you can use portrait mode on both and to be honest even cropping in by three times there's not really much in it sometimes the SE by comparison is a little less detailed and maybe a tad noisier but if you're just posting these on Instagram I think most people will be hard-pressed to tell them apart of course we are missing out on the ultra wide and the telephoto lens plus we don't get any night mode on the SE 2 which is a little bit disappointing alright so this is being shot at 4k 30 on both the iPhone se 2 and the iPhone 11 Pro if we give it some challenging lighting let's see how it handles the dynamic range we do a little focus test between this plant and the one behind it and see if there's much difference actually they both seem to be focusing pretty much just as well please excuse my very messy house right now with so much tech and camera gear and iPhones it's pretty crazy and also very fingerprinting iPad pro right there with the magic keyboard with Jam also working on a video for so make sure you do stay tuned for that but what about front-facing video how do you think they compare the SE to actually choose the TTP words the iPhone 11 Pro which I've got here goes up to 4k with the front camera I'm not sure how often or how many people would actually use 4k obviously you do get bigger file sizes but then again it's a high resolution little bit sharper but let's see how they're handling the dynamic range of that very bright background a slightly darker foreground just change the lighting up a little bit do you think there's a big difference we know the comments below as for battery life I think I need to spend a little bit more time with it but my experience so far is it it's good a little bit less than say the iPhone 11 pro and while has a relatively tiny battery the smaller screen size and the low resolution and also the lower peak brightness this tops out at 625 nits all helped mitigate it so you'll still easily get a full day out of it but it's not in the same league as say the iPhone 11 pro max this really is one of the best budget slash sort of mid-range phones that you can buy no yes I do know that there were tons of really good Android alternatives for similar money or even less you know you got the real me x2 pro you got the Xiaomi me note 10 and of course the pixel 3a and hopefully also the pixel for a coming soon which I can't wait to put this again so that's gonna be I think the real competitor to this but the thing is while they're all great phones and you know offer better specs and some regards maybe full HD screens when we don t hird maybe more RAM but the truth is I think most Android users probably upgrade their phone every two years or so I bet with iPhones it's less often I know a couple of people who still have the original SE in fact and yes I know that Apple was guilty of software updates slowing down all the phones so that their batteries didn't explode and all that so that is a concern but as a package with that a 13 chip the latest software the really good camera and all for $400 or 420 pounds I don't think there's a better value phone and I think this like the original SE for a lot of people will be their phone for the next three four maybe even five years and with those specs I think it can easily last that long although to be fair no other phone in 2020 has bezel and a screen to body ratio like this I appreciate it helped Apple make the SE 2 cheaper and we can argue it's a classic design but it does seem a little lazy from being honest I mean we give Google and the pixel phones enough grief for their bezels and I think if the for a launch looking like this people would make a big deal about it but they've got the fundamentals right and for the vast majority of my friends who asked me pretty often what phones I should buy if they want an iPhone this is gonna be the one that I recommend what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of these do you think Apple have been lazy with just a parts bin rehash of the iPhone 8 or do you think that's absolutely fine given the fact that we're getting a good cheap iPhone let me know in the comments below and also give me your best suggestions for what se stands for I know it's probably special edition or even small edition but I want the funniest wrong answers for what se stands for
