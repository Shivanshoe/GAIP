hey guys i'm tom of techchap and it seems that microsoft have made the first move we now know the xbox series x will cost 500 or 450 pounds when it launches on november the 10th now fingers crossed that sony either match or maybe even undercut this price they have an opportunity to maybe go even more aggressive than microsoft but i wanted to make this video because while 500 is still an awful lot of money i still think these next gen consoles are shaping up to be an absolute bargain so firstly microsoft is going all out trying to make the new xbox seem like good value and also crucially make it more accessible so they've introduced xbox all access and so in 12 countries including the us and uk they're bundling the series x console along with an xbox game pass ultimate subscription and ea play for 35 or 29 pounds a month that's over 24 months and so in the us at least that works out to be 840 over the two-year period which is actually 20 less than if you were just to pay the 500 upfront for the console and then the uh 15 a month subscription to xbox game pass plus of course you get ea play thrown in as well and i think this is a really smart plan because i remember what was it 20 years ago now when the ps2 came out and i was you know begging my parents for the 300 pounds to buy it and i think like a lot of parents they then recoil back thinking you know we're not going to spend 300 pounds on a video game console although i think in the end they did actually buy it for my brother for like a birthday christmas thing combined that always used to happen uh but of course that upfront cost is an awful lot of money so if you can then switch that to the sort of subscription service that this is and pay 35 a month then well i think that's a really good idea so while it is basically just getting an xbox on finance because you know you're paying a monthly repayment to pay it off uh because they're throwing in uh you know game pass and ea play as well it feels more like a subscription service like an expensive netflix although of course you can still pay the full amount upfront if you want but what i think is even more interesting is what this means for the future because let's say you do sign up to this uh xbox all access i forgot what it was called there for a second and then you pay your 35 a month let's say in three years time you're still signed up but then the xbox series x pro or whatever terrible name they come up with next uh comes out then i bet you'll just be able to you know roll over to that swap your console out so it basically becomes like a phone contract if you're happy to pay this fee forever then you'll always have the new console now of course that's not gonna be for everyone some people still like to buy their phones up front but i think the vast majority of people don't so it's gonna be really fascinating to see if we do end up seeing consoles become the new mobile phones of gaming in terms of how you buy them i do appreciate mobile gaming is its own thing but all that doesn't really answer the question of why i think these consoles are bargains and good value that's sort of just answering how you can buy them so a few weeks ago i made a video where i tried to build a gaming pc with as close to next-gen console specs as possible and available at the time and it ended up costing me about 1400 pounds so that's around three times more than a series x and that was without the next-gen rd and a2 graphics now i do appreciate it's not quite that simple and you can't you know apples to apples compare pc versus console i mean with pcs you can customize and upgrade it how you like there's no monthly subscriptions games can be cheaper than consoles plus most xbox exclusives will be coming to pc as well and the fact is with a pc you're not just limited to playing games your gaming pc can also be a work or video editing machine but when you consider the series x is supposed to have sort of similar performance to a current rtx 2080 and then you've got an 8 core ryzen processor super fast pci 4 ssd storage a 4k blu-ray player and next-gen hdmi 2.1 ports all in a pretty compact design well it's hard to argue that these consoles aren't good value in fact even nvidia's brand new rtx 3070 graphics card uh which is their current entry-level model although i'm sure we'll see a 30-60 soon but that costs 500 so you could get the entire xbox series x for the same price as one uh 30 70 graphics card and you've got to build the rest of the pc around it now to be fair it's likely that microsoft are probably making a loss on the consoles themselves and hoping to grow their market share and also get everyone signed up to game pass and of course there's economies of scale and just having one or two skus means it's far cheaper to manufacture than you know me or you buying off the shelf parts for a pc but how does this price compare to older generations of consoles so if we take say the current xbox one x which launched back in 2017 for 500 it was the exact same price as the series x even though it's not a huge difference if you adjust that to today's money that's about 530 dollars so it is still technically cheaper in real terms than the current console is but the series x is only half the story because microsoft's also unveiled the series s which i don't know if i love the look of but it's just 300 now the s has roughly half the power of the x it's capped at 1440p and you do miss out on the 4k player but if you don't have a 4k tv or you just on a tighter budget then it's pretty awesome that you'll still be able to play all the latest and next-gen exclusive games but without paying the full five hundred dollars and they're doing a similar xbox all access subscription deal where it costs you 25 or 21 pounds a month rather than the 35 for its bigger brother the series x now don't get me wrong i'm not saying we all need to rush out and buy consoles on day one in fact i think most of us are probably good to wait a few months maybe until after christmas when uh maybe we'll see some discounts or at least more games coming out because i think the only game coming out at launch for the xbox that i'm probably gonna definitely buy is uh assassin's creed valhalla but aside from that there's not a huge amount that's going to you know really excite me to buy one on day one but it's easy to get on you know the pc master race high horse and look down at these simple basic consoles and be like that's not very good it's not as powerful as my new rtx 3090 or something but in terms of value for money and what you're getting as a package i don't think there's any comparison and you simply cannot build an equivalently powered pc for anything like the same cost so while fingers crossed suddenly do take this opportunity now that they have a bit of time to maybe adjust their pricing uh now they know what microsoft is going for perhaps they'll undercut it and be a bit more aggressive but either way even if the ps5 is also 500 i think it's incredible value for money and hopefully they also maybe do some sort of subscription access like this because to be honest while i think games are the most important deciding factor when it comes to what console to buy i think it's a pretty big deal if one of them you have to pay 500 upfront but the other one you can pay 25 or 35 a month for two years i think a lot of people especially a lot of kids of course have to convince their parents like i used to have to uh to drop some money on a new console that's gonna be a lot more uh appealing than the full amount so xbox may have a bit of a secret weapon here if sony don't match it but what do you reckon is 500 reasonable and also are you thinking of maybe going for the xbox or the ps5 or another of them and just going with a pc let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and if you do want to see more from me then make sure you hit that little
