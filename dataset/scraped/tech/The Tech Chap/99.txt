[Music] all right there we go hey guys i'm tom of techchap and while this may not be the most super duper over-the-top flashiest pc you've ever seen for that i might have to recruit my friend marcus from pccentric to come over and help me build one with custom water loops and all that good stuff but for me in terms of the actual hardware and the components i've gone for in this build it's absolutely my dream gaming and editing pc plus as you can see we've got all the go faster rgb light so you could throw a stick at okay yes this is all a bit showy off you which i don't normally like and it is a really frustrating time to be a pc gamer right now but this is less about oh look how good my pc is maybe there's like a little bit of that but it's more about my thinking behind the components and this build why i've gone for what i've gone with and the lessons i've learned from building it and a huge thank you to corsair amd nvidia and severance for providing samples for this build and i'll put links to everything i've used in the description below first things first the case and i went with the corsair 4000d airflow in black it does also come in white which maybe i should have gone for to make it stand out a little bit more but then i'd feel the need to go with white for all the other components and then things would just get a bit tricky and more expensive anyway 4000d airflow and i love just how compact this thing is but there's still plenty of room for even the biggest graphics cards you can buy and crucially it has mesh top and front panels which of course helps with the airflow which we'll need given what's going to go in here now quick side note because you may have seen my pc upgrade video from last year about eight months or so ago and if you did then you'll know that that pc was not exactly sluggish in fact it had an amd uh through red ripper 3970x which is a 32 core 64 thread chip and cost about two grand absolutely overkill and actually it wasn't really the best choice for how i use my pc for gaming and 4k premiere parading if you're maybe a pixar animator or editing 8k workflows or you know doing cad renderings then maybe you'll take advantage of those cores for my use cases it just didn't really make sense so actually i've gone down from a 32 core chip to a 16 core chip with the ryzen 9 5950x but crucially we have the newer zen 3 architecture and also much higher clock speed and actually this is noticeably faster in my day-to-day use however if you're just gonna build a purely gaming pc i would probably save a couple of hundred quid and go with intel's latest flagship the 11900k because while frustratingly does only have eight cores 16 threads we do get the higher clock speed and also it's a bit cheaper as well so for purely gaming that would probably be a better bet but a value bet but since this is both my gaming and workstation pc amd's flagship chip makes more sense and right now i don't think there's a better all-round productivity and gaming cpu than the 5950x it also means i'm not going to throttle the rtx 3090 fans edition card that i'm using in here now i'll be totally upfront because no one really should buy this card the 1390 just doesn't make sense for most consumers given the price realistically the new ti which i recently reviewed is full intents and purposes the new gaming flagship but even that doesn't represent good value over the 30 80. it's about 10 faster but 40 to 60 more expensive so if i was going to go out and buy a graphics card now assuming i actually could and it wasn't for a ridiculous price as well i would personally probably go with the rtx 3080. that's like the best value flagship card in my opinion right now but at the same time the 3090 is unquestionably the fastest gaming and also consumer productivity card you can buy and of course we're getting double the vram 24 gigs versus the 12 gigs on the 380 ti and also this bigger heatsink as well this is the founders edition card but i would suggest going with a third party like the asus tough series especially on higher end and more uh power hungry cards as the more robust aftermarket cooling and also the extra overclocking headroom is nice to have so ryzen 9 5950x paired with the rtx 3090 and then i've also got 64 gigs of uh corsair's dominated platinum rgb ram it's 3600 megahertz and while you could go crazy with 128 gigs 64 is still more than enough for me even with a 4k video rendering and a game running i never go above like 30 or 35 gigs and this all sits on the asus origi crosshair 8 dark hero 88 motherboard this seemed to have the best reviews for an x570 board without going crazy on something like the msi godlike but importantly we get two m2 slots and they're both pcie four onboard wi-fi six usb-c and in my experience i've always found asus boards nice to use and they're solid for overclocking i have maybe gone a little bit crazy with the storage though we've got 10 terabytes in here split between two drives the main boot drive is one of corsair's crazy fast mp600s two terabytes pci4 this thing is a beast i mean it even has its own built-in heatsink and we're looking at some pretty ridiculous speeds which is roughly twice as fast as my second drive which is an eight terabyte pcie three sabrant rocket m2 10 terabytes is an awful lot of storage but somehow it's getting filled up pretty quickly i think that's mainly because i shoot these videos in 10-bit 4k and also make proxies as well so that adds up plus i've got a dozen or so games installed so obviously pci 4 drives are a good deal faster looking at almost twice the speeds on the mp600 versus the sabrin rocket which is a big deal in terms of benchmarks but in reality you'd really struggle to tell the difference i don't think pci 4 is really necessary yet realistically i just stick with pci 3 unless maybe it doesn't cost that much more and you're just going to go with a boot drive pci 4 drive in which case maybe to make it a bit more future proof but it's not really necessary okay so for cooling i've gone with the 360 mil corsair h150i elite liquid cooler for the cpu and i've actually paired this with three corsair ql 120 rgb fans all these get great reviews and they use the iq software so it's nice and easy to control the rgb lighting and all that is powered by a 1000 watt corsair rm1000x fully modular psu and so that is the build and for the benchmarking enthusiasts amongst you here's what i'm getting in a couple of tests although i'm sure i can squeeze out a bit more performance if i spend some time giving this a proper overclock but even these vanilla numbers are pretty tasty corsair also sent over a few extras including the sabre rgb pro mouse the k70 rgb tkl mechanical gaming keyboard with cherry mx switches and they're both part of their champion gaming series and to tie it all together i've got the fancy corsair mm7000 rgb extended cloth gaming mat which i thought i would hate but actually i quite like it the lip of the map doesn't bother me as much as i thought it would and it gives me an extra usb port lots of cables though as you can see which doesn't look quite as smart as having fully wireless peripherals but then again these are designed for proper competitive gaming so as you can see i've gone with a near enough full corsair build here the benefit to sticking with one brand uh when it comes to your peripherals and your fans and your rgb ram is that you can then sync it all up using just one program that iq app which is so much easier than having two or three from different brands if you've mixed and matched your hardware i'm not saying that's the best value approach uh or it's for everyone but that is definitely an advantage to sticking just with one brand but all this is a complete waste of time if you don't also then pair it with a pretty capable monitor that can fully take advantage of the performance that we get from it so if you're a regular on the tech chap channel you'll be pretty familiar with this big guy behind me it's the lg 38 wn 95c i've been using this as my main monitor for about four or five months now and i absolutely love it 38 inches 3840 by 1600 so that's a 21 by 10 aspect ratio which means it's slightly taller than your regular ultra wide so it feels a bit less narrow up to 144 hertz or 120 hertz with 10-bit color which is what i use g-sync hdr dedicated color profile modes like srgb and dci p3 it's genuinely the perfect match for this pc because it's great for gaming and also color accurate enough for editing plus it's bloody huge which is handy for having two or three apps side by side or just a really immersive full screen gaming experience i also use a pair of steel series headphones mainly for gaming although for editing as well but of course they're not professionally accurate but good enough for what i do to be honest and in terms of the desk itself well that's probably the one thing that needs a bit of an upgrade it's the same ikea carl b work top on top of a couple of alex draws that i've had since i started this youtube channel like six years ago now so that is definitely in need of an upgrade as is this whole room actually because i'm currently in uh my new house but in this temporary office because at the moment i'm renovating my double garage i'm very lucky to have that extra space and i'm putting some money into turning it into a new studio which i cannot wait to show you right now is a complete mess but in the next few weeks i'll share some stuff on instagram and also give you an updated setup tour but in terms of the new pc build for 2021 this is absolutely perfect for me you could go a bit more over the top with custom water looping and some fancy cabling maybe that's something i'll do in the future but for now i'm really really happy with this i love the case the 4000d although i think i would go with the white one uh if i were to do this again obviously we do have corsair's 5000 series which is a little bit newer but really the only difference is the size they're a bit bigger and i just didn't really want that uh for my setup for my desk so i'm really happy with the size of this but what about you what would be your dream pc in terms of specs and would you go intel or amd let me know in the comments below as well as give me some desk recommendations if you've got any as i say links to everything i've talked about today in the description below and if you enjoyed the video and want to see more from me then a cheeky little like and subscribe would be lovely thank you so much for watching guys and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech chat you
