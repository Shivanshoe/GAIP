hey guys this is tom the tech chat on the snapchat stuff no no this is my studio all right okay just doing a bit of a take over here yeah all right let's check these out you're not taking a breathing i can't bear gifts okay so we actually have two brand new phones from the lovely guys over at poco and they also sent a lovely south yeah it was actually a mini saf that came through and then you know i just get a way to go [Music] saf thank you so much for coming down and also a big thank you to poco for sponsoring this video for teaming up with us and sending these phones out so these guys are brand new we've got the poco f4 and also the x4 gt i'm gonna put these behind my back okay that one this one yes you sure yes you don't change your mind yeah okay you are unboxing the x4 gt the gt this is how the professionals do it really yeah so we're gonna start off with the unboxing and here's the initial reveal here we go now we have a pack which we'll come back to later because we want to check out the phone first and here it is in all of his glory guess what we have here surprise surprise is it is that a charger there is a charger included out of the box this is a 67 watt fast charger you've obviously got a cable as well so that's usb type a to usb type c cable we have some paperwork which i generally don't really take a look at and then we also have a clear case got some of the key highlights here which you can see at the front so we do have the demensity 8100 which is five nanometers chipset very capable we've got a 144 hertz display that's another key highlight which we'll take a look at the 67 watt charging uh as well as a high resolution 64 megapixel triple camera system right now let's get to the best part [Applause] there we go here it is we've got some flat edges we've got this uh two-tone finish i would say and based on how the light kind of reflects it does give you this uh it's like a mattified yeah it softens the light that's kind of nice i mean i definitely prefer matte finishes on the back and it's actually got to be a grip as well would you like to have a touch i would love to have a touch thank you sir and the other thing that i'm noticing straight away again these are my first impressions is something that we've got at the top headphone jack a 3.5 millimeter jacket nice i i would give that a solid 8 out of 10 unboxing eight just eight okay let's see how the 5 out of 10 one you guys that's savage you guys have to say who uh is the best in boxer by the way all right so i have the poco f4 wait is it poco or poco i'd say poco i think it's poco i can say poco you can say paco all right boom so inside similar to yours we've got the little box of all the extra thingamajigs let's get this bad boy out and you know what i like to just take the wrapper off straight away straight away okay it's impatient boom there we go so actually don't bring yours up for a second you can see that's quite a different it was a pretty premature um unwrapping anyway different different vibes going on here glossy finish matte finish different camera layout yeah i'm definitely more for the matte finish myself how about you so i like both yeah a little different all right back to me more importantly similar setup actually and actually we have the same 67 watt turbo charger and also the usb cable as well this has the snapdragon 870 we've also got a 120 hertz amoled screen with this and while we don't have a headphone jack we do get stereo speakers i think they both do and they're also very thin both devices they are quite thin so even though we've got very large displays they do feel pretty comfortable i'd say also a nice little protective case as well so that can slip right on there slap that right on there you go beautiful you missed out something as well i mean this is this is you know you've got an amateur just trying to do the unboxing he missed out this key element here oh i did you do have an adapter included as well so this is a usb type-c to 3.5 millimeter converter you're not getting okay i will just plug that in for you here i'll show you how it's done thank you dangling your dongle maybe like four and a half five out of ten yeah that wasn't fantastic yeah he needs many more takes you know he's not been doing this very long so so i'll be showing tom how to actually take some photos here on the f4 the first thing we need to do is let's just go for drips right you need to wardrobe we'll just change the whole thing including yourself so we want tilting which is your good side uh this like this yes brilliant go on give me a few different poses yeah god god love it gorgeous okay so this is the portrait mode yeah that's some that's some that's some really good edge detection we've got the sign here in the background as well that's blurred out a little bit just to give it a nice little bokeh effect so this is a 64 megapixel setup we've got this main lens four in one pixel binning then we have an eight megapixel ultra wide and if you want to see more of my behind the scenes of the studio which i've not tidied up don't don't look around and the 2 megapixel macro i think we all know how we feel about macro lenses but it's there if you want it there's no dedicated uh telephoto lens but you can of course zoom in and use some a bit of the ai to sort of improve that as well and you can shoot 4k video so as i say this is the first pocophone with ois so if we sort of just move around a little bit and look at that bit of shade going on this should be the smoothest video you can get on a poker phone it does make a big difference that optical image stabilization i'm keen to see this uh this this profile photo as well do you want to take another one do you want more i can't i can do i mean they're going to cost you look at that do you want to show us a thing or two about gaming all right so we've got a bunch of games downloaded here let's jump into a bit of mobile engines bang bang but what you can do is swipe in from either side to bring up this game turbo menu so like any good gaming phone you've got a bunch of options here you can record the screen don't disturb change the settings change the performance you can boost it for a little bit you can see that look at that the fps jumping right up there so you're really taking advantage of that 144 hertz screen so you can see here how it actually changes the sort of speed of your movements and the responsiveness of the phone you can change it to how you want but let's keep it in pro mode i like the visual representation it's so it's very it's very intuitive isn't it do we get some volume as well because we've got dual speakers it's time we learn a new skill that's very loud that was very loud all right here we go tech chat versus belmont okay running away too far you can see there's not a drop in frames here it's smooth as butter and actually i'm enjoying the vibration the feedback it's got a x linear haptic motor in here so that the force feedback the haptics actually feel quite nice victory he said i couldn't do it that was the demo now let's play the real game we don't know the price of these i should say that's a mystery right now it'll be down in the description when you've got it yes we'll put it put a comment below and also put in the description uh the pricing and also where you can buy it if you fancy generally this is more of an all-rounder phone um and the first thing i noticed really was just how fast it is with that 120 hours refresh the 120 has really does make a difference and amol as well so 120 hertz amoled one of the first things i noticed is how small that little hole punch cutout is it is one of the smallest which you're gonna learn to ignore shortly after using it yeah just like when you subscribe to supersaf and actually you'll see if we jump into the refresh rate settings on each it is set to the default recommended mode yeah so that will switch based on what you're using so it might be down to 60 if you're just on something standard but then if you are gaming or using something that can take advantage of that high refresh rate when you're scrolling then it's going to go up to 120 it'll switch to 800 or you can get a custom and specify one or the other so if you want you can keep it at 120 all the time if you want but i'll use a little bit more battery yes we've got the lcd here on the x4 gt and we do also have 144 hertz which just makes things that much smoother and along with the demensity 8 100. that's a five nanometer chipset we've got lpddr5 ram on both devices as well as ufs three point ones both have that personally speaking i like to game my smartphone occasionally but i don't want something that looks like a gaming phone that's a very good point you want the capabilities of gaming phone with yes well i know we've got vapor chamber coolers in both and also some new ice cool technology sustained performance is important and with the liquid cool technology that we've got 2.0 on here we've also got a 32 large vapor chamber so that just makes things much more sustained over a longer period of time when you are gaming and keeping that heat down so the x4 gt is powered by that mediatek demensity 8100 and like the f4 we're also getting that liquid cool 2 technology and ufs 3.1 lp tdr5 all the good stuff and also one of the most powerful and efficient processors you can get in a phone they're both incredibly capable chips as you say uh five nanometers on that one seven on this one so the dimensions a little bit newer but they're both well they'll run everything you throw at it when you've got 270 hertz touch sampling as well as 144 hertz lcd display it's just going to make things very responsive so as soon as you touch a trigger you'll be seeing that response uh without any delay so that's something that's really good i know both phones do get a glass five on the front keep them protected uh and actually the f4 we have 900 nips of brightness uh in high brightness mode and also we can peak at 1300 nits with hdr so if you're watching you know videos and movies and if you're like me with these on all the time you're gonna need a great phone and you you can see that very clearly which is i mean they're both great for entertainment and gaming but they've got slightly different slight different directions there so the f4 is powered by the snapdragon 870 which is still one of the best chips on the market for performance both in terms of high clock speeds and also the isp for the camera and together with poco's liquid cool technology 2.0 and also the bigger vapor chamber cooler inside for the money this is a pretty solid setup battery life it's important it's important we want something that can last a long time unlike tom detective [Laughter] wow wow 5 000 okay 5 080 million power battery that's a that's a pretty sizable battery yeah yours is bigger than mine as they say uh no this is actually got the free 500 million power battery um but i guess obviously that being more gaming oriented that yeah you are gonna that will drain the battery quicker so you want a bit of edge it will do and they both have that 67 watt turbo charging yeah and that just means you're gonna be able to go from zero to 100 in around 46 minutes which is really good so as you can see we have miui 13 running here this is on top of android 12 so it's the same software on both we've got lpddr5 on both and you've also got ufs 3.1 storage so everything is super smooth alongside the high refresh rates um and also on the side we have a little fingerprint reader yeah did you notice that yes convenient my power button doubles as a fingerprint although we do also get face unlocking if you prefer so you've got the fingerprint reader and the face unlock which is nice on both we have an ir blaster they both are buyer blasters yeah i mean you don't see that very often we don't we don't i could just switch the tv off here with this and that's yeah that's something that i've not seen in quite a while but it's nice to have that here now i'm guessing this is the night black color midnight black no night black midnight silver goodnight silver or nebula green interesting so i have three colors here we've got black blue and silver on the x4g they gave me fancy names for it for this one yeah anyway yeah well options we like options yeah we do like options all right staff thank you so much for coming down thank you for having me having a play with these if you do fancy checking out the x4 gt or the f4 uh both coming out very soon we'll leave a link in the description below if you've got any questions at all leave them in the comments we'll do our best to get back to you thanks to poco for putting this together thanks to tom for having me back here in the studio as well don't forget to smash that like button and if you haven't already then subscribe and that's the end of the video thank you so much for watching and we'll see you next time on the tech chat all right get out that's too much okay see you later guys i've been kicked out of the technical studio shut up i'm taking this with me
