the problem is most phones feel like copy and paste glass rectangles right so when i see something different i get a little bit excited i think we all do and especially when it means i can play with microscopes hey guys i'm tom with techchap and i've teamed up with some oops hey guys i'm tom with techchap and i've teamed up with samsung displays for this video because i want to show you some of the best bits from ces 2022 and why their screens particularly their folding oled screens are properly next-gen but i'm even more intrigued by samsung display's new flex devices if you haven't seen these yet it feels like it's something out of minority report or something these are just concepts and demos for now but this new flex s can fold in and out in an s shape which lets you use it like a phone or a multi screen setup or just one big tablet the flex g on the other hand folds inwards which makes it more durable as the screen is protected on the inside and this concept comes in a couple of different sizes then there's this guy it's the new flex slideable so instead of folding it well as it says on the 10 slides out now we have seen a few brands show off concepts like this before but the design is the closest to a regular phone which i think is important for a lot of people and then when you want that extra space for multitasking or gaming you can slide it out and then get that extra chunk of screen but the funny thing is even just a few years ago the idea that we would have and you could actually buy folding phones or falling tablets like this we seem pretty crazy and of course we've got the flip three here this is the third gen fold zed full three but the second gen flip although they call it the z flip three and actually in terms of pricing well of course this is still pretty expensive the flip is kind of comparable to the galaxy s21 plus so it actually comes down to what form factor you want so while you still get a few looks if you are in public using one of these we are getting used to it so now we're looking to the next generation foldables now these are folding phones and tablets but what about something a little bit bigger something laptop size well that's where the flex note concept comes in when it's folded it's as portable as a 13 inch laptop but unfolded you get a huge 17 inch screen and of course it's protected as it falls inwards what is interesting though is normally i would be a bit skeptical of these concepts we see some crazy ces and then either it doesn't come out it doesn't work as well as we expect happens all the time but it grabs headlines i think what's different here though is that we have a track record from samsung and samsung displays the separate arm which actually makes and sells the screens which go into samsung's products and other brands by them as well and these are more durable each time and actually we saw a ces a fold in the cold test which demonstrates the durability in extreme climates so let's say these were all on the market now you could buy it today which one would you go for the flex s the g the slideable or the note which one do you think is most exciting so while it is always good to take these things with a pinch of salt and have a healthy degree of skepticism for actually when they come out how much they're going to be and also the durability obviously we'll put all those things to the test in actual reviews i'm pretty confident that this stuff will actually work quite well so those are the flashy concepts but let's dive a little bit deeper literally let's get a microscope out and talk about pixels because this is actually where the magic happens so a few weeks ago i did a proper deep dive into samsung displays tech and i'll leave a link if you want to check that out and you really want to nerd out but the headlines for some of samsung display's latest oled panels include their diamond pixel structure we actually already see this on some phones like the galaxy zed 3 and under a microscope you can see how it smooths out the edges which means you get an even sharper image without having to bump up the resolution then there's eco square oleds the zedfall 3 again was one of the first to come to market with this and by adding a polarizer to the screen it helps improve power efficiency by up to 25 percent which of course is always a plus when screens are one of the biggest power draws on a device and crucially this will be even more important with these new next gen flex and folds that come with even bigger screens then of course there's the inherent advantages to oled over a traditional led lcd including faster response times so we see less motion blur which of course is important for gaming the near infinite contrast of the self-emitting pixels which gives us those inky true blacks and rich colors while also offering a boost to battery life if your phone or laptop is in dark mode and at the same time reducing how much harmful blue light is actually emitted which is better for your eyes and your brain so you guys know the advantages of oled but when you combine it with the diamond pixel structure the power saving of eco square tech and then these crazy new designs and concepts and let me know in the comments below which one of these folding flexing sliding flipping devices phones you're most excited about i think for me i want that flex s with a case on it obviously hopefully it won't be too long until some of these come to market and i can probably test and review them so make sure you have hit that subscribe
