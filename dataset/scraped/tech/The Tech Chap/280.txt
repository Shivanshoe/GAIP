hey guys an Tama Tech job and I must admit that talking about PCI Express for probably isn't the sexiest of topics but I appreciate you clicking on the video and hopefully by the end you'll know exactly what it is and why it's actually quite a big deal now recently I've been looking at upgrading my main work PC and to be honest one thing I kind of assumed I didn't need is a system that supports PCI Express 4.0 I mean after all PCI III storage is already blazing fast and the r-tx 20 atti I having my build here doesn't saturate all the bandwidth it offers but then I saw rumors of next gen graphics cards new cheaper PCIe for storage options becoming available and then of course all the talk around the PS 5 and the Xbox Series X which have been teased to come with super fast storage and is most likely going to be based on PCIe 4 so this got me thinking should PCI 4 be at the heart of my new system well let's take a step back and as you probably already know the PCI Express interfaces well your graphics card adding cards or m2 and nvme storage drives used to send and receive data and with each new revision to the spec the data transfer speed is effectively doubled PCIe 3 maxes out at around 16 gigabytes per second in each direction but PCI you four can do a massive 32 gigabytes per second each way which is great but arguably a little bit overkill perhaps I mean the PCIe 3 storage I'm using now the nvme SSDs I think I'm using these Samsung 970 Evo these sort of drives are already about 4 or 5 times faster than these slower older SATA 3 SSDs and right now even the most powerful graphics cards don't take full advantage of it another issue is their only aim DS pricey x5 70 motherboards and Rison 3000 series CPUs currently supported along with their even more expensive thread Ripper systems I was also looking forward to Intel's upcoming 10th gen desktop chips but if the leaks I've seen are correct it seems that Intel Z 490 chipset boards have dropped PCI for support due to technical issues although it's possible it could feature on some boards with extra components but these are bound to come at a premium and this kind of compounds a problem that there's been a lack of components that I actually take advantage of PCI 4 speeds except for some pretty expensive SSD storage although admittedly their transfer speeds are pretty insane one upside though is that because motherboards have a limited number of PCIe lanes using eight PCI four lanes instead of 16 on PCIe 3 for a graphics card frees up more lanes for extra components but that's only really relevant if you want extra graphics cards or have a ton of PCIe based storage so it's kind of a chicken or the egg thing because until you have the motherboards the chipsets that support it companies won't develop products that support it as well so something has to come first and when you are at the cutting edge of tech especially when it comes to PC components it's always going to be in a premium and there won't be very many components to start with but then you could look at it as kind of speculative future proofing of your system I mean if you're thinking about building a new PC soon and you're obviously gonna have it for two three four maybe five years before you do a big upgrade it could be worth hanging on for a second because I've seen lots of reports of Samsung's next-gen 980 PCI for SSD storage coming very soon in their Pro Evo and affordable couvreux range which actually could be what they use in the upcoming PS 5 and Xbox Series X or talk more about that in a second so right now everything is very expensive but hopefully in about a year's time maybe things will be more mainstream and actually affordable but let's get back to the question of whether you'd even notice a difference because while the boost over PCI III drives is pretty significant on paper I just don't think this will translate to noticeable differences in system responsiveness for the time being although it may become more obvious over time as programs grow in size and complexity then there's next-gen graphics cards to consider the big navvy cards expected from AMD as well as Nvidia 3000 series which will probably come out around the summer now of course we don't know what kind of performance we can expect from these next-gen graphics cards but it is possible the extra bandwidth from a PCIe for motherboard may actually help you get the best performance out of it and if not this year then it's possible GPUs in 2021 will take advantage but I think the most exciting use case for this new standard is how it's going to transform the next generation of consoles the PS 5 and the Xbox Series X in an interview last year with mark Cerny the chief architect of the PS 5 he showed how super fast storage most likely using PCIe 4 could impact how games are designed he showed off a demo of the ps4 game spider-man running on new hardware and showed how he could fast travel around the game city in noir point seconds rather than 15 seconds on a ps4 with a slow hard drive so if you're moving fast through a large city or complex terrain then it should remove any ugly texture pop-in realistically though I think for multi-platform games most developers will still be designing them for older sata3 and of course even older hard drive based systems so it may take a couple of years before we start to see the full benefit of PCI for storage and as I say if the latest reports are true we could see Samsung's one terabyte 980 couvreux nvme storage in the upcoming consoles and so if they start mass producing them it should make it cheaper for everyone getting back to pcs just for a second and to complicate things even more the spec for PCIe 5 has actually already been finalized but don't worry about this at all for the minute it's not something you'll consider for a fully 2 or 3 or even 4 years from now it's a bit like 5g you know it's just coming out barely available but of course people have started talking about 6 genes as always something else around the corner so that's a lot to take in but let me answer some questions directly number one should you build a new PC now with PCI 4 well honestly probably not unless you have made to burn and you just want a really a future-proof system I would wait if you can expect a new PC because there's just not many options it's not much use case for it right now and it's only gonna get cheaper as time goes on especially if a next-gen consoles do use PCIe for storage which isn't confirmed but it is very likely by then in at the beginning of 2021 there'll be loads more options will be much more affordable and then it'll probably be worth investing in PCI 4 and I think right now the only way you'd really see any difference if you had a full PCIe 4 setup is if you're transferring large files but then of course both devices need to be PCI 4 or else you're gonna get a bottleneck but I am really excited to see how it's going to transform the next-gen consoles especially when developers can optimize their games to take advantage of it as for laptops aim DS new 4000 series chips which are due out in the next couple of months won't support PCI 4 which does make sense at this stage due to the extra cost and power requirements although we could see support for it with Intel's Tiger Lake processors do towards the end of this year but I'm not holding my breath board I reckon do you think PCI 4 is an essential part of your next system build or is it worth waiting for a while and also while we're talking about next-gen consoles we can't not have a poll about five vs Xbox series X let me know which one you're more excited for in the poll at the top right thank you so much for
