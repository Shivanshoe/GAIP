[Music] where do i even start with this hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is ridiculous i've got every single one plus phone they've ever launched borrow a couple of limited edition and mclaren versions everything from the original oneplus one the og which i can't wait to show you all the way up to the brand new 9 series 21 plus phones one plus 20 if you will and the reason i'm making this video now is actually because i'm working with oneplus to celebrate the seventh anniversary since the launch of the original oneplus one and also they've reached a huge milestone of having over three million registered users at oneplus.com from europe alone so lots to be proud of and of course really for oneplus it is the community it's you guys the fans that have been the backbone for this whole company which is why they got in touch asked if they could work with me on this video to look at the progression of the tech see how the company grew they've also created this one for all event uh with some pretty big discounts and good deals on select phones including one of my favorites which i'll uh well i'll reveal which one it is at the end of the video so check out the link in the description below so let's dive straight in and to avoid boring you all to death with 20 unboxings let me try this wow i didn't actually think that was going to work but there we are a magical one plus unboxing no smoker mirrors or editing at all that was pure magic right there 20 phones on this desk i mean straight away you get an idea of the changes in design also the colors this was a very aqua marine blue phase for oneplus and also the cameras from single lenses dual triple now up to quad lenses on the nine pro but let's go back to the start cast your minds all the way back to april 2014. i hadn't even started my youtube channel yet that was like another seven or eight months away and that's when the oneplus one launched and i remember the hype being crazy around this at the time with this new startup company launching what they were calling this flagship killer phone and considering this cost just 229 pounds or 299 it was pretty revolutionary actually because the galaxy s5 cost 600 pounds so over twice as much but we got a lot of the similar specs including the same snapdragon 801 processor which really puts into perspective just how good value these oneplus phones were and also how much more expensive phones have got since then now i must admit i don't love this sandstone texture on this curved back it's certainly grippy but it also scratched quite easily and it felt a bit well like sandpaper and we got this tiny single 13 megapixel camera and flash on the back this uh micro usb port on the bottom which really does show its age and also of course a three and a half mil headphone jack on the top but the highlight really was this big five and a half inch screen it is lcd rather than oled like we got on the s5 but in most respects they were neck and neck but i'm sure you guys would agree that the other standout for oneplus aside from their really good value is the software and while the first oneplus one actually ran on cyanogenmod which is a developer friendly version of android and it was actually really lovely to use and unlike a lot of phones at the time and still to this day there wasn't any annoying bloatware or you know heavy ui on top it was just slick fast lightweight but actually it wasn't just the phone itself that made the oneplus one special it was also one of the most special launches in history as you actually had to have a personalized invite code to buy one and it was sold exclusively through oneplus.com with almost no advertising budget even though i was never actually able to buy this one myself i remember the time a lot of the creators and the sort of tech people that i followed they were all talking about this and they were also all switching to it when they could get their hands on it there really was a big buzz around it and so it wasn't just about the phone it was also about the beginning of the oneplus community so that was the oneplus one from 2014 but actually the momentum continued with the launch of the oneplus 2 in 2015 and actually there were over a million people who signed up to get one of those personalized invite codes to actually buy one and again we had a flagship killing price of just 239 pounds for this when it launched and this definitely feels like a refinement of the first in fact if i bring the one back in side by side we've got a similar sandstone material on the back but now we've got this more premium metal frame around the sides also big jump up to the usb c port as well as having a fingerprint reader built into this front home button and also for the first time on an android phone this alert slider but i think more significantly is this was the first oneplus phone to come with what we now know as oxygen os so it was a nice little upgrade but there were a couple of problems with this uh firstly it had the snapdragon 810 which had some performance and overheating issues and also oneplus has said they could have done a better job with the launch of the two by having better sort of customer support at the time they really just grew so fast from the initial one they weren't really set up in time definitely some growing pains there then but fair enough they held their hands up they took in that customer feedback that they needed to improve their support and they did as the years progressed so a nice little upgrade but a couple of issues there with the two but then just a few months later later on in 2015 we had this guy which i actually forgot about but it's the oneplus x which is uh well unmistakably similar to a certain fruit-based rival uh like the iphone 4. it looks very similar to it and it was actually meant as a bit of a budget alternative to the oneplus 2 surprisingly because this was already like 239 pounds but the x came in at 199 and it offered a slightly smaller five inch screen also the previous generation snapdragon 801 but for 199 this was an absolutely stunning phone both in terms of design and also obviously with that oxygen os software it was just lovely to use so funnily enough even though it was supposed to be a budget version of the oneplus 2 honestly i'd have easily gone for this one instead and actually i think it's one of the most underrated oneplus phones but then it was the oneplus 3 where i think they really found their feet and actually you can see straight away just from this metal design it feels a lot more premium and actually it was kind of similar to the popular m7 and m8 hdc phones at the time i love those phones and this really did feel like a step up in terms of the design the build quality we also had a big spec bump with this up to the snapdragon 820 it also debuted their dash charge technology which later became warp charge we also have an amoled screen uh oxygen os obviously and it was also the first one plus phone you could buy without one of those pesky invite codes so this was a proper flagship killer although it was a little bit more expensive than we were used to uh starting at 329 pounds or 399 dollars so nearly a hundred more than the oneplus 2 but at the same time it was still half the price of the competing galaxy s7 and oneplus really made an effort to bring this to the fans to the community uh with pop-up and launch events and since then they've held more than 150 of them in 38 different cities around the world but then just five months later we had the launch of the oneplus 3t and so began the dual phone launch cycle that we're used to now and actually this will always hold a special place in my heart because it was the first one plus phone i ever bought and used as my daily driver i love this thing and essentially the t series not that t series would basically be the slightly refined and upgraded versions of the phone so the 3t here added a 128 gig storage option a much better selfie camera as well as a bigger battery and it started from 399 pounds or 439 dollars so it was a slight price increase over the three so can you guess what comes after the 3t well that's right it's the 5. uh they actually jumped ahead of the 4 because in chinese language the number four sounds a lot like death so they jumped straight to the five in june 2017. this was the first oneplus phone to come with a dual camera system but as we're used to with modern phones the second lens isn't a ultra wide or telephoto it was actually a 20 megapixel sensor that was used to give us two times lossless zoom so in a way it was for zoom and also to help with bokeh and portrait shots and also began oneplus slight obsession with cramming in as much ram as possible offering an eight gigabyte version of the phone for 500 pounds although it started from 450 with six gigs of the stuff so i really like the five but actually the 5t here is also a little bit nostalgic for me because the last time i saw this particular model of phone was in the back of a taxi in berlin during an efa trade show and that was also the last place i saw it because i left it there never to be seen again uh so uh it's good to see this again it's also one of my favorite colors of oneplus with this red metallic finish it's beautiful and the 5t trim the bezels so we have a much higher screen to body ratio they also added face unlocking but pretty much the same specs and also the same price as the five so a fairly modest upgrade overall and around this time they also open their oneplus lab where community members could come in and try their phones a little bit early and create sort of unbiased reviews and again give feedback to oneplus but then fast forward to may 2018 and we had this guy the oneplus 6 which actually was incredibly popular i think they sold like a million units of this in the first month but the biggest controversy with this was the notch not even was a fan of it although you can see that they really did trim the bezels and it meant they could squeeze in a much bigger and also a taller screen into a similar form factor and it was also the first time since the oneplus x that we had an all-glass body on a oneplus but then like clockwork six months later we had the oneplus 6t and actually at the time this was the best and the fastest selling oneplus and with this we got an even smaller teardrop notch as well as an improved camera a much bigger battery and also the first time on a oneplus an in-screen optical fingerprint reader but sadly this was also the first oneplus phone that didn't come with a headphone jack although the 16 series was also the first time we saw a mclaren edition with their signature papaya orange color accents and also a bump up to a frankly ludicrous 10 gigabytes of ram with a massive 256 gigs of storage so now we're up to the 7 series and this is where things get really interesting because it's the first time they start launching two phones at the same time but the seven pro here was the first one plus to cost over seven hundred dollars but the point was that you now had options you could go for a upper mid-range phone for a little bit less money or a proper flagship rival which included this very nifty pop-up camera at the top here so we had an entirely bezel-less screen which was also curved by the way whereas the standard 7 is actually a flat screen which i know a lot of people did prefer as well we also had a much smoother 90 hertz refresh rate the first time we had a higher refresh on a oneplus plus a quality resolution and also this triple lens camera setup but actually i think most significantly is that there was a 5g model of this which was actually the very first 5g support phone to launch in the uk so the 7 pro was actually quite a big upgrade for oneplus but then we move on to september 2019 with the refreshed 7t and 70 pro and i remember when i reviewed this because i really felt that the cheaper 7t stood out because it brought over the matte frosted glass body from the 7 pro and also the 90 hertz refresh and the triple lens camera into this new nifty round camera module and so it had pretty much everything you needed for a still reasonable 550 pounds or 600 so i think for me the 70 is a real highlight whereas the pro was a little bit bigger with beefier specs we still had the pop-up selfie camera and also improved camera sensors but in my book it didn't really justify the 150 pound price premium over the 17 which brings us to the year that i think most of us would rather forget 2020 and just as the world was shutting down we had the launch of these two the eight and the eight pro and this was the first time on the standard model so the eight uh that we had 5g support we also had a bigger battery and also wireless charging for the first time and also as you can see we had the transition away from the notch to the hole punch selfie camera the a pro went further with a 120 hertz quad hd screen we also had official ip watch resistance for the first time and a new camera lens setup which included this photochrome color filter which ended up causing oneplus a bit of a headache as it turned out it could actually see through certain materials like some plastics and even clothes in some cases although an update quickly disabled this but as well as the two new phones last year also saw uh the launch of oneplus idea campaign where again members of the community literally you guys could submit ideas for new software features and improvements which would then be voted on and then where possible actually integrated into the phones so again another good example of oneplus actually listening to consumer feedback so far so good then but actually it's this next phone which really stood out for me and i think even now is one of my favorite oneplus is of all time it is the oneplus nord it came out last summer for a much more affordable 379 pounds or 3.99 and with this they really did go back to their roots or their true north hence their name nord with a good affordable phone we missed out on some of the flagship specs but the mid-range 5g enabled snapdragon 765g is more than fast enough for most of us and paired with the lovely 90hz screen this quad lens camera sets setup on the back and also these dual selfie cameras up front including an ultra wide lens this really had everything you needed now this didn't come out that long ago and given some price uh reductions that we've seen on this it's still a pretty competitive budget phone and it's also one of the phones featured in the sale right now so if you found yourself an even cheaper nord then click the link below oneplus really have made a lot of phones in seven years but then came the oneplus 8t or the bizarrely no 80 pro so at this point uh you could choose between the uh eight pro then the 8t or the oneplus nord so you had options at all different price ranges and the 80 clearly took some design inspiration from the nord but i think this one did struggle to stand out a little bit although we did get warp charge 65 a bigger battery and a 120 hertz screen but this really was a good all-round phone and actually still pretty good value at 550 pounds so as we've been going the prices have been obviously getting higher as well to meet with inflation and also because they just wanted to produce better phones and also offer better support and these things cost money but towards well the last couple years or so they really have put more effort into giving us more affordable options starting with the nord which i still think is great but then phones like the oneplus nord n10 which i have here and also the even cheaper n100 and the n10 here cost just 329 pounds when it launched which was 50 less than the regular node and it also made it one of the cheapest 5g phones you could buy obviously the camera and specs were appropriately cut down but it still had a 90hz screen and with the slick oxygen os software it's lovely to use crikey that's a lot of phones but that brings us to well right now with the latest oneplus 9 series if you haven't already watched my uh full review and comparison of these check it out after this video and these two bring a whole host of upgrades but the highlight really is the partnership with hasselblad oneplus know that they've consistently offered good but never quite the best cameras on the market and while this is just the start of a three year deal and with the nine series we're getting software and color optimizations it's going to be really exciting to see where this partnership goes with upcoming phones although personally between the two i would probably go with the standard oneplus 9 which cost 629 pounds it's still very good value and while the pro gets quad hd a slightly better main camera sensor with ois and a telephoto lens i still think this is the best bang for bug and breathe that was a lot of phones but hopefully you're still with me and i haven't bored you all to death i found this absolutely fascinating to see the transition and the progress over the last seven years we really have come a long way if i had to pick a favorite i think it would be between the 3t because this was my first ever oneplus or honestly i think the nord because i still think it's incredible value for money but what about you which one plus phone do you think is the best of all time let me know in the comments below and also check out that one for all event uh which is running until the end of the week april 23rd i believe it is where you can get some good deals on various phones including the nord and the 8 series it genuinely is great to see a brand really working with the community hand in hand to improve the brand to make the products better if you want to see more videos like this or just more of me then don't forget to hit that subscribe button and i'll see you guys
