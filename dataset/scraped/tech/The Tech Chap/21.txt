hey guys i'm tom with techchap and if you had to pick between having a monitor or a tv which would you go for well what if i told you you could have both in one let me introduce you to the samsung smart monitor m8 and i say monitor but this is just as much a tv as it is a regular 32-inch 4k monitor samsung reckon this is all you need when it comes to working and also you know kicking back and watching some netflix or disney or binging the latest tech chat videos on youtube but for 699 pounds same in dollars is this actually worth buying well first of all a big thank you to samsung for sending this over for me to have a bit of a play with and also sponsoring this video but as always all opinions are my own so what exactly can this do well it has all the major streaming apps you have free live tv channels a remote control usb c and hdmi for hooking up your pc or your mac there's also screen and airplay for mirroring your phone your pc or your mac we get smart home controls a face tracking webcam even a built-in browser deck support and actually office 365 so you don't even need a computer attached to this to use it and there's also this very nifty detachable webcam which just magnetically slots on the back there it also comes with a little lens cap cover if you want privacy or you can just physically take the whole thing off and i love this design especially having just come from the apple studio display which is very good in its own right but with that there is no physical way of having the camera it also supports amazon's voice assistant i don't want to say the name begins with a in case it triggers your one as well as bixby of course the thing is i genuinely haven't seen a monitor with as many features as the m8 since well last year's m7 this is actually samsung's second attempt at their smart monitor following the old model that i reviewed last year and while the m7 shares a lot of the same smart well smarts as the new m8 it was let down a little bit by fairly ropey image quality and a bit of a cheap build especially given the price don't get me wrong i did like the m7 but this just feels like a refinement in almost every way including image quality which is much better but there are still a couple of issues which i'll come to later in the video design wise i think this thing looks great with narrow bezels a slim profile with this flat back and also this herringbone kind of texture we also get this neat little camera module and a nice clean designed stand we even get four apparently flavorful color options although the color only extends to the stand and this little strip along the front height adjustment is pretty good although it won't get quite high enough to set above a 13 or 14 inch laptop screen unless you tilt a fair bit as well and there's also no swivel except for moving the whole thing and the range of tilt is only just okay so who should actually buy this well i think it's kind of aimed at families uh students even businesses where maybe you can't have a tv and a monitor for space or money issues and you just want something that does everything in one the screen basically acts as an all-in-one work entertainment and smart home hub now if you are a regular on the channel and if not why not but you'll hear me go on about how 27-inch 4k monitors are just a bit too small you really want 32 inches to fully take advantage of that high resolution which is what we have here and i think this is the ideal size that's big enough you could use as a tv maybe in the bedroom you know from a few feet away but also not so huge that it takes up your entire desk so you simply pick up the remote and turn it on and you'd be forgiven for thinking this is a tv the interface the settings menu feels lifted straight from a samsung tv but actually once you get used to it it does all start to make sense with all the entertainment stuff under media and then wireless casting options under workspace and with settings covering inputs and shortcuts and other smart home controls every now and then i do see it sort of take a second or slow down a little bit so a slightly faster processor perhaps would have been nice but generally most of the time it is pretty quick so media is basically the home screen and you get suggested tv and movies from streaming apps like netflix disney plus prime apple tv and all the main uk based ones it also suggests shows from samsung tv plus which streams live tv channels via a tv style guide there aren't that many to choose from and also some of them are pretty obscure but it is free extra content and it's kind of fun we don't get a tv tuner built into this everything is streamed but you could always hook up a cable or satellite box via hdmi if you wanted to i'll tell you what it is we're doing this job sometimes watching yourself back and sort of spending hours staring even faith when you're editing videos anyway as you'd expect from an all-in-one display like this we do get built-in speakers seriously like so i'm holding the 15-inch one here one-handed and they get pretty loud we're talking lg gram levels of light definitely lacking in a bit of bass i still think a good pair of speakers uh perhaps bluetooth speakers would be better to really get that sort of immersive experience especially if you're watching movies but they're okay it does also have some clever adaptive sound tech that alters the audio to match ambient conditions but for me i'd still prefer to have a separate set of speakers now around the back we have two usb-c ports one of which supports displayport and also a micro hdmi and yes they do bundle a micro to full hdmi cable with the display in either case i got full 4k60 without any issues and if you do go through the usb-c port then you also get 65 watt laptop charging and you can also use the m8 as a hub by connecting peripherals or storage drives to the second usb-c port alternatively you can just cast your phone your pc or your mac straight to the display which is incredibly easy to set up although depending on your connection you may feel a bit of that latency and lag you can also use the m8 to control your smart home via the smartthings control panel although whether this is easier than just grabbing your phone in the first place i'm not sure but it is pretty convenient having the option direct on screen especially as you can use the voice assistant even in standby mode we also get a built-in tizen os interface for browsing as well as office 365 just connect up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and you're good to go no pc needed alternatively if you install remote access to your computer at work then you can actually log into it from the m8 at home we also get multi view which lets you use picture by picture or picture in picture from different inputs there are so many options with this and some of them you may never actually want to use but others could be exactly why you want to buy this now there is a quick setup process required it's not just plug and play like a regular monitor but it's easy and you can either use the remote or the smartthings app on your phone once you're up and running you can jump into the settings menu which is as i say lifted straight from a samsung tv although we do get some specific picture modes depending if you're working or after some entertainment there's even a dedicated game mode so far so good then but what about the actual image quality the panel well i think it is worth keeping in mind that this is more of a general purpose screen it's not really designed for pro level graphics or editing but more for everyday office tasks and entertainment so i must admit it was pretty surprising that it's as color accurate as it is i tested it in multiple picture modes and found the graphics option to be the most accurate it is also a matte screen which helps reduce reflections we do get hdr 10 plus support and also brightness maxes out at around 425 nits which is okay viewing angles are they're not the best you definitely want to be sort of front and center with this that is something perhaps i would have liked to see and more of an improvement on especially as this could be you know on the other side of your room if you're watching tv with it i also found when there's a bright white background that you do get some quite obvious vignetting or dimming towards the left and right hand edges even when you're sad dead center but overall considering the price and what this is meant to do i think it's pretty good so if you go to connected devices then hop over to samsung slim fit camera which we've got mounted on top of here you can hi there you can make google duo calls straight to the display you could also use it to uh watch yourself while also watching a youtube video they suggest you could uh check your form uh while you're doing your bicep curls and you do all your stuff like that which is pretty cool and you can change the source and also how big the screen is where it is if you want to set a picture in picture add bluetooth speakers if you want they've thought of everything you also have the option up here to turn on smart camera which then follows your face and keeps you nice and center in the frame or if you prefer the wider field of view and no that motion you can just turn it off all right there we go this is being recorded with the webcam on top of the smart monitor i've got this running off my laptop which is hooked up by usbc so hopefully it gives you an idea of the video and audio quality so i reckon by this point you're either thinking yes give it to me take my money that is what i've been looking for in terms of a display a tv and a monitor or you're thinking well some nice features there but probably not something i would use very often in which case perhaps look elsewhere but if you are after a good quality 32 inch 4k display that can also be a bit of a tv and a bit of a smart home hub for you considering it's what just under 700 pounds 700 i think it's pretty good value and also we get this nice slim design but what do you reckon could you see yourself using this let me know what you make of the m8 in the comments below and i'll also leave a link in the description if you want to check this out for yourself thank you so much for watching guys i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat [Music]
