i am shocked samsung didn't call this the s22 note because in all but name this is the new galaxy note we've been waiting for i mean yes it's the flagship of the new s22 series but when you put it next to the note 20 ultra from two years ago especially in this new burgundy color it's a note it is missing a few classic note features though there's no micro sd card support unfortunately no headphone jack and we still don't get a charger in the box but still after a couple of hours playing with the new s22 ultra i've come away more impressed and more excited than i expected particularly with this new camera setup so here is the family and i'm actually making a whole video comparing the s22 the plus and the ultra so make sure you have subscribed and you've hit that bell icon as there's some pretty big differences between them but the ultra is the big dog both in terms of specs and also size with this 6.8 inch screen up front although deceivingly it's not actually any thicker than the s21 ultra they're both 8.9 millimeters but it is two mil wider and you do feel that along with their boxier design around the back the so-called mirrored camera wall from the s21 is now integrated into the body so now we just have these well five sticky outy bits i am slightly concerned the lenses may get scratched more easily or it'll scratch your desk or your table but the good news is on both the front and the back we get the new gorilla glass victims plus in fact the whole s22 series are the first phones to use it although it is a little hard to say how much difference this viktor's plus glass will make in terms of durability and scratch resistance i am sure i will find out within the first five minutes of opening it up because i always end up scratching my phones or indeed when i have like uh these other phones in my pockets i'm doing camera comparisons i never learn to put cases on it or screen protectors but it always ends up scratch so i will report back in my full review whether the glass makes any difference there is definitely a hint of the lg velvet to the ultra's camera layout but it still has a nice clean uncomplicated aesthetic and i think the burgundy or actually maybe the green is my favorite color it does also come in phantom black and phantom white so there's four to choose from although you'll still probably want to put a case on this anyway front and center though we have this huge absolutely stunning screen it is still quad hd plus amoled hdr 10 plus and 120 hertz like the s21 ultra but now the ltpo panel can actually adapt from 1 to 120 hertz which is a slight improvement from the 10 to 120 before so we could get a slight battery boost from that i wouldn't have said no though to a 144hz option at 1080p more games are being optimized for this as more gaming phones come with a high refresh so for gamers perhaps that would have been nice but alas not this time however i think more importantly samsung have actually opted the peak brightness of the s22 ultra to a whopping 1750 nits which is up from around 1500 before but that's only half the story as we're also getting this new vision booster technology which boosts the brightness and the contrast and the color based on that ambient lighting so you don't just get a brighter but washed out screen it still looks vibrant and it's color accurate we do still have this central hole punch savvy camera up front perhaps an underscreen selfie camera like we saw on the fold three would have been nice to have but then again that did compromise the quality and didn't look great speaking of compromises and at this point you're gonna say uh tom stop it or you'll say yeah that's a good point let's wait and see snapdragon versus exynos again we're going to have two models of the s22 ultra in fact the whole s22 series powered by either the snapdragon 8 gen 1 or the exynos 2200 now so far we haven't been able to run any tests although a big focus is on ai performance which powers a lot of the camera tech and helps the phone run more efficiently there is one notable downgrade though and that is the entry level model of the s28 ultra only comes with eight gigs of ram previously we had 12. which considering the price which i'll put in the description below feels pretty stingy although there is also a higher end 12 gig model and storage tops out at one terabyte although there is a new ram boost option to well boost the amount of ram you have so effectively the 8 can become 16. i'll tell you what is impressive though how they managed to squeeze a 5 000 million power battery in this because the last phone to come with an embedded s pen the note 20 ultra had a 4 500 million power cell and while i do need to put this through its paces myself one product tester i spoke to at my hands-on event who's actually been using a prototype of this for months so you know pre-retail he still found the battery to be quite a lot better than even the s21 ultra suggesting a proper two-day battery so he was using the exynos variant of the phone so perhaps that's a lot more efficient or they're using a new battery cell technology or it's just ai efficiency improvements but fingers crossed it can actually challenge the current battery king which is the iphone 13 pro max plus it now supports 45 watt charging up from 25 samsung are finally catching up to you know everyone else but you're willing to pay about 45 pounds for the privilege as you don't get a charger in the box which also feels a bit stingy i mean maybe give me the option if you want the new fast charger when you buy your thousand pound or 1100 pound phone i do appreciate the flip side is that it's better for the environment and actually something to say that they've reduced the packaging by a further 19 even in the last year so every little helps but this is quite a significant new feature and you have to pay extra for it but let's talk about this the s22 ultra is the first s-series phone to come with an s-pen built in the s21 ultra did support it but you had to carry it around separately and as a longtime user and fan of the note series the only reason i use it is because it's so convenient to pop it out and make some notes sign or mark up documents use the pen as a remote shutter for the camera the usual stuff but actually functionally there isn't much new here the big upgrade is they've reduced the latency from 9 milliseconds down to 2.8 which is very impressive and it makes the pen feel even more responsive so that and also handwriting to text conversions now support a few extra languages but the big deal is it's more responsive and it is you know inside the phone both of which by the way are ip68 water and dust resistant the thing is though as nice as it is having the s pen not everyone needs or uses it so i think for me the biggest upgrade surprisingly is actually the camera because at first glance the setup looks very similar to last year with a 108 megapixel main lens a 12 megapixel ultra wide and dual 10 megapixel telephoto lenses which give us three and ten times optical zoom respectively and we can still punch into that ridiculous a hundred times space zoom handy for spying on someone or maybe checking your gate at the airport from a distance not so much for taking a quality photo and then around the front we have a 40 megapixel selfie camera but if you dig a little bit deeper past the megapixels actually the main camera and both telephoto lenses are completely revamped new sensor new lenses the processing although sadly the ultra wide and selfie haven't been significantly changed they're basically the same as the s21 ultra so this is the first phone to come with samsung's new iso cell hm3 sensor with 2.3 times larger pixels than the s21 ultra and side by side with the s21 albeit with a pretty grubby screen protector i'm afraid which kind of washes the colors out but you can still see there's a big difference in the detail my face my t-shirt the camera also for the first time photos combine a full res 108 megapixel shot with a bend 12 megapixel shot previously it was one or the other and so that helps give us the most detail while also reducing noise plus the main camera uses a new super clear glass lens which helps to reduce lens flare this is a surprisingly big upgrade although samsung are actually spending more time talking about the low-light capabilities particularly with video for example when you're shooting at 30 fps whether it's at 1080 4k or 24fps or 8k the s22 ultra now shoots 12bit up from 10bit for what they call super hdr video and so more dynamic range means better true to life contrast between the lightest and the darkest areas of the scene portrait photos and videos have been improved as well again particularly in low light with more natural separation between your subject and the background and that's thanks to improved ai depth mapping and also the bigger sensor plus multi-frame exposure results in better low-light shots there's also a new auto frame video option that can track up to 10 people in a scene within a five meter radius and then reframe and center the video honestly it feels like i've just scratched the surface of the camera on the s22 ultra they've also extended a single take by five more seconds there's a new expert raw mode and so i cannot wait to test it against some of the other best phones on the market like the iphone 13 pro the pixel 6 pro oppo's upcoming flagship so again make sure you have subscribed lots of verses and comparisons to do so all together we're getting a refreshed note style design new processors we have the built-in and more responsive s pen together with a 5 000 milli power battery which is not something we've seen together before faster charging a brighter and more durable screen a surprisingly big camera upgrade thanks to the new and bigger sensor and smarter ai but in terms of downsides well as i say there's no micro sd no charger the ultra wide and the selfie haven't really changed and once again we may see a disparity between the two chips it is also a very big phone and once you put a case on it it might just be too big for most people although for other people and probably myself included that's exactly what i'm looking for i want the biggest and the best and i also think if you're still rocking a note 10 or note 20 ultra particularly if it's the rubbish exynos version this is what you've been waiting for i guess the other consideration is if you're not that bothered about the s pen is the s22 or the s22 plus a better value option and of course how is it going to compare to the oppo find x5 pro uh and also the oneplus 10 and the iphone 13 pro max but first impressions very impressive actually but lots more tests to run before i can give you a full review and recommendation but what do you think are you tempted to upgrade and also if you have any questions or anything you'd like me to test let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
