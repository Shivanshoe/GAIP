hey guys i'm tom of techchap and by now you've probably seen a whole bunch of videos on the new note 20 ultra i posted my hands on a couple days ago and now everyone's showing off their unboxing videos i too have a box uh but i've been using this for the past couple of days now i have switched to it i know it's the youtuber cliche but i reckon the note 20 ultra will become my new daily driver i hate that phrase but we're going with it so let's start with the box because people do love a good unboxing video and i'll keep this nice and simple in the box you get the 25 watt charger it now supports a maximum 25 watts the s20 series actually supported 45 watts so you had to buy a optional i think 50 pounds charging actually didn't make that much difference in real life along with 15 watt wireless charging and also 4.5 watt reverse wireless charging so the plug and the usbc two usbc cable and a pair of akg earphones usb c obviously because there is no headphone jack on the note 20 ultra we didn't expect it but i know for some people uh that's still a sore point because the note 9 had it but yeah that's pretty much what you get in the box i'm not sure why people need to do full unboxing videos that takes like 10 seconds anyway back to the phone and the first reaction i've had when i've showed this to people i've shown my wife and my brother so far i hand it to them and they say oh that's a big phone and oh wow look at that on the back that really sticks out both of them said the exact same thing uh that this camera bump here was well really for lack of a better word sticky-outy and i guess it is i suppose i'm used to it coming from the s20 ultra so while i think it does look better uh this whole thing especially in this mystic bronze looks fantastic i think it really does protrude quite a bit so i would recommend putting a case on this also because it's a bloody big phone 6.9 inches i have reasonably big hands i'm a six foot two guy so i'm not a tiny person but i do struggle to hold this and use it one-handed so of course it's a note it's what the original phablets were so you're gonna have to probably use two hands for this or indeed the s pen which is a staple of the note series one thing i've noticed i keep pressing uh the bottom right corner for the s pen because that's where it's always been but they've actually switched it now so it's on the left side we have the s pen which feels just the same as the last couple of years and of course it matches the color of the phone you've gone with so i have this very fancy mystic bronze also comes in mystic black which just looks a bit boring but also a interesting mystic white which i thought looked pretty good but it's not just the screen size that makes us feel big because we have the squared off corners it does make it feel a little bit bigger and if you do hold it in a normal phone way at the bottom at least it digs into your hand a little bit so you kind of encourage to hold it a little bit higher up so yes this is a big phone but you probably knew that because it's a note but just be prepared to probably put a case on it as well because not only does the camera module protrude quite a bit but it is quite slippery and when we do have gorilla glass 7 which they tell me is also known as gorilla glass victus on the front and the back unlike the regular note 20 which is still gorilla glass 5 and a slightly ugly glass stick design rather than this premium glass so looking around the phone on the bottom we have the usb-c port a single speaker down here along with the s pen then on the right side we have uh the power and volume rocker nothing at all on the left side so they've actually switched it as well uh compared to last year's note 10. on the top we have the sim card tray with microsd support because it's the ultra along with another speaker up here so this does give you uh akg tuned that's a tongue twister as well uh speakers we do get stereo speakers on here [Applause] and then on the front we have this massive screen which is curved to the ultra gets a curved screen the standard note 20 is flat so you may actually prefer that i know some people do and then this little well as something called infinity oh design this front hole punch cutout but it is pretty small and not too obtrusive now if you did watch my hands-on video from a couple of days ago you know that i spent about a third of that ranting while explaining the issue around the processor in here because of course in the uk and europe we get the exynos 990 samsung's own processor whereas in north america and other territories they get the even faster snapdragon 865 plus so the exynos was already slow in the 865 and then rather than you know improving that or you know making it fair across all regions they've just improved further the north american variant which is disappointing because the exynos version of the s20 series did give us worse performance worse battery life and it actually affected the camera quality a bit as well so i can't give you benchmarks or do side by sides just yet because of this review embargo i'm under but putting the processor stuff to one side for a second this is still an incredibly fast phone we get 12 gigs of ddr5 ram in here i have 256 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage although in the us it only comes with 128 gigabytes but both have a option of 512 gigs plus you have that microsd card support so you can have up to 1.5 terabytes of storage if you just want to go crazy i mean who knows maybe the reason we're getting uh the 256 gig option here and not in the us is because they feel bad for us because we have the exynos so they're making us feel better with more storage but the biggest difference to performance really is this new adaptive 120 hertz refresh screen because i mean even the x65 plus only adds sort of like 5 10 to the gpu performance it's not a huge upgrade of course i'm still frustrated about it and we'll come back to the full review now you still can't have the wqhd plus resolution and the 120 hertz at the same time it is one or the other just like the s20 series which again is a bit frustrating because you know the note series is well a very expensive and kind of marketed as this sort of all-singing all-dancing ultimate flagship phone but there's still this compromise there where you have to pick and choose it's kind of like having you know the ps4 pro or the xbox one x where you could either go for performance or graphics preset but even at 1080p i can barely make out pixels it still looks fantastic and there's a lot more to the screen than just the resolution because these samsung screens are consistently among the best on the market in terms of color accuracy you know blacks brightness this actually peaks at 1500 nits with hdr content so it's the brightest phone ever i believe now importantly it is adaptive refresh so using this fancy lpto screen it basically means that based on what's on the screen it'll adapt the refresh rate because of course that's going to drain your battery and the s20 series especially with the exynos chip were not fantastic for battery even with the massive 5000 cell that we got in the s20 ultra in here we have 4500 so that is one of the things i was really worried about and i will continue to test over the next few days before my full review but samsung do say that having this adaptive frame rate means that actually when you're just looking at an article or reading a web page it'll go down to between 1 and 11 hertz because you're not really doing anything if you're watching a movie or video it'll go between 30 and 60 and gaming is 48 hertz and above and they do say it should save a good chunk of battery so that's something i will test and we'll hopefully hopefully offset the smaller battery size because of course they've had to cram in an s pen into the body as well so these physically couldn't fit that same 5 000 million power battery as we got on the s20 ultra software wise we have android 10 with samsung's one ui 2.5 on top and if you've used the samsung phone for the past two or three years this will feel pretty familiar to you there's nothing really crazy here i still really wish we had the google news feed to the side rather than samsung's own op day sort of home screen thing i feel like there's a joke to be made there around what's up day not much you in my mind it sounds like up dog but really with the note series it's all about what you can do with the s pen and all the software and little extras that they've added now for me at least the big upgrade with the s pen is the reduced response time down to nine milliseconds i think it was 40 something on the note series last year so as you write and doodle and draw and do your whatever it is you do with the s pen you just have that kind of like instant feedback which really does make you feel like you're actually drawing something they have also added new air action so you can do well i was gonna say shortcuts but really i don't know who actually wants to use it you can just swipe back with your finger or the pen normally you don't have to act like harry potter and do it three times because you didn't hold it quite in the right position i find them incredibly gimmicky and to be honest not something i would use in real life but you don't have to use them you can entirely turn them off if you want to now for me i never use things like live messages or ar doodle or pen up but i do find it useful for taking screenshots or even being able to draw out little sections to record video and then turn into gifs i know my friend saf from supersaf he loves this for doing some of his thumbnail photoshopping on the phone i find it really useful if i want to take a picture you can hold it further away and then use the little button on here as the camera shutter button or you know you could put your phone way over there and then still take the picture remotely with this in your pocket or something or in your hand because it's quite subtle so far so good then but let's talk about this camera and first impressions i'm actually really impressed with it it's a very similar setup to the s20 ultra but they've made a few tweaks and i think made it a lot better firstly you do notice the focusing was one of the issues on the s20 lineup the had some sort of focusing issues and i do find now that it is absolutely instant it really is quick and that's thanks to a new hybrid laser autofocus which is exclusive to the ultra the stunner note 20 doesn't get that and also they've adjusted the space zoom they've got rid of the hundred times space zoom option which was a bit ridiculous anyway and now it tops out at 50 times but it does look better than even the space zoom on the s20 because actually we're getting a five times optical zoom in here which is up from three times optical one thing i would suggest though if you buy the note 20 is that you'll probably go into the camera app and be like where are all the modes but that's because for some reason they hide them under the more tabs so then you can go in here and then you can actually edit and drag them out onto the main camera carousel at the bottom for quicker access and you have the usual live focus for portraits night shots and also the new pro video mode so if you really want to you can shoot an 8k in this as well as in 219 ultra wide and also at 24 fps for that cinematic look and with the pro video mode you can change all the settings you know exposure lighting focus shutter speed look at histograms for lighting and also there's a whole bunch of new sound options in case you want to plug in external mics connected via bluetooth and you can choose what audio sources you want so if you are someone who takes a lot of video on their phone and maybe wants to get into the weeds a little bit more with the settings then this is gonna be for you i have to say though one of the more impressive changes i think is the selfie camera i need to spend some more time with it and also do side-by-sides with the s20 and the note 20. sorry this is the note 20 with the note 10 because they've actually dropped the resolution on the s20 ultra it was 40 megapixels now it's 10 but first impressions at least i really like the selfie camera on this unfortunately i've been told i can't show you camera samples just yet some of the videos do show them but apparently they shouldn't either samsung's rules are kind of vague annoyingly but make sure you're subscribed for my full review where we'll have an in-depth look at the camera but the question is what phones would you like to see compared to this in a big camera comparison maybe like the iphone 11 for a max maybe the oneplus 8 maybe the huawei the p40 pro plus perhaps let me know in the comments below what phones what two other phones because i have a little trident three phone uh contraption which i can use to take photos which two other phones you'd like to see compared against this in a big camera comparison let me know below and i'll take that on board and try and make that video and finally a quick word on battery life now i've only had a few days with it so far but by midnight i pretty consistently have 22 of my battery left which works out to be around four and a half hours of screen on time from this exynos version of the note 20 ultra i will try and get a note 20 ultra from the us or at least one of my friends hopefully he can give me some of his data and then compare x north versus snapdragon and see which one lasts longer although at the end of the day unless you're willing to ship a phone internationally you don't really have much of a choice so maybe it's a moot point anyway but i'd like to cover it just for interest sake and if we are indeed getting a bit screwed over here with the xnos version then it is good to know and hopefully then that feedback perhaps samsung will take on board so we'll have to see and there's also a few other extras like wireless deck support so you no longer have to plug this in if you are thinking about buying the note 20 ultra and using it as like a bit of a productivity hub i mean this is a powerhouse of a phone plus we have the s pen and with dex you can use it a bit like a desktop and also we have this new ultra wide band chip or uwb which right now doesn't really give you a ton of uh bonuses unless you're transferring files to other uwb devices in which case it should be a lot faster but there are some interesting use cases like being able to unlock your car but it will be interesting to see what developers can do with the ultra wide band technology in this and all together as you'd expect for the price of this thing it is a lovely phone so stay tuned for my full review let me know what cameras you'd like me to test against this and also if there's any other videos or any other questions you have about the note 20 ultra i'll try and factor that into my review and also i reply to your comments below thank you so much for watching guys i hope you found this useful and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech
