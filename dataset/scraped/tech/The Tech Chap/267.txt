hey guys Anton the tech job but I'm gonna find out which has the best camera between Samsung Galaxy s3 and the ultra and the Oppo fine x2 pro as always in these camera comparisons I'll give you my opinion along the way but I want to hear what you think so at the end the little poll the top right which pops up and so let you know in the comments below which one so here they are side by side and just to say I haven't edited any of the images although the Oppo is a pre retail model so bear that in mind now on the s20 we get a quad camera setup which includes the usual main ultra wide and telephoto lenses plus we get a time of flight sensor which should help give us more natural bokeh blur in portrait shots the find x2 pro has a triple camera setup we don't get that time of flight sensor here and the telephoto lens gives us up to sixty times zoom all right let's kick off with some rear-facing video this has been shot at 4k although the s tweaked actually got to 8k but for now we'll stick with 4k 30 and let's actually start with a little focus test looking at these daffodils so we're close up far away close-up weights like Homer Simpson with leg goes up beggars down but hopefully this is demonstrating which is faster to focus [Music] [Music] let's test the stability so this is just me walking using the main limbs on the rear camera but if you switch it to the ultra wide you can see how that compares you can actually definitely see that there's more in the frame on the s20 ultra it's a little bit of a wider field of view apologies for this very miserable great day here in the UK let's jump back to the regular lens again like so and then if we switch to the five times zoom on both ten times telephoto zoom on both see if I can focus on that sign from the viewfinder it looks like the upper is in the middle of an earthquake and then back to one again so I found a bit of a quieter area where I can test the super steady or ultra study modes on both phones it limits the resolution to 1080p but as soon as I start having a little jog hopefully you can see how the stabilization compares between the phones if anyone saw me now they'd they'd definitely be wondering why I'm doing hauling two phones side-by-side while jogging and we're back all right next question how does front-facing video compare I'm just walking through this all and being be that I'm staying in for a couple of days but hopefully as you can see the lighting keeps changing so you should be able to get an idea of how the cameras compare I'm shooting this in 4k on the s20 because it can the Oppo tops are 1080p which is kind of surprising actually given the fact that it's a 20/20 flagship phone that cost about twelve hundred pounds that's a little bit disappointing but side-by-side you can see the Oppo has a little bit more in the frame it's got a slightly wider field of view although the colors on the s20 do look a bit more natural I do look very washed out and pay off on the Oppo which I am normally but not that much so I think I prefer the s20 just looking at the screens but yeah they do a pretty good job what do you think how do you think they compare alright then so let's move on to some photos and I want to show you the full range of lenses starting with the ultra wide and then onto the main lens then two times zoom five times zoom 10 times zoom 30 times 60 times which is the maximum of the Oppo but then finally 100 times oome on the Samsung although I've also cropped in on the Oppo to show it 200 times equivalent let me show you another example this time in trickier lighting here in Piccadilly Circus in London starting with the ultra wide and then switching to the main lens you can see the Oppo is brighter more evenly exposed and offers a good deal more detail in the darker areas moving up to 5 times zoom and they both do a really good job although I think the Samson's colors are touch more natural 10 times zoom now unlike the previous tree photo the Oppo shows become a lot darker although at the same time it means the highlights are better exposed as we zoom into 30 times though which i think is the realistic maximum that you should actually use before the photo start to get really ugly and the Samsung does take the lead but not by as much as I would have thought ok let's switch things up a bit and by default we get 12 megapixel photos from the main lens both phones they use what's called pixel binning to combine multiple pixels into one 9 on a Samsung 4 in the Oppo now this photo is using their full resolution 108 and 48 megapixels on the Samsung and Appa respectively now if I switch back and forth a couple times you can see on the surface there isn't that much difference although the Samsung's full res shot is a little bit darker but if we crop in by 10 times on the standard 12 megapixel shot the Oppo is actually a little bit sharper now if we do the same again on the full resolution photo the Samsung's 108 megapixels come into its own it's a lot more detailed moving on to a couple of portrait shots or what Samsung called live focus and we're definitely seeing a pattern of the Oppo shots being brighter which can be a benefit in some photos but here the Samsung definitely looks more natural zooming in edge detection isn't exactly perfect on either of them the top left of the mug on the Samsung and part of the bench on the Oppo have tripped it up slightly now this is my lovely wife Sarah who's kindly pulling up with me doing a camera comparison while we're on holiday but you can see a stark difference between the two photos the s20 has higher contrast and shadows versus the flatter slightly more washed out look of the upper although the benefit is that you can see more detail and darker areas now both phones can shoot portraits with their main lens or their telephoto on the wide shot the Samsung is much sharper colors again a more accurate and the op ho just looks a little bit flat using the telephoto lens the AA post made me look kind of ill which isn't ideal and my hair is a weird reddish tint to it I think the Samsung wins here okay now I'm gonna shut up for a second and just show you guys a few more photos to give you an idea how the cameras compare now this is using the normal photo mode not the dedicated night mode still you can see the Samsung manages to keep more in focus the guy with the umbrella the sign on the bus the Samsung offers better dynamic range in lower light the colors are also much more natural the bottles behind the bar aren't all bathed in yellow like on the Oppo now using the ultra wide lens and night mode on a tripod you can see the big differences in colors while the Oppo does more accurately capture the black of the night sky the street and the houses look much better on the Samsung oh well here's Samsung's 100 times space soon versus Oppo 60 times zoom yes the Samsung is a splotchy mess and a hundred times is kind of dumb but it's certainly better than the competition [Music] as for low-light selfies well this is a regular selfie and this is with night mode now there exactly look great but the oppo is a good deal brighter but then back in the daylight the Oppo softies look kind of bad to be honest it was a similar story with the photos of me from the rear camera the Oppo is just too bright and too washed out sometimes when it comes to skin tones on this one the Oppo has done a better job so the quality is depend on the light but I think overall the Samsung has a better all-around selfie camera so then what do you think which one has the best camera overall I will admit that I'm not a professional photographer so I'm just giving you my two cents but I'd love to hear your thoughts about the photos as well make sure you do subscribe and stay tuned for my full reviews on both phones coming soon and I'll catch you next time right here on the tech chap
