hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and if you're a regular on the channel you'll know that i think the dell xps 13 is one of the best laptops you can buy it's not perfect and it is still quite expensive uh but i think as the horrible youtube cliche goes it's a good all-rounder so i've actually teamed up with intel who are very kindly sponsoring this video uh because they've asked me to basically test a laptop with one of their fancy new 11th gen tiger lake chips and i'm kind of curious not only how this performs but also how fast it is in games and to give some context here is another dell xps 13 uh one i made earlier this is actually uh the exact same spec but the previous early 2020 model with 10th gen iceland processors so this is going to be a perfect side by side to see just how much faster this is in games so this is the xps 13 9310 we've got the i7 1165 g7 which of course also comes with their much faster iris xe graphics intel claims that chip for chip this new design has around twice the gaming performance of the equivalent 10th gen mobile cpus although some chips lower down the stack still get intel's older uhd graphics as we get on the 10th gen chips so the question is do intel's claim stack up is this significantly faster than last year's model and is this a nice little mini gaming laptop that can now play games at 1080p well the answer is kind of sort of yes ish quick side note though because some of the new 11th gen chips including the i7 i have in here have a higher 12 to 28 watt tdp as opposed to the 7 to 15 what on some lower end chips in the new range but importantly i actually measured this xps with the higher powered chip go way above even the 28 watt tdp range briefly peaking in the high 40 watts so basically it all comes down to the cooling and the fans of the particular laptop you're using and this is another advantage of 11th gen the laptop being able to dynamically scale when in performance mode and so it means laptops like the msi prestige 14 i have here which is using the exact same chip but because we have a slightly beefier cooling solution you can see the keyboard lifts up a bit the fans do wear up a lot louder as well but this can actually go to an even higher tdp wattage level than the xps 13 and crucially sustain it for longer so even though the same chip depending on the model you go for you can actually get even more performance but if i put the msi back for one moment and then bring back the older 10th gen xps 13. during my cinebench test i actually recorded a 25 to 30 higher clock speed on the 11th gen versus the 10th gen so we get higher clock speeds for longer and therefore better performance and it doesn't get any hotter or louder which is pretty cool okay enough waffle let's get to the gaming and i'll be testing them at 1080p because even though these screens are 4k that's maybe a little bit overkill for a 13 inch laptop now maybe a little bit naively i tried boosting up cyberpunk 2077 just to see if it would work it wouldn't even start unfortunately it just kept crashing to desktop but who knows future updates or driver optimizations may fix this i also wanted to try the new call of duty black ops cold war but unfortunately it just wouldn't even start on this either neither would it on the old model or even the msi prestige 4 team maybe because they fall below the minimum spec requirement but uh not the best start so no cyberpunk no call of duty but thankfully rainbow six siege worked fine and this is one of my go-to test games it's well optimized it still looks pretty good so i averaged a playable 33 fps on the older 10th gen xps but it was pretty choppy with the one percent lows being just 18 fps at times which can feel kind of juddery now moving to the new 11th gen i7 and the average frame rate jumped from 33 to 51 fps that's a 55 optic and honestly it's night and day when it comes to playability dropping to medium high settings and i could hear a solid 60fps not too bad and the framerate never dropped below 37. but what about this little known game called fortnite well there's good news here as well at 1080p with medium settings the 11th gen i7 averaged 36 fps up from 26 on the last gem model which was just too weak for fortnite to two week fortnight so getting over 30 fps here makes all the difference although i did still suffer from some stuttering thanks to some pretty dreadful one percent low frame rates on both machines moving on to shadow of the tomb raider which is still quite a workout for integrated graphics on 10th gen i was averaging around 11 fps and could only get a playable frame rate by dropping to the lowest settings at 720p the 11th gen on the other hand was up around the mid-20s at 1080p on high so this is actually two to two and a half times as fast and while still not ideal it makes it into a game that you can actually play i'd still drop some settings back to get a solid 30 and reduce some of those choppy feeling 1 lows but overall this is maybe the biggest improvement i've seen and it feels so much better in cs go it's an old one but it checks out and again at 1080p with high settings the new xps averaged a very respectable 43 frames per second but it wasn't that much fun to play thanks to some serious and regular frame drops limiting the frame rate to 30 did smooth things out a little bit though and i can't really complain when average frame rates were double what i got on 10th gen things are looking up with league of legends though which was totally playable on either machine with both managing well over 100 fps at 1080p with very high settings i even pushed it to 4k on very high and i averaged 39 fps on 10th gen and a full 60 4k 60 on 11th gen and finally for the benchmarking nerds among you in 3dmark time spy the 11th gen was 47 percent faster and it's actually faster than nvidia's discrete mx 250 gpu while in cinebench which is more cpu intensive 11th gen had a 21 lead but don't forget it's not just performance that's had an improvement here battery life is also quite a bit better in my standard youtube battery test the 11th gen xps 13 lasted nearly an hour and a half or around 20 longer than the older xbs and this has a lot to do with intel's more efficient superfin process and to be honest i'm pretty surprised it lasted that much longer given it's still based on a 10 nanometer design and with much higher clock speeds and power limits so fast the cpu and gpu longer battery life we also get faster memory this now supports lp ddr4 4266 megahertz ram to be exact we also get wi-fi 6 support as well as thunderbolt 4. there's a lot new here so while i've been mainly concentrating on the xps 13 there are of course loads of alternatives with 11th gen chips so can the 11th gen xps 13 moonlight as a light gaming laptop well sort of it depends on the game really and if you're playing some older titles like cs go league of legends even rainbow six siege then actually you can get pretty impressive frame rates and i'm seeing anything from 50 to 100 to even 300 improvements in performance with this over this so even though we still have a couple of issues cyberpunk and call of duty just didn't run unfortunately across the board in terms of sheer performance 11th gen particularly xc graphics is a huge upgrade but let's be realistic this still isn't a premium gaming experience and we really shouldn't expect it to be but overall i'm still very impressed 11th gen is a worthy upgrade this year particularly in the graphics department but what do you think of the new 11th gen chips and also the xbs 13 would you be tempted to buy one of these or even just upgrade your current laptop and if you are using your laptop for games what are you
