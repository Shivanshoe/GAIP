hey guys Anton the tech jack but I wanted to share with you a few things that you may have missed or maybe not known about some things all new galaxies that flip and if I've missed anything please do share it in the comments below and if you'd like to see more of these videos then don't forget to hit that subscribe button so at number one and this is a super quick one but did you know that something actually bundles a case for the flip in the Box it's a pretty basic clear plastic cover but given the flip cost thirteen hundred pounds or nearly fourteen hundred dollars any extra protection is appreciated number two and while one of the headline features of the flip is the new ultra thin glass screen according to Zach from jury-rigged everything in actually scratches very easily in a similar way to the plastic screens found on other folder walls so it turns out the flip does use utg or ultra-thin glass but then it also has a thin polymer film on top which is why it can scratch like plastic still it does feel nice to use in the fold and the crease is definitely less noticeable number three and while we're on the subject did you know that Samsung offers a one-year screen replacement for a relatively affordable ninety nine pounds or 149 dollars that price is only for the first break though and after that it'll probably cost you a small fortune to fix number four and because the flip ships with Android 10 we get new and improved gestures I mean first of all switching from nav keys to gestures frees up that extra space at the bottom of the screen but now we also get swiping from the edge to go back on Android 9 like I still have on my galaxy fold I have to swipe off from the bottom to go back which is annoying given the size of the phone so particularly for the tall flip this makes it so much easier to use at number five and did you know the flip supports fast 12 watt wireless charging which is pretty impressive actually considering the battery is actually split into two it only works when a folder but it is pretty cool just to flip it close and place it on a cheap wireless pad plus it also supports reverse wireless charging so you can then top up other devices like the Galaxy buds number six and you've probably already seen the fact that you can use a tiny one point one inch cover screen as a camera viewfinder which i think is a great idea but in practice is a bit useless given how small it is and the idea is you can then take a selfie with the good quality rear cameras but what you can also do is jump into the camera app when it's unfolded and tap the little gray icon in the top right corner to turn it on and so then whoever you're taking a photo of can then try and well squint to see them in the cover screen viewfinder number seven and while we're talking about the cover screen firstly did you know that you can actually swipe right to check notifications and swipe left to control your music plus if you're getting a call you can actually swipe right on the cover screen to answer it so you never actually have to open the phone now if you do want to use the flip like a proper flip phone then go into settings tap accessibility then interaction and dexterity and then turn on open phone to answer you can also toggle weather closing the phone ends the call or not number eight and let's talk about Flex mode or using the flip halfway open like this the best use so far I've seen is with the camera app this splits between the screens then you can take photos selfies video chat all hands-free number nine and let's talk about gaming and surprisingly despite the fact that this is the tallest phone you can buy most modern Triple A games support it really well Call of Duty mobile looks incredible on the flip filling the whole screen in asphalt 9 the menu screens do have some pillarboxing outside but the game itself is full screen most games though particularly the older ones just aren't developed for the taller screen so we do get pretty chunky bars other side or if you're using in portrait mode just one big black bar with a bottom number 10 and sticking with games for a second after watching border works video gaming on the flip I had to give this a try myself and downloading a gba emulator from the Play Store and then downloading a few roms online it's a lot of fun playing classic games in Flex mode on the flip with the bottom half of the screen acting as the joypad all the buttons and the screen on top it's kind of silly but it brings out the nostalgic factor of the flip phone or you can use it in landscape mode and then the extra screen space comes in handy for the side controls I'll put a link to the app in the description if you want to check it out number 11 and I actually mistakenly thought the flip had stereo speakers during my hands-on video but in fact despite the 1,300 pound price tag we only get mono sound from one bottom firing speaker the top here piece one is just a calls which given how wide the phone is when you're watching videos or gaming in landscape having the sound come from just one direction is actually a little bit distracting moving on to number 12 and this one's a little bit more techie but Samsung phones usually come with either a Qualcomm or Exynos processor so for the Galaxy S phones including the latest s 20 we get the X nos 990 here in the UK what's interesting though is that I bought this flip from Samsung UK store myself and it's using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 plus which is a  overclocked version of the eight by five and not Samsung's own Exynos chip it doesn't make a huge difference but generally Qualcomm chips offer slightly better performance and battery life so that's good news number thirteen and this is a nice and quick one but using the edge panel you can tap on any app to quickly put it side-by-side in split view which actually works really well on this taller screen watching a YouTube video and making notes or Google Maps and whatsapp I think this is the first phone where I actually want to use two apps like this number 14 we're nearly there guys I promise now you've probably already seen the new single take feature mention but did you know it also works with a selfie camera over 10 seconds it captures video boomerangs portraits that uses filters and then you can swipe up and see the full portfolio to be honest I don't know how often I would use this but if you love a good selfie with your friends then this could be fun it's a bit like one of those photo booths you get parties and finally number 15 here's a couple of quick tips to make using the flip a bit easier first long press on the home screen go to settings and enable swipe down for notification panel now you can swipe down from anywhere on the home screen you don't have to reach all the way to the top also if you want to turn off Samsung daily which is a little newsfeed left of the home page just pinch in and tap the toggle icon now I already mentioned about gestures but another tip is to go to the display settings and turn on dark mode which should help with battery life plus it's a little easy on the eye also then go to advanced features and turn on reduce animations to speed everything up a bit there's also a one-handed mode to make things easier to use well one-handed obviously and finally by default holding the power button actually opens bigsby which I find kind of annoying so in the settings menu go to advanced features tap on side key and then change press and hold to power off so now acts like a proper power button so what do you think of the galaxies that flipped you reckon you'll be buying one yourself or maybe not for that crazy $1400 price tag let me know what you think and also if you've got any tips of your own in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you want to see more from me then don't forget to hit that subscribe button I'll catch you next time right here on the tech jab what are you doing research no it's the most pointless but very cool use of the floor flipping phone this was definitely worth $1,400
