you know i was about to say the same thing should we start with these yeah absolutely all right so hey guys i'm tom the tech chat hi guys i'm pete the tech chat and he is my elder brother we've been working together for a couple of years now and he's going to help me help you guys talk through some of the best gifts for should we say the holiday season gopros cameras laptops games consoles speakers everything under the sun really so i want to kick off with these you've probably seen it it's the new uh fourth generation amazon echo i know this has been quite divisive for a lot of people i've i've got echoes i've got the older taller sort of cylindrical ones i at first i thought this looks it looks great but then it's got the light bulb underneath yes exactly so this is replacing the tall cylindrical one which i had as well uh this is about 60 pounds on black friday 90 pounds normally so it sort of replaces the echo plus like you get the zigbee uh hub support it's got better speakers uh it's a little bit faster as well so when you speak to it it responds a little bit better i've had this in my kitchen for a few weeks now and as you mentioned the pain in the ass about this is that the ring light is now on the bottom not on the top so if you're anywhere that you don't look down on your echo so if it's on a kitchen counter or above something you can't now see the light light you can't tell it's activated you can't tell it's activated so you have to sort of double check a couple times i'm not a huge fan of that but it does sound better right the speakers are really good in this on the other hand you have this little guy this is the new echo dot smaller more portable you might want to have a few of these around your house and it costs about 30 to 40 pounds so i quite i kind of like this i would have one main one in my kitchen maybe a couple of these in the bedroom is that the one that's got a clock in it um yes you see to me that's way more useful if you're sticking that you know in your spare room or by your bed why doesn't the big one have a clock i don't know well any kind of small display that would be nice but these are you know nice refresh a conversation starter in terms of design and yeah i think quite affordable so this is my first one what's your what's your first gift recommendation uh my first one i think i'm gonna go for is this which is the new ipad air fourth generation okay because this just came out right this is the refresh yeah it's very very recent so but and this year is a big change in the past the sort of ipad air has sort of um taken the design of the lower end ipad and just sort of added in a few extra features whereas this one is much more closely related to the ipad pro which comes in higher than this is much more expensive than this actually so this gets all the good things that you get with the pro like the the new design the squared off design which is really really nice if it wasn't for the camera module on the back i would have a hard time telling the difference between that and the pro that's right so the so this does this is one of one area that it compromises uh so it's got uh it doesn't have the ultra right camera or the lidar sensor that you get but i mean arguably that that's limited use for a lot of people so it's a good way to cut down on the cost of it you don't get the promotion screen so this this has a 60 hertz screen as opposed to the 120 hertz i do notice that yeah i notice it too but i i think it's because we're used to using things with 120 hertz yes if it's not something you're that familiar with i just don't know if you've noticed if we bought that for your mom or your dad they wouldn't know the difference they wouldn't care this is as an all-around ipad for most people this is definitely the one to go for i think given that you're getting the much nicer design more storage double the storage double the storage yeah that's one of the issues the base one is cheap but only comes with 32 giga storage which is not which is nature-proof once it's formatted and you've got ios and ipad os on there it's you 20 some 24 gigs or something less somewhere so it's not worth it this i think if you can stretch to it makes it much better i agree with the overall purchase i love what they've done with this touch id is the home button that's right so you don't get face id like you do with the camera on the pro you just get touch id again it's just it's just a bit of a cost saving thing but but for me i think it's a compromise and as you showed in our little setup here this it does work with the magic keyboard absolutely and it's the cheapest ipad that does support magic keyboard the pros do as well i love this it's so good it's expensive it's a lot of money that's for a keyboard yeah yeah magnets always with the magnets yeah you get a little trackpad you get a nice keyboard you also get apple uh gen 2 pen pencil support which is if you if you want to do some drawing or some work on it such a good design yeah and it just charges by magnetically attaching to the top there so yeah it's brilliant best tablet you can buy hands down absolutely fantastic so you did mention the m1 and actually as we're using it for some notes here this is the new macbook air with m1 people don't get i don't think i don't think it's widely understood yet that this is a as big a change as it is it's absolutely massive i can't think the last time there's been such a revolution in the laptop market every year we get new intel machines which we talk about and we show off and it's for five ten percent faster slightly better graphics and that's fine but this has just come out and it's sort of offering in some cases double double the performance of before double the battery life together not one or the other yeah and actually even versus this pretty high spec i7 brand new xps 13 it's like 30 faster it lasts 25 longer it's cooler it's quieter it has a better webcam and in some cases it can be cheaper as well it's phenomenal stuff it's obviously still quite expensive it's an apple laptop but i think the air the new macbook air with m1 is absolutely laptop to go for for students for mom and dad for me i'm probably going to use this don't worry about app compatibility so far everything i've tested has worked well with this and it's actually run faster on this even than native windows machines that's ridiculous which is because it's even through translation where's that or whatever it is yeah yeah it couldn't be simpler if you want to buy a new laptop and you're happy with to go with a mac and you have i know a thousand pounds to spend 100 go with the macbook air which i do appreciate is quite a high-end gift maybe stretches the world gift a little bit but i just want to bring that in okay then so what's your next pick well i'm gonna go again because i want to talk about this guy it's the gopro hero 9 black this is the hero8 black so you can see a quick side by side and the big upgrades this year as you can see we actually have a front screen so it's a box of viewfinder which is the most useful thing in the entire world especially if you want to use this for vlogging or you just want you know set up the scene or even you're taking a picture or video of someone else they can see themselves compared to the eight which just tells you you know if it's recording and how long you have left real real upgrade also battery life lasts about a third longer than the eight even with the screen okay well yeah which is huge so 30 longer much better front screen better stabilization and low light have you been on any adventures this year really no i barely left the house or the cupboard under the stairs where i worked right gpu it's true i don't know i probably wouldn't have needed to buy a gopro this year but at the same time even though we're under sort of you know restrictions and traveling is difficult i've still found that this has been quite fun to go around just hiking and walks and just exploring my local area so yeah i think it's about 400 pounds about 4 20. uh i'm on black friday it's about 380 so still kind of expensive but not a macbook on the scale of uh some of the gifts here it's um mid-range mid-range but i think this would be a great gift for someone especially if you want to think of 2021 as you sort of a new year new adventures new explorations and you want from the screen with a bigger battery all right so let's go pro for me pete what's your next one um i think i'm going to go with this which is a fairly obvious gift choice idea yeah that's not new is it though it is not new no this uh this the switch i think this is an original one actually i think this came out in let's see i can turn the screen on here 2017 2017 yes 20 20 gift guide the best from 2017 but there's nothing else like it yet no this is still i mean nobody does what nintendo does or as well as they do when it comes to a certain kind of game family friendly multiplayer sort of co-op split screen given it's three years old we've actually got a decent library of games yeah yeah there's absolutely loads for everyone and you can actually buy these i'm like that's right these actually are available now there is obviously a switch light as well which is newer which is newer slightly yeah yeah so which is newer it's a little bit smaller it's more portable and it's just it's ideal for people who are just playing on the go or don't have access to a tv personally i wouldn't really want to give that up because i wouldn't either the whole point of this is removable joycons yeah or also plugging into a tv plug into this multiplayer that's right the dock yeah i want to switch the switches yeah i totally call me old-fashioned but uh my three-year-old little boy loves playing mario kart on this as much as the console is i think fairly reasonably priced um the games are often very expensive if they're new they they can charge a lot for them and they do i think expensive games is the order of the day especially when we come to these consoles yeah if you bring in the ps5 we actually have one which is quite impressive for a start we've also got series x there there's a series s lurking somewhere else 65 pounds for nba that was a whole noise yeah this obviously you guys will know this this is probably the hottest gift yeah it is i think so i think probably ps5 more than the xbox there's merits for both we love both and it's all i think down to what games you play in terms of exclusives and also what your friends yeah what consoles your friends go because if everyone's playing online on the ps5 and you've got an xbox then you really know me yeah really the one thing i was thinking that's really impressive about this is that as a console generation this is the biggest leap i think since i've been playing games since ps2 yeah i mean it's just it's huge this is this is high-end pc stuff you know reasonably high-end pc stuff i agree and it's not just uh the boring stuff like tech hardware it's the controller as well so this is the dual sense and what do you think of the triggers i think they're amazing i think i think this is the standout bit that nobody really saw coming i agree basically with this we have this force feedback this next-gen haptics that's right so the developer in a game can adjust how it feels to press the trigger so in call of duty you've got to really press it down to fire a gun which you may hate does that thought vary between weapons as well that's a great question so far i don't think it does oh right i think a rocket launcher would take a bigger one uh but it just makes you feel like you're really in it for me i would go ps5 uh yeah just because i like the games more i think and also if you do have a gaming pc then most xbox exclusives will also be on windows yeah which is kind of negates your need to have an xbox to some extent i mean you do have game pass on the xbox yes yes you do which is actually a cheaper way of getting it it is it's because you don't have the outlay of a 70 game you actually have a real real child so here we are uh recommending something that you might may not be able to buy in time time not for the last time not for the last time either last thing on the consoles though is that i think we would recommend avoiding the digital edition of the ps5 and also the xbox series s because it doesn't have the disk drive that's right yeah and it just means you have to buy all your games to the digital store through the play store whatever it is um so you're playing playing top dollar every time you can't trade your games in yeah and if you trade your games and that'll quickly erode the difference in price absolutely too because if you bought watchdogs or assassin's creed you're probably not going to want to keep that for long so yeah buy the full version i think why am i in here again yeah you might want to turn it on as well otherwise it's just in the dark i'm just looking at darkness this is an oculus quest 2 his box um you can take that off now if you want tom uh refinement of the quest one that came out a couple years ago um uh which is a great headset actually it was yeah and i had one of those and i've just upgraded to this one um so the big deal here is this is a standalone vr headset so you don't have to have a pc to plug it into there's no cables no cables so you can walk around in 3d space and the games are all run internally so um you buy the games on here you play the games on here they come with a couple of controllers here these are the movement controllers i like this they feel the same as the rift s and the rift yeah they're a little bit chunkier than before um they're great and actually you can use your hands as well uh in vr so even without yeah without these just track your hands and you interact by pinching your thumb and forefinger and moving things around what's the game situation because unlike a pc hooked up one so i have the oculus rift s which is the sort of high end oculus still cable still plug into pc and i can play all my steam games and stuff yeah so you can you can do that with this as well you can plug it into your pc it is via a usb connection as opposed to an hdmi okay so there's sort of compression that goes on there so it's not quite as pure anymore but you can play full fat pc but you can yeah so this doubles up as a pc headset as well okay that's why it's quite versatile there's nothing else really that competes with this because um the ecosystem that's part of this is far and away you've got the most games for a standalone headset it is facebook owned so they're throwing a lot everyone facebook integration no and that gets me onto the to the the bad points because you have to log in with your facebook account in order you have to link it with your oculus account which wasn't the case before so essentially you have to give your data to facebook and a lot of people are not very happy about that um which i completely understand i mean i have this for testing purposes so it's just a necessary evil i suppose facebook necessary that works i should say this is actually cheaper than the quest one quest one was 399 this is 299. that's a big difference i thought the original quest was too expensive yes that's much better it is but they in order to cut costs they've actually they've this head strap for example isn't very comfortable it's a cheap cheap material i love this thing i think it's a a great gift idea again mid middle mode pricing you know 300. uh so yeah it's two 299 pounds uh that's six for a 64 gig one and i think it's 3.99 for a 256gb one if you want the storage you want to put some movies on there okay great so let's talk about something a little bit cheaper because so far we've been on the higher end this is a gift is a strong word but it's a tile so i actually i've actually been using these for a couple of years this is the new tile pro this little thing will cost you about 30 pounds or you can get the smaller mates two for about 25 and it's basically [Music] basically didn't think i'd be that loud just like a way of tracking things so you could put this on your keys you could keep it in your backpack your luggage your wallet i've got one almost all of those actually and then through the app on iphone or android you can then track it if you lose your keys you can beep it you can ring it from your phone and then it will go off and you can find stuff not too expensive i actually bought my wife this for christmas last year it's a little bonus romantic so romance isn't dead but just because you know it helps you stop helps you stop losing things and then like your wife like yeah i've got one on her at all times i know where she is but definitely a nice little uh stocking filler as they say okay what's next what's next i reckon we should talk about philips hue philips hue is a bit like any smart home stuff it's a bit of an addiction because as soon as you get one you think well this other room isn't automated so i better get some more things to automate that and it just goes in the i must be up to 30 odd light bulbs i thought you're gonna say it's a bit like crack but maybe it is it's tech crack so you guys are probably familiar with philips hue small lights smart bulbs nothing really new there this is one of the uh go lamps we've also got this hue setup behind me we've got light strips we've got a couple of bulbs um but one of the new things from uh the good people at phillips whereas this guy this is the philips hue gradient light strip and it's kind of like a next-gen version of the light strip which we have behind this desk and this is meant for your tv so can you guess how much this this costs is 120 this starts from 150 and then you need the hue sync box which is 230 and you need the philips hue bridge which is about 35. is it too late to change this buying guide recommendation i there's nothing that does this quite as well i've hooked it up to my tv at home and it's a 75 inch model there's a 55 inch version of this as well and it just goes around the edge with the sync box then you connect it to your games console your satellite box tv box and then it basically can read what's on screen and then project those colors out of those corners nothing crazy new there philips ambilight tvs have been doing that for a long time but this is just like a way of adding it to any tv essentially it's very expensive you have to use the huesync box which is a bit of a pain you have to plug all your cables in it won't work with any of your smart tv apps because it has to be through an hdmi input so i have to now play say netflix through my ps4 or ps5 rather than through my actual smart tv to get the effects but when it does work and when you have set it up at the end of the day it does look quite cool would i recommend it only if you've got money to burn and you love philips hue otherwise i think that's just a bit of a luxury i do like these kind of bulbs yeah just general smart lights start with a bridge start with a couple of bulbs maybe just expand it over time yeah the only thing i would say is that with the color bulbs that you get they are fun for a little while but i think most people probably just use them in their standard settings yeah warm light so yeah so the i think the the best bulbs i've i've found are the are the um just ambient oh yes much cheaper ambience yeah which are cheaper than the color bulbs i like these you can go crazy with how much you want to spend you can just go over the top with these sort of things uh which is fun but i wouldn't really recommend for the value um but i think philips hue is quite a nice gift i did the hugo is still quite expensive but you often find them on deals especially around like friday yes tends to be when i buy my bulbs i've never ever bought one full price what exciting lives we live buying bulbs now i see behind this ipad you have a graphics card i do this is nvidia geforce 3070 rtx 3070 you can't get many of these like as usual you can't buy these things the 30 series the new uh amd rx 6800 6800 xt you just they're just they're sold out because the demand is so high yeah because they're really good yeah um so if you can get hold of these now i'm not thinking this is necessarily a gift this is even if you just want to get it for yourself for a gaming pc uh a 30 series something like if you're playing at uh 1080p 1440 something like the the 3070 is fine or any forthcoming lower end cards plus one of amd's uh 5 000 second combo series the the 5600 x it's brilliant blows everything out of the water it's just it's so good compared to the last generation including all of the top end intel stuff it's it's really good and it's much cheaper than that as well so if you want a quick gaming pc one of those one of these maybe the amd one if you can get it it's definitely a good time to build a pc because it isn't always a good time to build a pc because there's usually always something coming but now is a great time that was a great time chip with an nvidia or amd graphics yeah all right so even i'm getting bored now just do a quick once thanks i invited you on here all right a couple of quick last ones uh this is the new chromecast the uh one with google tv this has just come out about 60 pounds it kind of sits between the normal chromecast it's above that but below the chromecast ultra so this can't stream games this does not support stadia i don't think anyone's that bothered about that necessarily it surprises me it feels like google's already given up on it isn't it why not support stadia anyway this is basically your dongle you can plug into atv and you get apps like netflix amazon hbo disney plus and it also has a little remote with it it can stream 4k hdr with dolby vision although of course your tv will all seem to support that you're probably thinking where when would i use this it's a little bit tricky because if you have a modern tv probably your smart apps on it will do most of those anyway i think it's for reasonably modern tvs perhaps 4k tvs but the app situation isn't so good you have some more budget tvs where the apps don't support 4k for example then you can get through that maybe if you're traveling plug this into a tv that's what i do i take it with me plug it in that's already logged into all of your right streaming apps you have to log into the wi-fi and it will work i think that's one of the biggest uses for this although you may need to use a power connector as well it doesn't always get all the power it needs through the uh hdmi or usb on the tv itself but a good little travel thing 60 pounds nice and cheap of course there are lots of alternatives roku fire stick 4ks which are a little bit cheaper than this uh but if you like the google ecosystem you want this nice remote uh then the google chromecast with google tv is a pretty nice actually i'm gonna say affordable gift call that quick yeah that suddenly wasn't quick and i think last of all video games yes right yeah everyone loves a video game and there's a whole bunch of them out what are you playing uh at the moment i'm playing a really well it's sort of a i think it's an indie title on the pc called satisfactory where you build a factory you can do a co-op and you just sort of i've never even heard of that but yeah i know i know it's not a mainstream game but it's it's it's it's great fun and you you just sort of build a factory and it has you have to sort of you have to try and make it as efficient as you can all right learn something new about your brother every day so you're playing for this factory i'm trying a bit of spider-man on the ps5 spider-man is great on it looks fast also you've got black ops assassin's creed valhalla watch dogs legion and of course the big one coming soon cyberpunk 2077 i think if your husband your wife your partner or girlfriend wants a video game for christmas if they haven't already ordered it chances are cyberpunk is going to be the game to buy this year or this decade to be honest yeah next year yeah so i think that would be the one to go for what would be your one if you could pick one device from everything here what would you take away everything else goes in the bin i'd have you have sony a7s 3 because it looks really nice it's because you know how much it costs yeah that's right fair enough we haven't got time for that one uh actually if i had to pick anything here if it was if it was for me or i or someone i really really liked it would have to be the macbook m1 because i think that it's so it's such a step change it's such a big deal uh in performance and battery life that pcs are going to take a while to catch up with that i agree and it's money well spent for me because i'm a bit more fun it's christmas time-ish i'm on the ps5 what do you think which one would you go for out of all these and if we've missed out any great gift ideas let us know in the comments
