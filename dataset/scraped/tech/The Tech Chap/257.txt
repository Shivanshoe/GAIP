hey guys Anton the tech chap and this is the new msi GF 65 thin gaming laptop now you may have noticed that this looks exactly the same as the 2019 model and that's because it is it's identical the chassis the screen they're exactly the same as before but now it's available with an NVIDIA r-tx 2060 that's up from the gtx 660ti before for the same price 999 pounds that's actually really good value I mean a full fat RTX 2060 not a max-q version the six core i7 and 750 H processor and a 120 Hertz IPS display for just under a thousand so the main compromises are that you know it's not an ultra thin super sexy gaming laptop necessarily and also the base spec only comes with 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage which frankly isn't enough and I'll come back to that in a second and it does have some stiff competition plus the upgrade to the r-tx 2060 really only offers around a 10% performance gain in most games although it does unlock extras like ray-tracing and dr SS so first of all this is unmistakably a gaming laptop it's pretty chunky and everything is red but ms I've done a good job of giving it a more premium feel with the brushed metal finish no crazy RGB and actually weighing just one point eight six kilograms or four point one pounds it's surprisingly lightweight for a 15.6 inch gaming laptop although don't forget you've also got this fairly hefty 740 gram power supply to go with it there's a little flex in the screen and at the back of the keyboard plus the top and bottom bezels are quite chunky but overall it's pretty decent looking my main complaint though is it picks up smudges grease marks and finger prints incredibly easily I'm not a particularly dirty person if I do say so myself but even a few minutes after unboxing this I had my greasy paw prints all over it I do really like the keyboard and touchpad though it's well spaced out you get a good amount of travel and you can also set the keyboards backlight to any color you want as long as it's red you actually can't change that but it's par for the course with MSI's more budget range of laptops the precision enabled touch pad is also very nice to use well though the clicks feel a little bit spongy but most of the time you'll be using a mouse for gaming and with that budget slightly more affordable theme in mind there's also no face locking or fingerprint reader so you have to unlock it with your Henry a password you know like a peasant peasants who have a thousand pounds to spend on a gaming laptop that is there's also a good range of ports and it's nice to see a couple of USB C's there although neither support Thunderball three unfortunately also the placement can be a bit annoying sometimes when you've got the power coming out of one side and then maybe your wired mouse or any other peripherals using the USB a port on the other side which also then sticks out into the area I'm using my mouse I might just have to get a good Bluetooth gaming mouse instead so the one thing that you really want in a new gaming laptop a side obviously from good performance is a high refresh rate display it's pretty common now actually and the GF 65s 15.6 inch 120 Hertz IPS display does a good job now it's not gonna win any awards I wouldn't edit a professionally color accurate video on it but despite the average brightness and fairly poor color accuracy to my eye it still looks good and when a want to rehearse refresh is absolutely fine for gaming all right let's talk performance and actually straight away I had a bit of a problem here that's because this review sample which is the 999 power version the base spec of the work on the GF 65 only has 256 gigs of storage and only about 218 of that is actually usable which is the most frustrating thing in the history of the world I couldn't install three or four recent games in fact I had to fully reset windows to have enough room for call of duty which requires a ridiculous 180 or so of gigs so you could pay a bit more for a spec with more storage or what I recommend just upgrade it yourself it's really easy to open you just need a phillips head screwdriver and with the plastic bottom chassis removed you can see there's two m2 SSD slots and anymore them is being used so I would probably go and buy a 512 gig one for about 70 pounds and I've grade it it's also only using one of the two RAM slots I'd bind another stick and double it but sticking with the base bag for now and here's the results from a few benchmarks if you into that sort of thing in terms of throttling I ran 30 mark times by three times in a row and the results were the same every time so we're not saying any GPU throttling but doing the same again in Cinebench are 22 stress the CPU it did drop by 10% with temperatures occasionally hitting 99 so it can't sustain its maximum turbo boost for long but despite the loud fans found at the top of the keyboard reached 49 degrees Celsius so it did get quite hot although fortunately the WASD Keys and touchpad stayed comfortable to use okay let's jump into some games and a tenth EP with high settings we're looking at a range from 55 FPS on average in battlefield 5 to 137 in siege now with a few tweaks to the graphics options we could easily push bf5 into the 60s and 70s and while we're not fully taking advantage of that one to rehearse refresh in most games except MC drove other less demanding games it's still worthwhile over a standard 60 Hertz me Wolfenstein Youngblood is interesting though as is one of just a handful of games to support both rate racing and NVIDIA beauty art there's two tech I actually posted a video all about deals as - a few days ago and how I think has the potential to transform games but a 75 FPS average between the two benchmarks with ray tracing and DSS is pretty incredible for an RT X 2016 now unfortunately I don't have the 2019 model here with the gtx 660ti to directly compare it to but you can expect as i say a fairly minor 5 to 10% speed boost but every little helps and while I wouldn't recommend enabling ray tracing without DL SS as it will Harvey a frame rate considering this is the same price as the outgoing GF 65 we're basically getting more for our money battery life is fairly poor though in my experience with light use I got just about three and a half hours although obviously you want to plug it in for gaming speakers are decent though but a pair of headphones is recommended to drown out the fan noise [Applause] so we think the GF 65 offers a good balance it may not be the sleekest or the sexiest or indeed the fastest but if you want a good gaming laptop for you know a grand or just under you are getting a lot of bang for your buck and if you do make a couple of smart upgrades yourself you could actually turn this into a really powerful gaming laptop this really is one the cheapest RT x 2060 gaming laptops that you can buy but what about you would you be tempted to buy one of these or do you have your eye on a different gaming laptop let me know in the comments below and if you did enjoy this video a thumbs up or a sub would be amazing thank you so much for watching guys I'll catch you next time right here
