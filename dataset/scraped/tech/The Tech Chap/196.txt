this video is sponsored by fast hosts just answer this techie test question in the link below for a chance to win the ultimate tech bundle and dream pc setup okay we're going to start this video with a blind test will i be able to tell the difference between 144 240 and 360hz because this is a 360hz monitor so p behind the camera is going to switch the refresh rates i'm not going to know which ones which and then let's see if i can get it right okay first test okay first one all right okay it feels good um have you double bluffed me is it still 360 i wonder oh it it's either 240 or 360. i'm not sure let me have a thing change it to the next one and then let's see what happens i'm already done i just enjoy you all right so this is the second one this feels slower i think this is going to be the 140 oh i think this might be the 144 last one okay so okay that's much smoother i think okay i think this is 360. it is is it it is 360. that's amazing i think the last one was 144 and the first one was 240. that's exactly right i'm 30 next month or in like a few weeks time and i'm surprised i can see it because these sort of 360hz monitors i've always thought are kind of like just for esports and pro gamers and 17 year old kids who have much faster response times than me so i'm kind of impressed that i could see the difference it's subtle it is subtle between 240 and 360 but maybe maybe this is worth it so i've sort of answered the big question of whether you can actually notice 360 hertz but there's a bit more to it so this is the asus rog swift pg259 qn it's a 24.5 inch 1080p ips monitor that's mainly for pro gaming and esports but it's that ridiculous 360 horse refresh that's the standout so the idea is the high refresh rate and the low response time and also the g-sync should as they should give you a competitive advantage i've also got no speakers here and i'm leaning across the desk yes and this is especially helpful in fast-paced shooters like this where you see enemies sooner and then you can react more quickly but the problem is while 360hz is great in theory how many of us have pcs that can push out 360 fps without resorting to potato mode graphics it's pretty expensive as well 650 pounds or seven hundred dollars for a 24 and a half inch monitor this had better be something pretty special and this is clearly aimed at pro gamers and serious enthusiasts and for them this monitor is getting on for perfect but for the rest of us it is worth thinking about if your system can even keep up although of course it's not just for gaming i mean everything you do on the desktop just feels so much faster but it's not all about that crazy refresh rate and the rest of this monitor is actually pretty great as well with a fast ips panel one millisecond response time nvidia g-sync and ultra-low motion blur and hdr it also gets pretty bright and color accuracy is better than most gaming screens covering 98 of the srgb color gamut although i probably wouldn't want to rely on this for any proper photo or video editing now just a bit of a tangent but do you guys fancy winning an ultimate tech bundle and dream pc setup worth up to 5 000 pounds well fast hosts who are kindly sponsoring this video and who offer everything you need when it comes to websites from buying your own domain to building and hosting it they're basically a one-stop shop for making a great website well they're giving you the chance to win this ultimate tech bundle and all you have to do is answer this one techy test question which tech company was founded first nvidia or amd just click the link below and then give the correct answer obviously and you could win this competition is uk only i'm afraid but best of luck and don't worry i've got lots more competitions coming soon if you're not from the uk but definitely check out fast host if you're looking to create a website they really do have everything you need and the best part is it doesn't cost an arm and a leg so why not give fast hosts a try design wise it's a really solid bit of kit actually and it's surprisingly heavy although it's nearly all down to the stand and the base so it feels sturdy and we also get a good range of movement from height and tilt adjustment a little bit of pivoting there and you can also fully rotate it if you like if you want your 360 house gaming monitor in portrait mode like that you have that option so it's well built really solid and yeah pretty flexible as well just like me the bezels are pretty slim which keeps the overall size down although at 24.5 inches it's not exactly big anyway although apparently this is the kind of size pro gamers and esports athletes want to have anyway as it keeps everything in their eye line but i do like the look overall it's clean and not too gamery although it's a different story around the back with creases detailing and this rgb asus rog logo giving me the evil eye you can control this via the aurasync app or using the on-screen controls speaking of controls we get a joystick and four buttons so it's actually really easy to navigate the on-screen display as for ports we get a single displayport 1.4 b which you'll need to use if you want 360 hertz as hdmi 2s top out at 240 hertz we also get two usb 3 downstreams as well as a headphone jack we don't get any built-in speakers which isn't ideal but i guess it's to be expected because if you're going to buy something like this chances are you have a good pair of gaming headphones anyway importantly though the so called fast ips panel does exactly what it needs to being ips the viewing angles are good and there's around 500 nits of brightness it's easy to see even in well-lit rooms so image quality really is very good on this i think the only limiting factor is the resolution but then again 1080p is the only way you're going to get anything close to 360fps in game so of course it makes sense being a gaming monitor it is also marketed as supporting high dynamic range or hdr so if i turn it on in the windows settings and then if i refresh this page 1080p hdr so you can technically get high dynamic range out of this but it's not that impressive to be honest it doesn't even support the basic display hdr 400 spec so it's not something i use very often and i suspect if you are an enthusiast gamer it's not something you'd even probably play with anyway now with this guy we're also getting a full g-sync processor built-in not just g-sync compatibility and of course g-sync helps to reduce screen tearing and smoothes out motion even further now asus says this monster will give us a one millisecond greater grade response time but you will need to set it to extreme overdrive mode and this results in some inverse ghosting artifacts around fast moving objects which just don't look great much better i think is the normal mode which is between two and three milliseconds which is easily fast enough and it does minimize artifacting also good for esports is nvidia's ultra low motion blur or ulmb and this helps to minimize motion blur so you can see enemies more clearly by strobing the image problem is this only works up to 240hz and it also reduces the brightness and turns off g-sync i tried it and it does clean the motion up a little bit though if you're getting this for less competitive games then i'd leave it off and stick with g-sync now the real problem with this video aside from my slightly questionable gaming skills is the fact that it's pretty much impossible for me to show what 360hz looks like to you watching this a 60fps youtube video however if i slow some gameplay down you can see just how many more frames we're getting although it's nowhere near as big of a difference coming from 240. but in reality playing at 360 hertz and to be honest this goes for 240 as well it feels awesome and actually even switching back to 144 hertz is noticeably less smooth and basic 60 hertz just makes me sad now but don't forget unless you are getting a stable 360 fps which i'm just about getting here in rainbow six siege you won't be fully taking advantage of this so really it all comes down to the games you play if you're gonna fire up some microsoft flight same or crisis remastered you've not got a chance of getting anything like that but you know if you're playing your cs goes your rainbow six sieges or your league of legends those sort of things uh depending on your pc specs of course you should be able to get up to 360 and if not maybe just tweaking the settings a little bit you can probably get up there so where does that leave us well i think it's pretty clear that this probably isn't meant for me it's pretty small it's very expensive and it's right on the edge of what my nearly 30 volt response times and reflexes can even keep up with what it is though is a laser focused product that knows exactly what pro gamers and esports gamers want small with the fastest refresh and lowest latency possible to eke out every tiny little advantage possible when you're playing against other players and with solid image quality decent brightness and color accuracy it's a pretty good all-round monitor as well although kind of surprisingly to me at least it is definitely an upgraded noticeable upgrade even over 144 hertz that said for your average gamer like myself the sweet spot for price performance image quality i think is still 27 inches 1440p at hertz as for competition to this guy well there isn't really any at least not you can buy right now you'll have to wait until november for the dell alienware 25 or msi's upcoming oculux monitor as well as aces prior to x25 but what do you think would you be tempted to buy something like this do you think 360hz is overkill or it's like a must-have if you're gonna get those wins in call of duty or league of legends let me know what you think of this asus monitor in the comments below and if you do want
