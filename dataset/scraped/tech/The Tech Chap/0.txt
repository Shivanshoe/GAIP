hey guys i'm telling techchap and this is the new surface laptop go 2 terrible name pretty good laptop and actually i wish i had one of these 10 years ago definitely makes me feel old but back in 2010 when i started university most students rocked up to class with one of these bad boys but not me i couldn't afford one i actually did bring my desktop pc with me for gaming but in terms of taking notes and lessons and actually having a laptop with me i use whatever chunky old horrible pentium windows xp thing i can get my hands on the thing is though as awesome as the macbook air is particularly now with the m1 and of course the new even more impressive and more expensive m2 that's coming out the cheapest air even with a student discount will save you back 899 pounds the same in dollars however this starts from 529 pounds or 599 in the us although i think the strongest competition for this comes from the likes of the asus zenbook 14 or actually the vivobook 15 which of course is a little bit bigger but it's similar money with an oled screen faster graphics more ram more storage keep that one in mind as well so it feels like we don't get a new microsoft surface device that often but there are actually quite a few to choose from now with the recently launched studio laptops at the top end and then you've got the surface laptop 4 which goes up against the likes of the macbook air and then we have this the surface laptop go 2. and honestly i reckon this is the one or at least one of the laptops that i'm going to recommend to my friends when they ask what's the best all-round laptop that doesn't cost an absolute fortune which is one of the questions i get asked all the time so the first laptop go came out in 2020 just as the pandemic was kicking off two years later it was definitely do a refresh and so with the laptop go 2 we get the newer 11th gen intel processors with much faster intel ios graphics also the base spec now gets 128 gigs of storage up from 64 and it's also the faster pcie kind not the rubbish emmc storage they've also improved the webcam which well not perfect is probably the best camera you can get on a laptop at this price point what do you think as you can see lighting makes a big difference to the quality and also the noise yeah look at that if you're in a dark room it gets pretty ropey but then spin around into the light not too bad at all and you can also see it adjusts a little bit i'm a bit overexposed there but then it sort of adjusts to fix it not too bad not the best in the world but definitely i think above average for a webcam but what do you think in terms of the video and also the audio quality the keys have 30 more travel the battery's been boosted by a couple of hours and most importantly of all there's a new color you may have to trust me on this but this is sage it is very silvery it's just got a little hint of green which you can see in certain lights they're all metal there's no fancy alcantara options here like you get on the service laptop and design wise nothing's really changed it's still 1.1 kilograms we still get a 12.4 inch screen with that 3x2 aspect ratio so it's a little bit squarer and less rectangularly that's not that's definitely not a word still i think this has a really nice design it's a little bit tapered as well so it gets thinner towards the front these are absolutely lovely laptops they just feel and look premium and i really do think these are perfect for students or just as a nice little home or office laptop i kind of wish the screen would go a little further back but more flexibility there the hinge is quite solid not too much screen wobble doesn't flex it's very very well made although you can also see here those viewing angles aren't the best maybe that's a good thing though so if you take this to your lecture you're not worried about the person next to you copying your notes or seeing that actually looking at sports and netflix and stuff working speaking of the screen though and this is not even full hd it's just a little bit over 720p although at 12.4 inches it's not that bad actually it's reasonably sharp uh you can't see individual pixels it's around 150 ppi which at a normal distance it's fine and also while the brightness does drop off a little if you're looking off angle on the whole i think this pixel sense screen looks really good microsoft claimed 330 nits but i measured 350 which is pretty decent actually it's touch screen although we don't get proper pen support and also we get decent enough color accuracy we're looking at about 98 srgb so i would be happy to watch movies edit some photos or write an essay on this all day in fact i wrote my entire script for this on the surface laptop go to and it was a really nice experience i love the keyboard on this as i say it's got a little bit more key travel than before though you might not really notice it it's really nice to type on i do just kind of wish that we had a backlight there is no lighting behind the keys which isn't the end of the world but it would be nice i tell a lie there is one key that gets a backlight and that is the power button which actually doubles as a fingerprint reader so how much well as i say it starts at 529 pounds 599 and that's for four gigs of ram i know and 128 storage which is double the amount from last time although this does start at 50 pounds more but overall i think we're getting a better deal on the entry spec however it does start to get a bit pricey eight gigs of ram 128 storage it's an extra 100 and if you want 8 gigs of ram and 256 storage it's another 100 again so i think actually this mid-range model i've got here with the 8 gigs of ram and 128 storage is probably the sweet spot 629 pounds or 699 dollars all versions get the same intel i5 1135 g7 processor with the ios xe integrated graphics and while the new processor gives us a welcome 18 to 20 boost in performance the 82 jump in graphics is definitely the headline that is huge and i can even get away with some light gaming in rainbow six siege on top of that microsoft claim they've also boosted the battery with this and we should be looking at up to 13 and a half hours but i can tell you that's not what you're gonna get in real life one hour of youtube drained 18 of the battery and actually in my everyday kind of use of a bit of netflix youtube spotify google docs those sort of normal things i got between six and a half and seven hours so you might just about get through a full day of school or work at the office with this although the good news is that the microsoft connected charger is nice and small so you can carry it with you it takes about an hour to charge up to 80 percent plus you can also charge it via the usb c port if you prefer speaking of which we get a regular and actually quite slow usb type a plus the usbc which supports display out if you want to hook up an external monitor as well as data and charging and also a headphone jack and on the other side the surface connect charging port also the speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop this size and well this price not bad at all so should you buy it well yeah i really like the surface laptop go to as i say terrible name but there are a couple of problems as i say a slight longer battery life would be nice uh that screen resolution really isn't particularly impressive nor all those viewing angles but they're fine and it is a lovely laptop to just use to type on the precision touch pad is really responsive and of course you've got the touchscreen if you prefer i just kind of wish that we had eight gigs of ram as standard that would make a big difference i don't really want to pay another 100 just for four more gigs of ram and i think the biggest problem with this is the competition not from the macbook air but as i say things like the zenbook or viva book with arguably better specs and for similar money but if you want a good all-round student slash home laptop and don't want to pay an absolute fortune and you want a nice compact size definitely give the surface laptop go to a look and actually if you do fancy checking this out i'll leave links in the description below and if you've got any questions at all let me know in the comments and also let me know if you would go for this or something like the viva book instead thank you so much for watching guys if you enjoyed the video want to see more from me hopefully you do then a cheeky little like and subscribe below would be very much appreciated
