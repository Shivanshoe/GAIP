this video is partly sponsored by nvidia and scan computers [Music] nope nope off i done there we go i didn't break it now i wish i could say i built this myself but if you're familiar with my channel or my pc videos you know that i'm not capable of anything like this um in fact it's one of just two pcs in the world i was gonna say it's one of a kind but there's two of them so that doesn't really work but this was actually built by scan computers and their 3xs build team which apparently has a royal warrant from the queen so uh if this is good enough for liz then i suppose it's good enough for me as well now as you can see from the not so subtle marketing down here this is kind of in collaboration with xbox game path for pc and also gears tactics this is actually one of the first pcs to have a custom water cooled rtx 3080 so i'm really interested to see what this does to the temperatures i've tested the fans edition a asus tough version of the 3080 and now we've got this guy so uh we'll be running some tests later on to see how much cooler this is we'll come back to the rest of the specs in a minute but i really just want to talk about the design of this thing i've never seen anything quite like this obviously it's gears of war inspired or gears tactics but we've got this steel frame on the top and bottom which i guess has got some sort of uh patina on it i'm not sure what they call it maybe an acid wash to give it that sort of rustic look probably other laser or water cut this gears of war cog logo and then actually 3d printed this little image in the center i don't usually get that excited about cable management but if we spin this round slightly it's not just the front it's not just a facade they've done an awesome job at the back as well with this sort of black and yellow sort of color scheme for this build so this is the default color we've got sort of yellow black and red kind of theme going on but you can customize the rgb lighting through the iq software and also the asus armory but obviously this liquid is yellow which either looks like alien blood or some sort of custard or something so it kind of works having this yellow lighting theme for me it's really the sort of labor of love that they've put into this because there's a little hand sort of painted bumper thing tack on to the end of this card and also you can see this little reservoir pump for the uh liquid here you've got this sort of well it's plastic but they've really put some time and effort painted it to make it look rustic and kind of beaten up to really go with this theme we get so wound up in benchmarks and frame rates but we kind of forget how pc building can be really fun sometimes i love what they've done with this so we've got a 360 rad at the top here and then three 120 fans at the front so we've got a lot of airflow uh obviously we've got this big metal plate at the top and front which isn't ideal for airflow but we've got these sort of vents as well here and of course the main parts of it the gpu the cpu are water cool and you've got the reservoir up here pumps into the cpu and then you can see all the nice liquid taking that heat away from the 3080 here and then it goes underneath down by the psu and starts again so specs wise we've got the rtx 3080 and from what i can tell it's probably an asus card i think it's made based on the tough uh version obviously they've taken off the fans this has got a water block on it we've also got a intel 10th gen i7 10 700k which we've overclocked to a 5.1 gigahertz across all cores it's an 8 chord chip 16 threads of course just 16 gigs of ram that's something i might upgrade myself we've got a twin corsair vengeance 3600 megahertz ram and of course this is all based on a asus origi strix z490 board powering everything and behind here we have an 850 watt uh corsair psu and we've also got one terabyte of storage through an m2 ssd so with that spec and then of course all this custom everything really how much do you reckon it would be well i went on scan's website priced up all the components individually including the case and it came out at about 2 200 pounds or so which is i think about 2 600 but that's before any of this before the labor before the sort of custom the materials you know they must have put a lot of hours into this we're probably looking about 4 000 pounds and cool transition did that work this is tom from the future jumping in here with a quick message from the sponsors for this video nvidia and scan computers have you ever wanted to stream your videos or games it's not something i've really tried before but with nvidia's new broadcast app you can basically turn yourself into a bit of a professional streamer just have a look at that there's not even a green screen so you can get all your hardware so your pc components your fancy new rtx 30 series graphics card even full pc systems and of course streaming extras like key lights decks mics and webcams from scan then thanks to the newly released nvidia broadcast app it's so easy to turn your living room office or gaming space into a proper home studio and what i can do is go to the microphone for example i can actually then use the broadcast app to reduce background noise so if i've got air conditioning fans or a loud partner but i think what's most impressive is what nvidia broadcast can do to your camera to the video let's start with background blur straight away i've got a really nice depth of field and i can adjust the strength here if i want that sort of bokeh blur to be even stronger and that's just the start i can also replace the background again if i enable it i've got my old techchap logo behind me so i can stay on brand or i can even remove the background completely finally we've got auto frame i can adjust the level of zoom here but it crops in a little bit and then it'll actually track my face we've got face tracking so if you want to give this a try yourself then i'll leave links below for everything you need from scan computers and also the nvidia broadcast app and then as i say for free you can do all this so no ultimate pc video would work without a bit of crisis can it play crisis obviously this is the remastered version we're getting about 39 40 fps uh roughly this is obviously a 4k maxed out can it play crisis settings so this is as intensive as you can get really outside of maybe flight simulator but actually i think more interesting is not just the performance but actually the temperature we've got the cpu at about 77 78 degrees but the gpu is 64 degrees celsius 65 which is actually remarkably low so i've got an all-core cpu overclock up to 5.1 gigahertz and a pretty decent gpu overclock as well meaning that in flight sim 2020 with ultra settings at 4k i'm getting about 46 frames per second in my standard landing challenge which is about 10 faster than i saw with my founders edition 3080 and that was actually paired with a more powerful i9 10 900k in fact across all the games i tested the overclock got me an extra 10 to 15 higher frame rates so it's well worth the effort now when it comes to liquid cooling obviously it's all about keeping temperatures low and from the off things look pretty promising at idle the cpu sits at just 31 degrees celsius so for a bit of context we actually ran the 3dmark time spy benchmark on this pc and then my other one with the founders edition 3080 and the asus tough 3080 of course there are other variables it's not an exact like for like pc but it'll give us an indication of temperatures and actually we found that the fans edition was averaging about 73 degrees celsius the tough card with the three fans uh was actually 64 celsius so quiet upgrading cooling it was quite a bit cooler whereas we measured this guy averaging 57 degrees celsius at stock so a little bit cooler than even the tough version of the 3080 and it means that you do have that little bit more headroom if you want to uh go crazy with your overclock in terms of sort of temperatures with firmark and prime95 running in parallel i saw 88 degrees celsius on the cpu after 30 minutes and 75 degrees celsius on the gpu though i did see some throttling of the cpu but it was in line with what i expect even without the oc i think my main criticism of this build though is that it can still get quite noisy even at idle what i find really interesting about this is it's not like a completely over the top pc i mean we've got 16 gigs of ram we've got the 3080 not 3090 but they also make sense for a gaming pc it's not wildly at the top but really this is kind of like the best sort of high-end gaming pc you could get with some very fancy cooling and a nice custom build paint job so this is gears tactics obviously and also gears 5 and loads of other games they're all available on the xbox game pass store which is kind of like a subscription surface and there's tons of games on there which you can play one thing that i would love for you guys to tell me is if you could have your perfect custom pc you can have like a machine cut water cooled super fancy pc of your own what game would you like to have it based around i'd love to see like a cyberpunk 2077 or even maybe a final fantasy 7 kind of set up i'd love to see that and also of course let me know what you think of this thing do you like the look of it let me know in the comments thank you so much for watching guys and if you do want to help me get to that one million subscriber mark i'm like this far away then don't forget to hit that little subscribe button below and i'll see you next time right here on the tape chat but for now i'm going to play a bit more gears tactics if i can work out how to play it i haven't been paying attention to the instructions
