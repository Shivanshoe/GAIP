hey guys i'm from the tech chap and this is the new msi prestige 14 evo so this time last year i was sat at a hotel bar in hawaii during qualcomm's tech summit i might add so i was doing some work but i was also reviewing the msi prestige 14. now as you can see this year is a little bit different it is currently raining outside on a very grey winter's day in the uk no hawaii vacation for tom sadly [Music] but the good news is that i do have the brand new msi prestige 14 eva with me here the late 2020 model uh and that she's had a pretty big upgrade although you wouldn't really know just by looking at it from the outside really this is a internal hardware refresh boasting one of intel's shiny new 11th gen tiger lake i7 chips which of course also comes with their much improved xc graphics we also get faster pcie 4 storage which is pretty impressive plus a couple of new thunderbolt 4 ports a faster uh s3 microsd card reader although i think full size sd would have been more helpful and all together the i7 chip with 16 gigs of ram and 512 storage it's a fairly impressive spec for the 1200 pound asking price especially when you consider that the similarly spec'd dell xps 13 here's what i made earlier will cost you the best part of 400 pounds extra for the same kind of spec 16 gigs 512 and the i7 so arguably the msi is actually quite good value for money but that's not all because this also has an extra little trick up its sleeve or the part we call the prestige sorry i had to get that in there somewhere but the i7 11 85 g7 we have in here is just one of three of the 11th gen chips that not only come with the new xc graphics but also the more powerful 12 to 28 watt tdp which means the i7 processor can scale and actually in performance mode running cinebench i measured a peak of 42.5 watts with an average of 31 over the 10-minute test and even more impressive is the similarly spec'd new dell xps 13 albeit with a slightly lower clocked version of the new i7 peaks at 36 and averages 21 in the same test 30 percent less power than the i7 in the prestige and so a higher average tdp means better performance and it can also sustain it for longer which i guess kind of makes this the tiger king tiger lake king you see what i'm trying to do there which on the one hand of course means the battery can drain faster on the prestige here although that is only in performance mode that you get that scaling up of the chips power and also of course if you're using it plugged in charging then it doesn't really matter but on the other hand it means we can potentially get much better performance from this even over similarly spec to 11th gen laptops so let's see if it makes a difference and here's my cinebench geekbench and tomb raider benchmark results side by side with the dell in multi-core and gaming the prestige is clearly faster which puts this in a bit of a weird category it's like a little bit faster than your typical 13 14 inch ultrabook but still not as fast as a normal sore 15 inch laptop with intel's h series 45 watt chips and maybe even a dedicated graphics card so it's kind of on the edge of two different categories but this still packs a punch in fortnite with high settings at 1080p i'm averaging 43fps definitely playable albeit a bit jittery the demanding shadow of the two meter same settings scored 24 frames per second and finally in rainbow six siege we're looking at 74 fps so actually if you drop two medium settings generally speaking you can get away with some moderate 1080p gaming on this not bad at all given it's just using the integrated xc graphics chip which from my tests a few weeks back when i had a quick hands-on with this laptop i measured to be about twice as fast as last year's laptops with 10th gen chips and in my tests they easily handle photo editing and lightroom and even basic 4k video editing in premiere pro so performance is impressive from this thing but i have to say just using it i have noticed quite a few sort of slow downs and stutters just in everyday use sometimes it's as smooth as butter but then other times even just tapping the windows button to bring up the search menu takes a second maybe going into a chrome tab just sort of pauses it feels kind of like maybe the processor is just scaling up and down a lot and so we're getting some inconsistent performance i'm hoping that maybe software or driver updates will smooth things out though because there's just a few too many hiccups than i would expect for this kind of laptop not only that though but the extra boost in processor performance comes with a couple of compromises anything other than just the lightest of tasks like browsing the web or watching youtube and the fan will start to kick in and actually get annoyingly loud plus under load it does get quite warm to the touch i measured a peak surface temperature of 43 degrees celsius battery life also isn't that impressive i ran a youtube battery test overnight with brightness set to 50 in battery saver mode and also using the edge browser and it managed just over seven hours of video playback and actually with a few chrome tabs open and maybe a bit of lightroom in the background i'm getting maybe four to five hours generally on the upside it does charge pretty quickly i managed to get 47 of my battery in just half an hour now here's a question for you guys if i bring back my uh dell xps 13 again honestly i'm not sponsored by dell i promise i just think these are kind of like the standard go-to benchmark of windows laptops currently what do you think about 16x9 versus 16x10 personally i think the slightly taller aspect ratio on the new dells and also you know laptops like the macbook is much nicer to use it feels less sort of claustrophobic especially on a 13 inch screen or 14 inch on the case of the prestige so while this is obviously quite a bit bigger i do wish that msi would maybe transition to that 16 by 10 but let me know which you prefer in the comments below so with the prestige we're getting a 14 inch matte 1080p non-touch display and overall it's a pretty good screen color accuracy is decent hitting 99 srgb 77 adobe rgb and 78 dc ip3 but it is definitely lacking in the brightness department i measured a below average 280 nits peak and it doesn't support any kind of hdr in terms of design well not much has really changed from last year except for msi's new logo here this is a i forget the exact name of the color but it's basically a gray like a slate gray with this quite nice blue little glossy accent around the edge on the outside and also around the trackpad as you can see famous for the prestige series as we open the lid up the keyboard also lifts up by up to five degrees which gives you a slightly more comfortable typing position i do quite like it and also of course better airflow if you look at the bottom here we've got this big air vent for the fans so that obviously helps to try and keep it cool while you're using that more powerful chip we get quite nice thin bezels around the three edges here although quite a big chin at the bottom although that's slightly obscured by the keyboard as it rises up the keyboard itself is backlit it's nicely spaced out and we get good travel with the keys i like it and the extra wide precision touch pad is responsive although the click is a little bit inconsistent it's harder to press higher up on the touchpad and at the bottom in the corners it's a little too easy to press in and feels like you can almost get your fingers under the edge of it it's all fine but just not exactly premium we do get a fingerprint reader though although it's not built into the power button or anything plus there's an ir camera next to the webcam for face unlocking the whole thing is impressively lightweight though for its size it's about 1.29 kilograms i say about i looked at the spec before i filmed this 1.29 kilograms which is 2.84 pounds i believe uh so it is nice and compact you won't really feel this putting it in your backpack or your suitcase it's a pretty compact machine especially given the specs of this as well so it's a good travel companion but i have to say the build quality just isn't up there with other premium laptops the chassis feels a little bit cheap and squeaky in places and when i plug it into charge i notice a slight buzzing coming from the inside none of which are a deal breaker it just takes the sheen off a little bit so the question is should you buy the new msi prestige 14 evo uh the evo name by the way uh kind of reflecting the intel branding uh which is built on project athena you may have heard of from last year basically evo is a certain spec a certain benchmark of laptop that comes with their latest chips uh thunderbolt support wi-fi six quick wake fast storage those kind of things and when you check enough of those boxes then uh you can slap on this little intel evo uh logo down here so the prestige 14 is a good laptop and for 1200 pounds i think it's decent value for money but for my money i'd prefer a dell xps 13 or a macbook air and one but as always that's just me but what about you guys would you be tempted to buy the prestige 14 do you like the look of it do you think the design and also that extra scalable cpu is sort of a selling point or just like a whatever you know if you want the extra performance go for a 15-inch laptop anyway let me know what you make of this in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you did enjoy the video don't forget to hit
