all right i think we are good to go hey guys i'm tom the tech champ and this is a camera comparison between the iphone 13 pro max and the brand new s22 ultra so i thought i'd start with a little video side by side these are being shot at 4k 30 and you can also hear my voice as i switch between the microphones so you can have an idea of the sort of video quality also the stabilization as i'm walking along here and i figured i'd show you around this is actually wells cathedral the smallest city in england and it's got a ton of old stuff then there is this place which is actually the oldest still standing medieval street in europe i believe cobalt steps here so putting that stabilization to the test it's funny when my wife sarah moved here from the us she thought everything looked like it was straight out of harry potter which i guess the cat does there is even a castle with a bridge and a moat which usually has some swans in although i can't see them at the moment because you may also know that this is where they filmed hot fuzz and those swans 15 years later continue to be hilarious for the local constabulary so uh two foot tall um long slender neck yeah uh-huh look found him and this is why you need a good zoom lens for when you're swan spotting so that is the maximum zoom for 4k video nine times on the iphone 20 times on the s22 ultra but realistically i think the most you want to go is 10 on video [Music] okay hopefully that doesn't fall over but they both do have a few tricks up their sleeve for example the samsung can shoot in 8k ak 24 fps still not 30 for some reason uh whereas you're obviously topping out 4k 60 on the iphone although i don't know how many people really shoot in 8k or want to uh we also of course have that 10 times telephoto lens as well but then on the iphone you can shoot in pro res uh at 4k 30 or 10 tb60 and particularly in low light it does noticeably reduce the noise obviously it whacks up the file size hugely and because of that landing port it can be a bit tricky actually taking it off the phone most of the time i use airdrop and try and keep the clips shorter but certainly that does increase the quality one thing they both have now is a video portrait mode so let's turn that on oh like magic i have been very impressed with the cinematic mode actually i think the separation between the subject me and the background has been pretty good of course you are limited to 1080p 30 you know 4k and no even 24fps option which is the cinematic frame rate which is a bit bizarre you can of course change the aperture that bokeh effect on the iphone before or after you shoot it's currently i think f4 so a little less severe to be fair though i'm not really sure how often people actually use this kind of mode i'll tell you what is quite popular though taking photos so let's switch over to the lovely and ever so subjective world of photography so we have three camera lenses on the iphone and four on the s22 ultra they both have an ultra wide a main and a three times optical zoom telephoto with the s22's extra lens giving us a stalkery ten times optical which is actually quite usable even up to 30 times and you can still go nuts up to a hundred times aka space zoom which is both impressive and still a bit useless i mean fair play for a phone handheld it is pretty good but realistically i found it a lot more useful for checking train times or reading text at a long distance it can come in handy just don't be weird but i do think for the sheer versatility of having that extra 10 times zoom point to samsung however at the other end of the spectrum both phones do have a macro mode and while they both do a good job the iphone does have a shorter focal length so you can get even closer so that's a macro point to apple now one request i get a lot in these camera comparisons is to test the camera with moving subjects not just me with a cup of tea in my hand for some reason and so here is sylvie usually the antithesis of a fast-moving object but i managed to catch a couple of her yawns and in this first shot the s22 has nailed the focus with the iphone looking a little softer but then in my second shot they're both nicely in focus although again you can see that difference in the field of view there's a lot more in the frame on the samsung back outside i decided to scare off a few pigeons although the first thing you notice is the iphone gives us a much brighter photo but it has kind of overexposed the pigeons a little bit so i did manage to get a few in-flight shots this is not scientific by any stretch but i think the samsung just edges out in front and finally meet lex i wish he was my dog but he did let me take a few photos and there was a stark difference between the phones now i'll tell you i always use a microfiber cloth on the cameras before each shot but the iphone just looks washed out and flat the s22 is arguably too contrasty and we do lose some detail in the darker areas so perhaps the iphone is better for editing in post but when lex's owner asks me to send her photos of the dog i send the samsungs alright so back to me with my cup of tea and let's look at some portrait mode shots and the good news is both phones let you tinker and adjust the bokeh after you've taken the photo and you can also play around with various lighting options which all look kind of bad if you follow me on instagram at the tech chat by the way you'll see me post this portrait shot and as you can see there is a big difference in the contrast the color tone although zooming in you can see the iphone's edges are a bit softer the s22 can pick up individual hairs which is pretty crazy although i do like how the iphone introduces the bokeh that blur on my right shoulder as it is further away from the camera like you'd see on a proper dslr but despite that i've gotta go with the s22 on this one now just quickly for the sake of continuity of this video and why i suddenly have shorter hair later on i did get my hair cut today with a number four on the back and sides and a little scissor trim on the top if you're wondering on any new phone though one of the first things i download is surfsharkvpn who are very kindly sponsoring this video and who are my go-to vpn buddies because there are so many to choose from but for me it's the fact that there's an app for pretty much everything every phone tablet pc even web browser also just one account lets you use an unlimited number of devices which is very handy for me plus it's just really simple to use and it works so i use surfsharkvpn to get around region locked streaming websites like netflix and hulu but also crucially to stay safe online as their clean web tool helps to prevent tracking malware ads all those nasty things but the best bit is if you click the link below or enter the code tech chat at the checkout then you can get a whopping 83 off and three months extra for free plus there's a 30-day money-back guarantee so why not give surf shark vpn a try today or tomorrow whenever it's convenient for you but i do urge you to give it a try okay sun's down cameras out let's see what these can do at night and the first question i had is do we get lens flare and the answer is yes on both with the star burst of the lamps and the little green lens flares although it is a bit more prominent on the iphone in fact let me show you some 4k video i shot on both phones and you can see how the lights react in real time hey sarah hi which one of these phones would you take if you had to pick one neither why i got a pizza damn it should have included a pixel good answer so they both pick up some lens flares although it is more obvious on the iphone and so perhaps that new clear glass on the s22's main lens is helping but more importantly the iphone stabilization is doing a much better job than the s22 where you can really feel each step as it vibrates i know my friend supersaf had a similar experience and this may need a software update but to be fair samsung hasn't mentioned anything to us or asked us to wait so fingers crossed it gets improved and keep an eye on my pinned comments below as i will update it if anything changes now the big difference for low light photos is the color and the white balance and actually i do prefer the s22 here we still see the white of the lights in the middle but that doesn't overwhelm the entire shot and it naturally fades back to the realistic orangy tones that are coming from the nearby street lights they've both done a good job here although the iphone is a little washed out by the lights and we're losing some of that contrast but the s22's white balance trips up here with an unnatural yellow tone to the whole photo now while the s22 is a little oversaturated particularly on sarah's face the colors particularly in the background are more true to life the iphone perhaps aesthetically looks nice but the ultra white balance is over compensating for the tungsten ambient light it's the same story with me you look at the color of the lapels on my jacket and my face again it's definitely a bit too saturated on the s22 but the iphone goes too far the other way and also the samsung is more detailed and that flat overexposed iphone look sometimes just doesn't look good okay back in the studio now and i'm really impressed here how the s22 handles the dynamic range particularly on my neon sign and in fact the whole photo looks cleaner and sharper the iphone can still look good but if we zoom into marty's face you can see there is more detail on the samsung although the iphone does get a point here as the color is spot on the s22 is too blue and also some of the detail can be lost in those darker shadows even with a three time zoom portrait shot you can really see that field of view and focal length differences looking at my face and my eyes though the s22 packs in a ton more detail the thing is though even if the s22 is overtaking the iphone sometimes the 13 pro just hits right with that flatter exposure and warmer tone so we get a more pleasing instagramable photo if you like what do you think low light selfie video this time still at 4k30 although not in pro res on the iphone which you do have the option of which would even increase the quality further what do you think though this is going to be a bit of a analog for say if i had a social life and i was outside at a pub maybe and recording a drunken selfie on the way home let's change the lighting up looks like i've got a wider field of view on the iphone which is very useful for selfies i do like though that both phones have a little green light next to where the camera is so you always know where to look when are you taking a selfie so the iphone 13 series didn't really upgrade the selfie camera but i have found the s22 is quite a big improvement over the s21 even though they share similar hardware and so here the samsung is noticeably more detailed even in portrait mode the skin tones the contrast the detail the iphone just keeps coming out too soft it's not bad but i hope we do see some improvements on the 14 series later this year so the big question which is best well the iphone is generally brighter warmer and flatter subjectively it may look more instagram ready but it's not always the most realistic it does take better macro shots and also switching lenses while filming is still more seamless plus its cinematic mode pro res support and stabilization i think give the iphone the win for video and sometimes i do just like how the iphone takes photos but that is very subjective now comparatively the s22 ultra is darker with heavier contrast and shadows it does have a wider field of view so you get more in the frame and shots are often more detailed plus that extra 10 times telephoto makes it the zoom king and together with more camera modes including the pro mode if you want to tinker the option to shoot at the full 108 megapixels or even record 8k video the s22 is more versatile i also found the microphone to be a touch cleaner with better background noise reduction the selfie camera is sharper and it's also good to see that social media apps can now take advantage of the s22's camera features so it is a tough one i think realistically which one you go for is going to come down to the ecosystem whether you have an ipad an apple watch or a mac you know even if the camera is better on this the ecosystem's going to sell it for you on this but in terms of just the cameras well i'm lucky enough that i get to have both and carry both around with me but if i could only take one i know most youtubers tend to just sit on the fence here and i'm tempted to because they are both extremely good phones and cameras you really can't go wrong with either but if i had to just take one with me i would go with the s22 ultra it's just a bit more versatile and i think it's a pretty solid upgrade even over last year's s21 ultra but more importantly what do you think which phone came out on top in the camera department let me know in the comments below and also if you did enjoy the video a little like and subscribe and also that uh what do you call it the bell icon thing because i think only about 15 of you lovely subscribers actually get notified when i post a new video so make sure that's checked as well that little ding-a-ling bell i'll also leave links in the description below if you fancy buying one of these and actually right now through my affiliate link i think you can get some samsung credit if you buy one of these which is very tasty and i will see you next time right here on the tech chat thanks for watching oh and also don't forget to check out
