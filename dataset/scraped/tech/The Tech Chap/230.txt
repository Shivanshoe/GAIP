[Music] hey guys Anton the tech chap and this video is gonna be a little bit different because I have about three hours with this laptop until a very nice man comes and suddenly takes it away from me this is the definition of a quick hands on although not in New York where I'd usually be four aces big global press conference which they do every year where they announce their new products including the Swift five you know the new Triton Helios gaming laptops and their Ryan desktops but in this weird coronavirus world we live in they vote kindly shipped to me for about two or three hours and there's actually nothing I can do because it's locked into airplane mode and the reason for that is this is gonna come with Intel's next-gen processors which I'm not to talk about and even if you dive into the computer management settings all it says is unnamed chip or the Intel zero zero zero zero Who am I kidding you guys know this is gonna have you know the one that comes after the tenth James whatever that might be called so that's pretty interesting by itself but as well as that you'll also get a spec the Swift five with an NVIDIA MX 350 graphics chip which combined actually makes it pretty powerful and when you consider that the real headline the key sign point of a swift series is the weight or the lack of it I mean this guy weighs just 990 grams it's a sub kilogram 14-inch laptop so considering just how light and compact this is paired with those pretty beefy specs actually this is gonna be one to look out for but as well as the new processors and also the new graphics chip we've also had a bit of a redesign on the Swift 5 most notably the bezels they've really really shrunk the bezels now so it looks a lot more modern than the previous Swift live so it's still a fourteen inch full HD touchscreen but now we have these thinner bezels we get slightly higher screen to body ratio so it's just a little bit more compact overall we also now get Gorilla Glass on the screen so it's a little more durable plus we get these glossy bezels which are flush with the screen rather than the chunky plastic ones from before so it looks a lot smarter you'll also notice this new color which I can't quite put my finger on it's kind of like a slates green I really like the blue of the old Swift five I'm not sure if I do prefer this or not but it's suddenly different what color do you think that is it's definitely like a gray green hint to it a little bit slate another new feature is that when you open it up the keyboard actually lifts slightly so you get a more ergonomic typing position but more importantly you get better airflow underneath so if you are pairing this with a next-gen i7 and the 350 chip you're gonna want some better cooling so that's quite a smart design and it also hides a little bit of the bottom bezel elsewhere everything is pretty similar we still have full size HDMI along with the USBA and the USBC Thunderbolt 3 port which is nice to see on the other side we have another USB a Kensington lock and the headphone jack now one thing that slowly frustrates me is that we still have this DC power it would have been nice to see us PC charging on this I mean even my new Dell XPS 15 with a gtx 1650 can be charged via us PC so that would have been nice but it's not the end of the world the chassis itself is still using this lithium magnesium aluminium I believe that's right material so it feels a little plastic you know but it's not too bad and of course importantly it does keep the weight down as I say it sub 1 kilogram seriously if you've never picked up a swift v it just feels like the battery is missing or something it's still reasonably well built but yeah it's incredibly lightweight and this died seriously when I took this on the box it had about 8% of the battery left which is not ideal when you have three hours with it so I appreciate this has been a pretty quick hands-on but to sum up the new features are the thinner bezels gorilla glass screen the fact that it now lifts up to give better cooling in a better typing position we get this new slate agree gray color and also a big spec bump inside with irreverent Intel processors and up to the MX 350 graphics chip nothing new as far as I know in terms of the battery or the keyboard a touchpad we still have this fingerprint reader here as well although that does look like we've got a couple of microphones up here now so maybe they've improved the audio quality of the webcam so a slight design refresh more powerful hardware and still in this same super lightweight chassis that's pretty much it for the new 22 the asus swift 5 in terms of pricing asa tell me it's gonna start from 1100 euros so that's probably gonna be a thousand pounds and I'll be coming out around September or October on finally I did ask and there's currently no news on an AMD version of this all they're talking about now is the unnamed Intel chip it would have been good to see maybe the next-gen AMD processor in here but for now we'll wait and see what Intel can offer with their 11 current processes thank you so much for watching guys let me know what you think I'll be swift 5 and also this kind of interesting new color and don't forget to hit that subscribe button and stay tuned for my full review well as soon as I can I don't think this quite counts as a review since it's locked into airplane mode and I've had it for about two and half hours thanks for watching and see you next time
