hey guys Anton a tech chap and I have two brand-new Samsung Galaxy S 20s here the only difference well aside from the color is one uses a qualcomm snapdragon 865 and the other Samsung's own Exynos 990 chip blue the Snapdragon and pink 4x nos so once and for all I want to find out if there's a real difference in terms of performance battery life and also the cameras so let's get into it if you do enjoy the video guys it'd be amazing if you could give me a little thumbs up below first of all let's compare performance starting with a couple of benchmarks and in Geekbench 5 while single core results were pretty neck-and-neck actually the snapdragon was 18% faster in multi-core but what about graphics while jumping over to 3d mark and winning the slingshot Xtreme benchmark actually before we even get to the results you can see a real difference in framerate so after the first test the Snapdragon was 8 percent faster Ivan ran into second and a third time straight afterwards and in both cases the Snapdragon was 25% faster now after these benchmarks jumping over to antutu to look at the temperatures and the Exynos is around 15 degrees hotter than the Snapdragon so this is shadow gun wargames and if I use the game pen chapter measure the performance of the phone in real time you can see with the X nos at the top right I'm getting 52 fps as the median average but then if I bring in a Snapdragon version you can see it's locked to 60 that's at least a 20% gain over the eggs nose and even with the higher FPS we can also see the average CPU load is low on the Snapdragon we can't compare GPU low because the X naught is have support it within a game bench but the amount of memory used is pretty similar but what does all that mean in the real world well firstly with the Snapdragon you'll get slightly higher frame rates in games particularly more demanding ones and with the latest flagship phones offering 90-120 even 144 hurt screens to take full advantage of that you'll need to get 90 120 or 144 FPS in games something the Snapdragon will more easily achieve and just as importantly over longer play sessions the X nos will total more quickly so when it comes to gaming it's pretty clear card the Snapdragon is the better chip but what about sort of just general real-world use well I set the phones up for a little speed test fresh restart all the app have been close same settings so let's see which one comes first in this little app launching challenge all right so one minute 26 for the Snapdragon 820 and then finally one minute 45 for the X knots so altogether the Snapdragon was 22% faster so we've established the Snapdragon is faster and also it stays cooler throughout now before we test the battery in camera a big thing it is surf shark VPN who are tightly sponsoring this video now obviously I'm not doing any traveling in the moment where I would usually use surf shark on my phone or laptop to browse the web safely safe internet banking or if I'm logging into a web site but even at home here in the UK while it's handy for watching you know American Netflix and Hulu it still keeps my browsing safe and prevents ads trackers malware and

recommend it give it a try next up battery life which one lasts longer well with both phones identically set up let's do an intensive real-world battery test of gaming watching videos checking socials shooting some 4k video using Google Maps with data the usual stuff that you and I might do but non-stop until one of them dies at 9:45 a.m. both phones were fully charged and ready to go and after the first hour of YouTube there wasn't much in it then following an era of gaming we do start to see the X nos fall behind a little bit but not by much two hours later the snapdragon is definitely in the lead the 6% more battery and by the end 6 hours and 10 minutes after we started the X nos version finally gives up leaving the Snapdragon as the winner with 13% still remaining which depending on your usage could be good for another hour so two wins for the Snapdragon so far but for the third and final test I want to compare the cameras see if there's any real difference in photo quality so using my once a day lockdown exercise walk I took a bunch of pictures side by side but I want you to get involved with this one so we've got camera a and camera B and I reveal which is which at the end but before that I want you to look closely see which one you think takes better photos and then vote in the poll [Music] [Music] all right guys so what do you think voting the poll at the top right and choose a or b all done okay well I can reveal a is the X naught and B is the snapdragon let me know in the comments if you guess which was which but to be clear none of these photos have been edited or changed in any way they're all fresh out of the phones but why is it different I mean they have the same sensors lenses megapixels and all that stuff well all comes down to the ISP or the image signal processor which are built into the chips worth the Snapdragon or the Exynos the ISP as it kind of says on the 10 does all the processing so exposure colors noise AI tweaks it's the brains of the camera and it seems the snapdragons camera brain is just smarter okay so we've established the Snapdragon version is on average 22 percent faster than the X nos in my intensive real-world battery test this still had 13% of his battery left and in the camera Department there was a noticeable difference in terms of quality when it came to exposure and noise particularly in low-light shots and when using night mode so across the board the Snapdragon is clearly the better chip and I have to say it's actually kind of frustrating that you know here in the UK and Europe and in other regions we are essentially getting an inferior product even though we're paying you know relatively the same amount of money unfortunately we don't really have much choice aside from maybe importing one from North America South America or Japan where you get the Qualcomm models although amazingly there is actually a petition that's been set off asking Samsung to use Snapdragon chips globally so why don't they well I think the simple answer is because Samsung make the X not chips that is obviously cheaper for them than buying Qualcomm's products plus they can sell a cheaper version without 5g in some markets but whatever the reason it is kind of disappointing I really do hope that Samsung maybe invests a little bit more in the quality of the X dot chips so they are more comparable with the snapdragon if you're gonna call both of these the galaxy s 20 and as I say charge the same kind of money relative to you know the local currency they should be the same product but they clearly not battery life performance camera quality across the board while it's not always a night and day difference the Xbox version simply isn't as good and this has been going on for years for Samsung phones for my American friends who are lucky enough to get these Samsung phones with the Qualcomm chip all I can say is damn you I'm jealous although in the great scheme of you know first world problems I think this does rank fairly highly to be fair these are still both great phones what do you reckon is this a big deal am I just complaining about nothing or are we being shortchanged let me know what you think of the Qualcomm versus X nos debate in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you do want to see more for me make sure you hit that little subscribe button below and once
