[Music] all right here we are in the studio it is almost done it's built and we have decorated it and there's furniture and there is a pete and a james but it's a work in progress but i thought i'd give you guys a bit of a tour show you what's what's going on how i work firstly this is my brother pete you may have seen him before you're a producer i am yeah like i write your scripts and stuff you'll film them i edit it he also makes me tea and cleans up so senior janitor barb's the 360. that's me hello i'm behind the camera james is a incredibly professional cameraman and editor and videographer and no pressure and yeah so if there's any flaws in this video you can blame him blame him for that and if there's any editing issues it might be pete nothing's ever my fault but yeah this is definitely an upgrade from where we were with uh what dad's dining room yeah when you started out he was just living at dad's house yeah working out of his dining room trying to avoid his uh floral curtains and my mum's cushion oh my god yeah but then you got an upgrade to his bedroom yeah he moved out of his master bedroom his his main bedroom and let us film in there and we still use it as a studio actually so yeah if you watch anything of your older stuff it's all filmed i think it's disguised quite well actually a lot of credit for the whole tech chat goes to our dad actually chris so um i don't think we've ever probably said thank you to him for that but yeah he's been the most supportive person in the entire world but now we're here we have our own space which is good and it took what four months to make [Music] so tomorrow morning work starts to completely transform this into a new studio slash office thing doors are coming off windows are going in a new door at the back flooring acoustic paneling vaulting the entire ceiling so this is gonna be gone it's gonna take about two months but i'm very excited i had a great company called homark who came in and did all this i would love to say i made this myself james is actually a fantastic home builder and i think wait why didn't you do this for me you could've done this i could have you didn't ask me you're building your own home at the same time take credit for it deal deal yeah so homework came in and they gutted it everything was taken out it's really opened up the space we've got these lovely windows in now kept these beams which are absolutely beautiful they really add a bit of sort of character to the place because that's one of the problems like you can make a studio you can rent a unit you can you know anyone can do that but it can all look a bit basic and a bit officey and that's something we wanted to avoid still a work in progress obviously we're trying to make this our own there's a lot we want to put on the wall what do you think maybe a massive the tech chat neon sign like pccentric has or something what do you reckon maybe what do you guys think if you've got any thoughts actually any feedback or suggestions about how we can make this space a bit better and a bit more personal then you know let me know in the comments below but very proud of this nice brick wall real bricks not just your crappy laminate stuff that took a lot of time and money you've got the tech chat blue wall which you may recognize from the old studio uh we had that color match because they don't actually sell the same paint anymore acoustics aren't too bad now when they finished the actual construction it was so echo in here ridiculously echoey i even paid extra for some fancy underfloor and uh wall insulation which was like acoustic insulation didn't make any difference at all so what has helped and is hiding behind pete actually we've got these fantastic acoustic panels i'll leave a link in the description below and they've made such a difference so generally this is my setup now so i'll talk not at peak pete wouldn't be there sometimes and we'll have the camera there i've got the uh aputure light there that's the c300 d2 got another one over here that's the older c120d2 actually i've got the big umbrella as well the big dome for that in here got my little locker this is where if pete or james have done anything wrong i had to put them in here for a few hours so they learn their lesson but a bit of storage in there but i didn't actually have room despite this new space room for this whole dome to go up here as well in fact i'm going to show you something really horrible do you see the worst thing about this whole setup ignore my horrible shadows look what i'm covering with this acoustic panel don't judge me [Laughter] but that's fine because that that oh no that goes there smoke and mirrors nothing is as it seems i have collected a few bits and pieces over the years a uh keanu reeves cyberpunk doll figure it's not a toy and never take this out of the box one day it'll be worth something maybe in 2077. actually look at this though my brother pete bought this for me for my birthday recently turbo mandal i'm trying to find a turtleman door if you've not seen jingle all the way then this will be really weird it'll still be weird even if you have i want to talk about this standing desks so obviously selling desks aren't new to most people but they are to me and they're the best thing ever so this was actually sent over from the guys over at flexispot it is a ceno desk it's actually the biggest top they make i think it's 70 by 160 or something i basically wanted to replicate a nice wide desk for i can do product shots but also film on and obviously being a standing desk you can adjust it you can also pre-program a couple of heights to it so you can just come in in the morning and if i'm going to do some standing work or you know present make my videos like this i can bring it up to a certain level if i want to sit down new desk it's very cool actually lovely bit of kit really really solid weighs an absolute ton took me maybe 20 minutes to put it together or something but it's just really added to that sort of flexibility of how we work because with that desk i have found i'm a lot more productive so generally what i do now i've got these new macbooks as well i was normally just sort of restricted to this pc setup where i've got my desktop but now with the new macbook pro 16s and 14s you can get the 100 performance off battery i don't have to plug it in it's just a nice little break away from sitting at a desk which is really nice so i will leave a link to this in the description below if you want to check out the flexi spot desk you can actually get loads of different colors on the top black black brown white woods you can also get matching legs little under cable runners as well so you can really customize it to how you like definitely recommend it it really does make a difference just to how energetic you feel you know you'd have to be sat down all the time but if you do want to sit down got a couple of options and actually i want to tell you about them because what we've got one two three four five chairs in here for a maximum of three people which is doesn't make a lot of sense but if you were wondering what does tom the tech chap sit on all day one of those big questions this guy first probably we've got this hummer miller chair a little bit pricey very pricey but it is so comfortable and also looks pretty good as well it's they teamed up with logitech so it is the hammer miller logitech m-body gaming chair i don't know what really makes it gaming except it has this like cyber punky blue color to it it does look pretty cool incredibly comfortable and also very very adjustable in sort of every which way you'd want so definitely recommend these again i'll leave a link below if you fancy it if they are a little bit too pricey though get one of these guys this is a noble chair uh from my good friend stephen levitt who basically made them what they are today noble chairs i've had these for years my black leather one over there and this guy is the noble chairs icon this is actually really interesting it's a brand new fabric-y one so unlike the leather ones which i found got a bit sticky sometimes when i'm sort of sat here all day and my back gets a bit sweaty this is actually really nice we'll see how it lasts over time but yeah not too expensive actually and the fabric is really nice again nice and uh nice and adjustable it means after a hard day of youtubing i can just you know take a step back i enjoy this is how this is usually the setup where i'm i'm leaning back and everyone else is working furniture in here is all a bit slap dash i'm not an interior designer you'll be surprised to hear various things i've bought from dunelm and may.com and amazon and ikea it's all as i say a work in progress i had actually this nice little desk made from a guy over at etsy and one of the things i really wanted to do with this space was keep it modular and keep it sort of flexible so you can sort of shoot from almost any angle which is what we wanted not just this is the set this is where we can shoot and so being able to sort of drag desks a little bit hopefully don't scratch the floor doing that and actually being able to just shoot upwards and have a bit of sort of verticality to the space and also because we've left the ceiling white uh we can actually use it as a bit of a bounce so we've got this aperture pointing upwards as my glorious assistant my glamorous assistant turns around and actually gives us a very scary dragon shadow going on there from this msi little dragon this is the best thing ever here's a chunky little msi dragon this i don't know what i'm gonna do with it but it looks quite good there actually while i'm here this is kind of kind of nice i met my wife sarah through youtube she got in touch and was asking some tech advice about phone still got the original galaxy s9 plus that uh she was asking me questions about that's very cool so uh yeah if nothing else i met my wife through youtube yeah this little little behind the scenes on on me there where were we let's talk about other things that aren't me one thing i have sort of figured out as i've been trying to improve these videos over time which hopefully hopefully fingers crossed you've been able to see the progress there's having a big old reflector thing so maybe that's maybe that's made it better but actually just being able to balance lights off this or more importantly uh when we're shooting b-roll uh stick it in front of windows or you know in overhead it removes a reflection so you don't get those horrible well reflections so a bit ugly and nowhere to store it and i think you can collapse it down but i've not figured it out we'll come back to that later we'll leave that like that that looks good there so this is um well what is this it is my new vertical camera mount and it's the best thing since sliced bread i actually got some advice from my friend andy ruffel at e-technics who bought something very similar to this because i can mount my camera on the end of this pole so what i can do is get this sort of overhead my desk so i can get some nice sort of vertical shots and with this little ball head mount on here i get flexibility with the camera so it's actually just being able to shoot upside down left to right vertical shots this is such a good bit of kit you can spend tons of money on cameras and lighting but being able to have the flexibility of shooting with something like this bit slap dash as you can see we're still figuring everything out and i almost poked myself in the eye with this the other day but again i'll leave a link below if you fancy checking one of these out so this is the usual setup that you might be familiar with if you watch my videos we've got the backdrop there that nice sort of bokeh background and actually having that depth of field i think really adds to the sort of quality of the video and for video as i say we are actually using these guys sony a7s 3s that is secure 787s3 uh we often have a monitor on top as well so we can see what we're doing a bunch of sony lenses most recent one i bought actually was this guy it's the sony 24-105 so we can zoom in a little bit for audio uh rode lavalier mic plugged into a task camera quality in my pocket every time so not necessarily the most professional setup but it works for me and i take the micro sd out here sdr here and then edit it together on my pc so in this guy my pride and joy if i get my duff beer cup out the way this has got an rtx 1390 we've got an amd r9 5950x 64 gigs of ram it's a bit of a beast but i have to be honest aside from gaming over the last few weeks i've just been plugging in my macbook pro which is crazy i mean this is still very expensive and actually not that much less than this was to be honest although gpu prices are still crazy but i can just plug in my thunderbolt port which also charges it of course and i can just edit straight off the mac it's really really nice and i don't have to make proxies even though we shoot in 4k 10-bit h264 which is a horrible codec but it's just buttery smooth on this so if you are a video editor i highly highly recommend getting a macbook pro 14 or 16. but of course no setup will be complete without a good bit of philips hue so i've got the light strip behind my desk i am going to put a gradient strip on behind the tv soon and also uh got a few of the bits and pieces coming so definitely recommend phillips hue they are kind of expensive but you can just kind of add to it over time and it's kind of fun if i black out all the blinds and then put the lights to green or red or blue or something it gives you a really nice kind of atmosphere and in this corner we have the living room it's um actually pretty useful to be able to test tvs so actually i didn't wall mount this another one behind you there on the floor storage is still a bit of an issue in here uh but this is a really nice little you know chill area for playing some games we've got uh this sky glass tv this is a 65-inch sky glass definitely an interesting proposition not enough shorts for everyone but i did a review of this recently ps5 got the series x in there i think actually and recently i've been playing a bit of vanguard also forza horizon 5. that looks insane on this and while actually the sound quality on the skyglass is very good i do have a sonos arc down here as well normally that will go up here but just well didn't work for this setup but hopefully we'll be doing more tv reviews and tv versus videos on the tech chat channel because i can more easily get them in and out of here it looks a bit more professional and uh yeah they're just fun to do so stay tuned for more of those we are the borg resistance is futile obviously having some good testing equipment helps this is a laser thermometer we've got a lux meter for measuring lux brightness on things uh also color accuracy on monitors and screens so hopefully you know i do my research for my videos and we do a lot of testing but all together i mean this is one of the most sort of proudest moments of my life getting this 1 million subscriber plaque i love what i do i'm extremely privileged and lucky to be able to be a youtuber creator person for a living but it is a full-time job i work many long hours and many long days we all do james included in pete as well of course but it's a labor of love and hopefully this space will just give us a bit more room literally to to improve our game to be more creative and uh improve the quality of things so do stick around hopefully you see some improvements going forward as well and if you've got any suggestions about what we can do with this space let me know in the comments below if you haven't already subscribed as well although i guess if you've watched this entire video chances are you already have but a cheeky like and subscribe will be very much appreciated and stay tuned for a whole lot more on the tech chat thanks for watching all right james back to work now for this waffling no seriously james back to work
