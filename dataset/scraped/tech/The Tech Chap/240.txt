hey guys Anton the tech [ __ ] and I've got some goodies here Intel have very kindly sent me over a review sample of the new 10th generation processes we i9 this is the top dog 10900 k it's a ten core 20 thread 5.3 gigahertz turbo boost processor and also inte R calling it the world's fastest gaming CPU which is something we'll be testing in a minute so we've got the new chips but as well as that we've also got a dinosaur which I just so happen to throw in here because it's my nephew's birthday happy birthday Oliver your three and this is what's yours but for now I'm gonna keep that there I might end up keeping that myself but as well as that we also have a new motherboard because as you probably know the temperature in chips require the new LGA 1200 socket so we've got a Zed 419 here from a soos the origin Maximus 12 extreme which is a bit of a beast actually but the question I have is how does intel's ten nine hundred k compare to AMD's 3900 X which is a 12 quart 24 thread processor they were in the same sort of ballpark for price or at least it was until AMD cut the price this week it's now down to about 410 pounds or 420 dollars for the 3900 X which is a good 120 less than Intel's 10 900 case so it's even better value for money but I want to stick with this video anyway not least because I've put about a week's worth of work into it but it's still an interesting comparison between the two because they're the closest in terms of core and thread count and in terms of launch pricing at least they are competitive but things are getting even more complicated because I've seen rumors that AMD are about to announce 3 new updated CPUs for release in July the 3600 XT 3800 XT and the 3900 XT with 5 to 10% improved performance thanks to increase clock speeds and better overclocking which if true could really put the squeeze on Intel anyway getting back to the 10 100 K for the moment now Intel claimed this is the world's fastest gaming CPU well it's still based on their kind of prehistoric 14 nanometer process so to counter aim DS efficient third gen Rison parts Intel have instead opted clock speeds to a potential 5.3 gigahertz on one or two cores out of the box which they've managed by increasing the chip TDP to 125 watts while also improving the heat spreader to try and limit he ish interestingly the chip can also detect the two best performing cores which will then boost up to five point three gigahertz but as well seeing the results hitting five point three is one thing staying there is another all right let's get to the testing and I'll be comparing it versus my old eye nine 9900 case or the previous gen flagship Intel processor and also the AMD 3900 X and across the board I'm using the same cooling the same nvidia RT x 20 80 TI graphics card 32 gigs of ram and a similar case and I'm also running the games often incredibly fast and also massive 4 terabytes aberrant PCIe m2 SSD so first question is 5.3 gigahertz as advertised on the box well not this box this is a review sample box but is it actually achievable well the 10 100 K is max all core boost is 4.9 gigahertz although this dropped to 4.3 under sustained loads after about 30 seconds and even with my two hundred eighty millimeter AIO I only ever saw it hit 5.3 gigahertz for a fraction of a second in less demanding apps and games I also did a little overclocking in the newer chips to see how that changes things I went for an all-court OC of 4.2 gigahertz on the phone 900 X and while I could get a little bit higher by varying the clocks on each core I feel like this is a good balance on the 10 900 k I managed a quick and dirty 5.2 gigahertz all core overclocked with hyper-threading which sustained in gaming and light workloads but stress all the calls and it floated back to 5 gigahertz almost immediately and as with stock speeds down to a 4.3 or 4.4 after about 30 seconds a 5.3 gigahertz if totaled sooner well five point four men switching off hyper threading cores completely but it still throttled just as quickly so I'm sticking at a 5.2 gigahertz all core overclock alright let's get on to some benchmarks and starting with Rainbow six siege and we seen the Intel chips have an advantage here with high frame rates across the board especially at ATP where the CPU and clearly the higher clock speeds are better utilized the difference lessons though as you jump up in resolution in battlefield 5 the 900 K and 10 100 K performed very similarly with overclock yielding pretty minimal gains it was a similar story with a 3900 X which was a little bit slower teint EP but matched the others at 1440 and for K playing a bit of war zone in the latest Call of Duty and we actually see lower performance on a 10 hundred K versus the 9900 K which I suspect may be due to the 9900 KH stock maintaining as boost clocks for the longer overclocking does even the feel though and in both cases is still ahead of the 3900 X but by less than 5% in every case Wolfenstein Youngblood showed a 6% improvement at TDP when coming from ninth gen to 10th Chennai 9 with the advantage of higher resolutions disappearing almost completely overclocking gets basically no games on a 10 100 K or phone and her eggs except the laughter at 1080p clock speed is clearly important here though with the Intel chips offering decently higher frame rates at 4k in overwatch the main takeaway is just how similar performance is across all the chips and considering the prices it's a great result for AMD overclocking the 10 100k boosted my FPS by 5% on average across the board and about the same at 1440p on the horizon but when we're hitting around 200 frames per second of 1440p across the board it's a great result all-round performance in fall night is pretty similar between the 9900 K and the 3900 eggs at all three resolutions and about 6% quicker on the stock 10 100k at ATP 8% at 1440p and 4% at 4k and I got a pretty minimal increase from overclocking the newer chips then in cinnamon jar 20 we see a big jump in performance 24% from the none 700 K to the 10900 K and around 1% boost with my overclock but both scores pale in comparison to the 3900 X which is a further 15 percent faster of stock and 21% quicker when comparing OC scores Geekbench 5 sort of 10 100 KS single core results a little bit over the Dontae 100k but again it's the multi-core score that really sees a meaningful improvement and actually here challenges the 3900 X but what about video editing well in my premiere pro CPU only export test we saw around 21% faster encoding speed versus the 900 K which improves by a further 11 percent when overclocked so that's quite impressive actually but it still loses out to the 3900 X with its extra cores and extra threads which make it 18 and a half percent faster of stock and 13% faster using the overclock now when it comes to overclocking and power consumption it's clear Intel have already eaten into any Headroom that 10900 K may have offered bear in mind this is technically a 125 watt part but even with out-of-the-box settings straight think all the course means it sucks around 240 was for the first day seconds or so before dropping back to a more manageable 125 watts with 4.6 gigahertz across all cause most of the time in games or less intensive apps it's between 95 and 130 watts though whereas the chthonian hundred eggs have stock speeds never went above 260 was running all caused in Cinebench and by setting in all core 4.2 gig is overclocked it was actually much closer to 175 watts like the i9 though in gaming this was much lower between 45 and 105 watts so while we are getting lower clock speeds generally the AMD uses less power alright so that was a lot of numbers but to answer the question is the 10 100 K the fastest gaming processor in the world well yes I mean the none sign Hydra cave was before it but now this is a few percent faster so why do I feel torn about it well for my money it's just too expensive and I don't think it really offers value for money if gaming is your priority it's clear that at 1440p and 4k it's the graphics card that's still the performance bottleneck even with a 20 atti so you're much better off saving some money on a CPU and plowing it into a more powerful GPU there is some difference at TTP where turtles are more CPU bound but often the frame rates are so high that any differences won't be there obvious even with a high refresh rate screen so really the tenner hundred K is for people like me who play games but also want the extra performance for production or work like I do lots of video editing so the extra cores next for threads come in handy there but if you're just playing games then I think the 10 600 or 10 700 all the risin faced X or 3700 chips are better options and speaking of better value the now discounted rise in phone and her ex is way cheaper than a 10 100 K and that makes aim DS chip an easy recommendation over the 10th July 9 especially for production workloads so if you do want a hybrid gaming editing PC then this is a much more cost-effective option so that was a pretty long and quite technical video but hopefully it's giving you a bit of an idea if you are looking for a new processor which one should you buy and also the performance difference between the top end intel and AMD consumer chips and right now you know what AMD is killing it in terms of performance and value for money and along with potential new XT chips coming soon it's like a 1/2 hunt against Intel is great to see the competition there it's good first consumers we're getting more bang for our buck but yeah Intel kind of feel like they're on the backfoot right now but what about you which processor are you looking to use in your next PC upgrade let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you didn't enjoy the video a little subscribe or thumbs up will be amazing because it did take a good week or so to make this video and hopefully I'll catch you next time right here on the texture
