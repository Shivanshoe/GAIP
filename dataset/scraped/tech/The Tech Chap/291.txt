hey guys Anton take Jeff when I'm hearing Easter's is booth where they've just shown off what they're calling the world's most powerful 40 inch gaming notebook which we'll come to in a second we'll get to the specs but the sort of gimmicky first thing you notice is this big light array on the back there's around 1200 mini LEDs and you can she cussed amaizing says you can show a bunch of text you could do a equalize like your levels on your audio playback so the technical name for this is the Annie me or an MA LED matrix it's a whole fancy marketing term for it outside on the show floor they were showing this off on top of sort of an audio deck so I can imagine people who are DJing and bars might like some stuff going on there although we have actually had some trouble with it this is a pre-production model of course so it's not final software and I can't actually show you the customization software so I was told that by default when you unplug the battery the LED lights will turn off to save power so the idea is that you don't use it when plugged in or occasionally on battery mode so it's not constantly flashing and annoying everyone when you whip it out at Starbucks if you think it's all a bit gimmicky though you can buy the g14 with all the lights which actually makes it a little bit lighter thinner and also cheaper but it is nice to have the option so it definitely makes it stand out but it's probably not the reason why you want to rush out and buy this really I think it's the specs the form factor as I say as soon as are calling this the world's most powerful 14 inch laptop and so inside we're looking at the latest aim the 4000 series processors they're eight core chips 16 threads so we're Suso actually using a brand new custom aimed e 4800 HS which is a special 35 watt Edition although it shares the same clock speeds and cos as the standard 4800 H and along with up to 32 gigs of ram and a one terabyte nvme SSD the g14 can expect with a r-tx 2060 max-q graphics card in a laptop this thin and light we're looking at about one point six kilograms around 17 millimeters thick I'll take the power out now it is a pretty compact and powerful laptop obviously the max-q variant of the 2060 is a little bit less powerful and under clocked versus the standard 2060 but you'll still get pretty good gaming performance on this so there's actually three versions of this laptop there's eight ATP 60 Hertz 18 to be 120 Hertz and a 1440p 60 Hertz going back to the original point of this being so for gamers and creators looking at a hundred percent sRGB coverage Pantone certification and also adaptive sink or free sink so they'll help reduce screen tearing in games design-wise the g14 has a magnesium chassis to keep it light and it does look good although there's definitely a slightly gamer east cyberpunk ii look to it especially with the keyboard and power button speaking of which the power button actually doubles as a fingerprint reader and so you can turn now on and login with just a single touch so I've only had a quick hands on with this but so far I like it I'm impressed by the specs given the form factor I wish the touch pad was a bit bigger it does feel quite small especially for a 20/20 laptop and also I'm having some issues with the touch pad in terms of responsiveness but like that we're LED matrix thing this obviously is a pre-production model so hopefully those things will be fixed and of course test that in my full review we've also got a pretty good selection of ports as well everything from full size HDMI to USB a USB see the one fairly big downside though is there's no Thunderball three supports since he uses an AMD chip and Intel don't want to share the Thunderbolt 3 tech with them so we're limited to slightly slower us PC ports you might be right here that that's mat Mona's next door doing his spiel on the same laptop actually he has the black version of this I've got the white one which I think stands out a little bit more but it does come in two different colors but hopefully he's not too loud and he's not ruining this video so a couple of other things to mention first of all if you come down with me here you can see that as suits are using their logo lift designed so as I open it up it lifts the keyboard up a bit which helps with air flow and cooling but also gives you a slightly more comfortable keyboard position we also have a think around an 83% screen to body ratio the top and side bezels are fairly thin but there's quite chunky chin at the bottom it's nice it's fairly compact but certainly not the sleekest or smallest 14 inch laptop on the market this thing is the most powerful not the smallest they've also made the power adapter a little bit smaller and lighter which is important because most of the time you're carrying both with you so there's no point having a superlight laptop you've got a big power brick with it but not only that while this does charge laptop obviously at full speed you can top this up via the USB C port so you can actually use your phone charger it won't sort of keep the battery top top while gaming but if you're just doing you know browsing the internet streaming videos you can actually use your phone charger USBC obviously not iPhone yet fingers crossed this year but that will top this up a little bit so unless you're playing games you can actually leave the main power adapter at home a su so also quoting up to ten hours of battery life which is pretty impressive although that is something out to test properly in my full review now Isis wouldn't confirm pricing but I was told it'll start from around a thousand pounds and top out at about two grand so that's just a quick look at the newest seuss rog Zephyrus g 14 bit of a mouthful of course put updated pricing and availability in the description when I know more and I also do a full review of this when I can get my grubby hands on it back at the studio but for now what do you think of this do you think the LED panel matrix personalized thing on the back is a good idea or a bit of a gimmick let me know in the poll of the top right and also whether you think you can start buying something like this let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you want to see more of me even off take of my voice just yet then why not hit
