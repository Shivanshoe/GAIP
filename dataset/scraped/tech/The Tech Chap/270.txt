hey guys Anton the tech chat and this is the new Oppo find x2 Pro it's their flagship phone for 2020 and there's a lot new here with a refreshed design cutting-edge specs a stunning quad HD and 120 head screen dual 5g support SuperDuper fast charging and they triple lens camera setup using brand new sensors which I'm actually really excited about so I've been lucky enough to get an early hands-on with the fine x2 probe but that does mean that right now isn't filming this I don't have final pricing and availability but it will pin a comment and updated description below when I know for sure but first impressions this is an incredible phone and actually coming straight from playing with and using the galaxy s xx altra I have to say that in some ways I actually prefer the x2 Pro just

so one year ago I reviewed the find eggs which at the time had the smallest bezel on any phone thanks to the nifty pop-out camera but they've done away with that here and instead we have a small hole punch camera in the corner and around the back we get a new triple camera setup so I don't think the find x2 stands out quite as much as the first one but it's still a gorgeous looking phone with super thin bezels curved edges or what they're calling 2.5 D curves as well as a thin aluminium frame between the gorilla got 6 on the front and back and actually on the back it is quite hard to see but you can feel the takes to glass elsewhere we get stereo speakers USB C charging that supports oppose crazy fast 65 watts super vooc to charging so while I was a fan of the little pop-out mechanical camera we had on the original find X the benefit of this more simple less mechanical design is we get ip68 water and dust resistance so you can take this in the pool the bath with you and obviously 1.5 meters of water for up to half an hour so this is a lot more durable side-by-side with the iPhone 11 Pro max and the Galaxy S 20 ultra the find x2 pro feels kind of like the Goldilocks eyes and while it is very slippery to hold so I definitely put a case or pop suck on this I think it's just the right size and a little bit more manageable than the huge s 20 ultra although with that camera bump it is the same thickness at 8.8 millimeters and actually if you use the phone on a flat surface it does wobble quite a bit which I guess there's another reason to get a case but I think for me it's the screen that's the real standout here we get a six point seven inch quad HD AMOLED screen and that seems to be the new standard for 20/20 flagship phones a 120 Hertz refresh rate and the best part is we can have both at the same time in the display settings you can jump between vivid srgb or cinematic modes and with tempeh color HDR 10 plus and 100% DCI p3 color support plus that quad HD rezoned 120 Hertz the screen on this thing is just insane I could watch movies and Netflix shows all day long on this thing although I should probably finish the video first specs why is this ticks all the boxes really with a Snapdragon 8:6 512 gigs of ram and a whopping 512 gigs of SSD storage although there isn't any microSD support the only thing that slightly concerns me is battery size in here we get a 40 to 60 mAh cell which is still reasonably big but if you consider the similarly sized s 20 plus has a 45 hundred million power cell and the fact that when you pair that quality wears with the higher 120 Hertz refresh rate maybe you're using 5g as well at the same time again this is one of the areas I mean how to test properly in my full view so make sure you do subscribe and stay tuned for that but of all the specs on paper at least I guess the battery life because actually it's split into two cells and then paired together is probably my biggest concern on the find x2 Pro so the find x2 runs Android 10 with op ozone color OS 7.1 software on top and while in the past I haven't been the biggest fan of their skin it's actually lovely to use it's fast there's tons of options including being able to create your own custom icon styles and as well as the awesome gesture support we get with Android 10 I like the extra option of holding a swipe in from the edge to jump back to a previous app we also get a smart assistant page to the left of the home screen although it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot you can add to it other than usual weather step tracking and AB shortcuts and then we also have an edge panel that you can swipe in with a handful of apps and shortcuts that you can customize now for unlocking the phone we get an optical fingerprint reader as well as face unlock they both work well although there's no IR sensor on the front so face and locking isn't quite as reliable in lower light alright so I've saved the best till last let's talk about that camera it's a triple lens setup with a 48 megapixel main lens 48 megapixel turf photo will technically periscope lens and a 13 megapixel ultra wide there's no time of flight death sensor here though like we get on the s20 ultra nor do we get an option for 8k video recording although in practice I don't know how many people would actually shoot an 8k what's really interesting though is the new sensors that find X to uses with Sony's brand new imx6 89 for the 40 and make a pixel main lens which also uses pixel pinning to combine four pixels into one so we end up with a higher-quality 12 megapixel photo you can choose to shoot in the full 48 megapixels if you want though now to get even more technical for just a second this is the first phone to use what's called all pixel omnidirectional phase detect autofocus so that's just some fancy jargon for better focusing but altogether it's a very impressive camera and photos look great and if you're more of a vivid rather than a natural kind of person then you've got the a I dazzle mode which makes everything look more punchy and vibrant opposed also added a new ultra night mode 3.0 you can probably guess what that does and so in low light with a longer exposure photos look good side by side with the s20 ultra then how do you think the fine x2 pro holds up which one do you prefer vote in the poll of the top right and let me know in the comments below if you'd like to see a full camera comparison [Music] now speaking our video this tops out at 4k 60 rather than 8k on the s20 but it's sharp stable and looks good plus we get a new ultra steady mode similar to Samsung's super steady although like that one this also drops the rares down to 1080p for that and finally up front we have a 13 megapixel F 2.4 selfie camera I always turn off the AI enhancement stuff that's on by default but the HDR does a good job of evening out the lighting and I like how wide the angle is so far then I'm actually really impressed by the Oppo find x2 Pro and I think office got a good opportunity along we see 1 plus and Xiaomi in others though well while we struggling a little bit particularly in Western markets that maybe they can grow their brand recognition a little bit so hopefully with devices this good it'll help put their name on the map a little bit more so the find x2 Pro is definitely worth considering it's got a lot going for it but I think its biggest challenge will be standing out from the s 20 + 1 + 8 and so on but stay tuned for my full longer-term review soon but what do you think of the eggs - would you buy
