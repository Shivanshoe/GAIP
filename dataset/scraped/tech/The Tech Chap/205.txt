hey guys i'm tom of techchap and i've rounded up 10 of the latest and greatest phones that you can buy that don't cost an absolute fortune in fact every phone i'm going to show you is under 400 pounds or 400 so in no particular order let's jump straight in with this guy it's the new tcl 10 5g you may be more familiar with tcl for their tvs but in the last year or so they've started making some genuinely good budget mid-range phones this one will set you back 400 pounds so it is at the top end of our price range so what stands out for me about the tcl is well firstly we're getting 5g which is kind of a nice to have but i don't think it's exactly an essential feature especially if you are on a tighter budget but we also get this pretty unique looking design with the quad camera setup on the back decent specs a good size 4500 million power battery plus a headphone jack and also surprisingly really nice software that doesn't feel too far from good old stock android it's a pretty hefty phone though the size of it the thickness and also the plastic body don't make it feel particularly premium but the thin bezels and the small hole punch cutout do look good colors also look vibrant thanks to the nxt vision technology which also does some fancy sdr to hdr conversion but the tcl does use an lcd rather than amoled panel and it's only 60 hertz which is fine but given the 400 pound price tag 90 or 120 or at least an amoled screen would have been nice to see so i think the tcl 10 5g is a good option it's a good all-rounder as the cliche goes but for 400 pounds i'm worried that maybe this will get a little bit lost versus some stronger competition and speaking of stronger competition next up we have the oneplus nord i reviewed this a few weeks ago and it's good to see oneplus kind of going back to their roots you know with the seven series and the eight series getting more and more expensive they've sort of gone back to giving us you know a good affordable phone which is what oneplus was always about in the first place so the node comes in at 380 pounds so it's not exactly cheap but considering we do get 5g a 90 hertz amoled screen a genuinely good looking design especially in this blue marble color and an impressive spec sheet even if it does miss out on the flagship snapdragon chips that we're used to seeing on oneplus phones while famously oneplus cameras never quite match their flagship rivals at this price point they're definitely above average and with six lenses altogether including an ultra wide on both the front and the back it's a very versatile setup my favorite feature though has to be the software oxygen os is just lovely to use it's fast there's no bloatware and it's kind of like stock android but with a few extra useful features honestly it's hard to find fault with the nord it's not the cheapest budget phone out there but i think given everything you're getting yeah this is an easy recommendation now this next phone genuinely blew me away when i found out how much it cost it's the new poco x3 nfc and as i said at the start of the video poco are very kindly sponsoring this video or at least there's integration with the x3 but to tell you the truth and you know maybe don't tell poco but i would have included this phone anyway in the video i mean just guess how much this costs considering it's the first phone to come with the fastest snapdragon 732 g which gives us wi-fi 6 and 15 faster graphics over the 730 g along with plenty of ram and storage full 120 hertz refresh screen with 240hz touch sampling a massive 5160 milliamp hour battery quad camera setup including a 64 megapixel main lens headphone jack and a pretty interesting design with what i like to call this go faster stripe on the back so i was thinking 300 maybe 350 for the x3 that'd be pretty reasonable given the specs but no this costs 199 pounds it's 200 quid and i think as you guys know i only work with sponsors where i genuinely believe in the product i think it offers you know really good value for money and so i don't think i've ever been happier to work with a brand than on the poco x3 nfc here and it's the little extras as well like having stereo speakers a fingerprint reader built into the power button so it's just one press to unlock liquid cooling so you don't see as much throttling with longer gaming sessions but most importantly that 120 hertz screen and massive battery is such a good combination if you're gaming downsides well it doesn't support 5g but i still don't think that's really a must-have right now it also uses an lcd panel so it doesn't have quite the same contrast as an oled the cameras aren't the best in the world and also you do get quite a few pre-installed apps aka bloatware but with that said their focus is on giving you exactly what you need and i think for 199 pounds sponsor or no sponsor this is right up there with my top recommended budget phones now staying at the lower end of our price range the next phone i want to show you is the realme 7 pro which as you can see well i actually don't have one with me right here but starting from just 230 pounds or 270 dollars this is a great little all-rounder and coming from the real me 6 series just six months ago the 7 and 7 pro add bigger batteries improved cameras faster 65 watt charging and a new design and we get a great looking 6.4 inch super amoled panel but only 60 hertz i think 90 or 120 would have been nice especially having just looked at the poko x3 we also get a good sized 4 500 million power battery snapdragon 720 g plus there's a quad camera setup on the back and it's also nice to see stereo speakers an in-screen fingerprint reader headphone jack and sd card support on the real me i do still think the poco x3 is a better deal though because while i do appreciate having the super amoled panel on the faster charging on the real me the poco gives you a faster processor bigger battery and it's also 30 pounds cheaper all right let's switch gears and now at the top end of our price range we have this little guy it's the iphone se 2020 which costs 399 or slightly annoyingly 419 pounds so it's technically over my british budget but it's under 400 so i think it's still worth including and it's funny because on the outside it looks like one of the most dated phones and yet on the inside it's actually one of the most powerful thanks to apple's a13 chip which is the same one you get in the iphone 11. so this is the cheapest way of getting that iphone experience with imessage facetime airdrop touch id and i think that alone is enough reason for a lot of people to ignore all the other android options and it's also a genuinely lovely phone to use and at 4.7 inches it has one of the smallest screens you can get these days so if you are a fan of compact easy to use one-handed phones then it's a great option the camera is also a definite selling point quality is right up there with the best phones at any price point however we do just get the single lens there's no ultra wide i think my biggest criticism is the lack of any kind of night mode so in low light it really does fall behind also while the screen looks good it's using an lcd rather than oled panel it's also only 60 hertz and it's not even full hd 1080p but overall i think the sc is a great choice and while it does look kind of old-fashioned now although some people call that a timeless design i call it a little bit old-fashioned but to its credit i think the sc will hold its value much better than any of these uh other android phones and it'll probably last you a good deal longer as well i mean i know people who still use the original se from like five years ago so if you just want a good small iphone for you know 400 that will last you three or four five years then yeah this is the one to go for now next up we have the google pixel 4a which is basically the iphone se of android phones it's a bit frustrating that it's still not coming out until october but at 349 pounds the same in dollars it's 50 pounds less than the iphone and i think overall one of my favorite budget phones it's interesting because last year's pixel 3a turned out to be one of the most popular phones of the year and while weirdly the 4a doesn't actually offer that much of an upgrade we're still getting that combination of fantastic camera stock android and also a pretty affordable price in fact while it does only have one lens so there's no ultra wide sadly i'd say this has the best all-around camera setup in this lineup with incredible photo quality and also great night sight and even astro photography modes i also really love the size it's only a tiny bit bigger than the iphone but thanks to much thinner bezels and a small corner hole punch cutout we get a much bigger 5.8 inch oled screen in a phone that's still easy to hold and use one-handed now of course the snapdragon 730g processor isn't as fast as apple's a13 but it's about on par with other android phones in this category but having pure stock android makes it much nicer and more responsive to use plus alongside its bigger brothers the pixel 4 and the 4xl the 4a will be one of the first phones to get new android updates including android 11 whereas most of these phones will be waiting months or even a year for the updates the battery is fine nothing to write home about really and i would have liked to see an ultra wide lens plus it only comes in a slightly boring just black color but aside from that i think the pixel 4a is a great little package it's just a shame it's not out until october so hopefully you guys are still with me but let's move on to number seven we're nearly there i promise and this is the samsung galaxy a51 so right now you can get this for about 300 pounds and for that you get a six and a half inch super amoled screen triple camera setup including an ultra wide lens and okay-ish specs the 4 000mah battery will easily get you through a full day but i have noticed a few slowdowns more than most of the phones i think the four gigs of ram and less powerful exynos chip hold it back a little bit but to be honest none of these are deal breakers and the lovely screen decent camera and nice overall style plus the 300 pound price make it a solid option there is also a 5g version for 120 more but i don't think it's worth it so the a51 is a good phone and it's very popular but i don't think there's any one amazing feature that makes it really stand out it's kind of a jack of all trades and personally i think the next phone i want to show you gives you a lot more bang for your buck and finally at number eight we have the moto g 5g plus on amazon uk right now it's just 279 pounds although for an extra 60 you can get extra 2 gigs of ram and double the storage either way the moto is incredible value for money and takes pretty much all the boxes good specs 5g 90 hertz great battery life headphone jack dual sim solid quad camera setup and best of all stock android i also really like the taller 21 by 9 aspect ratio it's the same as you'd get on say the sony xperia 1 mark ii so while it is a big phone the taller screen makes it slightly more comfortable to use it also uses the snapdragon 765 processor which is a fair bit faster than the 730 or 732 chips that we get in most phones for this kind of price and along with the smoother 90hz refresh rate and stock android software it feels incredibly fast to use given the price tag plus the hefty 5 000 milliamp hour battery means it'll easily last you two days the body feels a little bit cheap and the camera quality is pretty good but not great an oled screen would have been nice too instead of an lcd and as much as i do like having an ultra wide selfie camera the two lenses do take up a fair chunk of the screen and it can be a little bit distracting so those are my top eight budget slash mid-range phones but there are loads of other great options like the oppo reno 4 the nokia 7.2 or even the redmi note 9 pro in fact i reviewed the redmi a few months ago and i was really impressed it is 30 pounds more than the poco when it uses a slightly slower 720 g processor like the real me 7 but a big battery good looking design and well for 230 pounds the note 9 pro is definitely worth taking a look at as well and i'll put links
