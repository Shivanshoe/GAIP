hey guys Anton the tech chap but I'm lucky enough to have both the new 20/20 MacBook Air and also the new iPad pro 12.9 I've reviewed them both individually and I'll leave links at the end of the video if you want to find out more but the question is if you have about a thousand pounds or a thousand dollars to spend and you have your heart set on a new Apple device which one of these two should you actually buy to be honest it's a surprisingly tough call although I bet right now as you're watching this you already have a gut feeling towards one or the other but let's see if I can change your mind so first of all price and this won't take long because they actually cost the same $9.99 dollars the same in pounds the MacBook Air and the same price for the iPad pro although in the UK is actually thirty pounds cheaper but new enough exactly the same money of course you can always get the smaller 11 inch iPad pro which I must admit I do prefer it's more comfortable to hold and carry around plus it costs 200 less but I think for this video given the similar screen size and price the bigger one is a fair comparison but that's just the start for the MacBook Air I'd recommend you pay a hundred more and get the i5 processor it's a more powerful quad-core chip rather than the base dual core i3 which is fine but if you can be using this for next few years I think it's worth the upgrade as for the iPad I'd suggest the keyboard folio which I've got here which also acts as a case and that's two hundred and then if you want the pencil that's another 120 but obviously it depends on what you're using it for so in a way it's nice that you can pick and choose so I think realistically we're looking at about 1100 for the MacBook Air and between 11 and 13 for the iPad pro and of course a little bit more as well if you want the LTE option and also considering the magic keyboard is coming out in May and will cost 350 for this one that's an awful lot of money so straight away I think I'm leaning slightly towards the MacBook Air in terms of value for money I get it's not exactly cheap and there's lots of cheaper windows alternatives but you know between the two maybe a little bit more bang for your buck here okay next question and what's new with these 20/20 models and which one is the bigger upgrade well the short answer is the MacBook Air we get much more powerful 10th gen Intel processors these new chips also come with faster until iris plus graphics and we get double the base storage 256 gigs up from 128 along with a much improved keyboard it's the same one as the latest map sixteen as well as things like faster RAM and Bluetooth five in my full review I found that versus the 2019 model the processor was on average 27 percent faster and the graphics are whopping 61 percent faster and I was testing with this a3 model the cheapest one it will be even higher on the i5 or the i7 so it's a very slow upgrade whereas the iPad pro is a little bit less exciting coming from the 20 18/19 model we now get the a 12 z chip which is near enough exactly the same as the previous a 12 X but with one more graphics core unlocked it's basically a 7 5 percent boost in graphics I mean every little helps but most of us would really see any difference more importantly though Apple also doubled the base storage option 128 versus 64 we also get Wi-Fi sakes something the MacBook Air misses out on for some reason and the new camera sets up with an ultra wide lens and a lidar sensor which is basically a time-of-flight sensor for measuring depth and while more apps are coming right now pretty much any apples measure out makes use of it I think of him being honest the biggest upgrade here is the fact that they've doubled the storage to 128 because it means that I think for most people you can get away with buying the cheapest model so with the price and what's new in mind let's talk about pros and cons starting with the design and while I know not everyone loves the iPads somewhat industrial aesthetic it definitely looks and feels more next-gen its slimmer lighter with thinner bezels and so we get a much higher screen to body ratio and the way Bluetooth keyboards just seamlessly connect and with the Apple pencil you can just pop it on the top and it magnetically clicks to it and then once the charges it's all very seamless and futuristic and I can't wait for the magic keyboard that will bring full trackpad support backlit keyboard and a second year's BC for pass-through charging then of course we get the cameras on the bag which I'll come back to in a second and also quad speakers which sound awesome hey guys Anton the tech tap and I've been driving the Tesla Model 3 around London for a week hey guys anti-tank and I've been driving the Tesla Model 3 around London for a week including the places I probably shouldn't have including two places as I couldn't have the MacBook Air on the other hand it's still a gorgeous looking laptop and actually while I've always been I saw Space Gray fan and I must admit this gold color is actually growing on me it's a beautiful looking laptop and I think well maybe it's not as futuristic in terms of you know the bezels a little bit thicker and overall it's slightly less compact it's incredibly well made and I think it has a kind of timeless design quality to it plus the huge trackpad and a new scissor mechanism keyboard or I think the best combo at any laptop right now aside from maybe the bigger MacBook Pro 16 the air also wins in terms of ports we get a three and a half mil headphone jack which we don't on the iPad as well as two Thunderbolt 3 USB seaports and so with this you can actually connect up to either two for cakes doll monitors if you want or a single 6 K display and you have the option to connect an external graphics card or GPU if you want some more graphical horsepower though to be honest I'm not sure how many people actually do that and it would probably be significantly bottlenecked by the processor in this so yes you'll need an adapter for most accessories but there's plenty to choose from and assuming you don't forget to bring it with you it's not a big deal whereas the iPad just has a single USBC pause and well recent iPad OS updates mean you can now connect SD cards and external storage obviously by a USBC adapter and then move things around with the files app to me at least it still doesn't feel as versatile or easy to navigate as it is on the MacBook with Mac OS Catalina and having a full desktop but one area where the iPad takes the MacBooks but is you might better tell just by looking at it the displays it's 50 percent brighter up to 600 nits 16 percent sharper the viewing angles are better and we get a much smoother 120 Hertz refresh rate which is great for gaming and just generally using apps feels more responsive don't get me wrong the MacBook Airs screen is still really really nice but I think if you know I had to choose and I was going to watch a movie or edit some photos in Lightroom I'd probably choose the iPad the only downside is the more squarish 3x4 aspect ratio means you do get bigger black bars or letterboxing when watching movies or shows now in terms of performance well compared to the dual core i3 model of the map here indeed which five the iPad does come out on top however the quad core i5 or i7 laptop would certainly close the gap but quite honestly your performance and specs doesn't really give you a proper idea of how they compare all comes down to how optimized the apps and the program's are for example I think the six gigs around in the iPad is probably better utilized than the eight gigs in the MacBook Air and also in many cases they're lighter scaled-down versions of their full desktop counterparts and we no doubt the top spec MacBook Air with the i7 and 16 gigs of ram and a 2 terabyte SSD this one tops out a one terabyte SSD will be more powerful but it just comes down to what programs you're gonna use so let's talk about that because for me the biggest selling point of the iPad is the incredible App Store it's the main reason it's dominated the tablet market for the past 10 years there's an iPad optimized app for nearly everything you can think of and in many cases is better than the web browser equivalent using Safari on the MacBook I love how quickly I can digitally sign something or how nice the YouTube Netflix and Amazon video apps are or the awesome drawing and design apps that use the pencil and for whatever you can't find an app for you still have Safari or Chrome and actually using sidecar the iPad works is a great 2nd screen for any macbook so even as a secondary device it can still be very useful however as nice as the iPad ecosystem and UI is if you want to code in Xcode or use Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro or run virtual machines or bootcamp or you know have a full desktop and file systems much more intuitive to navigate or at least that I'm more used to the MacBook Air does it all it might not be as pretty or slick in some cases but I think for pro users Mac OS and the father uses Intel processors right now makes the MacBook Air more versatile one advantage of the iPad which we haven't really talked about yet is the fact that we get this weird camera setup it's using a main and an ultra-wide lens along with a new lidar sensor which obviously compared to the MacBook Air doesn't really have anything on the back now I'm not someone who tends to use their tablet cameras but they are by far the best cameras on any tablet and aren't far off the iPhone 11 setup plus I'm excited to see what developers can do with that lidar sensor so I'm shooting this with the cameras are on both the iPad and the MacBook Air essentially want you to see her FaceTime or a zoom call and I just looking at the screens I think it's fairly obvious which one is which and which is better but I'm gonna take this a step further actually test it in the real world so I'm gonna make a call to my friend Michael Josh from get to match over zoom with both others see what his reaction is okay MJ so this we're gonna call it a you're watching this feed and you're listening from that feed as well in the audio and now everything is coming from this one video it's clear video from B is way better than a brighter the screen is warmer the quality is is much better and then you can see for yourself thank you so much stop slacking the iPad also relies on face marking using the camera and the IR sensor whereas the MacBook Air has a touch ID fingerprint reader as for battery life they're pretty similar actually with normal everyday use I'm getting about seven hours in the MacBook whereas the iPad is closer to weight and I think chances are that you're running less intensive programs and probably not multitasking as much on the iPad but battery is great on both and it's not really a big enough reason to pick one over the other alright so I've been waffling for long enough let's get to the point which one should you buy well I'm gonna give you one of those annoying non answers because I'm gonna say it all comes down to how you're gonna use it but you know what the truth is I've had both of these lying around for the past couple of weeks and I would say that 9 out of 10 times I've actually reached for the MacBook Air admittedly I'm on lockdown so if I wanted to watch something on my commute on a flight I probably get more use out of the iPad it's really interesting and absolutely Nilay over the verge made a good point on the verge podcast which I definitely recommend you listen to because he said the iPad simplicity can actually sometimes make it more complicated I mean for basic tasks is great but unlike a laptop that we're all used to you have to learn the gestures learn what works and doesn't work whether you'll have the same functionality on an outpost of the desktop version and if you are happy to invest some time into it really cost use sweet shortcuts and get to know it then the iPad is a great choice and you will not be disappointed but I think for me based on my workflow if I had a thousand pounds to spend and I had to go out and buy one of these myself right now I think I really good for the MacBook Air it's just a bit more practical for me but what about you which would you go for iPad pro or MacBook Air or non the above let me know in the comments below I really hope you found this video helpful and if it was then it'd be awesome if you could give me a little thumbs up below and let me hit that subscribe button all those youtuber cliches thank you so much for watching guys and see you next time right here on the tech chure
