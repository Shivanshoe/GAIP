you know what forget the iphone se that everyone's talking about this is probably the mid-range phone you should actually buy hey guys i'm tomotek chap and i've been hands-on with the new galaxy a53 which costs just 399 pounds and for that we get a six and a half inch 120 hertz amoled screen the brand new exynos 1280 processor which i haven't tested yet but it is the first five nanometer chip in a galaxy a series and it's also being used globally there is no separate snapdragon version here and according to samsung we should be looking at a 20 to 40 speed boost over the snapdragon 778g in last year's a52 anyway that's alongside six gigs of ram which can be boosted with ram plus and 128 gigs of storage with micro sd card support which is always great to see now here in the uk we are just getting this one model of the a53 499 pounds which gets you that six gigs of ram 128 storage but the fact that you can boost the ram and also drop in up to a terabyte of extra storage via microsd that's pretty good there's also a huge 5 000 million power battery that's the same size as we get in the s22 ultra and i genuinely don't know how they've squeezed that into this chassis which is actually even thinner this year at just 8.1 millimeters now around the back we have this quad camera setup which i'll come back to in a second because normally when i see quad camera set up on a spec list i roll my eyes usually it's a way of companies sort of padding out the spec list by adding pointless extra lenses but actually it turns out they do make a difference but to round out the features we do also get gorilla glass 5 as well as ip67 water and dust resistance stereo speakers an optical fingerprint reader and face unlocking support and also a couple of new colors including this peach which i think is going to be one for my friend sarah dietschy and also this very snazzy bloom which i am actually quite fond of what is genuinely important though is that samsung will be supporting the a53 and the a33 which i'll come out to in a second with four years of android updates and an extra additional year of security it is really good to see samsung supporting their phones this long oh and did i mention it's 399 pounds which means it is actually 20 quid less than the new iphone se now to be fair i have only had a short time with the new a53 nor have i been able to do a direct comparison yet but outside of the admittedly awesome a15 chip that we get in the se the new a53 just makes it look kind of ancient with its sub 720p resolution 60hz refresh big chunky bezels single camera lens i think unless you really do want to be in the apple ecosystem which i don't blame you it's kind of hard to justify compared to something like the a53 but let's talk more about this camera i do need to spend more time with it but first impressions are good and it's better than i expected especially given that price but also as it's borrowed some of the smarts from the flagship s22 range for example the ai and processing from the new exynos chip combined with this dedicated 5 megapixel bokeh lens which works with the main camera for what they're calling spatial recognition together it gives us much more realistic and also adjustable bokeh for your portrait mode shots low light's been improved as well again the smarter mpu in the exynos allows for 12-shot ai multi-frame processing try saying that three times quickly so essentially we're getting more detailed less noisy better looking night mode shots there's also a 5 megapixel macro mode which actually doesn't seem to be as bad as you might think it is a specific mode that you go into from the more tab within the camera app and certainly for the price i reckon this could be the best macro i've seen even if it's not something you'd probably use all that often and finally up front we have this 13 megapixel selfie which does seem to look pretty good although it is a fixed focus rather than auto focus mainly because well it's cheaper so again this is something i'll have to test further but i think what i've come away most impressed by with the a53 and the a33 is that massive 5000 million power battery which is up from 4500 last year that's a big upgrade and together with the new adaptive refresh rates new ai algorithms to improve battery over time as you use it samsung claim a two-day battery and i don't think that's totally unrealistic charging is still limited to 25 watts and you'll get around 50 in half an hour and also there is sadly no wireless charging here now if you are tempted to buy this but the 399 price tag is just a bit out of your budget then for 70 quid less at 329 samsung's also unveiled the galaxy a33 which is pretty much the same as the a53 the biggest downgrade is in the camera department as all but the macro lenses are lower quality the a33 screen is 0.1 inch bigger although you'd be hard-pressed to tell but you can see we have this slightly bigger u-shaped notch rather than the infinity o as they call it on the a53 but that's pretty much it same exynos 1280 same ram storage microsd same big battery and an almost identical design it's going to be really interesting to see just how much of a difference there is in the camera and therefore whether it is actually worth paying the extra 70 to get the a53 but either way first impressions both these phones seem to be pretty incredible value for money but what do you reckon are you tempted to buy one or would you maybe get the iphone sc instead let me know what you think of the new galaxy a series which currently does not include a new a73 i should add the bigger version we haven't seen that just the 33 and the 53 and if you did enjoy the video and maybe want to see more of my tech reviews then why not hit
