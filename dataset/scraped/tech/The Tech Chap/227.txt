hey guys Anton the texture and I've just finished building this guy's it's my new video editing slash gaming setup and quite honestly it's completely over the top now before I show you what this thing can do let me run you through the specs and as we go see if you can get like a rough idea of the price in your mind and top it up as we go through and see if you're anywhere close by the end it's it's not cheap at its core we have an AMD thread Ripper 39 70 X that's the 32 core 64 thread chip and except for them even more ridiculous 64 core thread Ripper this is one of the most powerful prosumer chips you can buy I mean this is meant for 8k video editing proper high in film production or serious 3d rendering and can design for pure multi-threaded performance the thinness of the X here is almost unbeatable so basically this whole build came about because aimed ego in touch last if I wanted to test out one of their finest empty eggs chips and of course I'm not going to say no to that so I thought then well let's do a whole build around it but then that's where things start to spiral because then of course you're gonna need a TRX for motherboard to go with it and if you've seen the prices of those things it all adds up pretty quick but by this point I just wanted to go full steam ahead so I've gone with the ax suits ROG Strix TRX for TE gaming board as I say all thread Ripper boards are pretty expensive and while the Seuss's zennith 2 is the top of the line that costs over 700 pounds by itself whereas this will see you back a little under 500 which still has everything I need with eight memory slots for up to 256 gigs of ram room for three m2 SSDs which do support PCIe 4 and nice extras like Wi-Fi 6 this OLED display an associate's fancy or a sink lighting now speaking of PCIe 4 and I've got 2 m2 drives with me here from Sabourin a primary 2 terabyte PCI 4 Drive and then the secondary 8 terabyte PCI 3 so 10 terabytes in total that's a lot of for k-pop but seriously it's gonna take a while to fill that up and they're both lightning fast drives just wait for the benchmarks now let's talk about RAM and this is where things got kind of tricky because crucial very kindly sent over 32 gigs of their thigh 600 megahertz ballistics RGB Ram but then given how over-the-top the rest of the PC is I kind of wanted 64 so I went out and bought another lot of 32 gigs of the same Ram so 64 in total great but then and the blue crew she'll send me another 32 gigs around but this time they're even faster 4000 megahertz but now I've got a problem admittedly a very first world problem but do I stick with the 64 gigs of take 600 megahertz RAM or go for the new 32 gigs of 4000 megahertz ram which would you go for let me know in the comments below and based on that I will make the decision right now I've got a say 2 in here but in my draw as a 64 so what do you think just quickly guys a big thing it is surf sharks for sponsoring this video there VPN actually saved the day when I wanted to jump into a bit of war zone the other day but then saw a table date which was taking forever to download but then I used surf shark changed my location to New York and it made all the difference since it was then down running from different servers I mean that's just one use case they also use it to check out u.s. Netflix or Hulu while I'm here in the UK and generally it's just awesome for keeping you safe while you're browsing the web preventing ads tracking malware and all that bad stuff so why not give surf shark a try follow the link in the description or enter the code tech chap to get 85% off and three months extra completely free as for graphics well if I was going to go out and buy a brand new card right now well to be honest I'll actually wait till September for the next-gen cars to come out but fortunately I have my twenty atti for my old PC and then powering everything I bought the HX 1000 from Corsair I've measured this PC draw about 700 watts at its peak so I've still got some Headroom now the truth is I've actually had most of these components just laying about for the last few weeks because I've been holding out for a new cooler master case and also a new cooler master cooler cooler master cooler because most coolers particularly a iOS don't actually fit the bigger tr4 socket of the flavor of a chip so then you have to use the adapter that comes with it and it's just not ideal obviously this is a pretty hot and power-hungry chip so you can want the best cooling possible so I go in touch with cooler master and they vote Kylie sent over the ml 360 a i/o cooler which is designed for thread Ripper and covers the whole thing no adapters needed and so with the three 120 ml fans the chip stays nice and cool and finally the case which actually is the most affordable part of this whole build now I was seriously considering the Lian Li Oh 11 D which looks fantastic a lot of people highly recommend but it's just a bit too big and while I'm water cooling the thread Ripper I wanted good air flow as well especially with the TI so I went with color masters brand new TD 500 case it's pretty compact the top and front are meshes well for better airflow and they costs under a hundred pounds the only downside for me is the lack of a USB C port on the front it doesn't look quite as slick as something like Li Lian Li but it was easy to build with and I do recommend it alright so that's the setup but any guesses on price I mean considering the thread Ripper the 22 TI the 4000 megahertz around the 10 terabytes of storage I'm almost afraid to say but I priced it up and we're looking at about five thousand pounds or close to six thousand dollars for this guy which is just insane and to be honest pretty overkill for what I use but it's still pretty awesome nonetheless one finally I've paired it with this lg ultra wide it's the 38 WK in 95 C I've actually had this for a couple of years now and I love the size and the color accuracy for editing but it is only 75 Hertz and there's no three single G sync however I do have a brand new 38 W n95 C which I saw a CES this year with more free 4 Hertz g-sync Thunderbolt 3 brighter HDR basically what's gonna be my perfect monitor and it should be coming pretty soon so I'll do a video with that when I get it but overall I'm pretty happy with the build and as you might expect it's quite quick as well and kicking off with Cinebench just look at how fast it renders I've never seen a score this high in person 17000 131 in gate bridge 5 I mean just look at that multi-core performance 22030 one and it's no slouch in the graphics department either with a CUDA score of nearly a hundred and sixty thousand and one hundred twenty seven thousand with OpenCL and then in 3d mark we're looking at an overall score of almost 9,000 pretty impressive stuff but now let's test the stab wound rockier this is the PCI for SSD and we're looking at five thousand megabytes per second read and 4200 right then compared to my eight terabyte PCIe three Sabourin drive which still delivers around 3500 read and 3000 right it's actually not far behind so benchmarks are all well and good but what about actual real-world performance well for me I spend about half my life it seems in Premiere Pro and coming from the Intel i7 8700 K in my previous build everything feels faster from scrubbing around the timeline warp stabilizing and adding effects of course the real test will be when I can edit some properly high quality 8k video on this guy although right now my pH 5 amusing is limited to 4k if red you know if you're watching and you want to shoot me an email and send over a high quality 8k camera then that'd be pretty cool I'd give it a go but interestingly when it comes to export times the thread Ripper hasn't made a huge difference and the reason for that is following Adobe's recent update the ports a lot more of the load onto the GPU particularly within video cards but AMD GPUs as well so you can see in the task manager with the video encoder in the CUDA cause of the graphics card really doing the heavy lifting here either way a pretty complex 10-minute 4k video with max depth and Max render quality checked takes just four minutes and two seconds to explore now you may be thinking who really cares about shaving off a few minutes from the export time I mean just go make a cup of coffee or work on your thumbnail or something and that is true but really it's all about multitasking I can export a video edit in Lightroom or Photoshop have a bunch of chrome tabs open and this performance to spare I can even jump into a bit of war zone while I'm exporting so what about gaming well I usually try to get a few games of war zone in most days and well of course thread Ripper isn't primarily aimed at gamers the 4.3 gigahertz boost clock speed is still pretty decent and more more games are being developed with higher core and thread counts in mind so in Call of Duty with ultra settings of quality plus I'm averaging a hundred and thirty FPS here at any in Rainbow six siege same settings and we're looking at a whopping 295 FPS average for games at least I definitely need that monitor upgrade even maxing out settings I'm still not anywhere near taking full advantage of all that performance I went just for fun I've been keen to get into command and conquer remastered which actually looks pretty great and we're getting over 650 FPS just in case you were thinking how well is CC you gonna play when the 20 atti in a Fae two core thread Ripper now you know I know you need more deep background but we're up against it it really has been a lot of fun building this PC and I'm just in awe of the performance I guess though that the 2080 TI is probably the oldest component of the whole thing so I can't wait to see what indie and NVIDIA are gonna show off september/october time with the next-gen graphics cards don't buy a graphics card right now if you can help it because there's something a lot better coming around the corner thank you so much for watching guys don't
