okay so i think it's fair to say that upgrading your gaming pc at the moment is a royal pain in the backside everything's out of stock and even if you can find a new graphics card or processor it's gonna probably cost you two or three times the price from a dodgy reseller so if new hardware is off the table how are we going to boost your frame rate your performance and your load times in games well i've put together some of my favorite tips most of which won't cost you a penny so hopefully a few of these tips will be helpful and if you do enjoy it then absorb and a thumbs up would be amazing but let's get straight into it and tip number one well let's talk about monitors if you're still running a 60hz monitor this might actually be holding you back because if you're getting over fps in your games upgrading to a 120 or 144hz display will essentially unlock that extra performance so you get a smoother game without having to buy a new graphics card of course it does depend on the game you're playing and also the specs of your pc because if you're only getting 40 or 50 fps in call of duty then buying a 120 hertz monitor won't do anything although regardless of the performance you get in games having a high refresh monitor will always make a difference to your desktop experience so navigating windows and browsing the web all that stuff will be a lot smoother as well and also newer gaming monitors are likely to have faster response times and extras like g-sync which help reduce tearing and smooth out your frame rate so would you benefit well it's a pretty easy test just boot up a game with an fps counter enabled in the geforce experience or you're ready on software and you can then see how much beyond 60 frames per second your system actually gets and so just how much smoother gameplay you could unlock so conveniently my first tip does actually involve buying something but the rest of them most of them don't cost you anything at all including this next one which involves tweaking your graphics card just a little bit okay so first up make sure you've got the latest graphics drivers installed i mean this can help as well right click on the desktop and open the control panel go to manage 3d settings scroll to power management mode and change this to high performance this will use a little bit more power but it should mean your graphics card will go to boost clocks more often and also while you're here go down to texture filtering quality and also switch this to high performance okay tip number three and we've all done this where you fire up your game and your performance sucks for some reason so you go into the graphic settings you start messing around and something fixes it but you're not quite sure what and it's where one or maybe two graphics options in any game seems to completely tank the performance and often it's not clear which settings are the worst offenders so rather than say setting everything to high overall check if any individual settings come with a warning that they're demanding and also if you see a resolution scaling option this will actually allow you to reduce the res of in-game assets but keeps the ui elements at your main resolution so they still look sharp and actually these scaling options are often a better alternative to simply dropping the resolution although to keep things nice and simple amd and nvidia with their geforce experience have optimized settings options that detect based on your system what graphics options to use and this can be a good starting point okay tip number four and it's all about this airflow this is a big one having good airflow keeps your cpu and your gpu temperatures down which means they can run at higher clock speeds for longer before they throttle and it should also mean that your fans don't have to run as fast so they're quieter and also maybe gives you more headroom for overclocking and since your graphics card speed steps down at certain temperatures even if you can get your system to drop a couple of degrees it might help keep it from throttling as much so get your vacuum or a can of pressurized air and some cloths and clean out any filters fans and air inlets although just make sure your pc is switched off of the wall or psu first but going back to this which is a corsair mesh front plate this is also another really good way of improving airflow there's nothing worse than having a nice fancy gaming pc with a big chunk of metal or plastic on the front which restricts the intake so even if it looks fancy most of the time you're gonna be much better off with a mesh front plate and even a top plate uh for your system to get that air flow through and then out the back of your system and away from your hot components also if you are regular on the channel you may notice that this is actually a different pc i'm building two brand new uh rigs one intel one amd this has got the 11th gen rocket lake i9 processor inside so i'm working on some videos for that but personally i'd start with a good spring clean before spending any money now this is just a quick tip and you probably already have one but if you don't go outside now turn this video actually watch the end of the video then turn it off and buy yourself an ssd seriously it's the single most effective upgrade you can make and it can bring an old system back to life and it can even have some effect on frame rates and even texture pop-in but really it's the load times where you'll see the biggest benefit and even a cheap satur ssd will make a big difference over a traditional hard drive but if you can splash the cache then a fast nvme m2 ssd will be even faster and more future proof i've completely lost track of what number tip we're on but all i'm gonna say to you is dlss deep learning super sampling this is nvidia's clever ai powered upscaling tech which you get on their 20 and 30 series desktop and laptop cards and in supported games it can boost your frame rate more than a new graphics card probably would and has a minimal effect on the visuals and it's also completely free so in basic terms dlss which is now up to version 2.1 renders the game at a lower resolution internally and then uses the gpu's fast tensor calls and machine learning to upscale the resolution back up and this is far more efficient than just rendering everything at the native res so you get a massive boost to your frame rate particularly at high resolutions and it's also a great way to offset the performance hit you get from enabling nvidia's fancy ray tracing effects now dlss is already in some big games like cyberpunk and fortnite although most exciting for me is that it's coming to call of duty warzone soon now if you don't have a nvidia 20 or 30 series graphics card then you are a bit out of luck unfortunately but i think aside from the raw performance access to dlcs is the single biggest reason to upgrade your graphics card at the moment it is magical stuff and it gives you a huge boost in performance and i can't wait to see how this even gets better over time and also see supported in even more games okay next up and if you've built your pc or maybe you've reset the bios for any reason recently there's a chance that your ram may be running well under its rated speed and timings it's happened to me a bunch of times after a couple of crashes and an automatic bios reset my 3 000 megahertz ram was running much slower so to fix this i re-enabled the xmp memory profile which is called the docp on ryzen systems in the bios not all motherboards have this option although it's pretty standard on gaming models and basically xmp sets your ram frequency and timings to the fastest preset profile it should be stable at and will also adjust the voltage automatically if you don't have any xmp or docp setting then some motherboards will allow you to manually adjust the speed and timings to what they should be or even beyond that if you want a bigger overclock i do also still think that 16 gigs of ram is the sweet spot for gaming right now if you are on 8 then you're fine but i think you'll probably see a bit of an improvement in speed if you do upgrade to 16 and that can be one of the more affordable ways of upgrading your pc without some ridiculously overpriced graphics card or processor however if you are mr fancy pants with a shiny new rtx 3000 series graphics card then well firstly well done because they are still very hard to find but secondly since the end of march nvidia has basically unlocked the ability to turn on or enable the resizable bar although you will need a compatible graphics card motherboard and processor and this resizable bar is essentially a new pcie technology that improves the memory management of your system and it can boost your frame rate by anything up to 12 in some cases so firstly make sure you do have the latest nvidia game ready drivers installed and also the latest bios firmware for your motherboard now if you have an nvidia founders edition card then it's actually a little bit easier as you can just download their update tool which i'll link below and follow the instructions it literally takes about 10 seconds for third-party graphics cards then firmware updates for each card can be downloaded from their manufacturer's websites which again i'll leave links to below now as you guys know one of the oldest tricks in the book for getting more performance from your system is overclocking to be fair this could be a whole video by itself so this is more of a pointer than a guide overclocking really isn't that tricky you can either just set a auto overclock in your motherboard's bios nice and simple or you can fine tune it adjust voltages and spend hours if not days just tweaking it but either way you can pretty easily get a meaningful boost to your frame rate beyond this there are a few extra tweaks you can do to get even more performance so you'll need to download an overclocking app i'm using msi afterburner but rather than overclocking this is actually about unlocking your gpu power and voltage limits and also changing the fan curve to allow your graphics card to maintain a higher clock speed for longer so in afterburner firstly you want to head to the settings and unlock the voltage control and the monitoring this opens up the voltage options then restart afterburner then just increase the power limit to max the maximum temp will also move as it's linked but again this is still a safe level next go back to the settings then head into the fan tab and enable user defined fan control and here we're going to use a more aggressive fan curve i.e the fans will ramp up quicker to keep things cooler at the expense of more noise how noisy things get will depend on your gpu and your system so play around with this until you're happy but i'm gonna make the fans ramp up faster at lower temperatures which as i say should keep clock speeds running higher okay last tip i promise we're almost there and this is a nice and easy one just a bit of housekeeping you know the stuff closing any apps you don't need when playing games stuff like chrome and even app launchers are often hardware accelerated so they're using a little bit of your graphics card and also downloading in the background can often affect your ping in online games in the task manager jump into the startup tab and disable everything you don't need at boot up make sure windows is up to date and also use a disk cleanup app to clear out loads of old windows files or use something like ccleaner or pc tune-up software to get rid of even more stuff like unused registry entries and then when you are running a game open task manager to make sure its priority is set to high and that's it those are my tips and if you think i've missed any good ones do let me know in the comments below hopefully i haven't bored you to death completely and if you do want to
