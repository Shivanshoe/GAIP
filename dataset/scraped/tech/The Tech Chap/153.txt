so this time last year i was in vegas on the show floor of ces as you can see getting actual hands-on with all the new tech this year is a little bit different as you can see i'm still at home but i still want to give you guys a bit of a walk through and tour of some of lg's new launches this is their brand new 2021 stuff a big thank you to lg for partnering with me on this video they basically asked if i give you guys a tour of their virtual showroom focusing on the lg grams because they've had a pretty big upgrade and also their new displays for both gamers and pro users it's not the most sophisticated experience this virtual showroom but you do get all the information you need and i will leave a link in the description below if you want to check this out for yourself so let's start with the lg gram and there's a ton of upgrades this year we've got uh refreshed 14 16 and 17 inch models uh plus a couple of two in ones and they've obviously got new hardware with intel 11th gen processors including the much faster xe graphics thunderbolt 4 high resolution more color accurate displays pretty big upgrades actually and one of the headlines is that they've taken the 15 and now it's become a 16 inch version because they've trimmed the bezels made everything a bit more compact so now we're getting officially the world's lightest 16-inch laptop which is very impressive although they're on a ton of other 16-inch laptops so it's quite a niche category but considering the lg gram 17 so the big flagship 17-inch weighs just 1.35 kilograms the 16 is 1.2 kilograms and the 14 inch the smallest one is just a kilogram and paired with this new premium design including much thinner bezels bigger track pad a slightly flatter keyboard faster thunderbolt 4 ports and also i5 and i7 11th gen tiger lake processors the two and ones have also been refreshed if you're into your 360 hinges and you fancy using their stylus pen to do some drawing or doodling for me i genuinely get the most use of the lg gram the traditional clamshell version of the laptops and along with all the other upgrades one of the big new features for me at least is the fact that every model now gets a 16 by 10 aspect ratio which previously only the 17 17-inch flagship did now they all get it so you get a little bit extra vertical screen space which just makes using it a lot nicer also both the 16 and 17 inch come with quad hd resolution so 2560 by 1600 whereas the 14 inch sticks with full hd which i think makes sense given its size because you're always trying to balance the battery life with the sharpness or the resolution the screens themselves have also had a bit of a refresh now with 99 dci p3 color coverage so if you are doing color sensitive workloads like your photo editing then that will come in handy and actually as i'm just flicking through the colors here this snow white version of the gram does look pretty nice i would have liked to see maybe an option for like a nvidia mx350 or 450 graphics chip as well for some slightly more intense graphical workloads i mean we're still getting a pretty big upgrade with the xe integrated graphics it's often twice as fast as last year's 10th gen processors which is pretty incredible year on year but based on the specs and what i can see from this new design i think this is probably one of the biggest upgrades we've seen to the gram range in two or three years actually and i really can't wait to get hands on with these properly all right so that's a quick look at the lg gram laptops but let's move on to some monitors let's start with their ultra fine collection so lg as well as making lots of gaming monitors also produce some very high quality professional uh displays and one of the standouts this year when it loads there we go but it's the lg ultra fine oled pro the 32 ep 950 lg's first oled monitor and actually if you saw my video from a couple days ago where i was testing out switching to an oled tv as a monitor this could actually be exactly what i was looking for 4k oled and we're hitting 99 p3 99 adobe rgb true 10-bit color i mean as good as these ips displays are there's just nothing that compares to the contrast that sort of million to one contrast the deep inky rich colors that you get from an oled and while there are quite a few other tvs you can buy now oled monitors are still very few and far between this really isn't the best way of showing off the new tech but as you can see it's a pretty subtle uh design no fancy rgbs or anything this is definitely a professional uh grade monitor but as i say 4k oled top or line color accuracy i can't wait to test this one myself okay next up i want to show you this the new 40 wp 95c and as it says on the tin it is a 40 inch curved ultra wide monitor uh 5k by 2k dcip 98 hdl10 thunderbolt 4 improved speakers so this is another high level sort of editing professional monitor and the main benefit of having this 5k resolution is you can actually edit back 4k natively because the problem with this particular monitor i've got here which is 3840 by 1600 is you haven't got quite that 21 by 60 uh vertical resolution so you can't quite play back 4k natively as i say so with this this is a 5120 by 2160 so you're getting full 4k and a bit more in an ultra wide monitor which is gonna be perfect uh for creative professionals editors like me i guess so i can't wait to get hands on with this myself i don't know if it's high refresh though i don't think it is which would be a bit of a shame i'm currently using the 38wn95c i made a video all about that a couple days ago and for me the benefit of that is you have all these pro features as well as g-sync and 144 hertz so it's like a sort of best of both worlds i think this is just more aimed at creative professionals but considering this is 38 inches it's gonna be a little bit bigger even this but then you're getting that higher resolution as well so this is actually going to be a pretty cool new monitor i can't wait to review it properly all right last but not least let's have a little look at their new ultra gear gaming monitors and actually if you are interested in any of these uh i will leave links below as well as two surveys that lg are running one for the lg grams one for the monitors they're just little gleam links below uh enter the survey subway and uh you can win some prizes that's about it really so check those out in the description but what i want to show you next is this guy the lg 27 gp 950 and it's a 27 inch 4k monitor we've seen those before but this has hdmi 2.1 which i think is going to be a lot more common in 2021 but crucially it means you can plug in your ps5 your xbox series x or s and it will unlock that full 4k 120. the problem with almost all pc monitors at the moment is that they only go up to hdmi 2 which limits you to 4k 60 and as more games come out offering 120 hertz and maybe even 4k 120 hertz this is gonna be really helpful so this is like a next generation pc and console gaming monitor so 27 inch nano ips still very color accurate 98 p3 hdmi 2.1 with vrr variable refresh rate and nvidia g-sync compatibility one millisecond greater grade response time so super fast and a 160 hertz overclocked uh refresh rate i imagine that's 144 normally and also hdr display hdr 600 so decent hdr high refresh 4k hdmi 2.1 i kind of wish there was a 32 inch version as well but yeah if you're looking for a new monitor to pair with your pc and your games consoles this is probably gonna be the one to go for we're also getting this guy which is a little bit more of a mainstream gaming monitor uh the 32 gp 850 so 32 inches uh nvidia g-sync compatible hdr 10 one millisecond response time ips and 180 hertz overclock so just a nice all around big gaming monitor there finally we're also getting a new ultra wide gaming monitor the 34 gp 950 g catchy names right 34 inch quad hd g-sync ultimate which is pretty interesting and that supports uh well g-sync at a higher range of refresh rates and also hdr uh because we're getting displaced gr600 uh 180 hertz overclocked refresh rate still one more second response times and even still 98 dci p3 so across the board whatever you go for we're still getting really color accurate displays which is quite nice to see but yeah between these three gaming monitors i think as i say for me the most exciting new one is this new 27 inch hdmi 2.1 i kind of wish the other ones were also 2.1 it would be nice if that was to solve the standard across the board i'm guessing maybe it costs a little bit more to implement that but still it's good to see that we are getting a dedicated 2.1 next-gen console monitor from lg so we've got all new lg grams with refresh designs and updated hardware and we've got the new oled pro displays which i can't wait to try out the brand new 40 inch 5k ultra wide and also three new ultra gear gaming displays including that hdmi 2.1 next-gen console monitor so out of all those uh which one are you most excited for and also which ones would you like to see reviews for on this channel let me know in the comments below and if you do want to check this out for yourself as i say description below as are those two lg surveys uh where you can also win some prizes as well if you enter a few details thank you so much for
