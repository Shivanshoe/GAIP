hey guys i'm tom of techchap and there is so much hype around this especially as their marketing and well all the leaks we've seen suggest the s and the note series are merging but one big question that remains to be answered is whether the exynos 2200 chip will actually be any good and crucially will it be on par with the new snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip because since the beginning of time or well galaxy s2 i think we've had two versions of samsung phones one with their own in-house exynos chip and the other using a qualcomm snapdragon so in the us china parts of india and japan you guys get the snapdragon whereas here in the uk and europe and parts of asia and africa we get the exynos chip which historically has been a bit rubbish i've been doing these versus videos for years now and while the gap has been closing with last year's exynos 2100 giving the snapdragon 8 a good run for its money in the past we've seen some pretty big differences in terms of performance battery life and even the camera quality so here we are in 2022 with the galaxy s22 and it is all but confirmed that we will again be having a dual model launch because even netflix have added support for the exynos 2200 chip so it is coming but here's the thing we already know what the snapdragon 8 gen 1 can do in fact i was in hawaii at qualcomm's snapdragon summit where they showed off the chip and we can run benchmarks and while to be quite honest it's not a huge improvement over the snapdragon triple eight we're talking just a few percent faster in some benchmarks although there is a big push towards ai and neural processing performance however there is a curious and slightly worrying lack of data and benchmark results for the exynos 2200 version and i can probably also guess that at my upcoming hands-on event with the s22 series they're not going to allow any performance benchmarks or probably even comparisons it's going to be a good few weeks until we get our proper review units where we can then run all our tests and see just how fast it is which is a bit frustrating most phones don't have this issue but with samsung's flagships we have two models two different socs and given how one of these is historically at least always been demonstrably better than the other one it's always left everyone else feeling a bit short changed why is my phone which i've paid the same amount for not as good as my friend in america's phone well actually there's been a lot of excitement around exynos this year as finally the amd partnership will bear fruit in the forms of their rdna ii based eclipse 920 gpu with its ray tracing capabilities and as i say which samsung suggests will bring console quality graphics to smartphones now there is a strong possibility that samsung is just tweaking and updating the drivers so that we get the best performance when it finally comes out because i'm sure they are well aware of the reputation and the history with exynos and in fact some unconfirmed leaked results do show the gpu outclassing the snapdragon 8 gen 1's adreno 730 thanks in part to a higher gpu clock speed 4 gigs of vram and 384 stream processors and possibly even going toe-to-toe with apple's awesome a15 but these benchmarks have a few anomalies and it also doesn't answer the question of how good is the thermals does it throttle what's the battery life going to be and will the different isp compared to the snapdragon ship have an impact on the camera performance and it's funny because that kind of raises another issue what if in fact the exynos turns out to be incredible next-gen graphics performance on a smartphone great unless you're then in america and buying the snapdragon version we don't want one to be significantly better than the other you want parity between the two unless you're pricing one differently but then again maybe this is just the price of healthy competition it's taken samsung a while to catch up but i think it's fair to say qualcomm has some of those intel vibes going on right now compared to apple with their arm chips and mediatex dementity arguably qualcomm haven't really been fast enough to innovate and their chips have also been getting more and more expensive for oems to use in their phones so either way really whichever chip is better i kind of hope it does give qualcomm a bit of a swift kick up the back side and recently that's where mediatek have really made some ground that i think their new dimension 9000 chips are not far off snapdragon 8 gen 1 in terms of performance and i believe quite a bit cheaper just a quick

which chip you get the s22 series is shaping up to be quite a tasty upgrade with the flagship ultra a big 6.8 inch screen and a refresh design including the new gorilla glass vectors plus alongside samsung's armor aluminium frame that we saw on the fold 3. also updated cameras including a new iso cell hm3 sensor for the main 108 megapixel lens which i cannot wait to try out and that's alongside an ultrawide and dual telephoto lenses also a whopping 40 megapixel selfie up front faster 45 watt charging the same size 5 000 million power battery but somehow with an s pen squeezed in so currently with the s21 ultra it does support the s pen but it's not embedded in the phone you can buy a separate carry case but no one really wants to do that with an embedded s-pen that is a notes and i think really going forward samsung's gonna be focusing on the flipping and folding phones for the sort of different form factory options that come out later in the year the new flagship is also expected to cost the same at launch as last year's s21 ultra with the only caveat being that the entry-level model may only come with eight gigs of ram down from 12 as a result of chip shortages and price increases and that would be a bit disappointing but i guess i'd probably take that over a price hike so place your bets now which chip do you think is going to come out on top the exynos 2200 or the snapdragon 8 gen 1. let me know in the comments below and then let's come back to this in a few weeks with my full review and we'll see where we ended up and also don't forget if you're not that convinced by the new s22 series and you don't think it's much of an upgrade then maybe wait and see how much of a discount we can get on last year's s21s which are still very good but i was going to suggest considering the s21 fe which is a little bit cheaper but i'm not convinced that the new standard s22 os 22 plus isn't gonna be a similar price and give you more for your money so it may be a little bit hard to recommend this but we'll have to see make sure you have subscribed though for my full unboxing and review coming very soon on the s22 and i'll see you next time right here on the
