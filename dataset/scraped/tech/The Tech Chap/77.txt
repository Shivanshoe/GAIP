hey guys i'm tom of tech chat and i'm shooting this on new gopro hero 10 black including the built-in mic so you can get an idea of the audio quality and it's also a 5k 60 one of the new resolution of frame rate options so there's a ton of stuff i want to show you about this except this video very nearly didn't happen it almost went disastrously wrong so this is the hero 10 black and as part of this review package gopro also sent this remote control speedboat which is equal parts awesome and also terrifying in fact taking a well few liberties with central london bylaws i snuck down to the edge of the thames to give this thing a proper test and holy moly does this thing go [Music] so this is being shot at 4k60 with hyper smooth 4.0 boost enabled and also with the linear field of view and considering how bumpy the river and the boat is it's doing a remarkable job of staying smooth [Music] and also you can see bar the odd bit of dirt or sand there are very few water droplets on the lens which is actually one of the upgrades [Music] so far so good then well except for that but at least i got it back now this time still at 4k 60 but with horizon leveling turned on which well as it says on the tin locks the horizon now up to a 45 degree angle up from 27 degrees on last year's hero 9. gunning it towards the city it's all buttery smooth even if that hydrophobic lens has picked up some of that beautiful brown thames water but then things took a turn literally in the middle of the thames it capsizes and my heart sinks the gopro and the boat all of my footage i wasn't quite sure how i was going to tell gopro i wouldn't be making a video after a good half hour or so and the wake of a few boats going past it drifts back to shore and my completely on purpose 30 minute underwater test was successful [Music] [Music] so what's new with the hero 10 black aside from this snazzy new blue colored font well the star of the show is the brand new gp2 chip and it's the first new processor we've had in the gopro since the six back in 2017 and it's twice as fast side by side you can really see just how much snappier the interface is it really does feel like you're using your phone now rather than a laggy action cam and even the front screen smoother now thanks to a higher frame rate but most importantly gp2 also doubles the frame rates we can shoot in so we now have 4k at 120 5.3 k at 60 and 2.7 k at 240 fps we also now get hyper smooth 4.0 which isn't significantly different to 3.0 last year except it works at the higher resolutions and frame rates there's also that improved horizon leveling the cameras had a bump up to 23 megapixels from 20 and you can now pull out up to 19.6 megapixel stills from your 5k video which again is up from 15.8 last year so across the board we're looking at more detailed photos and screenshots and higher frame rate video now in terms of actual picture quality i don't think an awful lot has changed when you're in good light but as you guys know the one thing that gopros struggle with is low light performance so with a new chip we have new advanced tonal mapping and also 3d noise reduction so hopefully a little bit less noisy as you're watching this than the lighting changes but probably not a nine-day difference in terms of actual video quality on the outside there's now a policy of no licking because as i mentioned earlier the hero 10 has this new lens cover with hydrophobic glass it is still removable if it breaks but gopro says not only is this even more scratch resistant than before but the water shedding glass helps stop droplets from obscuring the lens something gopro users used to lick the lens to help prevent before they took it in a scene it does seem to work most of the time but sand and dirt can still get in the way but visually you'd be hard-pressed to tell this apart from the hero9 because aside from well the number and that blue font oh and the fact that it's three percent lighter you can't really tell we get the same front and back screens the same slightly finicky pull-down release for the battery and micro sd card slot although batteries are interchangeable so you can use your old ones with this and then there's these pull down thingymajigs for mounting attachments and it does support all the mods for the hero 9 including the max lens but i do just want to show you this horizon leveling again where you can tilt the roll of the camera because hypersmooth does a great job at keeping everything well smooth but eliminating the roll with horizon leveling really makes a difference so the hero 10 gets the usual three modes photo video and time warp and on screen you can tap to go back to real time whenever you like and then resume the time warps so you can get some really cool effects the ui and the menus are pretty much the same as before although i do appreciate that they've rejigged the default camera settings a little bit so you don't really need to mess around with protune anymore in my experience the only tweak i'd suggest is changing the bitrate from medium to high we still get all the smart capture modes like hindsight which captures 30 seconds of video before you hit record live burst for taking a bunch of photos one and a half seconds before and after your shot and also now scheduled capture lets you set the time and record up to 24 hours in advance and then hopefully duration capture lets you select for how long you want it to record but you will want to download the gopro quick app it'll suggest you subscribe to gopro for automatic uploads and that 1080p live streaming but mostly i just use it as a remote viewfinder for the camera which is free and much easier to frame a shot on this rather than the back of the gopro but in the quick app you can also update the software and adjust all the settings including what you want the front screen to show another new feature of the hero 10 is the ability to auto upload your day's footage to the cloud as soon as you plug it into charge via the usbc port you can also wirelessly transfer it via the app or plug it into your phone directly and actually these are 30 and 50 faster respectively on the hero 10 or of course you have the good old-fashioned way of just popping out the micro sd and plugging it into your pc probably via an adapter okay so uh future tom jumping in here because i had originally uh scripted and made some notes about battery life and also uh some conclusions about the hero 10 which i'm shooting this on now but i've come across a bit of a problem because i wanted to test the battery life of the hero 10 because gopros say it's um comparable to the hero 9 unless you're using one more high performance modes like 5k60 or 4k 120 in which case it's a little bit less um but actually my tests uh over a 20 minute 4k 60 recording the hero 9 actually had 73 of its battery remaining versus 61 on the hero 10. so that was a noticeable downgrading battery even in the same camera mode but actually i've come across a bigger problem overheating because i cannot get this hero 10 to run longer than about 23 minutes before it overheats and just shuts down i've tried it at 4k 60 at 5k30 on three different uh batteries so i reached out to my friend tommy from gadgetsboy who is also testing the hero 10 and i got him too so there's a couple of things here firstly this is a pre-release model or at least it's a non-final software i'll put the software number below so that is something that maybe can be fixed with an update but i also shared my findings with gopro to see if they had any thoughts and to be honest they didn't really have a good answer they told me that they don't recommend recording on the highest settings in a static environment as that's where overheating is likely to happen but even at 2.7k60 which is some way from being the highest settings after just over 20 minutes it shuts down surely there is something wrong here and maybe it's worth holding off buying but then again it could be an easy software fix or just an issue with these pre-release models uh in which case this whole section of the review you can just ignore and you can carry on buying hero 10. so bear that in mind but let's now go back to my original video and my wrap up so how much well the 10 black will cost you 500 or 400 if you have the gopro subscription but considering that costs 50 pounds you may as well get that first and then buy the discounted uh hero 10 black of course you can still buy the nine and the eight for lower prices i think the nine is definitely still worth considering if you're not that bothered about the higher frame rates the improved horizon leveling and also uh the faster you why if you can live without that the hero9 is probably a better value option but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of these and also what do you think still missing that you'd like to see in the 11. let me know in the comments below cheers for watching guys i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat you
