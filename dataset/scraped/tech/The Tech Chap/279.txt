hey guys Anton the tech chap and I've been hands-on with the new Samsung Galaxy S 20 altra 5g and along with the u.s. 20 and as twenty-plus these are probably the most leaked phones ever but Samsung's still had a few surprises I wasn't expecting as you would expect though for the eye-watering price of about 1,300 pounds or $1400 the ultra is an incredible phone so let's get the specs out of the way first and for me the biggest upgrade is the new quad camera set up the 120 Hertz screen and huge five thousand milliamp hour battery so there's actually two models of the ultra that both 5g but one comes with 12 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage and the other with 16 gigs of ram and 512 storage this is actually the first time Samsung are using their new faster lpddr4 AM as well I must admit though that 128 gigs of storage on the base model of the Ultra does seem a little bit stingy given how much we're paying for it although the upside is that you can expand the memory with microSD cards up to one terabyte and of course we get new processors either the snapdragon 865 or Samsung's own Exynos 990 depending on where you live we'll have to see how different they end up in the real world although historically the snapdragons have offered better performance and better battery so there is still a little bit disappointing that we gain the X not here in the UK specs aside though the first time I picked up the ultra I think there were three main things that really stuck out for me with one literally being the camera module that dominates the back of the phone and sticks out quite a bit just look at the difference versus the note 10 plus an 8.8 millimeters thick and weighing 220 grams it's pretty hefty however the rounded corners and the fact it's taller rather than wider thanks to the new 20 by 9 aspect ratio means it doesn't actually feel uncomfortable to hold and the third thing I noticed is well just how boring the colors are so the S 20 and the Plus come in gray pink or blue whereas the ultra is just gray or black it's so dull where did the snazzy over colors of the s10 and note Tango between all the new colors though which one would you go for vote in the poll of the top right and let me know also I have to show you this shot of all of us trying to get the best video of the new phones this is what tech youtubers look like in their natural habitat but you know we do it to bring in the best videos we can so we'll be awesome if you can hit that subscribe button it makes it all worth it so design wise they've trimmed the bezel a tiny bit they've shrunk the hole-punch selfie camera giving us the slightly taller aspect ratio and added that massive camera module on the back we still get stereo speakers ip68 water resistance and like the note 10 plus it drops the Bigsby button and the headphone jack that we had on the STM plus now one of the big new features is the faster 120 Hertz screen and to fully Hertz touch sensors YouTube is obviously capped at 60 Hertz so it's kind of hard for me to show you a higher refresh rate means everything feels a lot smoother and the to fully Hertz touch sensor means the screen can actually react more quickly to your touch so altogether everything feels much more responsive there is a compromise though 120 Hertz is limited to Full HD plus switching to the sharper wqhd plus resolution Gray's out the option so you basically have to choose do you want a sharper or a smoother screen to my eye while you can see a difference going to the high-res on the big six point nine inch screen I would go 120 Hertz every time it's much more noticeable it's hard to go back to a 60 Hertz screen after it it does seem a bit of a shame that on this all-singing all-dancing super expensive phone we still have to compromise her to choose one or the other although of course having both would drain the battery quicker but when it's expected that other phones like maybe two one plus eight will have both it feels a little bit like we're being shortchanged although maybe just samsung is holding it back for the note 20 regardless the dynamic AMOLED screen is absolutely stunning the only thing that slightly takes away from the experience is that hole-punch camera but actually the 20 by 9 aspect means you don't really see it in most videos unless you pinch into zoom of course it is there in full screen apps games and when you're watching movies but you do quickly forget about it so all the hardware is very impressive but the software is just as important and the s20 ships with Android 10 and Samsung's 1 UI 2.1 with a similar but slightly cleaner interface fully integrated dark mode but the best part is we now get Android 10 swipe in from the edge to go back gesture for years now one of my main issues with Samsung phones as good as they are is the speed it takes to update their software it feels like an absolute age it's usually a whole year before you'll get the next version of Android when it comes with the next phone launch so while this will be coming to older phones as well it's a really nice to have sort of quality of life feature one area I am a little bit disappointed in though is when it comes to unlocking the phone the s20 uses the same ultrasonic fingerprint reader as the No ten plus which is fine but I was expecting combs new and much bigger 3d sonic Mac sensor there's also still no IR sensor on the front which would help with face unlocking in low-light now of course one advantage of being such a big and felly Chokey phone is that something's managed to cram in a huge five thousand milliamp hour battery which is a big jump up from the forty one hundred million power cell on the sm + and the fully three hundred mah cell on a note M plus the bigger and high refresh screen will definitely have an impact but I'm expecting a big boost of battery life with all three new s 20s although of course I'll properly test it in my full review all three s 20s come with a fairly mediocre 25 watt charge in the box though although the ultra does support 45 watts if you buy the charger separately it does seem that Samsung is falling behind a little bit compared to the competition when it comes to charging times although we do now get faster wireless charging and of course reverse wireless charging makes a return so you can top-up other Qi enabled devices so far so good then but I've definitely saved the best till last let's talk about that camera which I reckon is the biggest upgrade symptons made today camera tech in years they significantly increase the resolution and sensor size across the board plus they've actually dropped the variable aperture system they've been using since the s 9 now versus the other s 20s you can see the Ultra has a slightly different setup with a whopping 108 megapixel main sensor and 48 megapixel telephoto compared to 12 and 64 on the other models so we get a 10 times hybrid optical zoom and a whopping 100 times super resolution zoom versus three times and 30 times on the other s 20s now testing out a 100 times space zoom in a small briefing room isn't really the best use case but the quality seemed pretty good actually as it combines the optical zoom with AAA I powered digital zoom unfortunately I wasn't allowed to take any photos away with me but I can't wait to take this out into the real world and test it properly it also does a pretty good job at smoothly transitioning between the lenses as I switch from noir point five times ultra wide to the main lens and then zoom in it's still not as smooth as the iPhone but that doesn't have anywhere near the same zoom capabilities as this so I guess if you're a birdwatcher or maybe a stalk or something then you're gonna love this zoom camera back to the main lens though and while a hundred eight megapixel sounds overkill by default it actually uses pixel binning to combine nine pixels to 1 so we get sharper less noisy 12 megapixel photos if you want though you can tap the aspect ratio icon in the camera app and switch to the fold resolution I'm telling you pinching in on a 108 megapixel photo is insane it's incredibly sharp I really wish I could show you the full image one of my favorite new features is single take which is actually something I hadn't seen in the leaks and basically over a few seconds it captures everything an ultra wide portray and a I filtered photo a smartly cropped photo so if you're not sure which camera mode you want to use this takes it with everything then you can just swipe up and see the full portfolio of photos and videos the camera upgrades aren't limited to just photos though the s20 range are the first phones that can shoot 8k video which you could then upload to YouTube or cast to your fancy 8k Samsung TV if you're mr. moneybags or more likely you can then down wares to 4k or even pull 33 megapixel stills out from it whenever I take photos of my partner Sarah I always seem to time it wrong so if I just film her for a few seconds in 8k she can then freeze-frame and take a high-res photo from the clip we also get improved super steady mode which I'm hoping will now work at 4k but I'll need to check that when I get my review device as well as a new nighttime hyperlapse which should look pretty good thanks to the bigger sensors which let more light in on the front the Ultra gets a 40 megapixel Savi camera which is up from the 10 megapixel on the other s 20s we only get one lens but we do still have the option to go for a slightly wider angle in the camera app so I came away from my hands on actually genuinely really excited for the s20 ultra it is very expensive but it does also seem to be a big upgrade over the S 10 plus and the note 10 plus I wish we had the new bigger fingerprint reader there's still new I offer face unlock there's questions over how the snapdragon will compare to the X nos and also if other phones coming soon do offer full wqhd plus and 120 Hertz are we getting a bit shortchanged here make sure you have subscribed though because my full of you as well as battery tests and camera comparisons are coming very soon but in the meantime let me know what you make of the s20 and the ultra in the comments below do you think something's done up to convince you to upgrade or do you think they're just too expensive and not really worth it do let me know below thank you so much for watching guys I'll see you next time right here on the tech jab
