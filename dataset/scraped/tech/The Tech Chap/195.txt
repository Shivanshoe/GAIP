so i went to the pub last night and a couple of my friends who had seen my instagram post of me with the series x uh sort of crailing it like a baby and they asked what i thought of it so far what my sort of first impressions were now the problem is there aren't any next-gen games i can actually play right now to test it i mean this doesn't even come out until november 10th so i couldn't really give my friends a good answer and actually we all kind of agreed that the launch lineup isn't that exciting yes we've got cyberpunk and black ops and watch dogs coming out soon but there's few great exclusive next-gen games plus they were getting more expensive for looking at 70 pounds each so at this point they were starting to reconsider whether they should even keep their pre-orders for the series x that is until i mentioned backwards compatibility and actually it changes the whole conversation about whether you should buy one think of it like upgrading your pc with a new processor new graphics card new super fast storage the first thing you'll do is jump into your favorite game and then see how much faster it is and that's the case with the series x and probably the series s to a slightly lesser extent but it's not just about buying expensive next-gen games it's how this will give you the best experience possible playing all your current games the 12 teraflops the super superfast pcie 4ssd and new features like quick resume all make such a difference to be clear though this is not a review it's barely even a preview and almost dropped it there and it is running on non-file software so this is just my experience so far playing a few games on the xbox game pass library to see what it does to them in terms of well improving the experience now firstly credit to digital foundry as they produced a fantastic video showing the real-time frame rate difference between games running on the new series x and the current xbox one x and you can see as they play games like hitman ff15 tomb raider where the current one x frequently sees pretty heavy dips in frame rate the series x just breezes through giving a solid 60 across the board i mean to go from a 38 fps average in hitman with the 4k quality setting to maxing out the 60 fps cap is a big deal and remember these aren't games that have been remastered or had any real work put into them for the series x let me give you another example i fired up a bit of no man's sky and started a new game on both the one x and the series x and if i put them side by side while i don't have the fancy digital foundry tech to measure the frame rate directly on the consoles you can just see how the older one x on the left has slow downs and frame rate dips versus the buttery smooth series x on the right now of course this does vary between games some see bigger boost than others and unlike upgrading your pc you can't then suddenly enable a whole bunch of better graphics settings but the higher more consistent frame rate can make a big difference but that's only half the story because one of the biggest upgrades with these next-gen consoles is they've ditched the slow old 5400 rpm hard drives in favor of super fast pci for ssd storage which makes a world of difference to load times if we jump back into no man's sky and that long initial load screen for new games you can see we've got little timers at the bottom there for each console and it takes the series x 37 seconds to load if we then skip ahead the one x takes a full minute longer at one minute 37 that's a 61 percent faster load time now let's have a look at red dead redemption 2 and starting from the main menu and loading my saved game i'm used to this taking forever normally and yet the series x finishes in 36 seconds compared to one minute 39 so a similar boost to no man's sky it's 63 faster and actually it's not just those big initial loads either i got myself killed and it took 31 seconds to respawn on the one x versus just 21 seconds on the series x metro exodus is another great example and the one x takes about a billion years to load well 2 minutes 33 but it feels like forever whereas the series x i have here sat next to it loads in just 39 seconds that's nearly two minutes shaved off i can do a lot of things in two minutes that's what she said avoid boring you all to death looking at load screens all day this is a roundup of my results so not only are we getting higher and smoother frame rates but it's a night and day difference when it comes to load times i do keep holding this like a baby i don't mean to it's just oh this is how i hold it anyway there's one more party trick for the series x and that's quick resume and this lets you jump between up to 12 games that have been cached in the background so rather than having to fully load up a game every time you want to play something else you can switch between them and it takes a fraction of the time in fact going from no man's sky to metro exodus takes just 15 seconds and there's no slowdown or anything i'm right back in the action then if i switch to foul fantasy 15 it takes a little bit longer so it does vary between games but at 19 seconds it's barely time to put the kettle on and then maybe if i jump back into red dead just 15 seconds later and i'm ready to go now you do of course have to be careful with multiplayer games you'll get kicked out of the server if you're out the game for too long but if you're sharing a console with someone and you're both playing something different being able to just quick resume into what you've been playing is really useful now you may be able to have up to 12 games of quick resume but if there are you know big aaa games then you're probably going to want where is it one of these guys this is the seagate expansion slot which gives you an extra terabyte of storage because out of the box you have about 800 gigs to play with on this so uh i think pretty quickly uh you'll want to invest in one of these which of course does add a couple of hundred pounds extra but i think you know long term it's pretty nifty that we do have that option i honestly didn't think i'd be able to make a whole video just about backwards compatibility and what it's like playing current games on the series x but just seeing what a difference it makes to the frame rate to the load times and also having quick resume as i say going back to my conversation with my friends even if there aren't any super exciting next-gen games that you want to spend 70 pounds on just how much this improves your current gameplay experience as i say i think is probably worth it by itself but this is not a review it's not a preview even it's just my experience so far of backwards compatibility with xbox game pass library of games so obviously this is previously software things may change things may even get better and i can't wait to test this on some other non xbox game pass games uh and of course also give you guys my full review so what do you make of the series x so far and all this backwards compatibility let me know in the comments below and also what next-gen game you're most excited to see
