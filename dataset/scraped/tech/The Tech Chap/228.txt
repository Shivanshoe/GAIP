hey guys Anton a tech chap and this is Sony's new flagship phone the Xperia one mark - I've been really excited to test this out because I still think that last year's experience call the mark one for now was actually one of the years more underrated phones but the question is is the mark 2 a big upgrade and is it worth paying 1100 pounds or $1200 for well let's start with what's new and there's been a few design tweaks for example is about half a millimeter thinner now the camera modules been moved to the side they finally merged the power button with that size fingerprint reader which makes a lot of sense so now it's just a one touch to wake and unlock they've also ever so slightly trim the top bezel and now both speakers are front firing and they've been moved right to the edge but I think one of the most surprising changes is the addition of this between a half mil headphone jack I mean last year's experience didn't even have one and it's one of the few 2020 flagships that actually comes with one so you know for that reason alone maybe it might be worth buying we still get Gorilla Glass 6 on both the front and the back which looks good although it's still one of the slipperiest phones I've ever used you should absolutely put a case on this as if you're attempting finger gymnastics to reach the top of that extra tall screen you are definitely gonna drop it sooner or later despite this though I still really do like the design it's kind of refreshing actually just to have a symmetrical bezel is not I'm not your hole punch cutout insight but the bigger upgrade is on the inside with a new snapdragon 86 5 chips 8 gigs of ram up from 6 last year as well as now just a single 256 gig storage option using the faster u FS 3 storage + micro SD card support that's up from the poultry 64 and 128 gig models last year so a new processor more RAM more storage but I think the biggest upgrade hardware-wise is the battery we now get a 4000 million power cell up from 3,330 on the Xperia 1 so this lasts a good deal longer and the fact that Sony's stuck with a 60 Hertz screen which is a bit controversial and I'll talk about in a second that also helps battery life so actually this thing is surprisingly long lasting I've been using it for the past week or so and I'm getting about 5 hours of screen on time and by the end of a normal day I still have about 30% of my battery left which is pretty good actually a full charge takes about now and a half although a quick 30-minute top-up will get you to 50% of the battery and also for the first time we now get wireless charging which is nice a few other features like bluetooth 5.1 Wi-Fi 6 and also 5g support and then we have this camera which is now a quad lens setup with the usual main ultra wide and telephoto lenses but now with the addition of a time-of-flight sensor for more realistic bouquet and portrait shots so far so good then but the real selling point of the Xperia not - is this screen this 6.5 inch 4k OLED HDR screen and with this 21 by 9 ratio immunity to watch movies in full screen with no less bossing and paired with their dynamic vibration that makes a return giving you a kind of haptic feedback basically a rumble to go along with a movie game or music you're playing everything about this phone is designed to give you the ultimate mobile cinema experience and it's awesome firing up the bit of Call of Duty you're playing a 4k HDR youtube video it looks stunning plus the mark 2 seems brighter and the colors more vibrant in the mark 1 you can also now switch to creative mode in the display options which is kind of like cinema mode giving us less vivid but more realistic colors and again closer to that cinema experience all that paired with Dolby Atmos supporting front firing speakers and support for high res audio yeah it's good but the problem is not all games support this what a 21 by 9 aspect ratio and while movies look great if you're watching YouTube videos or regular shows shot in 60 by 9 then you're gonna have big pillarboxing either side then there's the 4k resolution which Sony have been pushing on their phones since I think that said 5 thinking I was back in 2015 but to be honest with you I still don't think it's really worth it I love the idea but it's just not that useful I mean Netflix prime video and play movies are all still capped at ATP on mobile and well if you do find some good native 4k content say on YouTube and take full advantage of that crazy 643 pixels per inch sharpness I mean put it right up to your eyes and yes you can see the difference it's incredibly sharp but I just don't think most people are gonna get much benefit out of the 4k screen in real life plus it only gives you 4k well actually slightly less than 4k 38 forty by sixteen three four to be exact when it detects 4k content why is it stakes to 2560 by 1096 to save battery the thing is I wouldn't really have as much of a problem with the 4k screen if it wasn't for the fact that it compromises so neat to stick with a 60 Hertz refresh rate screen so unlike most other flagships in 2020 which give us you know 90 or 120 Hertz because of that 4k resolution we're still stuck at 60 here now to be fair they have added a reduced motion blur feature that is supposed to kind of simulate a smoother 90 Hertz refresh and it helps it feels kind of like when you turn on the motion smoothing retv but it's just not quite the same as a proper 120 Hertz screen and in my mind while 4k is something you might enjoy every once in a while a high frame rate would make the whole experience of using your phone feel faster from scrolling through menus apps and importantly playing games so unlike other phones that offer faster 120 Hertz and also more responsive 240 Hertz touch latency it means that while immersive the Xperia 1 mark 2 just isn't a great gaming phone but what about you if you had to pick between 4k and 120 Hertz which would you go for let me know in the comments below for putting all that to one side it's still a lovely phone to use we get Android 10 with Sony's UI on top left of the home screen is the Google News Feed we also get the multi window app for easy multitasking with two apps on top of each other which makes sense given a tall screen there's also side cents for quick apps shortcuts and of course Sony's pro photo and video modes if you want to tinker and get the most out of a camera we also get a game boost mode with a few options to boost performance stop applications and record gameplay won't criticism I do have though is that there's no face unlock option with this the only biometric security option you have is the fingerprint reader which is fine it's fast it's reliable but it seems quite odd to not have any face locking at all and maybe it's not as big a deal these days because everyone's wearing face masks when you're out and about but at home I'm just kind of used to picking up my phone not even thinking about it and it just you know automatically unlocks with my face with this I have to make sure my therm or my index finger is planted on the power button each time to unlock it it's just kind of a weird omission ok let's talk about this camera and here are the key specs and most notably the main 12 megapixel camera has a 50% bigger sensor than in last year's Experian I'm paired with a three times photo ultra-wide and Newtown flight lands it's a pretty versatile camera setup now first things first if you want to get the most out of this camera you're gonna have to get familiar with the pro photo and video apps it's not for everyone but part of maybe why you want to buy this is the ability to fully control the camera however I'll be honest and say that I'm not a pro photographer so while it's fun to dabble in these apps most people including myself will just be using the regular camera app although to be honest you could give most of these features just by downloading filmic pro on any other phone so here's a few snaps from the mark ii when along with a bigger sensor they've also improved the real-time eye autofocus tracking and you can see Davey here is InFocus every time despite moving around so focusing is snappy the colors look realistic and the dynamic range is also better than last year something that Mark one really struggled with with more detail in the darker areas and less blown out highlights it also holds up pretty well against the iPhone 11 pro although I have noticed in a couple of shops there's a slowly purple tint to Sony's photos and it still can't quite match the iPhones aggressive HDR although I know it can sometimes give the iPhone shots than a natural look so it's definitely a step up from the mark 1 but it does still fall down a bit in low-light shots there's no dedicated night mode instead it'll automatically sense low-light and give you a 2 or 3 second long exposure but again compared to the iPhone it can fall behind in terms of white balance detail and dynamic range when in tricky lighting also just look at these portrait shots dynamic range just goes have the window in quite honestly it looks like something you'd get from a $300 phone as for video the mark 2 can shoot up to 4k at 30fps but there's no 4k 60 or even 8k unfortunately and the HDR mode is still limited to 1080p but here's a side-by-side with the iPhone at 4k and there's a clear difference in terms of brightness and vibrancy the iPhone definitely looks more appealing and looking in the sky you can see your handles or highlights better you can see as I'm walking the stabilization can't quite match the iPhone I've also had some issues with the Sony getting very dark while filming something I just couldn't fix even by tapping on the screen and trying to adjust the exposure and finally around the front we have an 8 megapixel selfie camera in good light quality and detail is solid but it definitely struggles in low lights either under or over exposing and a lot of detail is lost so then should you buy the Sony Xperia mark - well this is undoubtedly Sony's best phone in years it's a solid upgrade over the Mach 1 and with a headphone jack Pro photo modes and a 21 by 9 4k screen it does have a lot to offer but it is very expensive and personally I don't really feel that 4k adds a whole lot especially the expense of not having a high refresh rate and also while the camera is definitely an improvement and in good light it can take a great photo it's still 4th buying a competition in low-light selfies and video I genuinely really do like the mark 2 and I think by now you'll probably have a good idea if this is the phone for you but I don't think it's for me especially at 1,100 pounds I think maybe if Sony was a little more aggressive with the pricing say if it came in at 900 pounds then it'll be a lot easier to recommend but as always that's just my opinion I'd love to hear what you guys think of the mark - would you be tempted to buy this and do you think you get much use out of that 4k screen let me know in the comments below and if you do want to see more from me don't forget to hit a little subscribe
