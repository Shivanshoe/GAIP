in the past century we've learned incredible amounts about our solar system but what do you think lies at the very edge darkness the portal to another dimension maybe at what point does our solar system merge into the other parts of the universe unaffected by the Sun at the center now after decades of sending probes into space we're finally beginning to get some answers first of all let's talk about the structure of our solar system the inner part of our solar system is fairly well understood because well our planet lies within it there's the Sun at the center a planet that orbits it's billions of asteroids and comets that are held in its gravity and masses of gas and dust that swirl around close to the Sun our four rocky planets Mercury Venus Earth and Mars beyond the Mars is actually room for another planet and a material present that could have formed into one if it wasn't for the massive gas giant Jupiter that comes next following Jupiter of course comes Saturn another gas planet and then choose smaller colder gas planets Uranus in Neptune beyond Neptune things are more disorganized with a lower gravitational pull from the Sun billions of clumps of rock and ice are in orbits but never themselves formed into planets the belt of comets further out than Neptune is called the Kuiper belt in the enormous bubble of materials around the solar system is known as the Oort cloud now at the center of the solar system around which everything else orbits the Sun exerts its influence to the furthest reaches with both its gravity and the particles that emits these charged particles far out into space from the Sun in all directions creating a sphere around it called the heliosphere this reaches out about eleven billion miles were the distance equivalent to 100 times the distance from the Sun to the earth the further these particles go the less energy they have and at the edge of the solar system the energy of uncharged hydrogen atoms in interstellar space push back against those emitted by the Sun and this boundary is known as the hey Leo Paz it's believed that here there is a buildup of hydrogen atoms from interstellar space and this invisible wall scatters incoming ultraviolet lights and with the vast distances involved there have only been two spacecrafts that have passed through the heliopause Voyager 1 in 2012 and void - in 2018 it was from these spacecrafts that we first got proof that the edge of the solar system existed where it was and even if it expands and contracts but more recent probes have taught us a lot more the new Horizons spacecraft which recently conducted a flyby past Pluto and the Kuiper belt used as Alice UV spectrometer to take readings of the heliosphere between 2007 and 2017 it detected an ultraviolet glow on the boundary where the solar particles hit the hydrogen atoms beyond and this is called the lyman-alpha line this glow can actually be seen across the entire solar system but it's more intense at the edge of the solar system did anywhere else however the theory and understanding behind this phenomenon is not completely understood yet so New Horizons will continue to collect data twice a year as a journeys deeper into space eventually it won't itself cross the boundary possibly within 15 years and with the new technology aboard it can help us to uncover more information about this mysterious region and as it is so far out it seems like a missed opportunity to send a probe to explore the outer edge without first visiting other unexplored areas within the solar system the Voyager probes only reached an edge because they continue flying after the mission completed and New Horizons is only just expected to remain operational by the time it reaches it since the discovery of the border there are now calls for a specialized robotic probe to make the trip if the proposal is accepted it should be able to reach the edge six times faster than the voyagers did and could reach his target in less than ten years traveling to a distance of 90 billion miles from the Sun it will be able to automatically explore the region and then send back the data to answer some of the biggest questions that remain unanswered about the solar system now every time a new probe is sent out to explore the solar system something else has discovered that piques the interest of researchers even further the mysterious boundary between our sun's influence and interstellar space really is still unknown but the new horizons and future pros will really get us a lot closer to a better understanding thanks for watching everyone we'll see you next time
