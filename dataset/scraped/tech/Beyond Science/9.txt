of all the powerful and destructive forces in the universe black holes remain some of the most mysterious in recent years astronomers have studied far more of them and discovered that not only do they come in all shapes and sizes but rather than being stationary in space some are actually moving and some even spend an incredible speeds but what are the consequences of this and how does it affect the surrounding regions we're only just starting to find out when stars that are more than three times the size of our own reaches the end of their lives they can undergo extreme gravitational collapse which sucks all the remaining materials into an incredibly confined space here the force of gravity is so strong that conventional rules of how atoms interact are overridden and the result is a black hole they are so dense in the gravity is so powerful that even the fastest moving particles such as photons of lights are unable to escape the event horizon that surrounds it so apparently photons of light are not as powerful as Matthew McConaughey so if the Sun were to be suddenly compacted into an area to such an extent that it would be a black hole it would have a diameter of just four miles across although it would still have the same mass as the Sun so the gravity exerted on the rest of the solar system would be the same the planets was still orbit the way that they do now and this means that black holes interact with other objects beyond the grasp of the event horizon just like anything else for a long time black holes were just a theoretical but ass researchers have developed technology to look into the sky it's now believed that they are actually quite common all galaxies are thought to contain supermassive black holes at their centers and images have been taking that showed the universe to be full of ones that exist elsewhere - while the black holes themselves aren't visible the disks of matter that surround them show the telltale signs that there's a massive gravitational anomaly within it and there are instances where the phenomenon can actually expel material for example this would occur when they collide with one another were through a process discovered by Stephen Hawking known as Hawking radiation what's even more fascinating is that study examining supermassive black holes at Galaxy cores has found that they also spent just like other objects in space but the rate at which they rotate is almost unbelievable so let's talk about these spinning black holes NASA's Chandra x-ray Observatory as a Space Telescope that detects x-rays more than a hundred times as sensitively as any other system astronomers have used its capabilities to look at five different quasars which are gigantic galactic nuclei with supermassive black holes that have the mass of many hundreds of millions of our Sun and are surrounded by large discs of gas and material quasars are incredibly bright in the sky compared to surrounding objects but at distances of between 10 and 11 billion light-years away from us but at distances between 10 and 11 billion light-years away from us they are so extremely difficult to look at in detail to do this effectively astronomers take advantage of a range of effects that happen to the light as it travels towards us to help sharpen the image the first is called gravitational lensing which occurs because any object with a sufficiently large mass such as a galaxy warps space-time in a way that magnifies images from behind all the five quasars die were looked at we're perfectly positioned to be gravitationally lensed to give greater clarity but this also causes a phenomenon predicted by Einstein where the light has been to such an extent that multiple images of an object are seen at the same time one of the costs are images which shows four virgins in a closed configuration is known as the Einstein cross and in this case the galaxies used to magnify the image is ten times closer to us than it is stars also cause warping of space-time although to a much lesser extent but this can be used to further refine any magnification in a process called micro lensing it's how scientists managed to gain such clear images of the croisé are much better than has ever been done before when they did they could hardly believe what the images showed they expected accretion discs of material around the black hole to be superheated because that's why they're so bright in the sky but they also found that these disks were orbiting the black holes much closer to the event horizon that would be expected if they were static which means they had to be spinning as super high speeds in one case had reached around a 70% of the speed of light for this to be possible the black holes themselves would have to be spinning at even greater speeds and it's not that one of them has an event horizon moving at very near the speed of light it's believed that this happens because material usually as to a black hole from the same direction as it approaches from an already spinning disc over billions of years each addition as momentum to the whole spin and eventually it can reach such huge speeds for example the Einstein cross has been measured with the spin of 670 million miles per hour not only does this have consequences for the disk of material around it but also for the fabric of space-time itself there's currently no way of detecting quite how far the ripples spread but with the mass and speeds involved it likely has distortive effects throughout the whole of his host galaxy basically the more we learn of black holes the more we realize how truly powerful and destructive they can be future probes and research projects are still being planned that will further explore these phenomena so who knows what we might find out next and what that means for our fundamental understanding of the universe thank you so much for watching see you next time
