I don't know why but every day in that tree right there birds congregate together and then at some point they lift off and they start flying together in a flock you got all these birds that are just moving almost like they're a macro organism you've got like one individual bird and it'll be leading the pack and then when it turns the other ones turn it's just a fascinating thing this flock behavior of birds today on smarter every day I want to talk about that it has to do with a mathematical algorithm called Boyd's algorithm and I've got a computer scientist buddy named Ben dieter he's gonna walk us through that by showing us the man oh my goodness you can't see it on film yet because of the pixel resolution but there is a Tod over there and they're all coming to meet right here boom and we're off they win about a mile down the road let's go look at him we're gonna see if we can see them there they are trying to do this safely here and we'll go to the service road just off of the interstate oh man this is what I normally see every day let's just watch the birds when you're watching them think about it in the bird level like one individual bird and think about it from the perspective on the whole flock it's beautiful and you can see like it's almost like coolant flowing and you can see like areas of high pressure or high burden to the areas of low bird density it's beautiful aqua talking now let's just watch birds because their goal [Music] every single bird is making decisions based on a very simple set of criteria [Music] so I've watched the birds in this specific location for years and I loved it it's magical every time but I've recently learned that this is an example of what's called emergent behavior the decisions of a single bird when thrown in the mix with the decisions of a myriad of other birds creates this beautiful aerodynamic dance I didn't fully understand how this works in flocking Birds until recently when I was at my friend Ben eaters place out in California Ben designs and builds his own computers from the individual electronic components demonstrating how these simple components are combined to make complex modern computers Ben either is an amazing programmer with a youtube channel you should definitely check out and there's an algorithm that simulates flocking behavior in birds oh really it's called the Boyd's algorithm like bird I object okay or sounds like a New Yorker saying bird okay so your Bell this is what I didn't need to see this no you haven't seen this before no so this is just an implementation of the voids algorithm oh okay okay so it's very difficult but like I'm tracking some of them and they are kind of gravitationally pulled towards the other one is that what I'm seeing yeah so there's actually three things going on here so let me show you what they are is this how actual birds work quite possibly really yeah so they're they're doing a couple things so what are you changing parameters on the fly I'm gonna change the code so that they don't do all the things that they're doing so we can just say isolate each one okay just show you what it's doing so the first thing that they do is they just fly towards the center of mass okay so it's just a bunch of different things they all have a velocity and it says every time period every tick every frame whatever but is drifting there just and that's because they're not turning immediately so there's and this is this is why I went with this algorithm there's a lot of different parameters you can tune okay so one parameter you can tune is like how quickly does it drift towards the center of mass okay and so what you'll see is if we keep this running for a while that ball will just get more and more dense and they'll all just kind of collapse into one point like a singularity it's like okay the guys are just all attracted to each other but that will eventually collapse onto itself and so the other the second of the sort of three things that you do in a void simulation like this is you tell the objects to avoid each other so instead of just coming in and eventually collapsing they if they get too close to something they'll turn away from because the birds would fall out of the sky yeah cuz birds don't hit each other okay so they're like they're attracted but they're kind of like both electrons and they repel just a little bit yeah so it's so so we've got two rules right which is fly towards the center of the flock and then avoid other birds okay and that's that gives you this you get this sort of like jumbling cloud so that's only two rules yep Jim rules and you get that okay and then the third rule is try to match your velocity with the other birds and velocity is speed and direction okay so this will start to get them to align in in the same direction so now they're gonna try to match vectors and now you owe the flocking behavior that is so pleasant dude and that's and that is essentially the Boyd's algorithm and then there's a few things you can wait so we're seeing three things in there you've seen three things going so they're attracted to each other in fact into each other they're trying not to hit each other yep and they're trying to match vectors Wow and then you get this flocking behavior that looks looks like birds it looks like fish it looks like insects it's pretty cool dude it's really cool you know and so you can do other things you can say instead of flying towards the center of the sort of the average position of all the birds fly towards the ones that are within some radius of you which is actually a bit more realistic because birds don't know where all the other birds are they're just know we're the ones near Denmark right and that makes it a lot more interesting because now you get these little groups that break off yeah which I see that often in nature but that's a that's a little more broken than I'm used to so what parameter are you changing there so I have this visual range parameter so we can crank it up a little bit and they'll form tighter groups all too much for hunger it's starting to feel more like the the Assembly of a murmuration what's interesting is when they pass okay yeah there you go it took them a while but they all got together that feels normal yeah that feels more real [Music] I am in love with this it's just math that's all this is each bird is naked based on man pick a bird and watch it and watch the decisions it makes [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] as they present their bodies to you they get like really dark you see that pattern right there it's really dark but as they point towards you away from you the aspect angle of their bodies is thinner so they look transparent but then they'll flash in another direction and they get solid looking again as a cloud there you go see it isn't that awesome look at that okay the cool thing about living where I live is I'm up next to wheeler National Wildlife Refuge and every year thousands of cranes come down here to winter today as I was driving by I noticed that there were thousands of them and they're all flying in a flock but I noticed that the flock for these cranes is very different than the small birds and I think it has to do with the fact that the shape of I'm sorry they're flying overhead and I got excited the reason the big birds point in one direction and stay going in one direction is because they're less maneuverable than the small birds and that's fascinating to me the overall shape of the flock is a function of the maneuverability of would it be the largest bird in the flock the least maneuverable bird in the flock maybe okay here's a walking trail I've done this since I was a little boy and it goes to a hidden observatory so that we can see these birds that have migrated here Shh I really like little bridges here [Applause] there's a lot of people here today it is my understanding that that white one right there is the endangered whooping crane so there's one whooping crane I hear how do you say they say whooping crane whooping crane whooping [Applause] one thing I find interesting is as they start walking in one direction they all try to like walk in the same line and I wonder if that Boyd's algorithm is kind of working on the ground as well like I wonder if they are walking in the same direction in in the same type of pattern that they would fly in I don't know it's something to think about this episode of smarter every day is sponsored by Kiwi Co there are several different types of kids they send to your house everything you need to assemble the kit is included in the box we actually went to headquarters which one did you get this is this is for you this one's yours this is a

it so flip it right down in there there you go yeah how old are you there's a ton of different grace to choose from whether you're for or a hundred and four there's something that you will enjoy so go check it out at Kiwi cocom and slash smarter to get the first one for free and that's like a twenty dollar value or something like that it's a subscription box so it comes right to your house and everything's included go that's legit man you're gonna dig it we really like it I'm gonna go in this store right here and ask them if the birds always are here I have a feeling they are but they would know since they work here how's it going we were filming the birds all right so this is Andy and he puts up with the birds they're here all the time right every fall in winter what was your name ma'am Wanda Wanda so mostly during wintertime and they stay for a couple months in the morning so do you like the birds they're neat to watch but they're big news I could smell it a little bit out there I think that's how they say really hard smelly and rough you wonder if you start smelling that's when they start coming in what is the smell their droppings their urine and poop yeah that's amazing well thanks for letting me hang out in your parking lot I Rover okay my name is Destin okay yeah Andy and Wanda thank you so much yummy good good people in Alabama that's Andy's RV service who they're going to the ground now I think they're done all right the birds are about to go to sleep I guess go to their little nest or wherever Birds go I hope you enjoyed this episode big thanks to Ben eater for showing me how all this stuff works it's pretty cool how powerful a system you can create with just a few simple rules if you feel like this video earned your subscription please consider doing that maybe hit the bell if not no big deal thanks to the patrons that support smarter every day I just want you to look at Birds in a new way and think about what each individual bird is doing and what rules dictate the movement of the entire flock anyway I hope you enjoyed this I'm destined to get smarter every day have a good one bye [Music]
