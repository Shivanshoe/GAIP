hey it's me destin welcome back to smarter every day i recently got to spend some time with the united states coast guard and i gotta say i was blown away a lot of people don't even know about the coast guard or think about the coast guard but it's awesome there's so much to learn here for example did you know the us coast guard was originally thought of by alexander hamilton it totally was you can read about it in the federalist papers the coast guard is america's oldest defense force actually four years older than the navy i ended up learning so much about a whole bunch of different cool stuff that there's no way i could fit it into one episode yes sir so welcome to the smarter everyday deep dive series into the u.s coast guard in this series we're going to get to explore what the coast guard is and how it is that they do what they do the equipment is rad the tactics are smart but it's the people that impressed me the most and many of these folks are really young they're out there every day thinking ahead training ahead to be able to help you and your family and friends if you ever need it but there's actually far more to the coast guard than i realized seriously did you know the coast guard has huge boats like this these things obviously do more than just plug people out of the water when they're in distress but getting plucked out of the water is a pretty good place to start you're bobbing out in the ocean because your boat sank like this one we'll see that in a later episode and the coast guard shows up over the horizon and they pull you to safety how does that happen obviously the boats and helicopters and all the gear is really awesome and we'll go through those in later episodes but how are all these assets coordinated before that basket comes down and plucks you out of the water a whole bunch of decisions have been made by many teams in many different places that's what i want to learn about today how does a rescue mission start and how does it finish so today let's go get smarter every day and learn about the organization of the us coast guard is this artwork awesome or what an artist named penny made that it is so awesome thank you so much penny okay let's get this thing started i live in north alabama and a lot of the coast guard station on the coast there's other places as well but for today we're gonna go down to the coast to go to mobile alabama to what the coast guard calls sector mobile it's a sector mobile where i met lieutenant trevor valette who told me we were about to head into the room where they coordinate search and rescue operations when we got inside the first thing we did is go through a secured door to a place where people aren't usually allowed to film so this felt pretty special we then walked through a glass door into a room that was far more important than i realized what happens in this room could literally mean life or death for some people are you guys am i okay to film in here just not that you see the red stickers got it understood not that of the cameras but everything else you're good to go all right sounds good that besides okay after the after the fact we can blur anything and everything we'll make sure that so we're in the command center so or is that the right way of saying it command center yes okay i'm i'm destined hi kate kate pleasure to meet you how's it going okay so i'm the command center chief pleasure to meet you and ms sullivan is the enforcement chief for sector so we're piers nice to meet you um kind of everything kind of flows together between the departments we all own a little piece of the pie when it comes to coast guard missions we have uh several different positions here um so everything from our comms room to our search and rescue desk to our marine safety kind of multi-mission desk over here our su our situation unit to our command duty officer who kind of sees is kind of the watch captain so these if i understand correctly so these four desks right here you each have a different responsibility and you are so sorry search and rescue okay but what are you doing over here i'm just a situation unit mainly in charge of keeping track of common operating picture between eastern aorta and western union water so the weather our assets and the other plane events happening okay in the area so when you say aor area of responsibility you told me that earlier lieutenant valet so area of responsibility so what's eastern aor and what's western aor western aor is the pro river west bank of pearl river uh-huh eastern europe is the jefferson county line i can't okay okay cool so all the gulf coast to the to the chunk of it until the part of florida that turns down a bit that's crazy okay so we have about 435 nautical miles of coastline that we we oversee you never know what you're going to get like i said like last night i mean as we roll into the search and rescue season one day it may be a few cases i can tell you the last 24 hours have been extremely busy we've had everything from prevention cases to search and rescue cases to law enforcement cases so at this point they were just about to do a change of watch where the watch commander that we were just speaking to gets replaced for the next shift and he was sharing the status and history of the open cases when i heard this sound my buddy george who would come with me in case more than one thing happened at once turned on a second camera what's going on kevin you said you were missing some of your family members okay so apparently a call just came in and this is real and it feels weird this past wednesday okay and so he was dropping your son off on wednesday that's when you last heard from them and where did you drop them off at do you know the marina or harbor and when were they due to their destination and what destination point so i went to this room because i wanted to understand how search and rescue worked right but when i started actually listening to what smith was saying and understood how she was doing it i realized this was for keeps like this is real and i started to feel like i shouldn't be in the room okay yeah i'm going to get a little bit more information i just wanted to get that back story from you um so give me a description of the vessel first of all so you said it was a sailing vessel so is this normal so right now we are still really in the early stages of this gathering information so she's trying to find locations yeah so what we'll do so a lot of these cases when it's overdue what we'll do is let's say for instance it's a um a member went out fishing and never came back so we'll send resources down to the boat ramp to see if the truck and trailer are still there if it is our uh you know our concern goes up so before it's a search and rescue it feels like an investigation it is there is there's significant investigative work that goes into specifically with an overdue case um oh that's weird i didn't expect that i kind of thought it was cut and dry like hey this person's in distress this person is lost at this location but she's like scrolling the map and i tell you one of the one of the newer pieces of technology we have here is called i-911 so we enter our phone number here it goes out it goes out to the member they would see it pop up hey the coast guard's trying to get in touch with you they would click the link it sends that back to here and we'll populate where they're at that way we have a position on them there's four to five key items that we really need to get you know positions always the first one so if we have a position we can put resources to there to their location uh nature distress you know what's the problem are you taking on water are you on fire are you overdue is it a medical emergency are you just this are you broken down um number of people on board because you know you always want to know hey if we're responding are there multiple people involved that way when we do conduct a search we have full accountability of everybody on board and then description of the vessel we want to know what we're looking for right so a lot of that is carried out through these checklists through us called an initial search and rescue checklist so we go through we try to fill out all that information that way when we put resources out there they're set up for success to locate the vessel and to render assistance as needed one thing that happened that i didn't expect when the phone rang i heard emotion in her voice like she was empathetic towards the person that was clearly in distress and so there's a component there too where you're trying to manage people's hope and oh yeah things like i tell you we are a the lifeline between families and the mariners all right so that's what it looks like to open a case with the coast guard from the coast guard's perspective which was admittedly a little bit more dramatic than i was expecting but it's very interesting and we'll come back to smith in the future but what i want to do now is go speak to someone we met earlier about what it's like to open a case versus what it's like to close a case lieutenant commander kate sullivan so you were telling me that anybody can open a case correct a phone call comes in the case starts right correct so starting a case is a flare or or a phone call it could be lots of different things or a radio call or what else there's uh 16 different types of distress uh signals in the um really correct 16. 16. please don't make me go through all 16 of them is this good or bad so all those things start the case correct but only a few people can close the case or i guess it depends on how the case ends only a few people can suspend a case suspend suspend what does that word mean suspend means that whatever we are looking for we did not find okay so a lot of different options available let's say somebody says mayday mayday over the radio if we don't find who made that broadcast we do search efforts we never found we suspend the case we get a report of flares we did searching we never find who shot the flares we suspend that there's a person known to be missing we cannot find the person after extensive searching we suspend now we close if same instances person shot off flares we do searching we find the people that shot the flares they said i shot those flares we can close that case because we were able to correlate whatever the distress was with the person who did that uh initiated the distress the search and rescue system right so that's the difference between suspending suspending whatever you're looking for you didn't find or you didn't correlate or closing you found what you were looking for or you correlated whatever the distress was with whomever initiated i think i'm getting it so so there's ways that cases start you close the case if you find the thing correct you suspend the case if you can't find the thing and certain criteria have been met correct the goal is to end the case in a favorable way as quickly as possible and and you go until you find a resolution or you suspend the case because continuing to search will not garner any different results in my mind there's you send out aircraft and they'll search in a zigzag pattern is that real it very much is real there's numerous types of patterns that you know i'm sure the watch can show you whether it's a creeping line pattern whether it's a parallel search pattern so in a future episode we're going to talk about those search patterns out over the water specifically a victor sierra but for now let's go back to the call center where smith is still working that first case and another call has come in we got another one um i just heard each marine police call out to alabama marine and uh talking about a vessel taking on water by aliens sandwiches probably not gonna make it we had another call come in for a vessel taking our water i went to the radio room to listen in and try to figure out what was going on marine three this is coast guard on channel 22 alpha could i get a good brief description on what the vessel looks like over uh blue out of 24 foot center console uh alabama registration roger that's a good copy is there a vessel name over could i get a good gps position from them at this point we're not equipped roger just to confirm uh near bird island directly south of bird island by about 50 yards roger good copy south of bird island please stand by 22. but it was two two uh other government agencies that are talking to each other about the vessel so they're already on scene with the vessel uh but they shift it off the channel so we can't now i'm gonna have to make a phone call and see if i can get some other information about it okay so if you so if you have someone on scene do you guys need to show up well we still if the vessel sinks then we still gotta look at make sure they get recovered right but then you gotta look at the other missions which is pollution and how are they gonna recover that vessel you know so it's not a hazard navigation so there's a whole bunch of different things that go into it that you have to kind of prioritize everything from search to rescue to pollution to hazards you know so there's a big field that goes into it of the way you got to think about it so when the whole bunch of things start coming in then you got to kind of prioritize first search and rescue than the rest of your missions right we're kind of in the trenches here and what i want to do now is zoom out a little bit i want to understand the overall context of where we're at within the coast guard lieutenant valette walked me across the base we saw all kinds of cool stuff we'll talk about in future episodes but for now let's go meet the person in charge okay so i'm here with captain allen and you're over sector mobile correct i am i'm the sector commander for mobile okay so my understanding from a conversation we had earlier is that you've got coast guard stations and that rolls up to sector and then sector rolls up to district and then district rolls up to atlantic area atlantic area and then headquarters and then headquarters which is in dc right that's right that's where our commandant and vice commandant are do they like give you information that you have to obey or that goes down through the district actually headquarters creates policy for us and um we're more operational unit so with sector under the sector umbrella we have 18 units essentially we have six boat stations we have six coast guard cutters we have five aids to navigation teams and we have one marine safety detachment which is kind of like a one of our many units all the way in panama city you're keeping navigational beacons going that's right you're doing search and rescue and then what else we uh drug enforcement we do actually we have 11 statutory missions and we do all of them except for uh arctic operations ice breaking um for search and rescue that's our primary here do you have a map of the area under your authority is there a map here we can look at or it's not called a map right chart a chart um do we have a chart we can look at so right here is can i come in here absolutely our area of responsibility which is mississippi alabama and northwest florida over to saint mark's which is near tallahassee okay so you are here in mobile that's correct we're right here and so you deploy to all these areas right we actually have stations and cutters in all of these areas so it's not so much a deployment you're just there already we're there already we're ready to respond we respond within a half an hour at a moment's notice we also have units in northern alabama which you see here are two river systems that are in there oh yeah like alabama has some of like is it true we have more interstate waterways per unit area than almost any other state that is true is it really absolutely and we have a lot of commerce on these rivers as well barges and everything all the goods that come up and down the river really and then we have a lot of vessels that come in and out of ports along the coast here we have five deep water ports we have two small ports as well and uh i'm the captain of port for all of those ports as well to keep those ports operational oh really right i'm starting to understand the magnitude of the person i'm speaking to okay i'm sorry so you're in control of the port i uh oversee the port we're cut the coast guard's kind of like the doctors on the water if anything goes wrong we fix it during the hurricane i have the authority to close the ports and then we reopen them as soon as possible that's a big deal it is it is so that's a responsibility have you ever done that i have actually during this last season it was a record season we had to open and close the ports many times i think about five times we had to do this but we don't do it in a vacuum i certainly don't do in a vacuum i do it with our partners our industry partners our port partners our pilots that are out there piloting the vessels in and out i don't make the decision alone i get lots of input and feedback before i do anything like that so this was a great chat with captain alan but for now we still have an open case in the command center i still feel things about that and if you recall there's two ways that a case can end it's either suspended or closed so let's go back and find out what happened there and it's lieutenant smith yeah lieutenant junior grade smith oh pleasure to meet you i appreciate the promotion but i'm not there yet sounds good so so two things i noticed that uh you had a special uh inflection in your voice when you answered the phone yeah what was that about like you were being like you wanted them to feel comfort and care did not expect that right what were you doing there um one it's you know kind of stressful when you're dealing with anybody who's concerned right if you're calling worried about your loved ones like you don't want to feel panicky it makes you forget things it makes you kind of stress out and to like maybe escalate the situation so we just want to like start at the baseline and make sure we are calm cool collected so we can get as much information as we can because the more information we have the more we can help the faster we can help so that's really important plus just from a personal standpoint too i would want to be comforted a little bit too like make sure everyone is helping me isn't panicking as well and that's kind of a key component to what we do back here is yes we deal with real high stress situations but we can't get stressed on top of that because we need to think clearly we need to be smooth when we respond to everything so so what can you walk me through the the thing that you filled out here oh i i kind of do things a little bit backwards just because of the way my brain i i like taking long hand notes just getting as much information i have this as a reference to make sure i'm asking the right questions but my handwriting is a little too sloppy to fill out this neatly so i usually take it all on a chronological sheet this is just like our standard note taking for any call that comes in and then i transfer that information to our qrc so our quick response check sheet this is the this is the qrc yes and we have one for each individual case that may occur so this individual was calling because he was concerned about family members that went on a sailing voyage that he hadn't heard from in a couple of days so they were going to be unreported is what we would classify that because he wasn't due back until june 2nd so he wasn't technically late just yet but there was enough concern because he hasn't been hearing from him so this is all the information that we've kind of gathered as the coast guard that helps us determine what actions to take from this particular case so uh asking a lot of where were they going where did you last see them yeah i heard that you you were saying were they supposed to be did they mention they were gonna go explore a cave or you know you didn't say that but you know yeah just what they were gonna do so were you what happened to resolve it because when you answered the phone i was like i'm just gonna film this call center and then you answer the phone and everything got serious for me real quick right yeah and then it was resolved i would i need you to tell me why things are good now yeah things are good because as we're doing all the investigative work uh the individual he was concerned about called back finally or texted rather so and how long had this individual been lost three days so you know just enough to concern you know and we're gonna be concerned if everybody else is concerned too so were they a little embarrassed like were they they they waited three days to call here or well no he so the the family member called us today because he figured they were on a sailing voyage exploring around maybe they just had fun lost track of time but after three days he thought i should have heard from them by now he got the text message from his family member saying hey sorry we're okay um he did not realize the individual that's on the sailboat that we were already involved at this point and so i don't know if they're embarrassed or not they shouldn't be i mean if you're out on the water yes please check in with your loved ones because otherwise they get worried we get worried it becomes a big deal um like how what did you feel like did you kind of like mentally roll your eyes like oh they called me no just an immediate relief because this is you know you start automatically thinking worst case scenario like i think we're kind of all pre programmed to think that way it's like all right if this is the worst case scenario what do we have to do and so you know i'm already starting to mentally roll through once i get all this information what we're going to have to do which would entail quite a bit but when somebody is found that's our ultimate goal so if that happens without our help i'm just happy that they are okay so that's the search and rescue desk over there i see a bunch of phones i i feel like i'm in the way imagine being a member of a force whose job is to save lives that's incredible the coast guard is not a part of the department of defense they're part of the department of homeland security and they wake up every day thinking about what they can do to be ready to save someone simper paratus always ready i feel incredibly blessed to make a series like this we're gonna get like ridiculous access we're gonna go learn what it's like to be a rescue swimmer we're gonna
