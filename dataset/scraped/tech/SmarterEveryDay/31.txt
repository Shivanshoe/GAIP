hey it's me destin welcome back to smarter every day today on smarter every day we are going to learn about the top like top top top people that exists um you've heard of astronauts and how big of a deal it is to become an astronaut you've heard of navy seals and how big of a deal it is to become a navy seal we're going to look at navy seal astronauts today on smarter every day we're going to meet these people we're going to understand what makes them tick i'm going to start here at the u.s navy underwater demolitions team navy seal museum and we're going to go in and we're going to just see what's going on what a navy seal is how they work and then we're gonna go meet some of these people all right walking into the museum here this is the first time in my life i've ever seen a legitimate grappling hook like you see in gi joe that's wild so this museum which is located in fort pierce florida by the way is fascinating and really cool and it helped me get a sense of how and why special warfare units evolved in the first place but it gave me more than just a sense of seal team history it gave me a sense of seal ideals and operating principles which it's clear is at the heart of seal team excellence we're going to come back and explore some of these things but first i want to stop at this exhibit it's on three seals who are the reason for this video so here's an entire exhibit about nasa's space program here here you got bill shepard chris cassidy johnny kim okay i'm at johnson space center nasa facility and we have a rare opportunity to talk to chris cassidy you're about to go up right yeah i am okay so are you excited about that oh how can you not be yeah it's a pretty big deal but you're different and it has to do with that right there i got a little too close there don't hurt me the the trident can you tell me a little bit about that about the trident itself well it represents a whole lot of hard work and a lot of blood sweat and tears to get it and i'm very proud to be wearing it having having the trident you see another trident walk in the room that that has to mean well for us on the inside it's a bond like right away there's a brotherhood amongst uh all of us that's all i think about it is he's part of he's part of my brotherhood and i can trust that guy implicitly okay this is interesting i just learned about the trident and what this means there's a lot to it according to this plaque right here the flintlock here which is cocked and ready to go it doesn't seem to be cocked here but it says here in this signal here that it's ready to go this is a symbol of a navy seals abilities on land seal is an acronym for sea air and land also you've got the trident here which symbolizes the seals connection to the sea the hardest element for any warrior to operate in it's the one where the seal finds themselves the most comfortable the interesting thing here is look at the eagle according to this plaque on most seals that you see with the united states the eagle has their head held high but right there built into the trident it says that on the seal check this out and still insignia the eagle's head is lowered to remind each of us that humility is the true measure of a warrior's strength that's awesome i'm gonna be honest when i grew up in the 90s a navy seal was like this meathead big muscles you know really good with guns can just you know beat people up or whatever but that's not what it is is it like it seems to be an intelligent person that like picked a path and did some i mean where'd you go to school what'd you do yeah so i went to normal high school and then i went to the naval academy got a masters in mit later on in my once i was in the seal team so but what was the master's in ocean engineering okay and what was your undergrad in math okay mathematics does you you cannot pick a stereotypical seal in fact you show up i remember showing up on my first day of buds training and there's 120 guys lined up and um tall short thick skinny i mean and of those variety you couldn't pick who was going to be successful and who wasn't really all in the head in the heart what do you mean uh well there's like this fire in the gut that you have to have that have they have to realize that you can't get through it by yourself you have to realize that no matter how tough and strong you are the instructors will find that edge and push you to that limit and make sure that to test your metal kind of and see if you've got the don't quit type attitude that we need and that can come in any package what type of people would you hope would would continue to try to get that trident at the core what is a good seal a good seal is someone that has all those intangibles that we already talked about never quit just innate fire in the gut to get the mission done reliable to the end we have a seal ethos and and i won't recite it here but you can you can reference it and the seal ethos is exactly who the man uh the men we're looking for and soon women too if you speak to an abc you hear a lot about the ethos and some of the qualities in this long creed that you can read for yourself my word is my bond i will not fail i am never out of the fight it's a very interesting read i highly recommend it and these are things that you can apply to your life even if you're not a warrior not a trigger puller it's it's something to aspire to essentially it's trying to communicate that the seal the individual wearing this trident is the person that represents all of our core values at the end of every paragraph i am that man i am that warrior so you've done crazy things you've done things you'll never tell anybody i'm sure but the things that are most interesting to me are the times when you've been in a vehicle of some sort and then you got out of that vehicle like for example um i'm assuming you've jumped out of a helicopter i've jumped out of a helicopter i'm assuming you've jumped out of an airplane i have i'm assuming you've got out of a boat i have but the coolest vehicle that i've ever gotten out of is a sealed delivery vehicle have you ever seen those yes those things were amazing that was my first job in the seal teams so do you get out of a submarine so it's it's it's like a series of nesting russian dolls you've got the seal delivery vehicle inside of a dry deck shelter which is mounted to the full-size submarine okay so you're you're eating your chow and doing all your mission prep inside the submarine you you transfer up into the dry deck shelter close some hatches again very similar to what we do on a spacewalk and then open some valves at flood water into this um hanger and then you can equalize pressure open this giant door and then push the ceiling vehicle out there it is look at that let's go check this thing oh we can actually look inside this one okay i'm pretty pumped about this it's a wet sub so they have all different types of gear whatever they need to do their job but they have their own breathing devices and this is amazing we have the bowel plains up front this is the rudder it's basically flying through the water so that would be an elevator on an airplane i'm assuming it's the same here control here and you have control there propulsion there i'm only assuming that's batteries oh i can get in okay i'm doing it if you were a seal in this you're guiding yourself to the target with math the whole idea of this thing is the the submarine can't go all the way up to shore because it's too shallow so the seals get in this and you've got to guide yourself there so obviously you've got you know magnetic compass to guide you there but let's read here so we've got altitude so they say altitude they don't say depth so it does feel like flying doesn't it okay so distance in yards bearing oh there's also a range so you think in spherical coordinates when you're in this thing that tells me that uh yards left yards right okay so they have some way of knowing where a target is and going to that okay there we go doppler so we have doppler reset navigation test i'm learning a lot of things let's say that so okay we have two different types of communication okay we've got radio i'm assuming we have underwater communication um we have pressure so that's our overall pressure i'm looking back behind me on my shoulder here and i'm seeing these big tanks can you see that it's kind of hard to see so i've got a manifold here i can open and close or they lock whoa there's pressure in that oh just because of heat oh that's neat that means there'll be pressure in this one yeah because it's the the heat of the day so all that's going to my manifold here which is going around here to okay that right there is just a normal scuba din connector so i could put my my breathing device on that so yeah look at that that's scuba divers know what i'm pointing at right here this is how you fly this thing just figured that out so check this out we have a this reminds me of trim and a cessna 172. this right here is a left and right stick does this button push down no not with my my hand it doesn't so that goes left and right so this is kind of the person that's flying this thing i'm going to call him the pilot of course i don't know what this person is called but um it looks like yeah look at that nose down oh okay so that wasn't bearing to target that was just nose down or nose up okay i understand now oh that's cool this is how you would fly this thing you would sit in this location um you would probably be negatively buoyant inside here if i was a seal that's what i would want i would want to be able to sit my booty down here and then i would just grab this stick and i would go left and right like that and then i would go up and down with that and i would try to match the needles with where i wanted to go so this is my desired course and this is my magnetic compass so i'm looking at this and i'm looking at that and i'm trying to get to where i want to go this is amazing this looks like the coolest thing ever it is one of the coolest missions in the navy i think i mean i just absolutely loved it what i loved about it so much was that uh when myself and my buddy back in the day my buddy was travis when travis and i would submerge it was just the two of us figuring out problems yeah you don't have nowadays on missions you're tied to a radio back there's a overhead coverage and infrared video and everybody is is watching and part of your decision-making process in a sealed delivery vehicle submerge you've got all the intel you had when you at the time you submerged and now you're just dealing with data and problems and what the environment hands you what the equipment hands you and what the enemy hands you and uh and just with your knowledge of what the overall intent of the mission is figure that out so so you're literally as a navy seal you are a deployable asset which can be launched from any moving vehicle at any time and you can be given an objective and you can use what you have in your brain to figure out that objective and i think that's a really critical point use what you have in your brain we you can train a lot of people in in the military in the united states or any part any country in the world to be a great shooter to run fast do lots of pull-ups and jump out airplanes and do all those things but really what i think makes special operators special is the ability to do all that and and think through problems creatively and and get the job done if the situation is dealt with them where it's completely out of the box so the ultimate vehicle to get out of the international space station is it at this point in our on our space flight history that's the place that's the uh that's where we do space rocks from and hopefully i'll get to do one coming up here this your face changed when i said this because i love it yeah it's a passion of mine to put a spacesuit on there's a few things that we do as an astronaut that you don't feel like an astronaut when you do them here at work it's normal emails and meetings and that you don't have to be an astronaut to do that kind of stuff and when you're busy on the space station and you're running around carrying bags it's easy to forget after you've adjusted the floating and you don't actually think about the floating part sometimes it's easy to forget where you are and i would when that happened to me maybe every couple days i'd float by the window and stop and look and go oh yeah oh by the way i'm right i'm in space and uh how lucky are you to be here uh but putting a spacesuit on closing that gold visor exiting out to the uh the vastness in the vacuum of space it's unlike anything else we do as astronauts is that your happy place hanging out there on the outside of the space station yeah i just really like it i i like the the the sense of accomplishment i like the sense of teamwork the broader teamwork the whole ground team that's there that provides the equipment the procedures and all the preparation we work together to get it done so you are planning to do an eva this time so i'm launching april 9th it's looking like there we're going to have a spacewalk with drew morgan and myself somewhere around the 11th 12th 13th of april so are you excited oh hell yeah that's awesome what are you what are you going to do you know what the mission is of the eva uh we do in fact the the procedures are being put together right now haven't actually seen the procedures yet and i assume in the next couple weeks they'll send send it to me here on the ground and drew in space and we'll review them independently and then we'll have a day or so to look at them together when we get there so you're gonna so the way it works is you and drew are about to be teamed up you're going to exit the space exit the air airlock interlock okay and then you're going to go out there and and do whatever it is and then you're going to come back and then at the moment the airlock closes behind you are you going to be happy or sad well so earlier in my career when i just assumed i would have more space flights i i was always happy when i got back inside you know it represented a lot of hard work you're tired you're hungry it's been a long day spacewalks are a long day of of putting out effort this time however i don't know if this is my last space flight i'm 50 years old this will be my third mission it's quite conceivable that this might be the end of my my space flight career i don't necessarily want that to be the case but you just never know and i and i'm mature enough in my thinking that i appreciate every day and trying to get smarter every day thank you and um and i don't know if it's the last one so there'll be this certain feeling of wow will i ever get out there again i don't know so it might be some some different feelings this time coming back in i'm gonna be watching when you do your space walk cool yeah i'll be watching too from the from a different perspective thank you very much for your time thanks a lot i had this conversation with chris cassidy at the neutral buoyancy lab which is basically a big pool where astronauts can get in the space suit and divers help them get neutrally buoyant which means they don't go up or down or spin anyway while i was waiting on chris that morning i got to meet some of the safety divers and a couple of them were actually navy seals so after the discussion with chris we walked outside to the pool and one of those divers was there so you know this place like the back of your hand this is your playground this is a playground this is where we hang out and this is where we you can't you can't go to space to train for it you got to do all the preparation here that's one thing that's different with with the steel teams we can create some pretty good combat scenarios in the seal teams and uh oh yeah and and train for combat towns and whatever with role players and the whole nine yards here in a first for space it's somewhat different so we have to use different facilities we have a building where we have the the mock-ups of the spacecraft where we do the inside training here in the pool we do all the outside training and we have computers for virtual reality and that kind of thing so is this like home to you this is absolutely home to me and uh uh when i yeah i l i i feel like the divers are a part of the family you know i know all of them really well and uh it's just cool place to be that's sweet so this guy over here is a seal when was your bud's class my blood's class was in 2004 class 253 2004 and you were uh 1994. okay 192. so there's a difference here it's like i mean this hair is amazing [Laughter] but but there's like a like the the trident matters and you know you're obviously an astronaut you know you're a diver but there's a bond there that could not be created any other way that's what we were talking about earlier that brotherhood that exists you meet a guy that went through training doesn't matter what year right like doesn't matter what the buzz class really it all falls back on that that base of suffering that we all had to endure you know and i i know this guy i know what he's capable of i know how for the most part how he's going to react under stressful conditions so i i can rely on that i don't even have to question it it's funny he's saying the same thing the same conversation we had down there that's because it's that's a universal feeling really it's basically can't even rehearse that answer yeah but it's it's a baseline thing baseline through pain these are apollo capsules why are they at the museum model was a training device used by underwater demolition team recovery teams during the apollo space missions to prepare for the actual splash downs the frogmen connected a flotation collar around the capsule to prevent it from seeking look at that they opened the hatch ensured astronauts were loaded safely aboard wow udt's played a vital role in mercury gemini and apollo space missions did not know that so the the connection between space and underwater demolitions slash navy seals goes a long way back apparently the latest navy seal to be selected for nasa's astronaut corps is dr johnny kim right out of high school at 18 years old johnny enlisted in the navy and then made it through buds to become a seal he completed over 100 combat operations and received the silver star and the bronze star with the combat v for valor he studied math and later attended harvard medical school where he earned his medical degree in 2016. so johnny you are several things uh i mean medical doctor navy seal astronaut you've you've done a lot and um you're also very humble about it and and that's amazing and i really appreciate your reputation in that regard i just wanted to just ask right off the bat what's it like to be a member of these communities you know i've been very humbled by working with amazing people who have sacrificed a lot and i find that everywhere i go it was certainly in the seal teams working alongside other seals soldiers marines who who bled who gave their lives for their duty and i saw that in medicine people you see that now today especially with the coronavirus situation that we're in you see front line first responders who who sacrifice a lot in the line of duty for other people that kind of service to other people has always stuck with me from the military stuck with me in medicine and is also present in the astronaut core so i i guess if i had to choose a word i i would say that i feel very blessed to have had these opportunities so so you're just the way you operate you're a very other centered type person i guess i never thought of it that way but i i like yeah i like that i like the way that sounds i want to talk to you a little bit about what it's like to enter the astronaut core behind chris cassidy and you know even something as simple as going through the neutral buoyancy lab like he has a reputation in the lab amongst the divers and i can only imagine that you're watching that yeah dessert he does have a reputation in the nba deservedly so you know even before chris chris had quite big shoes to fill before he entered the astronaut corps the first navy seal to become an astronaut was bill shepard captain bill shepard captain bill shepard is also well known for being the first iss commander expedition one the commonality the common thread i find in all seals is that we love hard things chris has filled those shoes quite well left by bill shepard and he also leaves quite big shoes for a young tadpole like myself it's a great opportunity it's my understanding that when bill shepard interviewed to be an astronaut that he was asked what he's good at and i i don't remember exactly what his answer was was it killing people with a knife or something like it was along those lines along along those lines and so that that was a very different thing to hear in the astronaut interview process i'm sure so let me ask you this what have you learned from chris what you can tell us about uh i've learned a lot of things from chris i i hit i have hit him up for some mbl tips because he's quite good working in the space suit and one of the most important things that he told me you know chris is a strong he's a big strong guy you know one big things he told me is to not fight the suit and to make the suit work for you the suit's a pressurized vessel right you can fight it all you want and it's going to win at the end of the day after six hours it's going to win so you need to learn to leverage the joints the range of motion just the mechanism of movement of the suit to make it do what you want and watching chris work in the suit and taking that advice to heart was really helpful for me in my training okay i want to make it very clear that this section of the video is not endorsed by the navy or nasa this is me destined from smarter everyday talking because smarter everyday is sponsored by audible if you want to get an audio book of your choice you can go to audible.com smarter or text the word smarter to 500-500 i'm going to recommend this book it's called men in green faces by jean wentz a novel of u.s navy seals and the reason i'm recommending this is because it is an educational trip for me the navy seals were pretty much started in the vietnam war you can see why they got the name men in green faces but this section of the museum here is all about vietnam you know you've got all the different diving apparatuses they had to use all this stuff it's very interesting so i just listened to an entire mission that happened in this book so it's it's a good way to learn where all of this culture came from the thing about it though this is war this isn't like a pretty thing it deals with very difficult challenging issues so i only recommend this book for adults you get your first audiobook and access to a huge selection of audible originals for free when you try audible for 30 days i do this to make myself smarter and reclaim my time when i'm doing things like mow in the yard driving things like that they also have tons of podcasts theatrical performances and comedy you can choose from as well so if you'd like to check this out please consider going to audible.com smarter or texting the word smarter to 500 500 and a little link will pop up on your phone and you can just click that link and go download any audiobook you want doesn't have to be this one big thanks to audible for sponsoring smarter every day i'm grateful so let's go learn some more stuff about navy seals and see if we can learn more from chris and johnny here we go so if if there was a young person that was thinking about joining the seals or something like this what would your advice be do some soul searching and look deep inside and come up with the reasons why you're doing it i think it's so important that you do things for the right reason and that they're not superficial especially not being used to leg yourself up in the future and i i'm not saying that trying to get experience to go to a further job is a bad thing but especially when it comes to the seal teams people who join are all in they put all their chips in the table and that's how i was and i think people in that kind of work deserve to be fighting alongside other people who are all in and there for the right reasons so let me ask you what are the right reasons absolutely it should be service for others i mean that is if you don't believe in that then it's just not going to work out in the seal teams there has to be an intrinsic desire in your heart to want to do that not to fulfill some type of preconceived notion that becoming a navy seal would impress your parents or society or other people that's awesome man yeah that gets back to the johnny kim way which is uh service to others huh i think it's it's a sustainable way of living service to others is a sustainable way of living that's very close to my philosophy on life as well chris cassidy launched to the international space station on april 9th as one of the last remaining american astronauts currently scheduled to fly on a russian soyuz vehicle he joined his crewmates in expedition 62 on the iss and what is a very strange moment for america's space program as we transition to commercial crew vehicles these vehicles are coming online and getting tested out what that means is we need to have a persistent american presence on the iss at this moment and chris cassidy is fulfilling that role as commander of expedition 63. as part of this mission when astronauts bob and doug arrived at the international space station in the dragon capsule which was propelled by a falcon 9 rocket that paved the way for chris to do what chris does best get stuff done in a space oh chris who is well suited for adapting in very strange situations is currently the only american astronaut in orbit given the fact that it's almost 20 years after bill shepard commanded iss expedition 1 and the fact that chris is alone currently on the american side of the space station holding down the fort i thought it would be a really interesting time to ask him a few questions about what it means to do an eva and what it means to be a seal all right dustin uh welcome aboard the space station here's uh got the questions on an ipad right here next to anatoly spacesuit so preparing for a mission in the seals and preparing for an eva are actually very similar in both instances we're preparing to mitigate the risks against knowns and unknowns and uh and with the military mission and the seal teams specifically you've got intelligence you you've got information about the target you've got information about the area around and the in the enemy forces and you compile all that to put together a plan and you have resources available to you other other units who can support or help or that you're helping vehicles you can use helicopters you can use other airplanes in the area that can continue to provide intelligence and you piece all that together to get to make a plan and then you rehearse that plan and then you go execute it and inevitably something is going to deviate from the plan and the level of your preparation is uh is kind of sets the tone for how adaptive you can become because everybody just sort of rolls right with the next phase you already thought through that problem and you're ready to deal with it spacewalks are exactly the same thing the enemy is the environment we've got resources available to us the suit all the the tools which you can kind of see some tethers and things here so we've got the suit we've got tools we've got equipment on the outside of the space station and then all the while the environment is the thing that's trying to kill us or harm us or or uh the unknowns that we can encounter are mechanical things that aren't behaving the way we we expected all of that is put together by a team of folks on the ground i'm talking spacewalks and uh in in the nbl in the pool we'll pull all that data together run through a plan that we think is pretty good run through it in the in the water with different astronauts a few times flush out the details uh turn happy to glad in some cases drastically change the plan after you execute it in the pool and realize it doesn't work and then you fine-tune the plan now you get outside and it's time to execute and that's where again your level of preparation you've thought with the what-ifs you have contingency plans and in both a seal mission and an eva those concepts are exactly the same during an eva to what extent are you making decisions in the moment and to what extent are you just doing exactly what you have already planned we are to a large extent executing the plan that is uh has put together by the ground the ground team and we on board we receive that plan we talk about it we know very well the details and then we go outside and execute now it there are i've been on one spacewalk where nothing deviated at all uh in my the most extreme case was a the spacewalk that i was on with luca where he had a leak in his in his uh leaking water into his space suit and we were making real-time decisions it's hard to tell but it feels like a lot of water i see it now legally can you see it's over here right yeah yeah but i have um about the same amount of when i took the helmet down last time chris really yeah i can feel it in the back of my head it's sweat or urine i guess mummy's weapon yeah how much can i sweat though my head is really wet and i have a feeling that it's increasing and i'm thinking that it may i don't know if it's possible but i'm thinking they may be they are cvg that's me thinks is that a possibility just a demand or the cooling you know i haven't touched everything the leak would remain and they would see data but where's their wheels coming from there it's too much i don't know it's a lot all right chris and luca just for you guys based on what we heard with lucas saying that water is in his eyes now and it seems to be increasing uh we think we're going to terminate eva case for ev2 on a more regular basis the type of things on a spacewalk that happens are the mechanical parts and equipment that you're working with don't function or work properly and that's where the the real-time decision-making kind of comes in with the actual spacewalker you are the ones with your hands on the hardware you are the ones that are feeling the forces you are the ones that that is can kind of tell where the bolt starts to stick for instance and that's where experience and a little mechanical sense comes in to be very helpful on a spacewalk because you can then make a good sound judgment on what to do in general we don't make decisions independently on a spacewalk we we converse with our our buddy out there the other eva crew member and in parallel to that with with the ground team and the engineers who are on the ground supporting who know the ins and outs and have the tech technical diagrams in front of them with the specs and and uh the whole all the details and so that's how we're making uh real-time decisions as a team once things start to not go as planned so those are the real-time decisions that the team has to make and then individuals can make real-time decisions like as your finger is on the the cordless drill which is right here actually this is called the pgt pistol grip tool and this big old monster is what's applying the forces to the bolt and and you can even though this is a big thing you can feel through through the tool how the bolt is performing and that's key key data for you to make a real-time decision on is this something i shouldn't put more force into or should i back off or do i need to stop altogether and talk to the subject matter experts so i hope that answers the question but we we strive to make no real time decisions and just have the plan execute as as as written but we're armed with the details and the technical knowledge to make real-time decisions as they as they are needed on the fly all right question three as a seal you're trained in uh military operations armed conflict how does that compare and what does it mean to be part of the international space station so the international space station is exactly that it's a program by mult pulled together by multiple nations to to build this unbelievable structure that we have in low earth orbit called the international space station and the this concept of international collaboration was not new to me when i got to nasa uh in the seal teams in the military and special operations command we're working together with all other nations and their military forces all the time and uh and so it's it has always been something that i've known appreciated and comprehended the value in pulling together multiple countries are multiple cultures and multiple points of view into a military mission or technical problem or or anything that you're trying to solve it just makes makes the uh the solution better more robust and and well thought through so to me i fee i have a great deal of pride of being part of the international space station i had a great deal of pride about being part of multinational military missions in different countries around the world and uh and i think that it's something that will will and should continue as we move from the space station on beyond low earth orbit and ultimately on to mars together multiple nations pulling together to make it happen when i first started this video my goal was to understand how navy seals tick and what makes them good astronauts and at first i thought it would have to do with their toughness and the ability to overcome challenges and obstacles but now i have a different opinion i mean yeah they're good at that stuff but the more important attributes seem to be things that i didn't expect for example humility service to others teamwork this year marks 20 years of continuous human research onboard the international space station five space agencies 15 nations serving research programs for over a hundred countries in my opinion this collaboration is by far the most peaceful venture ever undertaken by humans and it's worthy of the highest praise but the iss has never won the nobel peace prize why i think it should space has a unique way of bringing people together even people who were trained to fight each other there's something really cool to me about seeing chris cassidy's name written in cyrillic on his spacesuit on his navy seal trident just that alone seems like a major international accomplishment as we move forward to the moon and beyond it's encouraging for me to think about what we humans can accomplish if we continue to work together i'm destin you're getting smarter every day have a good one
