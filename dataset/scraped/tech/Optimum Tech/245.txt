hey what is up guys so CES 2020 is pretty much all wrapped up at this point obviously I'm not over there - pretty big commute from here in Australia all the way over there to the US especially for what is mainly a consumer electronics event however there is a lot of cool PC hardware that was launched or announced over at CES 2020 and that's what we're going to sort of round up and summarize today so there was definitely some pretty cool announcements from both AMD and Intel but not so much from Nvidia because as I said this is mostly a consumer electronics event so mostly like TVs and cars and that sort of thing but probably the most sort of announced piece of hardware that I got questioned about was Intel's new Nook 9 lineup so Intel are going to be branching into the small form-factor gaming PC market with the new NOC 9 extreme which is essentially an expanded and modular nook so we're definitely going to be discussing that today as well as a lot of other cool hardware those announced and also a few cases that were also shown off to all right so let's start off with AMD first because I think all eyes are on AMD at this point because they just have so much momentum in the hardware space right now and a lot of people meet sort of included were expecting some sort of announcement or some details at least or a teaser on the fourth generation rise in desktop CPUs or Xen 3 we didn't get that because they don't really have any reason to at this point I mean Xen - just recently launched however they did still have plenty of core releases the most important release at CES 2020 was the risin of 4000 mobile processors finally we have the Zen 2 architecture meeting the laptop market one of the mobile processes that they did announce was an 8 core 16 threaded 4,800 view with a 15 watt TDP and they also announced a higher TDP model around for the same core on thread-count that is the 4800 H now stepping it up quite a bit this is a processor that we were very confident AMD would you know let the reins off NCES 2020 and that is the thread above 3990 X this is a 64 core 128 threaded desktop CPU for reference Intel's Xeon w lineup stretches up to 28 calls so this is more than double that boost clock here is 4.3 gigahertz and that's most likely referring to the single core boost clock you're definitely not going to see all caused October going up to 4.3 and this is going to be available on February 7th for 3990 you OS now some people that sounds very expensive you know $4,000 us for a desktop CPU but for a 64 core CPU that actually is an absolute bargain as I mentioned in my 39 70 X review that's the 32 core 64 thread model which is expensive too but again very good value for that amount of cores and threads these thread Ripper CPUs are targeted towards a very narrow and specific set of users this is not for content creators this is for Hollywood blockbuster movies and very heavy VFX work yeah that is a lot of cause and definitely not for you know content creators and screamers for example still with a very narrow set of use cases it is very EPIK to see that many cause and threads being brought to the desktop cpu market it is the highest core can't CPU at the moment to be plugged into a desktop CPU socket next up we have the rx 5600 XT so this is a GPU that we were really expecting AMD to announce or expect more details on CES and they did announce it and this is a competitor to NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti so spec wise we're looking at 36 compute unit boost clock is up to 15 60 megahertz typical game clock of 13 75 megahertz and 6 gigabytes of gddr5 a competitor against Nvidia's GTX 60 and 60 TI are priced at 279 US dollars those of you who have been keeping up in the hardware space though will know of the GTX 1660 super so essentially this is Nvidia taking the GTX 1660 slapping on the GED r6 memory and only selling it for around two hundred and twenty-nine dollars and the value for that GPU is actually quite good so basically I think AMD should have probably been a little bit more aggressive with the pricing here for example pricing the 5600 XT at around 249 instead a rapid now let's talk about intel's GPU the d g 1x EGP u so this is definitely another final product or announcement we don't have any pricing or release date because they didn't actually show a physical product what instead they showed was a software development vehicle is what they're calling it essentially what this is is a piece of hardware that they can ship to game developers and software developers to actually write the code to work with the hardware that they're developing so what they showed was a single fan what looked like an ITX sized graphics card with probably a very low TDP as well it was shown to be running a few game demos as well but it was most likely under 60fps at this point I am unsure how Intel is going to scale this up to a full-blown graphics card that they're going to compete against AMD and NVIDIA against 1080p and 1440p gaming but only time will tell and we'll have to wait the most noteworthy thing that they had to show off at CES was the new NOC 9 Xtreme a bare-bones kit so until I've been making Knox for a while now and they slowly becoming a lot more gaming oriented and this one is definitely an aggressive push towards that direction so the ghost Canyon knock 9 is a much larger modular knock that actually supports a full desktop graphics card unfortunately though these are still knucks so they are going to be running the mobile CPUs so definitely don't expect desktop CPU class performance these are mobile CPUs with a very low TDP even that I 9 although it is an 8 core 16 threaded model with an advertised boost clock of 5 gigahertz it is just a 45 watt chip so I'm unsure on how far we can overclock that and push that but I am very excited to test that out so the way that this works is that you've got the mainboard with the main components on it the mobile h-series CPU ddr4 so dim memory and I believe up to 2 m dot 2 nvme drives the on board calling for the mainboard and the main component is very small it looks like it's running just a very small 40 mil fan so calling there will definitely be interesting so the enclosures that the stock Intel bare-bones kit comes with at least is very clean it looks like they're running anodized aluminium panels for most of the shell or most of the exterior and then you've got ventilated side panels on both sides the bare-bones kit will support a flex ATX power supply although I'm not sure what that's going to be rated for or how efficient is going to be and it will support a 2 slot graphics card up to 200 millimeters as soon as has actually made their own design for RTX 2070 so we would assume that the Flex ATX power supply in these Knox is probably around 400 to 500 watts and able to support an RT X 2070 quite comfortably and the card that they showed off actually looks quite good quite nice big fans 200 mils and should actually feel that bare-bones kit up quite well the real kicker here though is unfortunately the pricing so for the I 9 we have the bare-bones kit selling for 1700 US Dollars and just to know what you get with the bare-bones kit no graphics card no storage and no memory so once you factor in the graphics card the storage and the memory you're looking at a two and a half thousand dollar small form-factor system now some people have defended that and saying look it's extremely compact can take this thing anywhere but I mean you guys know if you subscribe to the channel we can build extremely tiny pcs under 5 litres under 10 litres quite easily with full desktop components I'm not sure about the volume of this new Nook from Intel at least the smaller bare-bones kit that they're selling but it looks around 10 to 8 liters so although pricing for the I 9 model is $1700 it's still quite steep it's a little bit more conservative for the i7 and the i5 we're looking at $1,200 for the i7 and then $1000 flat for the i5 so probably the i7 is going to be the sweet spot there I know that chip is not going to be overclockable so I mean I'm really excited to review these and see what the performance is going to be like compared to just building a desktop small form-factor PC instead now it'd be a great time to bring up the razor tomahawk so this is something that I've been asked about quite a lot because it does look very similar to the cases that we cover on this channel so just think of intel's bare-bones kit that just made bigger to support full desktop graphics card and a bit more of a premium enclosure now although this is an extremely clean and aesthetic looking exterior there is ZERO thermal design in mind for this case like there wasn't this isn't case design like this is just not case design case design requires you know planning in terms of thermal design and you know enough ventilation for the panels there is no ventilation for this case the top is barely ventilated at all basically we have a very small square cutouts and this probably a dust filter in there as well preventing airflow even more now some of you are probably thinking that okay it's a knock it doesn't really require much cooling because it's a mobile CPU you know 30 to 45 watts but if they're advertising a desktop sized graphics card in there with you know an RT X 2080 I think was most of their marketing material we have seen what happens when you put an RT X 2080 behind glass and not give it enough room to exhaust airflow and bring air flow in it chokes it gets very hot and it gets very loud what razor have done instead has no consideration for the film design of a graphics card and in my opinion it's just kind of making an enclosure that looks cool instead the other thing is that they've got a power supply fan just facing a glass panel and look like why why did you do that the power supply can be potentially the loudest component in a PC especially a small form-factor power supply with a small and loud fan pricing like I said is going to be the real kicker here because the Intel bare-bones kit is already quite expensive we can only imagine what this razor tomahawk is going to cost if the i9 from Intel's one is going to cost around 1,700 US dollars this one is definitely going to cost it north of $2,000 at that point a lot of you would just say just build a small form factor desktop enclosure instead they also said that the size of this one was about 10 liters which is not extremely tiny like we can already build ITX machines around that sort of volume so let me know your thoughts on that one down below and just to close off this discussion about Intel's nook I'm not hating on it I actually think it's really cool and I'm just more excited to test out intel's own bare-bones kit because i think that's what most people should probably be looking at instead now let's discuss a few of the extra announcements that are definitely worth noting so first off we have the ROG z11 ITX case from a sous do you know this is a very large ITX case it's definitely north of 30 liters which would make it bigger than NZXT zone h2 10 it does support a 240 ml AI OV and most of the industrial design or just the general design of the case is around looking cool all looking good not necessarily about space efficiency I believe the price here is going to be around 200 to 250 so you do pay that ROG tax as well Liam Lee announced the O 11 dynamic mini which I think may be my personal favorite for a compact ATX mainstream case essentially what they've done is of course taking the very famous and popular a whole 11 dynamic and shrunken that down to a more compact footprint and volume you do also have the choice of making this a micro ATX enclosure and allowing a little bit more radiator Headroom however I do think this is going to be best suited for an ATX enclosure instead and lastly let's talk about the 360 hurt eSports gaming monitor from a soos this thing is absolutely mental I personally thought it was going to be a while before we saw anything above a 240 Hertz but apparently the technology here is ready so this is a three hundred and sixty Hertz tee and twenty four and a half inch gaming monitor that looks very similar to their previous 240 Hertz to five AQ and of course this gaming monitor is strictly for eSports only most game engines are capped at 200 or 300 frames per second anyway so you wouldn't even beginning the full 360 Hertz benefit let's say apex legends for example that game is capped at 300 FPS however if you take csgo Rainbow six siege or overwatch extremely seriously then maybe this is a piece of hardware that you want on your desk for those wondering whether you would actually be able to feel the difference between 240 Hertz and 360 Hertz it's going to be extremely minimal but of course I can't say anything until I have tried it I do know that I can feel the difference between 144 and 240 I know do personally use a 1080p 240 Hertz display for my main gaming setup so 360 Hertz is apparently here and ready to go not sure on the release date or pricing for this one but I am very curious to give it a go and that's pretty much going to wrap up our summary for CES 2020 again I didn't go to the show but definitely some very noteworthy announcements here that are worth discussing I love doing reports down below in the comments as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
