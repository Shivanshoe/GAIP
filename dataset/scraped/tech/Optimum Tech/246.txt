[Music] hey what's going on Vance this is a project here that I'm really excited to show you guys this is a fully functional Mac OS hackintosh build running a rising CPU when people think of hackintosh builds they think straightaway of an Intel based system that's what has historically been the most compatible when it comes to building a hackintosh system but recently things are changing Rison CPUs are becoming a lot more popular and the support for building a rising hackintosh is also very abundant and pretty straightforward so firstly my goal for this build was to just see if it was possible at all could I just take any Rison built that I had laying around like this one that I had worked on in the previous video and boot up a hackintosh system with it secondly I wanted to get as many features as I could working and then compare that to sort of the Intel build that I had done previously that no longer exists but for example how many extra steps you need to take in how many features are you actually missing out on when you get to the final build and one of the big motivations for this build and why some of you might want to build something similar is because currently in Apple's desktop PC lineup that is the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro and then you've got nothing in between you don't have a sort of Mac middle or Mac mainstream build so there's a lot of people like you and I who might be content creators or power users but don't necessarily want to upgrade all the way to the Mac Pro but don't want to settle for sort of the lackluster performance of the Mac Mini this build fits right in that gap which is awesome you can also choose your own hardware and you can upgrade it down the line if you feel like you want a little bit more power and performance you can also upgrade the Mac Pro to some degree but eventually you're still constrained within Apple's hardware you know they're modules and within the xeon w lineup with this build you do have some constraints but the majority of the components you have a lot more flexibility with so today I'm going to show you how we can build something like this I'm going to talk about the hardware and also walk you guys through the installation process so my first hackintosh builder I completed a few months ago and that was a pretty straightforward setup and installation that build was running a ninety nine hundred K and a Radeon seven in Mac OS Mojave and the overall performance of that system was mind-blowing when you compare it to Apple's lineup of iMac pros and at the time the well dated trashcan Mac Pro but with the launch of the new 2019 Mac Pro consumers like you and I are given even more reasons to build a powerful custom hackintosh so let's start off with how hard is it how hard actually was this built to complete now hackintosh inge is pretty straightforward and keep in mind I am no hackintosh guru or expert this is only my second hackintosh system but my first system was an Intel system like I said and it was a lot more straightforward than this Rison one how can toshing an AMD risin build in my experience at least was definitely a little bit more on the hacky er end of the hackintosh spectrum but it is still totally doable and I think you guys are going to be surprised with the amount of features that we get working in the end now I'll honestly say that the biggest problem and friction to this whole process was just finding which guide was going to be the most straightforward to follow seeing as this was my first time hackintosh in AMD Rison the amount of mixed information out there was absolutely nauseating and made me seriously reconsider whether this was a project I even wanted to do thankfully though I did stumble upon the AMD vanilla clover guide made by AMD OS X and that God worked an absolute treat the most important file the config top he list file which Mac OS uses to define your hardware to work with it is actually provided and I only had to make a couple of changes to this which we'll get into in a minute so I will leave a link to that guide down below in the description I would definitely recommend starting there first if you are harken toshing an AMD rising system it's the most straightforward guide to follow in my opinion I'll also leave a link to all of the additional files that I use to get this build up and running but before that let's talk about the hardware that I used in this build the motherboard is the Isuzu p450 iist Crick's this is my top pick for a B 450 ITX motherboard it's got a really Sol errm enough fan headers for an ITX board and a decent IO unfortunately Wi-Fi and Bluetooth I couldn't get working on this board in Mac OS because of the chips that are being used but that's where the second MDOT two slot comes in you can easily buy the required Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module and then plug it in using an MDOT two adapter Ethernet though I did get working fine without an issue the CPU that I'm using here is the Verizon five 3606 cores 12 threads with a typical all core boost clock of around 4 gigahertz it's also fully overclockable if you want a bit of extra performance now of course the third-generation lineup stretches all the way up to 16 cores and 32 threads with the 3950 X and you should be able to use the same files to get that up and running if you want for the GPU we're just going with the Vega 56 for a couple of reasons this is more than enough to support GPU acceleration in programs like Final Cut Pro and it's also fairly mainstream I do eventually plan on upgrading this system including the GPU the vague 56 to something like an Rx 5700 or 5700 XT seeing as that's what you guys are most likely going to be using if you're going to do something similar like this I do know that Navi GPUs are just a tiny bit harder to get running in Mac OS and the main focus for this build was on Rison so I mean Vega 56 for this build was just enough to get things up and running and lastly the case that I'm using is the ghost s1 simply because it's the most Mac looking case that I have and by nature I wanted to build something nice minimal and compact also yes I am aware that these cases are extremely hard to get your hands on I will leave the amazon link down below in the description as well as a few alternatives depending on when you are watching this video though the ghost s1 may be in stock other Hardware includes a two terabyte nvme drive 16 gigabytes of 32 hundred megahertz memory and knock to an NHL 12s cooler and a corsair SF 600 for the power supply in terms of hackintosh installation here's a quick walkthrough of what I did again the exact guide that I followed will be linked down below as well as the additional files that I used firstly you want to create a Mac OS installer USB Drive from a current Mac OS system in case I used a MacBook Pro but for those who don't have access to an Apple computer you can just create a virtual Mac OS machine in VirtualBox that's how I built my first hackintosh it's not too hard to do just an extra step for those users now an important note I couldn't actually get the latest Mac OS running on this system that's Mac OS Catalina or 10.15 I kept getting memory driver issues in the bootloader which I just couldn't seem to get past despite trying different drivers with Mac OS Mohave though that's 10.14 i was able to get past this so i do recommend using that instead for now for the EFI boot loader I used clover there is also open core which a lot of Rison users are using instead but clover is a lot more straightforward from what I can see I might try open-call though in the future so running clover boot loader it gives you a default list of selected driver options this took a bit of trial and error back and forth to see what would work for my build but here's a look at the options that worked flawlessly in the end specifically finding the right memory driver was a bit of a pain in the butt once that's installed though the efi partition will be automatically mounted you should see it on your desktop and opening that up you'll want to swap the default config dot plist file to the one that's provided in the guide that I linked but if you are using the exact motherboard that I'm using here you can use the config dot P list file from my files instead another tool that will come in handy is the clover configurator tool which is basically just a friendly user interface to mount the efi and modify the configure up here list file and an extra step that i needed to do here to get iMessage working was to generate a new serial number and smu UID I'm not sure what the implications here are in regards to Apple themselves but I message on my build wouldn't work without these generated numbers the next important step the kernel extension files or text files for short which will get things running like specific Ethernet or audio hardware that is otherwise unsupported in Mac OS the links guide already provides the absolutely necessary text files like virtual SMC lelou Apple ALC and a couple critical ones for AMD systems nul CPU power management and Appl MCE report disabler just drag these into your text folder that you'll find in your efi partition again link below to all the ones that I use to get this build up and running the next step is to actually boot from this USB and begin installation but before you do that you'll want to make sure that you configure your BIOS correctly luckily for me all I needed to do for the B 450 ice tricks was to load optimized defaults then tweak a couple of settings he's an overview of the settings that you generally want to make sure are enabled or disabled so definitely keep an eye out for these all right now with all that out of the way we can now boot from our USB and begin to install our blank MDOT to drive with Mac OS if you followed all of these steps correctly with the same hardware you should have no issues at all like I mentioned previously though there was a bit of trial and error for me personally to find the correct files for this system but the final files provided it should get you up and running nice and smoothly finally we need to tell Mac OS to now boot from the boot drive not the USB installer drive and this is one part that I'm still personally stuck on with this build I'm confident that I can get this working with a bit more time but for now I'm still using the USB installer as the bootloader so now you can have the entire Mac OS Mojave experience at your fingertips powered by AMD Rison and when I say entire experience I mean about 95 percent seeing as we are not using the native Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that Apple machines use and the text files that don't exist to support this motherboard we are missing a few features that some of you might want like airdrop for example again all we would need is that card and we could get that working quite easily that will come in part two of this video along with some major hardware upgrades of course with our Intel and text file we get the expected internet connection via ethernet all iCloud features work the App Store works and iMessage also works flawlessly which was great to see as an iPhone user this is easily one of the top features that I personally wanted to get working with this build so this gives users plenty of functionality to leverage the productivity benefits of Mac OS if they have other Apple devices and also leverage the performance benefits of using a rise in CPU of course the big thing and of using Mac OS in the first place is that you'll now have access to exclusive programs that aren't found in Windows like Final Cut Pro Logic Pro and Xcode for example now when it comes to the sleep/wake functionality of this build this is something that a lot of rise and hackintosh builds will struggle with but with this build it does kind of work I can tell the system to sleep and it'll do that just not as fast as a real Apple machine and I can awake the system with my keyboard or mouse but again just a little bit slower than you'd expect overall though this isn't a massive compromise just definitely something to note though and as with all hackintosh builds you'll definitely want to disable automatic updates as this could break your build entirely one of the biggest reasons that you'd probably want to build something like this though is the performance now I'm actually going to breeze over this because most of you know what to expect when it comes to the Rison 5 3600 and the vega 56 at this point and honestly this build will be getting a hefty CPU and GPU upgrade in the near future Cinebench are twenty render scores for the r5 3600 were exactly as we would expect from a Windows 10 machine and Geekbench multi-core score puts this build around what you would expect a little bit above a 6 core I'm Mac Pro now I won't be personally using this machine as my daily driver because all the programs that I use on a daily basis like Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve 16 and of course games cannot all be found in Windows 10 however I do have a personal goal for this build I am going to keep it up and running and that is just to sort of get as much working as possible the end goal is to get everything working in Mac OS flawlessly because one of the big reasons people buy Apple machines is because they just work they are clean they have a great user experience and everything just works as you would expect nice and intuitively and stay tuned for part two as I've been hinting out in this video that will be a part two where I do plan on getting the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth up and running for this build and also swapping out the CPU to a more powerful verizon chip and also upgrading to an avi GPU as well if you are planning to build something like this I will leave all of the parts in the description of course the guide will be there as well and the additional files that are used to get this build up and running as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
