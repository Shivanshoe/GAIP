so here it is the phanteks 120 mil t30 uh the first pc fan that claims to be better than the noctua nfa 12 by 25 and yeah phanteks have hyped this up quite a lot and a lot of people want to know if it is actually better than these brown noctors here so let's talk about that today starting off it does have a very textured look just like the noctor and that's because it's constructed of a very similar material which is a liquid crystal polymer so the construction including the fan blades is very very rigid and the distance between the fan frame and the fan blades is extremely small there are a few main differences though firstly the fantas is a 30 millimeter thick fan as opposed to the industry standard which is 25 millimeters so even if the t30 does beat the noctua it's not exactly a one-to-one comparison like i'm sure if noctua made a 30 mil version of their own nfa 12 that would probably be slightly better than the current 25 mil version they haven't done that though and although there are a few instances out there usually in itx cases where a 30 mil thick fan just won't fit in most situations you probably do have room for that extra five millimeters the other main difference though is of course the color which for the general consumer is actually a massive point for people who don't associate the noctua color theme with premium performance they probably just see this ugly brown fan and although i have grown to like them over time i would hand down choose the neutral variant instead the t30 isn't perfect though it's far from a clean black looking fan it's more of a dusty gray look instead but a lot of people will still prefer this over brown the t30 also has three different rpm limits which can be changed with this little switch on the fan hub and those are 1200 rpm 2000 rpm and the fastest mode being a deafening 3000 rpm [Music] you can also daisy chain multiple t30 fans together rather than using splitters which is really nice and handy but i would have preferred if the cable measurements were just a little bit shorter here just to create an overall cleaner look overall though it is a pretty neat feature now to save us a bunch of time here and i mean days and days of testing uh this video will solely focus on comparing these two fans together because long story short you know comparing these to the thermaltake clones the arctic p12s the gentle typhoons and so many other fans out there the noctuas always came out on top they have the lowest vibration the lowest motor noise and the airflow operation is really quiet too so there's really no point going back and including all of those fans yet again just to come back to the same conclusion and finding that the noctuas are the better 120mm fan what we really want to find out today is whether these are in fact better so the first test that we're doing here is testing these fans as a case fan some of you probably remember this itx pc build that i completed recently i actually did a full step-by-step guide on how to put this together if you're interested in checking that out but yeah i've been using this as my second system whenever i need to test things like monitors and gaming mice and so it's been really handy having that second build around at the top of the build we have two noctua and fa12s exhausting air being built up within the case and a lot of the focus here is to pull away the hot air from the flow through fan on the rtx 3080 fe now before we take a look at the thermal performance let's first just take a look at how loud these fans are when installed inside the case so here we have the fan speed plotted on the x-axis and the noise measured in dba on the y-axis so ideally we'd have the lowest points on the curve as possible and yeah the noctua is in fact quieter especially at 1 500 rpm and 1750 rpm at least when installed in the case since the fantax t30 is a thicker fan it's closer to the top panel of the case that means that turbulence and airflow noise are actually going to be worse here compared to the slim and noctua and that's exactly what we see here's an idea of what they sound like at 1000 rpm and then at 1500 rpm however although being slightly louder than the noctuas the phantax t30 seems to move a bunch more air i guess that's the main trade-off of being a thicker fan here we're taking a look at the temperature of our rtx 3080 fe after 40 minutes of running heaven 4.0 the gpu clock speed voltage and fan speed have been completely locked and the only variable we're changing here is the fan and still we see almost a three degree improvement on the gpu by going with the phantex t30 that i was not expecting at all again we're just changing the fan so although the gpu temperature starts off the same between the two at the start of the test the difference between them grows as the t30 is able to exhaust a bit more heat sure the noctua runs a bit quieter when they're both locked at 1300 rpm here 41.1 dba versus 41.5 on the fan tax but even if we were to noise normalize that very small difference the phanteks would still end up leading by at least a couple of degrees so as a case fan especially in a restricted scenario like an itx case the phantax does seem like the better pick over the noctua if you have the room for it but what about when tested on an open test bench and when strapped to a radiator well then the noise performance is a lot more closely matched between the two here we don't have to deal with clearances and panel cutouts and air turbulence and so we're purely measuring the noise generated from the fan itself the t30 is the slightly louder fan overall but not too much louder than most people will notice and the two fans are pretty much identical at 1500 rpm again here's an idea of what that sounds like as for thermal performance and how it handles our overclock 10 900k here in blender honestly these results are kind of crazy so while the noise that these fans make when strapped to a radiator is pretty similar there is clearly a thermal advantage here by going with the thicker fans and it's not a small difference either five degrees c is what we're looking at if we just take the average of the final two minutes of each graph and that's a big difference when we're just talking about fans that's enough to maybe give you a bit of extra room for overclocking maybe just a bit of extra peace of mind when it comes to system thermals or more likely your system will run a little bit quieter since it'll be operating on the lower end of the fan curve so yeah big props to fantas on the t30 can highly highly recommend these and honestly i did not expect that much of a thermal difference versus the noctua nfa 12 by 25s i mean i've been using these in how many builds now because they are just the best 120 more option that you can buy and to find out that these come in and just pretty much stomp them in terms of thermal performance and the amount of airflow moved yeah that is pretty crazy having said that i think a lot of us would expect the five mil thicker fan to be the better fan i mean if these were worse than the noctua's then that would be really even more surprising i think so yeah five millimeters thicker uh there is a benefit here just also consider the noctus as an option as well because in some cases some radiators and maybe some liquid core builds you might not have that extra five mil clearance if you do have that extra clearance available in your system though these are absolutely what i'd be going for and i'll definitely be using these in some future builds so really hope this comparison helped you out as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
