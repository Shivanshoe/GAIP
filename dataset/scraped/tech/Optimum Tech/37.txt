all right so it's that time of the year again and some of you are probably interested in upgrading or maybe building a new pc but you would be forgiven for not watching every single tech video that has come out this year so that's basically what this video is a quick video to get you up to speed on the basic knowledge of what components are good and hey maybe which ones to avoid let's start with the cpus there's been a lot of hype and excitement recently over intel's new older league cpus and what amd has coming around the corner the 3d cache refresh the truth is that most of you who are building a gaming pc probably shouldn't bother with either of them and the reason for that is because the cheapest intel 12th gen option at the moment is the 300 i5 12600k and when it comes to amd's 3d cache series you'll probably see something very similar in fact the best option for a mainstream pc right now is this right here the i5 11 400 you get six cores 12 threads decent single threaded performance and most importantly when it comes to gaming it can sit right up there towards the top of the benchmark stack even among the higher core higher clocked options so for gaming this thing is absolutely killer and for 95 of games out there you really don't need anything more sure it is a locked cpu you can't overclock it but you can still pair it with a fast memory kit as well as unlock the power limit on some b560 motherboards you also don't need a beefy cooling solution for this one which is really good something like a hyper 212 i found to work really well but let's say that in addition to gaming you're also doing you know a bit of video editing extra multi-threaded work on the side basically you need those extra cores and threads that's why i'd say the next logical step up from the i5 11 400 would be the i5 12600k this in my opinion is one of the best cpus that you can buy at the moment not only does it offer top-tier gaming performance but the multi-threaded performance that you can get out of this thing is just actually insane the amount of cpu that you're getting here for 300 compared to what you previously got with the 11600k or even a ryzen 5600x this thing just stomps all over them now if you're spending more than this on a cpu then i really hope that you're actually putting those extra calls and threads to work because buying more than an i5 12600k these days for gaming you're probably just wasting money so instead of that i9 12900k put that cash towards a faster gpu more ram or more storage if you do need those extra cores though that's when i would recommend the i9 12 900k it's a decent bit faster than the ryzen 5900x at the same price and in some tasks it even beats the more expensive 5950x now i've seen a ton of comments around the power consumption and poor thermals of the 12900k but the truth is if you're putting this in a production system which is what it's meant to be used for that extra power consumption just doesn't matter as much for this type of work you want the fastest most time-saving machine that you can build and if it takes an extra 100 watts then that's fine now let's talk about gpus and prices here are still looking pretty rough the recommendations that i made in a previous video talking about what your options are at the moment those are actually still fairly accurate if anything i would say that availability is looking a little bit worse than it was a few months ago which is really really unfortunate and that is the case for most regions except for here in australia which for some reason we just have a lot more stock sitting around and we can expect that trend to pretty much continue as we approach the end of the year and most people are trying to buy a gpu as a gift or at least you know buy an upgrade for themselves before the holiday season honestly everything is so variable right now between all of the different regions that my best advice to you is to just do your research on what kind of performance these gpus offer consider what gaming monitor you're going to be pairing them with and then try and make an educated choice from an established retailer i would say that the rx 6600 xt is kind of looking like your best entry level option at the moment then you'll likely want to jump up to an rtx 3060 ti then a 30 70 and then either the 3080 or 6800 xt depending on pricing and availability i do still think that generally nvidia 30 series gpus are worth paying a little bit extra for compared to amd's radeon 6000 you have much greater game support for dlss and ray tracing and you also have cuda and nvinc which are super useful among production apps and again the pricing here is just so so variable so it's really hard to give a really solid you know recommendation and we probably won't see that pricing to start easing up until we start kind of settling into 2022. there is just no point for amd and nvidia to release an actually good affordable gpu at the moment when cards like the 3070 3080 and such are just selling so easily and so well so if you're someone who has been waiting around for an actually good affordable gpu probably keep waiting because that is not going to happen anytime soon so yeah solid recommendations here are pretty difficult but if i had to pick one gpu to recommend to the mainstream it would probably be the 3060 ti this is a gpu that offers really good performance both at 1080p and 1440p without being too power hungry or as inflated compared to your other options it also comes in a bunch of different form factors as well from the beefy triple fan models to something that is really tiny like this evga xc don't get me wrong it's still way above its launch msrp and from that perspective not really worth buying but so is everything else so again check out the benchmarks and reviews and specifically take a look at the performance and how that compares to whatever gaming monitor you're going to pair it with and then try and make a sensible choice based off of that as for budget gpus you don't really have any options at all even the fairly dated gtx 1660 super has doubled in price since its release and i would highly recommend it steering clear from that pretty much just keep using what you currently have or keep saving i would also recommend avoiding amd's 5600g and 5700g apus the price is tempting but the gaming experience from these is honestly pretty underwhelming now on the bright side there is some hardware out there that has continued to go down in price and that's your memory and storage as usual i'd highly recommend sticking to m.2 nvme storage for completely fresh builds these days it keeps everything simple and tidy with no cables while also being the fastest option this one terabyte p2 stick from crucial for example goes for just 80 bucks so pretty much a no-brainer pretty much all modern motherboards these days have at least two m.2 slots available so there's room for expansion there as well if you want to add another one too as for ram 16 gigabytes is still the sweet spot for most gaming systems these days with this 3600 megahertz cl 16 kit from g school going for about 85 to be honest though upgrading to a 32 gigabyte kit is probably worth it for most of you who are happy to pay an extra 30 to 40 dollars depending on the pricing in your region although these 16 gigabyte modules have slightly slower timings it's not a difference that most of you will actually notice now if you're going with an intel alder lake build i do currently recommend sticking with ddr4 memory for most builds as opposed to the faster but way more expensive and unobtainable ddr5 i've done a full video comparing the two and taking a look at ddr5 performance and in most apps and pretty much all games there is just not a worthwhile improvement now as for your options when it comes to pc cases uh these days it is pretty stale a lot of just the same thing being repeated but the options are actually still pretty good i would say that my top picks these days for itx cases would be the cooler master nr200 the nr200p max and the sups meshlicious if you do go with the meshlicious do not go for the 3.0 pcie riser version definitely get the 4.0 version instead even if it does mean paying a little bit more that way you'll get the full compatibility and zero headaches with your modern hardware these cases are of course a bit on the larger end for itx but so are the cooling demands and physical dimensions of the hardware these days so it does make sense for compatibility when it comes to mid tower cases uh there are plenty of good options out there with most of them pretty much being the same thing mid-sized boxes with tempered glass on the side and mesh for the front the main difference between them really comes down to radiator mounting and you know whether you prefer the physical aesthetic on the exterior so just consider that if you are planning on liquid cooling and how big you want the pc case to be so there it is a pretty compact video to bring you guys up to speed on what components are actually worth building with i will leave the relevant parts listed down below and i'll also link down below an nr200 build with the i5 and a 360ti which i still think is really relevant today so if you're looking to put something together definitely check out that build video down below otherwise a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
