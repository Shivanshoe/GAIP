AMD's thread Rupa 3990 X probably one of the simplest CPU reviews that you've seen in recent times because the bottom line is if you're after as many cores and threads as you can possibly get on a high-end desktop system this is the CPU to get there is zero competition when it comes to this product and there's definitely no debate when it comes to value comparing the 3990 x2 to of Intel's Xeon 80 to 80 Platinum's costing you around 20 grand u.s. so if you're after as many cores and threads as you can possibly get your hands on here it is the 3990 X and what I want to cover in this video is you know less whether you should buy this versus Intel's 80 to 80 Platinum's and more so which applications and workflows actually benefit from a substantially higher core count and where you might be better off with say 8 to 16 cores instead or perhaps offloading that work to your GPU but there are some use cases where the 3990 X does actually make sense so if you missed my review on AMD's thread Ripper 39 70 X the 32 core model here's a quick summary these CPUs are truly in a category of their own and they're truly pushing the workflows and the amount of time saved by creative professionals if you use your system to make a living and your workflow can be accelerated by an additional cause third gen thread Ripper is a worthwhile investment but let's not get too ahead of ourselves because there are many workflows out there we're sure bumping up to 16 24 or even 32 cores will save you a chunk of time but 64 cores may not give you any worthwhile additional benefit so the 3990 x then exhibits the full scalability of the Zen 2 architecture containing 8 8 core dies it also shares the same 280 watt power target as the 24 and 32 core models by moderating a lower base and boost clock but we'll take a closer look at that in just a minute l2 and l3 cache get a nice bump to from the 32 core model and overall the 64 core is around twice as expensive now of course when you see the advertised boost clock of 4.3 gigahertz that's not going to be across all 64 cores instead you're going to see that in extremely lightly threaded workloads across a single core and best instead for the 3990 X to be a sensible desktop CPU and stay within its 280 watt power target the clock speeds are reduced a lot closer to base clock this is definitely something to keep note of as this makes the 3990 X a pretty specialized CPU if you need a balance between high coil count and high clock speeds at the same time you're probably better off with something like 39 60 X or 39 70 X now in terms of thermal performance this is pretty interesting seeing as the 280 watt power target is spread out of a double the amount of core complex dyes compared to the 32 quart 3970 X we actually get better thermals here we're looking at the temperature plot for each of the 8c CDs being cooled by a 280 ml kraken X 62 and we only see the hottest data point at a mere 70 1.5 degrees C one reason for this is just as we saw with the 39 60 X and 39 70 X to stay within that 280 watt power target voltage is cleverly dropped to impressively low levels the 3990 X maintained AV core in blender of just 0.8 4 volts but remember the only reason is able to do this is due to the relatively low clock speeds at the same time still though that is some serious under vaulting on AMD's behalf thumbs up there a quick note on the test hardware used here the 39 90 X was tested on the Asuza TRX 40 zenith to extreme paired with 32 gigabytes of low latency 32 hundred megahertz CL 14 memory all test benches get their own m2 nvme Drive and I'm using the kraken X 62 280 m el niño which had no issues so let's start off with a look at rendering performance and as I said in the beginning I want to focus the discussion of these results more so on what the performance margins and scaling is like over something like the 39 70 X because although we do have a double the core count we are operating at 900 megahertz lower at full load and some applications aren't even programmed to utilize all 128 threads appropriately fortunately though in Cinebench are 20 with all threads enabled we get some fairly promising scaling here scoring 46% higher than me 39 70 X if you do use Mac's on cinema 4d software for some serious work and you want the absolute fastest performance there really is no better choice but also consider the first 960 X and 39 70 X for better value switching to a single thread we can see that despite having 128 in total for 3990 X still knows what to do in lightly threaded workloads many multi-threaded applications will still have a few lightly threaded tasks within them so this is pretty great to see continuing on with rendering let's take a look at blender now and here we don't see much scaling beyond the 3970 X the reason for this is that a large portion of the render time here at least for these extremely fast CPUs like 39 70 X and 3990 X actually involves overhead like initialization and synchronization this is usually lightly threaded or even serial coded and so it doesn't speed up the more cores that you add moving on to a different rendering scene we see a similar story a big upgrade from the 2958 239 70 acts but the 3990 ax is only saving you around 20 seconds per render for this particular scene no doubt if you're working on absolutely huge projects and rendering all day long and by all means if your project has the budget for the 3990 X might be worth considering let's not forget GPU rendering though in RTX 2080 super can give you respectable render times here so definitely explore that as an option 2 if blender is your main program of choice lastly for rendering we have v-ray a path tracing rendering benchmark where the entire scene is resolved at once here there's definitely some impressive scaling for the 3990 X for a single CPU a score of 74,000 is simply insane that's a 60% improvement over the 32 core 39 70 X despite the lower clock speeds now let's move on to video editing and here I personally wasn't expecting much at all beyond the 39 70 X in fact taking look purely at render times here there's no improvement at all that's with 6k black magic roll footage with a lot and video stabilization applied to no doubt maybe if you threw for multicam shots of 8k uncompressed red raw footage on the same timeline and exported that you'd probably see some scaling at that point on the note of timeline playback that is something that is becoming a lot harder to test as Premiere Pro becomes increasingly unpredictable and it also heavily depends on the footage and codec that you're using for example 6k Blackmagic RAW files despite being 6k raw video are surprisingly efficient to edit with where even a risin 530 600 can provide a flawless timeline and editing experience DaVinci Resolve studio is my personal editing software of choice though and again we see zero benefit by upgrading from a 39 70 X to eight thirty nine ninety X I will also note that resolved 16 allows you to leverage the GPU as the video encoder that's what I personally use to encode all of my videos in HD 265 and at that point all export times are basically the same so unless you are working with some seriously stubborn and inefficient footage and a lot of it at the same time you're not going to see great performance scaling with a 3990 X even the 39 70 X is difficult to recommend for most avid video editors and content creators I did also test Adobe Lightroom export performance to see where the photographer's may benefit by upgrading to a super high coil count CPU and it seems like the results here are fairly mixed but overall trending towards a higher clock speed if you use Lightroom professionally you're likely better off with a moderate core count of around 8 while choosing a CPU with a higher boost clock lastly a look at game development and here were in Unreal Engine and we're seeing how long it takes each CPU to build the lighting for the given demo for large scenes with multiple light sources this could take quite a while but we don't see much scaling beyond the 30 970 X here ultimately my recommendation here would probably be the 39 50 X which isn't on this graph but I'd expect that to perform pretty closely next we're seeing how long it takes to export and package the demo project this is important for agile testing but this seems like one of those tasks that is mostly serial coded seeing as most of the packaging process needs to be completed in a specific order and just to wrap things up a few gaming benchmarks which originally wasn't going to include because this isn't a gaming CPU but many of you may be using a production system to game on as well when the boss isn't looking overall expect some pretty solid performance here close to 30 970 x in most titles but possessing 128 threads does introduce some problems for some titles for example the 3990 X offers from the same stuttering and low performance in Far Cry 5 as the 3970 X and despite fresh installs of Windows chipset drivers graphics drivers pretty much everything this isn't an issue that I've been able to solve same issue in battlefield 5 which was a bit of a stutter immerse the 3970 X here otherwise was fine if you are desperate to clock in a lot of gaming time for the 3990 X for whatever reason I would recommend disabling SMT and half the cause if possible do you note that that will require a full system restart though in closing there are few use cases that can properly leverage the full 128 threads of the thread group of 3990 X but those that can show performance that has never been reached by a single desktop processor before rendering is definitely one of those use cases if you're working on a high budget and complex project the 3990 X should be considered beyond that though the use cases are slim and specific but no doubt there are small groups of users out there that are rejoicing the thread Ripper 3990 X's existence for most of you looking to build a production workstation for serious work like rendering game development and multicam or high budget video editing I'd recommend looking toward the 3960 ax and 39 70 X instead you'll save a chunk of money that you'll be able to spend towards an increased memory capacity and maybe even an additional GPU so while the use cases for the CPU do definitely exist you really do need to be pushing some serious serious work and very specific work as well to properly justify it in your system nevertheless if you are looking to upgrade to any of these third row per CPU I will some links down below as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
