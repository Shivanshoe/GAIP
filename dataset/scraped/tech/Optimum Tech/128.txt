[Music] today we have an exclusive look at an upcoming itx case that's coming early in 2021 this is the sunny side up meschalicious which quite honestly is a horrible name for a pc case i'm not sure who decided that but for the sake of this review we'll just be calling it the ssu mesh and it is a seriously seriously good itx case but that brand's name sunnyside up or suppt for short it's the daughter company of lian lee this is their first case and it's collaboration between lee lee and encase so two very well known case manufacturers at this point and the result is an excellent itx case so this is a 14.6 liter vertical enclosure with full mesh side panels which is simply awesome it can support up to a 280mm aio at the front and massive graphics cards as well but the best part is that this is aimed to be a mainstream case it's going to be released on amazon and newark towards the start of next year at a very acceptable price point of around 100 to 120 us dollars so again i think this is going to be the mainstream itx case to beat next year let's take a look at what you need to know [Music] so first off let's get a size comparison out of the way to see how big this thing really is the subt is slightly larger in volume than the end case m1 and nzxt h1 but it's significantly smaller than the phanteks shift 2. and despite being larger than at the end case the footprint is actually quite a bit smaller so that's one of the best things when it comes to using this as a desktop gaming system the exterior is super clean i mean no visible branding or logos here except for a small little stamp on the rear and overall this can make for an incredible looking minimal system for your setup the standard configuration uses highly breathable mesh panels on both sides the front and the top and these feel quite premium all of the panels very satisfyingly snap on and off with push pins and you will have the option for tempered glass as well not really sure of the premium that's going to be added there but i'd only really recommend tempered glass if you're also liquid cooling your gpu and don't need to rely so much on side panel ventilation then for front i o super clean again just located at the top of the case two usb ports here one type a and one type c although i haven't confirmed which speeds these are running at so with vertical pc cases you've got a decision to make when it comes to your rear i o you can either have it at the bottom like the nzxt h1 or you can have the rear i o located at the top of the case like the phanteks evolve shift 2. neither option is better than the other one in my opinion because both result in the case being overall a little bit larger you either have the case a little bit taller off the floor as in the h1 or have a bit of extra space at the top like the evolve shift 2. i will say though that both of those approaches kind of they're a bit of a compromise to user experience right because if you need to plug in a monitor to your gpu or maybe use a usbc port on the back of the motherboard you have to kind of flip the case around or route it through the back panel or something like that but this case does things quite a bit differently because the rear i o for the motherboard is located directly at the back so the way that the ssu mesh gets around this is by cleverly folding the gpu riser cable at a 45 degree angle allowing the motherboard rear i o to be still directly pointed out the back of the case and for the gpu to be mounted vertically in my opinion this is the best layout of a vertically oriented small form factor case rear i o is so much easier to access and you still benefit from that nice compact footprint however we still run into the issue of the graphics card i o being pointed directly downwards and here it's actually pretty bad because a regular display port or hdmi cable is just impossible to insert so the solution to this is to use a cable with a 90 degree port they do include a 90 degree hdmi cable in the box but seeing as a lot of gaming monitors these days require displayport 1.4 to get the full refresh rate out of i'd also recommend grabbing a 90 degree displayport adapter connecting the cable is still relatively easy though thanks to the cutouts in the bottom and in my opinion this is a sensible compromise to the unique layout but now let's make our way to the interior of the case which is surprisingly really simple and straightforward in fact it reminds me a lot of the chimera mach 1 prototype which we had a look at over two and a half years ago which unfortunately never saw production so it's your typical sandwich layout with your motherboard and power supply on one side and your graphics card on the other and then we can mount up to a 240 or 280 mil radiator at the front so from memory this makes the ssu mesh the smallest case that i've reviewed that can support up to a 280 ml radiator and not only that but we have up to 65 mils of clearance between the front panel and the spine of the case so your standard 280 ml aios will fit just fine here leaving you with around 10 to 12 mils of extra clearance i'd recommend installing an aio like i've done here routing the tubes from the bottom behind the power supply and then up to the pump block it is possible to route the tubes from the top and then around the cutout in the motherboard tray but i think you'll just end up with some really awkward tube routing having the tubes at the bottom makes for a much simpler layout of course you could go with air cooling if liquid calling is not your thing and being a full mesh enclosure i think the results would be pretty good however you only have up to 72 mils of clearance which is kind of one of the compromises of a sandwich layout case versus something like an nr200 or an encase m1 so 72 mils of clearance that kind of leaves you with a noctua nhl 12s as one of the most recommended options atx power supplies are also supported here but i'd highly recommend avoiding them in this case you'll just end up with way too much cable slack and there's also no room left to mount an aio at the front sfx and sfxl are the way to go in my opinion there's plenty of high power options out there on the market this way you also have a bit of extra room left between the power supply and the graphics card for cable management i'll also note that facing the power supply fan outwards was the only way that i was able to install this specific unit which is the sf600 platinum from corsair otherwise the included 24 pin cable is just not long enough 315 millimeter long three slot graphics cards can be installed here as well with a height of up to around 140 mils although that is including the power connectors which are around 10 mils on their own so for cards that have recessed power connectors a height of 140 mils will be fine but for cars with standard power connectors they will need to be under 130 mils one card which did not fit in this case was the gaming x trio from msi this is the rtx 3080 but for the purpose of dimensions i believe the 360 ti all the way up to their 30 90 uses the same cooler design the length of this card pokes out here at around 325 millimeters so i couldn't actually get this installed in this case the card that's in there at the moment is the rog strix rx 5700 and that comes in at 305 mils in length and that was no issues getting it in there so i don't have an official spec of what is technically supported just yet but it seems to be around 315 millimeters and i'll also mention that being a sandwich layout case as we've seen in previous testing flow through cooler designs like this one where you have the fan on the back plate or where the back plate would be and not expect it to work well with this case so i haven't tested this just yet but you can only expect that having the fan directly against where the motherboard is that's just not going to make sense thermally now in terms of storage despite most itx builds these days just using a couple of onboard m.2 nvme drives you can install up to three two and a half inch drives in here as well two on the floor of the case and then one towards the bottom of the spine behind the power supply if that's not enough and you are trying to build a system that's mostly based around a lot of storage you can use a shorter graphics card mounted horizontally using the expansion slots towards the top of the case and that way you free up space to mount an additional two three and a half inch or four two and a half inch drives using the included bracket keep in mind though that your graphics card will need to be less than 215 millimeters in length if you are using a pair of 25 millimeter thick fans at the front or less than 180 mils when using a standard front mounted aio i'll also note that the spine of the case can be shifted to allow a four slot graphics card clearance if that's something that you're interested in running i don't think four slot cards actually exist but this might be applicable for someone running a three slot card who wants a bit of extra clearance just keep in mind that your cpu cooler height and pump block height will be limited to just 52 millimeters also if you are interested in building a custom loop in this case there isn't much room at the bottom for a pump or a reservoir but with a clearance of 72 millimeters you will be able to use the barrow cpu pump lock and reservoir that we took a look at recently that along with a set of low profile fittings would be an excellent way to get a custom loop up and running in this case now the airflow setup in this case you can either go with a positive pressure setup which is going to be a little bit better for cpu thermals or a negative pressure setup which is going to be a little bit better for gpu thermals so with positive pressure that's kind of how i think most people would intuitively build in this case that's going to be pulling air from the front and then pushing it through the side panels negative pressure is going to be the reverse of that of course encouraging air through the side panels and pushing air onto the radiator this way typically negative pressure is what is recommended for sandwich layout cases like this or the form t1 or the ghost s1 that way you really are benefiting from all of that kind of air that's coming through the side panels and assisting the small fans on your graphics card so starting off with cpu thermals here we have a new best result and by quite a big margin versus the cooler master nr200 the ssu mesh runs seven degrees cooler for our test system here which uses a 10 900k overclocked to five gigahertz at 1.27 volts granted we are using an updated 280 ml cooler but the thermal difference here between the z63 and x62 in my testing showed less than one degree so the best cpu thermals in this case are achieved with a positive pressure setup bringing fresh air in through the front panel thermals are around seven degrees better there compared to a negative pressure setup but the reverse is true for gpu thermals as we expected their negative pressure actually works better since we're encouraging fresh air through the side panels and assisting the graphics card fans our results there lend us right around the encase m1 there's no reason you couldn't run some of the beefiest most power hungry gpus on the market in this case there is plenty of ventilation to support that but there's just not enough active cooling in the way of extra fans to push it to the top of the stack to beat something like an nr200 then for vrm thermals despite not much active cooling getting across the motherboard you'll still have nothing to worry about here it ties the top results which would be the nr200 and that's partly due to the superb cpu thermals so for mainstream builds high-end systems custom loops and everything in between this is looking like an excellent option dare i say it's going to be the mainstream itx case to be starting in 2021 as a vertical case at least i much prefer this over the nzxt h1 and the evolve shift 2. i'm personally trying to find something you know critical or negative to say about the case just to kind of balance this review a bit but you know there's really nothing that i can say about this that i don't like about it the layout is simple it's really easy to build in and i really do love the vertical form factor with that really small footprint i also think that the direction that hardware is going in with bigger graphics cards and higher tdps when you're looking at liquid cooling i think this approach to prioritizing thermal performance is a really important one and again i think this is the case to beat in 2021 so really excited to see this one reach market in february and i will be doing a few more content pieces on this one as we approach that release date i'd love to know your thoughts and comments down below as well so feel free to leave a comment as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
