today's review is going to be a little bit different because it's of a tv and i've never reviewed a tv previously but this thing behind me actually feels like a giant gaming monitor at least that's how i've been using it for the last two months and the experience has been really really interesting as someone who primarily games on a high refresh rate gaming monitor now sure you've got netflix prime video and live tv but what i really want to talk about now is how this has variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz on an oled panel with unbelievable responsiveness when it comes to gaming to be quite honest this thing absolutely blew away my expectations of gaming on a tv but if you're planning on picking one up for your gaming system there are definitely quite a few things that you should know so we're of course talking about the lg cx oled the flagship gaming tv of 2020 and what i want to talk about today is exactly that how does this go for a big gaming display how does it feel in terms of responsiveness and the refresh rate and the gaming experience compared to say a high-end 4k gaming monitor [Music] so firstly the exterior and i think the lg cx series of tvs are plainly some of the best looking tvs that are currently out the stand design is super clean the bezels are some of the slimmest that you'll ever see on the market and you really don't get an appreciation for just how thin the display is until you see it in person this makes it perfect for wall mounting if that's something that you plan to do just keep in mind that some of the ports are facing directly out the back most of the ports that you'll need regular access to though are directly on the side there is a cable management channel built into the stand which is appreciated and overall i just think this is one of the best looking tvs on the market before you even turn it on then when you get around to that you're greeted with that beautiful oled panel the biggest advantage of oled over an lcd display is that each individual pixel is completely self-emissive the display doesn't require a backlight whereas your common lcd panels do this means if a pixel is being drawn black on an oled panel the pixel itself is actually switched off and not displaying anything this leaves you with an infinite contrast ratio and some of the greatest depth in terms of picture quality that you'll ever see and it's only now after re-watching some of my favorite films and tv series on an oled panel that you really get the true intention behind cinematography color grading and exposure if those are things that you can appreciate as a content consumer you'll definitely love what an oled panel has to offer and the lg cx is no exception in that regard but i will say that the standard picture quality out of the box is just way off in terms of color and white balance i recommend using either of the isf expert picture profile modes depending on the brightness of your room those are the most accurate color modes out of the box the built-in speakers are actually not too bad either a little better than i expected given how thin the display is but for the full experience i do recommend a sound bar of course i'm using the samsung hw q60t which works flawlessly with the cx via hdmi arc [Applause] [Music] the big thing here at least for me and probably most of you watching this is gaming performance and this is really where the lg cx uh really excels so all of the lg cx tvs from the 48 inch 55 inch the 65 inch behind me and then also the 77 inch they all support 120 hertz refresh rates 4k with a variable refresh rate so both freesync premium and g-sync as well so for the games that most of you are going to be playing on a tv especially at 4k i personally feel that 120 hertz is plenty cyberpunk 2077 for example runs at around 80 fps on my rtx 3090 with ray tracing and dlss enabled and playing with the controller the experience is overall really really smooth but until only recently driving those specs on any gaming system just wasn't a thing even if you could render 4k at 120hz on an rtx 2080 ti for example you were limited to hdmi 2.0 with a max signal of 4k 60hz now though things have changed big time we do actually have gpus with hdmi 2.1 that can take full advantage of this display not only in terms of supporting that connection but also in some titles actually delivering a high refresh rate 4k experience relatively that is definitely do not expect to you know be playing at 4k 120 hertz across your entire steam library even with an rtx 3090 which is what's running behind me there are some games here which if you are running at 4k you will need to tone down the settings quite a bit if you want to milk the full 120 hertz out of this display so this is where g-sync and that variable refresh rate really comes in handy with a g-sync range between 40 and 120 hertz even if you are playing at those lower frame rates around 60 fps you're getting a completely synced tear-free experience and as far as i can see the only other tvs out there with g-sync are the predecessor of this being the lg c9 a few others in the lg lineup and those big format gaming displays which i think we can all agree are less than perfect so g-sync is a rare but super important feature to see here on a tv not to mention we also have freesync premium if you're rocking an amd radeon gpu or perhaps one of the next gen consoles now one really cool feature about the lg cx is that when plugging in your gaming pc over hdmi 2.1 it'll automatically enable the game instant response mode which offers much lower input lag it'll also automatically switch over to the game mode picture profile which reduces input lag a bit further but the problem is game mode just doesn't look anywhere near as color accurate or vibrant out of the box compared to the two color modes that i mentioned previously isf expert bright or dark however you can still actually just leave the game instant response mode enabled in those picture profiles to benefit from the lower input lag as well but the game mode picture profile will still offer the lowest input lag overall so with that enabled along with the tv in game mode you'll want to do a couple more things to get the full hdmi 2.1 experience and shout out to both hd tv test and artings here on youtube for these following settings first is to rename the hdmi port that you're using for your gaming system to pc this will enable the full chroma 444 color then in the game mode picture settings change the white balance mode to warm 2 for the most accurate white point and color now i don't have the proper tools or instruments to properly measure the input lag on the lg cx but what i can offer is my experience as someone who has thousands of hours gaming on a 240hz plus gaming monitor and i can say that the lg cx feels unbelievably responsive i mean i wasn't expecting much from a gaming tv but even compared to those really high refresh rate monitors that i use on a daily basis this feels about as instant as you could imagine and a lot of that is due to the near perfect pixel response times of the oled panel where the transition between colors is significantly faster than an lcd and the fast response times they really can't be stressed enough on the lg cx i was absolutely blown away by just how rapid and instant this display feels so if you had any concerns or reservations about the lg cx you know not feeling maybe as responsive or fast as a gaming monitor you can definitely forget about those because i had those same expectations and reservations but even at 80 to 100hz this feels exceptionally quick of course though we have to address the biggest downside of an oled panel and that's the potential for burn-in channel outings did an excellent video covering this topic with an insanely long burn-in test for multiple models of the lg cx they literally did a permanent burn-in test for multiple lg cx's which i think is about as dedicated as it gets and i personally thought that the results were surprisingly favorable of the oled panel i will leave that video linked down below because it kind of gives you an idea of what to do and what not to do but the short of it is if you are watching or playing varied content on the lg cx screen burning really shouldn't be a problem even static elements like a game's heads up display shouldn't be too much of a concern if you're kind of mixing that in with different content throughout the day although the potential is there if you are feeling reckless so bringing it all together the gaming experience on the lg cx oled in my opinion is the best way to enjoy certain titles story based games for example are an absolute treat on this display it's a much more involving and immersive experience compared to playing on a monitor in my opinion and of course the obligatory word of warning or kind of just a heads up is that 4k is no joke and to really get the most out of this display you'll ideally be pairing it with an rtx 3080 or a 3090 and realistically those are cards that are well within your budget if you're spending 2500 u.s on a tv so yeah this thing it's expensive but considering the feature set that's packed into it and the gaming experience that it can enable that price doesn't seem to be too unrealistic so i'd love to know your thoughts and comments down below on the lg cx it's by no means a new monitor but hopefully this experience was kind of uh helpful in your purchasing decision if you do plan on picking this up in the future otherwise a huge thanks for watching consider subscribing down below if you haven't already and i will see you all in the next one
