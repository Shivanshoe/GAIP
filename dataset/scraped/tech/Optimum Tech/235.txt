the Slugger sm58 II is a pretty impressive and relatively compact small form-factor case given what you can fit inside it this case slipped under the radar a little given that I had already reviewed the smaller and very similar SM 550 and SM 560 I didn't really feel much reason to make a dedicated video for the SM 580 but just because I didn't review it straight away it doesn't mean that I don't recommend it in fact it's a very well ventilated and pretty compact small form-factor case and it is actually in stock and available to buy most of the time in this video I want to compare the slugger SM 580 to other small form-factor cases that can fit a 240 or 280 ml liquid cooler like the Mk someone or da 2 and we'll also discuss the best approach to reducing thermals and noise levels in this case [Music] so if you've seen my review on the Slugger SM 550 or SM 560 you probably know what to expect when it comes to the larger SM 580 these cases have the same footprint but whereas these smaller Slugger cases are relatively limited with CPU cooling only allowing up to 55 millimetres of clearance the SM 580 supports up to 280 millimeter radiators we'll talk more about this in just a minute but if you don't mind the slightly larger volume on your desk then I definitely recommend considering the SM 580 as first preference compared to the N case m1 and the screen comb da to the slugger SM 580 is the least exterior design focused of the three while the m1 and da2 have a sleek minimal approach the SM 580 is more of a no fluff approach by no means does it look bad but the look is very straightforward one thing I will comment on though is the inconsistency when it comes to the ventilation cutouts we've got rectangles on the sides then circles at the top more open rectangles at the bottom and then rounded rectangles at the rear bit of an odd choice and I would have liked to see this be a bit more consistent the volume comes in at 16 liters making this the largest sandwich layout case that I've personally come across typically this Hardware layout is reserved for cases around 10 litres and under I'd say that any larger than this this layout just wouldn't make much sense but here I'm confident it does one reason for that is the support for three slot graphics cards up to 320 miles in length and 133 millimeters in height and specifically the way that it's mounted in the case despite Street comms da2 being a bit larger at 17 and 1/2 liters it only has support for two slot cards the end case m1 can fit three slot cards also but the fans need to pull air from below the case and if this isn't going to be as ideal as pulling air from the side the other advantage that the Slugger SM 580 has for graphics card support and cooling is due to the fan positioning under the graphics card you can mount up to two 140 mm fans and above the graphics card you can mount another two 140 mm fans with or without a 280 mm radiator this means that if you are using an open our graphics card those fans can assist the exhaust air flow of the card and improved thermal and noise performance compared to if the fans weren't there oddly enough Slugger actually recommends the opposite running the bottom fans as intake so I did some thermal testing here just to double-check of course if you're not going with the vented panels at bottom fans as intake would be preferred and that does make sense if you're running a three slot RTX 2080 Ti and you want to run it as quiet as possible outside of a custom loop this would be one way to achieve that the other advantage of having three expansion slots is that you can run two PCIe devices off of the one slot on your motherboard via PCIe bifurcation you will need to purchase the special riser for that to work though and also double check that your motherboard supports it for CPU calling it's pretty evident that this is a liquid cooling focused case don't bother running an air cooler here because the clearance is only 55 millimetres 280 ml a iOS can be mounted at the top however not all 280 ml radiators will fit for example Slugger note that the corsair h 115 i and cooler masters liquid pro 280 are incompatible but NZXT is cracking X 62 X 63 and Z 63 won't be an issue for the side panels you've got three options a blank non-vented panel an acrylic window panel and the fully vented panel which I highly recommend to be honest cable management is quite tough in the SM 580 just by virtue of how much hardware you have in here mainly fans so this isn't really an interior I'd like to show off with acrylic panels anyway alright so let's jump into CPU thermos we're running a 99 hundred K overclock to 5 gigahertz and 1.2 for a vault in a blender render for 20 minutes the cooler that I've used here for the SM 5 80 is the new Kraken is e 63 218 or a IO pump speed has been set to max and fans at 1,700 rpm and the results here are very respectable personally I was expecting the SM 580 to beat the end case and one seeing as it supports a 280 ml AIO as opposed to a 240 but the location of the radiator isn't as ideal in fact it's very similar to the radiator positioning of the ghost s1 when that uses a 240 ml radiator and that configuration runs 10 degrees warmer than the end case CPU thermals are also around 2 degrees cooler when having the bottom fans as exhaust and not in taking air through the bottom I think we'd all agree that this isn't a significant difference though so really it is up to you so CPU thermals are pretty good but it's the GPU thermals that really blow me away in this case in fact the SM 580 is 3 degrees C better than any other case that I've tested here running our 2 slot gtx 10a DTI to be fair it also has the most fans located around the GPU as well so although this is a surprising result you just have to take one look at the case for this result to be explained when we switch the bottom fans to intake that's pulling air from below the case and towards the graphics card we end up fighting the desired exhaust airflow direction of the GPU and so thermals are around 3 degrees C worse after 20 minutes in other sandwich layout cases we'd see this different speed a bit larger but due to how much of ventilation there is in the SM 580 it does make slightly less of an impact in summary the Slugger SM 580 is a brute force airflow monster and if you want to run a 3 slot RTX 2080 TI and as quiet and as fast as possible this case should definitely be towards the top of your list cpu films are slightly better in the n case m1 but virtually equal a 2 degree C difference really isn't worth fussing over so when deciding between the three of these cases and yes of course you have plenty of other compact options too but these three seem to be the most popular you really need to weigh up how much you care about how your system looks the thermal performance and whether you're willing to wait around let me explain while the Slugger SM 580 and the streak on da 2 are readily available to buy pretty much at any given moment the N case m1 is a lot harder to get your hands on all three of these cases can handle a 9900 K or 3950 X when using their respective largest liquid coolers and high-power GPU is like an RT X 2080 TI will run fine in all three also just with varying thermals and noise levels pricing for the SM 580 is the dearest of the three at 270 US dollars but that does include free shipping in the US still though that does sting a little when the quality and finish isn't as clean as the m1 OD a2 and of course you don't just have these three options you've got tons of different compact case options out there but I feel like the SM 580 the da2 and the N case m1 kind of directly competing against each other in terms of what they support and the amount of calling and sort of compatibility that they offer so if you are interested in these cases I will leave them linked down below as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
