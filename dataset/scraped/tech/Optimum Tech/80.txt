i need a video i don't know if it's worth it uh it depends if you like the switches in the g pro wireless and the g pro super light i found that they were okay but there is a big difference actually let me let me compare them i have two one is default and then black is with the klgm2s custom sounds amazing yeah it sounds pretty good what about the feel though feels so much better it's like a night in the day difference when it comes to feel sounds like they were lubed uh they don't feel smoother per se but they just feel like they're more locked in they feel like more snappy you know so yep a pretty noticeable difference here and today we're going to take a look at how you can do the exact same thing the process here is pretty straightforward if you know how to use a soldering iron and even if you don't this is a pretty easy starting point and it's definitely worth it in my opinion depending on which mouse you're using especially if you're using a g-pro wireless or a g-pro super light the upgrade is pretty noticeable and then just like keyboard switches you've got a ton of different options here that range in different sounds and feels and the characteristics of the switch itself i'm currently using the klgm2 teals in my g pro super light which is my main mouse and there is just no way that i can go back to the stock omron 20ms that were in there before so let's take a look at what you need to know now the benefits of upgrading the mouse switches are basically just around improving the feel and feedback similar to how you have different switch options for your mechanical keyboard if better fuel leads to better aim for you or more confidence in gaming then more power to you but for me this is just 100 having a better feeling better sounding and more solid mouse and i'm not kidding when i say that the difference really is night and day in the case of the g pro wireless and other logitech mice which have omron switches you'll also be avoiding the dreaded double clicking fault that these switches are very prone to so a nice little upgrade here will mean that you'll never have to encounter that now to access the switches on pretty much any gaming mouse out there you will need to open up the mouse which involves removing the stock pads and potentially making them impossible to reuse so it's essential here to get your hands on some aftermarket pads like core pads if you haven't already that way you've got a nice little upgrade to your glides as well which you should probably be doing anyway in terms of mouse disassembly it's going to be different for every mouse out there of course generally there are a few screws hidden underneath the pads and then you'll be able to remove the shell any cables and any additional screws that hold the button triggers in the case of the g-pro supply it is actually a pretty complex tear down and there is a lot going on here the main mouse buttons and scroll wheel are actually on a separate pcb but this actually makes it a lot easier to work with so here are the stock omron 20ms not horrible by any means but we can definitely get an easy upgrade installed here you'll also want to pull out the scroll wheel here as well just so we can work around those switches a bit easier now comes the fun part though that's removing the solder and here i'm just going to do it the cheap way with a hand pump that involves heating the solder joint up and then just vacuuming it up with the pump of course a complete rework station would be the dream here so feel free to use better tools if you have those available but if you're using something really cheap like i am here too that can work absolutely fine so with all of that solder removed we can finally get those stock omron 20m switches out of here and drop in whatever you're upgrading to in this case i'm installing the klgm 8s a quick little tip here is to solder only the middle pin first and focus on getting the switch fully seated onto the pcb then you can go ahead and solder the other two pins honestly it's a pretty easy swap if you're familiar with soldering and desoldering shouldn't really take you more than 10 minutes if you've done something like this before even if you've never soldered before this wouldn't be a bad place to learn just make sure that you look up some tutorials beforehand and have a small enough soldering iron to work with for those small pins if you don't have any of these tools on hand and you've never soldered before in your life then i'll leave a link to some tools down below this is definitely one of those skills that is always nice to have on hand but let's talk about what your switch options are here the most recommended switch upgrade will be a klgm switch either a 2.0 4.0 or 8.0 depending on how much switch lifespan you'd like but more importantly the snappiness and sound of the switch that you'd prefer as well the differences here are pretty noticeable with the 4.0 having the snappiest and stiffest feel out of the three the 2.0 being the lightest but still offering a really satisfying click and the 8.0 being about in the middle personally i'm using the twos in the g pro super light because i really like the full click that they provide but i did try the eights for a few days they were just a little bit too snappy and loud for my preference so i went back to the gm twos and this leads me to a very important note and that's the same switch installed across a range of different mice will actually feel and sound very different as well so for example the klgm8 which are kind of the flagship klgm switch at the moment i found them just a little bit too harsh and snappy in the g pro super light but the same switch installed in the extra fight zm1 which is rocket jump ninja's new mouse somehow feel so much better and well tuned they kind of have a much better fuller sounding click so most of that comes down to how the switch is positioned inside the mouse and the structures around it but if that wasn't enough it's also possible to find variations between the same switch installed into the same mouse so just like keyboard switches it is very possible to find a variance across the same switch model so this is why i'd recommend if you're interested in buying a specific switch definitely buy more than a couple buy at least four so that way you can sort out the best two that way you've got at least two switches that sound and feel pretty close you also have several options here from juano which are these switches found in all zowie gaming mice and if you're already rocking a zowie there's probably no need to upgrade here because these feel super super nice there are a ton more options here than these three shown but the most commonly used in zoey mice are the blue dot and the red dots then we have the ttc golds which are probably the most unique switch in this lineup because they have the shortest travel distance and by far the lightest feel at around 0.5 newtons these actually feel and sound pretty similar to the stock omron 20ms found in the superlite but just a bit more locked in if i had to order them from lightest to heaviest it would probably look something like this but i'm going to be totally honest with you guys a few of these switches feel very similar to each other with the nuances being very hard to pick up like the klgm8 versus the juano blue dots very similar actuation force and overall feel but the cables have a bit more of a snappy actuation even the differences between the three juano switches themselves are very small to me anyway that's why i have them all lined up here back to back then as for the sound here's what you can expect ordered from lightest to hardest you so i feel like the ordering here from lightest to heaviest is pretty spot on at least to me anyway with the sweet spot for most people going to be somewhere in the middle for some reason i see the klgm4s as a really popular upgrade option but this feels by far the heaviest switch in the entire lineup and having that much weight behind the trigger in game honestly just feels a bit too weird for me personally my favorite switches here would have to be the kale gm2s and the juano blue white dots they both offer a light to moderate actuation great feedback and a nice full sounding click i also think that these two sounded the best and fullest when installed in the g pro super light which tends to feel a little bit too empty and hollow for some of these switches and the bottom line here is that they are a noticeable upgrade over the stock omron 20 amps in fact all of these switches are i've also measured at no significant difference in click latency between them since that's mostly a result of polling rate and debounce time which is controlled by the mouse firmware this is the result that we'd expect so really a pretty quick cheap and effective mod which seems most useful for mice like the g pro wireless and the g pro super light where the stock omrons either just fail on you by double clicking or they just don't offer much feedback in the case of the omron 28ms i'll also mention that this is a pretty easy place to start to learn soldering in my opinion if you have a fine enough soldering tip it really is a pretty straightforward process the switches themselves are only really a couple dollars each as well so not a whole lot of money invested here either again all of the tools that you'll need will be linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
