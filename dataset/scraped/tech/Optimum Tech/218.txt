[Music] some of you might remember the hackintosh build here that we did a couple of months ago and the objective here was to see how hard it would be to get an aim D rising system running Mac OS because the general understanding is that AMD processors are just not that friendly with hackintosh build and that it is better to go with Intel instead well long story short we did get it up and running and it wasn't much more difficult compared to an Intel system today though we're taking that system and stepping it up a notch we're taking the six core processor and upgrading it to a 16 core one and we're also upgrading the GPU so we'll take a look at the performance there and I also want to dedicate a big portion of this video to sort of discuss whether building something like this is even worth it as opposed to buying a real Mac so one of the main problems with this build was that the onboard Wi-Fi and bluetooth for this motherboard was incompatible with mac OS and so let's deal with that first it's a pretty easy and cheap fix you'll need one of these chips here from Broadcom that Apple use in their own Mac books I'll link the exact one that I used down below all I did was swap the existing wireless chip with this one along with an MDOT 2 adapter and you can just use the existing antenna from the original chip so this was actually enough to get Wi-Fi and bluetooth up and running out of the box meaning that I didn't need any additional text files or adjustments to the config dot P list file iCloud services work and pairing with air pods was just as flawless with a regular Apple machine in fact airdrop also worked with had an issue which was great to see and a bit surprising to be honest seeing as this is one of the most desired features from a real Mac system and in terms of a hackintosh it's usually one of the harder features to get running honestly there are probably a few more little special features that don't work here that I just haven't come across yet but for the most part we have the majority of functionality that most people will need from a Mac OS system one little feature that I noticed that didn't work was the take photo from iphone feature it's there and it's it works on the map but it just times out every time not really sure if this is a hackintosh compatibility issue or if it's just a setup issue on the mind you probably already know this but if you want 100% of the functionality within Apple's Mac OS then hackintosh probably isn't for you unless you're prepared to spend a serious amount of time into researching the optimal configurations and kind of files that you need more than that in just a minute but one of the big benefits of building a hackintosh is of course that you can build a pretty powerful machine for not a whole lot of money so the initial system that I built wasn't too bad at all had a 6-quart risin 530 608 Viger 56 that's plenty of power to get some decent work done in apps like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere but let's take things a step further and see what happens with the 16 core rise in 3950 X and here ad on 7 for some perspective a 16 core Mac Pro would set you back around 8,000 US dollars and that's with a much weaker Radeon Pro 580 X which is essentially an rx 580 that's nothing compared to our Radeon 7 with 16 gigabytes of HBM to memory thankfully seeing as we're just using the same generation of CPU as we had previously from the 3600 to 39 50x there's no need to make adjustments to the config dot plist file but that is something that you might need to do if you're upgrading between generations I had no problems booting up here at all and the new hardware was recognized and working fine unfortunately the temp sensors don't seem to work here for AMD CPUs on Mac OS but I have tested the 39 50 X with this CPU cooler previously and I'm confident that everything is running just fine I played around with Final Cut Pro DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere and all three video editing programs seemed to run just fine very familiar performance to what you'd expect from the same hardware running on a Windows machine the big difference here is that you can actually run something like Final Cut Pro if you do need that for your work and we can see at least on a performance level we do get some very strong results against the Mac Pro and iMac pro but of course at a lower cost single core scores outperformed every Mac in existence and multi-core scores in Geekbench were okay in terms of price to performers but nothing over the top testing the metal graphics API which is what Final Cut Pro uses we're getting much better performance compared to the baseline 580 X that the Mac Pro users and a bit faster still than the upcoming Radeon Pro 5700 X according to geek benches database of course though you do have to actually build and research how to get this hackintosh up and running which does take additional time as opposed to additional money and that's something that I should not understate now one big problem with hackintosh is as you might know is that there's a very likely possibility that if you do happen to click update to a new Mac OS version your install will likely become very unstable and maybe even refused to food so the version that we're running here currently on this machine is Mac OS Mohave and when upgrading to Catalina we can see that this just breaks the entire system this is one area where a real Mac obviously would have no issues now there is a more stable route of building a hackintosh compared to what I've done here and that's with a bootloader called open core I built this system with the clover bootloader as at the time it was the much easier and more common route even for AMD CPUs but open core which is a more advanced way of configuring your hackintosh allows for a much more involved and deliberate process it forces you to understand the moving parts in everything here and there's a very dedicated community behind the scenes honestly I would push you in this direction instead of what I've done here with clover if you're looking to build something as stable as possible with the latest Mac OS versions so without hackintosh build pretty much useless after that catallena update attempt I decided to give open core a shot and worked off of the very detailed written guide there's also a video out there from snazzy labs which helps me understand how to run things like SSD tea-time and proper tree which I found to be sort of the main two differences between the clover and open core route and of course I will link that video down below so honestly I actually enjoyed the open core process of doing things compared to clover I felt like I understood it a lot more I got right to the end of the install process to the point where you set up your Mac but I can only see a portion of the screen and a moving cursor so this build did not work for me so although it was more detailed and thorough and technically is the better way to do things I could not get it to work I've tried different Mac OS builds I've tried different SM BIOS versions and of course swapping through multiple different supported GPUs and the ports on the back of course I didn't reuse any of my existing clover files because there are some clashes there and I made sure to clean the NVRAM still no success but let me know your thoughts down below if you have any ideas now I understand that there are a portion of you who just want to see the first 950 X and Radeon 7 in terms of price to performance and hopefully you got the results that you are after but there are also a portion of you who are interested in building something like this and a wondering if this is worth your time and your money and I would say if you're going to be doing this as a hobby system and for a bit of fun then definitely you will learn a lot and it is a challenging yet enjoyable process put a couple weekends aside get stuck into the open core documentation and I'm confident that a lot of you will have a successful and enjoyable outcome but if you're going to be doing actual work on this machine that pays the bills and you absolutely need mac OS whether that be for Final Cut Pro Logic Pro or maybe Xcode for software development putting the stability argument aside learning how to build and actually building a hackintosh does require a significant amount of your time if you're starting with zero knowledge and if you're doing it properly with something like open call that's time that could have been spent working on a real Mac and paying off the difference that you could have saved with that hackintosh build and I'll let that sink in for a moment because I think the main argument for a hackintosh is the amount of money that you can save building something like this as opposed to you know a ten thousand dollar Mac Pro but you also have to consider how much your time is worth and if you're going to be doing this for you know if your job depends on Mac OS let's say you need Logic Pro X or you're an Xcode development and you really need that performance maybe you are just better off buying a Mac instead because for you the additional time versus the additional money to buy Mac might actually cancel out and you're gonna ask yourself what you would rather in the end perhaps less functional and less stable hackintosh or the slightly lower performance but 100% stable Mac machine now some of you may have heard of the rumored upcoming Intel CPUs supposedly there's a 10 core on the way I think I'll reattached open core with that CPU and see if we get some better stability and a better outcome there I will also leave some very helpful links down below in the description if you are interested in building something like this as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
