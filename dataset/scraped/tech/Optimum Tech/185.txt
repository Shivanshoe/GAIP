[Music] recently i built a fairly dense custom loop in the encase m1 the performance was simply unreal even with a power hungry 10 900k and rtx 2080 ti since it used two 240mm radiators one of them being a solid 38 millimeters thick unfortunately though that build is a bit hard to be replicated by you guys seeing as the cpu pump lock that i used to power the entire loop is barely ever in stock and that's the apogee drive 2 but to be honest even if it was in stock i might just be recommending this pump solution instead this is the iceman pump and reservoir combo made specifically for the encase m1 and it's easily one of my favorite pieces of watercoloring hardware to date so if you're interested in building a custom water cooling loop in the nk someone or maybe just want to see something pretty cool stay tuned and we'll see what you need to know so i know this is specific to the end case m1 but seeing as it's one of the best pc cases of all time in my opinion this piece of hardware is definitely worth taking a look at don't get me wrong air cooled and standard aio builds in the end case are more than what most people will probably need for their systems but a custom loop will really take things to the next level especially if you're using two radiators with that much cooling available you can pretty much throw whatever specs you want at this sub 13 liter case and still get mind-blowingly quiet operation the iceman pump res combo is a piece of hardware that will allow you to do that in the fastest easiest and safest way possible firstly a quick overview of what exactly we're looking at here the top half is a nicely sized reservoir with a fill port directly above then we've got a drain port right at the bottom which is nice and easy to access and then the inlet and outlet ports which point directly into the case if you've ever wondered what those two little rubber grommet holes are for in the nk someone well now you know overall build quality is really impressive and exactly what you'd want for a high performance system i will also note that iceman do make two models the standard black one that you see here with the acrylic cover for the reservoir and also a frosted rgb version which also looks pretty neat either will set you back around 90 to 100 us dollars but that does include a ddc pump but more on that in just a minute installing the pump onto the reservoir is pretty straightforward make sure you've got the o-ring installed when doing this to prevent any leaking just four screws here and you're done the whole piece mounts to the back of the nk someone where you'd otherwise install a 92 mil fan so the good thing is that it's not imposing on any of the hardware that you would install inside the case one thing to definitely consider though is that it does extend beyond the back of the end case you know a considerable amount i don't think for most people who are going to be having it on their desk and kind of looking at it from this angle are really going to care but if you're going to be using the end case as a portable build this is definitely something you'll want to consider if you can get past that though one big benefit of using this over the swift tech apigee drive 2 is that you now have total freedom over which cpu water block you go with so if you have a high performance option or maybe a monoblock that you'd like to run instead or of course an rgb block then that is now an option installation into the m1 is fairly simple just remove the rubber grommets then use the included screws to secure it to the back where you would otherwise install a 92 mil fan they do include some anti-vibration mounting feel free to use them but i personally don't think they're necessary then after you've sorted out the rest of your build and the tubing filling the loop up is super easy just pour straight into the res try and get as much liquid into the loop as you can by maneuvering the case around and then when you've filled as much as you can turn on the power and the loop will start to run the test build here was quickly thrown together just to show the installation process but i also wanted to see how loud the ddc pump was that came with the kit and the answer is you can definitely hear it even at the lower speed the one that i ordered came with a ddc pump from bixkey but if i end up using this reservoir in the future which is highly likely i might try some alternate and hopefully quieter options from ek so having the pump running on the outside of the case is definitely one of the primary concerns of this setup it's going to be a lot louder compared to running it on the inside where you've got sound insulation of your panels your radiators and your fans that shouldn't push you away from trying this solution though because there are much quieter ddc pumps on the market than this one from big ski even the one that came with the apogee drive 2 much much quieter so there's no reason that you couldn't find a really quiet pump on the market after doing some research run it at a low pump speed because you really don't need that much flow rate and that will bring noise levels down significantly now some of you might also be wondering wait a minute didn't you just make a video on alphacool's dc lt pump and say that that was the pump that you're going to be using for water called itx builds and yes that's right but i'd only recommend that for single radiator builds for dual rad builds you might run into issues with flow rate and filling up the loop is going to be much easier with this ddc solution here although the dc lt is enough for smaller loops like in my personal rig ddc is significantly more powerful in comparison and is what i'd recommend for the end case another thing i'll mention is that you will have a cable running on the outside of your build as well to power the pump but there is a small gap just above the reservoir where you might be able to fit it through like i did here overall this is a really cool piece of hardware for the end case m1 and for all of you out there who do own an end case and haven't considered water calling it this might just be the easiest way to do that i might just use this solution down the road if the new nvidia ampere gpus are a bit too much for my t1 rig back there with a single radiator this uh paired with a dual rad solution in the m1 is probably what i'll be going with if you are interested in picking one up i will leave them linked down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
