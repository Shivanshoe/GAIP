so i want to try and make this video as compact and dense as possible for both of our sakes here because you know this is not a very exciting product but i want to try and skip over all of the ranty stuff where i tell you how the 30 80 12 gig shouldn't exist and how and video is just being a little bit weird here and taking advantage of the market because let's face it that is exactly what's going on here with this product but let's just make this video you know as useful as possible i want to show you how this stacks up versus the 3080 and the 3080 ti so yeah this is the new rtx 3080 12 gigabyte think of it basically as a 3080 but with some extra gpu cores extra video memory and memory bandwidth and it exists purely because the gpu market is so easy for nvidia at the moment basically anything and everything will sell so why not just re-badge pretty much the same thing and make it a bit more expensive i will also note that pretty much all of the 12 gigabyte 3080s that i've seen online seem to be only offered as light hash rate variants or lhr versions for sure i don't put too much faith in the whole lhr branding personally uh you know having a look at the gpu market since the inception of lhr it hasn't really improved things prices are still very inflated and the gpu market is still very stubborn sure these cards might be a little bit less profitable for cryptocurrency miners even after their kind of workarounds and mining less profitable coins but we're really yet to see any prices or availability improve but moving on let's take a closer look at the specs see what exactly we're working with here the new card it has an extra 256 cuda cores at the same boost clock and it has the same memory specs as the 3080 ti so 12 gigs 384 bit at 19 gigabits per second it also has strangely the same tdp as the 3080 ti which is a monstrous 350 watts which is really interesting since it has 12 and a half percent less cuda cores and the boost clock is only slightly higher but what does all this mean when it comes to performance the biggest question that you'd probably want to know as a consumer is whether this is closer to the original 3080 or closer to the 3080 ti well in cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing and dlss enables the new 12 gigabyte 3080 places itself pretty much right in the middle of the two with the margin either way pretty even now what i'm actually super impressed with here is how nvidia have managed to squeeze yet another gpu in between two existing cards which were already so close in performance first it was the 3080 ti between the 3080 and 3090 and now it is the 30 80 12 gig between these two cards that we see here with the 3080 ti only being about eight to ten percent faster than the standard 3080 it's honestly hard to tell whether the new 12 gig 3080 is closer to the original 3080 or the ti purely because the margins are already so damn close here basically you're looking at a 5 increase between the 10 gig and the 12 gig 3080 and another 5 roughly up to the ti and honestly with such small margins at this point i should also mention what specific graphics cards and cooler designs we're using here because that alone is swinging these tiny margins by a fair bit so for the 10 gig 3080 i've used the founders edition and i've used the msi supreme x for the new 12 gig and the 3080 ti so if we had to normalize the cooler designs and increased power limit across all three expect the margins between the 10 gig and 12 geek 3080 to be even slimmer now there are some titles out there which will benefit from the decently faster memory on the new 12 gig 3080 and so it'll perform a lot closer to the ti shadow of the tomb raider is a pretty good example of this and it's a similar story if you game at 4k i will note that i did see what seems like some driver issues in red dead redemption 2 where we see some pretty consistent fps hiccups stuff like this usually gets resolved pretty quickly and in this case i'd expect performance again to sit pretty evenly between the two performance in production workloads like blender is again pretty much right even between the two with extremely small margins even between the 3080 and the ti the increased memory bandwidth on the new 12 gig model could potentially be useful in some workloads but these gpus are already so fast anyway and you know with these margins so small between them i would just recommend to get the cheapest one that you can find here's an idea of the thermals clock speed and power levels of the msi supreme x that i used for testing and as you can see the power limit has been raised quite a bit this card sits just under 400 watts while maintaining above 1920 megahertz fan speed and temperatures were fine although we are testing on an open test bench here with the room at 23 degrees but putting this thing in a case make sure that you have enough airflow to keep this thing running happily in the end you get the idea about five percent faster than a 10 gig 3080 and about five percent slower than a 3080 ti and depending on which cooler design you buy what resolution you play at and the formation of the stars it could swing closer to either one i mean those are the small margins that we're talking about here so if you do happen to be a gamer who has been saving your pennies and you do have quite a lot of money to spend on a high-end gpu the advice still remains i mean just grab what is most affordable and if that is the 30 80 10 gig which it is most likely then that is what i would recommend as far as i'm concerned the gaming experience is fairly interchangeable even between the 3080 and the 3080 ti i mean even they're looking at like eight to ten percent and that is definitely not a performance margin worth hundreds and hundreds of dollars and i will mention there is actually no msrp for the 12 gig 3080. nvidia just didn't list one although that would be pretty irrelevant anyway given the market and look pricing today it is still dictated by which cards and how many of them happen to be in stock so summing up this review if you can't find a 12 gig 3080 that's within like pocket change of an in stock 10 gig model then it is just not worth paying extra for and i think we will leave the review right there hopefully this helps you out as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
