so a while ago i reviewed an open case called the x proto it was a beautiful well-machined vertical frame for your hardware and it made for a really interesting looking build and i had no idea that that would be one of my most popular videos to date but not only that it's that afterwards i began seeing so many x proto builds out there in the wild so clearly you guys are really interested in this open case thing and that's good because they've developed the case even further they've now added support for border cooling including both aios and custom lubes there's better support for flow through coolers as well as a larger model that supports triple slot graphics cards and atx power supplies so that's exactly what we're going to be taking a look at today especially this build right here with an aio at the back which i think looks absolutely sick as well as just talking about this whole open case thing is this really something that you should build your system with so why exactly would you go for an open case after all it's not really a case or enclosure at all it doesn't protect your precious components and your build is free to collect dust and be attacked by your pets well i think despite all of those compromises a lot of you find this open frame design really attractive because it allows you to do exactly that show off your pc hardware and have almost what looks like an art piece sitting on your desk it's clear that for a lot of you it's not just about the utility of your pc and getting the job done it's also about just building it how you want but speaking of utility there are actually serious benefits of going with an open case design for one you don't need any fans to move air through a case so noise is a lot lower at full load and being completely open allows for really superb thermal performance as well since it's unrestricted so let's take a look at one of the new versions which is called the x proto n all x proto cases come really well packed and you can tell that this is a brand that really cares about user experience instead of just giving you a bag of mixed screws and saying good luck like a lot of the popular small form factor cases out there here they're clearly labeled in a small container they've also included plenty of zip ties and a small screwdriver with two bits that are required for assembly now on a separate note i would love to see the x proto in a range of different colors maybe not a whole lot of different colors but at least in black and dark silver i think that would look absolutely sick at the moment there's only this kind of medium silver blue tint color which looks good enough it looks clean and the finish is really good as well but i think an x-pro in a really dark uh neutral color would look absolutely awesome so the new x-proto n has pretty much the same specs as the original x proto but it's better suited towards the latest gpus and also adds water cooling support as well there's now more cutouts in the frame for the latest flow through coolers and card length has been expanded from 315 millimeters in length up to 330 thanks to that large cutout in the bottom and you can get a really sick looking build here with really clean cable management as well here i'm using the asus b550i strix with a ryzen 5600x and the alpinphone blackridge cooler along with an rtx 3080 founders edition on the flip side i'd also highly recommend going with a corsair platinum series sfx power supply if you're planning on building with the x proto the sleeved cables are really flexible and can be managed really easily so here's what the thermals look like for the rtx 3080 fe with a room temperature of 20 degrees c and leaving the fan speed completely stock and the result here is definitely possible although it's clear that there is still quite a bit of restriction here for that flow-through cooler this is just the nature of sandwich layout cases there's not much you can really do here but a gpu under vault would help quite a bit if you're planning on running a similar setup cpu thermals on the other hand were really great with the ryzen 5600x and the blackridge cooler so if you're looking for something nice and low profile this is a really solid option of course cpu cooler height is virtually unlimited with the x proto but this keeps things looking nice and balanced alright but now let's talk about water cooling support starting with the aio bracket allowing for either a 240 280 or even a 360 mil radiator to be mounted at the front back or both the most conventional setup here would probably be a 240mm aio for the cpu mounted at the back like this allowing you to run higher tdp cpus like a ryzen 5900x or a 10900k at full power since the radiator is completely unrestricted in an open environment like this it'll be capable of some really serious cooling and the mounting system is actually really clever as well and it's integrated straight into the existing design the first bracket attaches to the upper and lower beam in the middle and then you can simply mount the radiator and second bracket it's surprisingly sturdy nicely machined and high quality just like the rest of the case and a super interesting design to look at now one thing that's definitely worth mentioning here is that when mounting an aio outside of a case pump noise is going to be a lot more noticeable so if you can probably stick to an air cooling setup if you have a really quiet kind of setup and environment if you have a normal noise setup like me for example i think going with an aio setup like this would be okay just go with one that has say an asetek gen 7 pump like this kraken x53 here that way you can spin the pump down to 800 rpm at idle and there it's pretty much almost silent one thing i will say though that even with the aio mounted here cable management can be surprisingly good almost all of the excess can be stuffed into the spine of the case and just tucked away keeping the build looking super tidy the manufacturer of the x proto xtr do actually make some really high quality custom length cables for the x proto if that's something that you guys are interested in specifically made for the corsair sf series power supplies i personally found the stock sleeved cables from the corsair sf600 platinum to be more than fine but these shorter cables are really nice and do make life a whole lot easier but arguably the most difficult cable management of an x proto build is when it comes time to actually put it on your desk since the i o faces the top of the build you're potentially looking at a ton of cable spew and mass so you really do need to spend a bit of time organizing this as well if you're someone who pretty much maxes out all of your rear i o ports like myself honestly this is probably not the case for you but if you're okay using right angled connectors and adapters you can get it at least looking pretty presentable now on this note one of the accessories that they've added is a front i o module which replaces the stock front bezel and gives you an additional two usb 3.0 ports a headphone port and a microphone port so great addition here and can definitely help alleviate some of that cable spew coming out the top but back to the aio build i'd only recommend going with an aio here if you're really running a high core count cpu or one where the power limits are going to be unlocked like an i5 four hundred for our ryzen 5600x here a 240mm aio is just so overkill whether it's for gaming or all core workloads like blender even the low profile blackridge cooler is able to keep things nice and steady at 74 degrees c here since it's not restricted by case airflow or any panels as for the 3080 fe we're running about one degree cooler here compared to not running any radiator or fans at the back as we're able to pull just a little bit more air away from that flow-through cooler on the graphics card so it's an okay result a bit louder than a form t1 at about the same temperature but for an open case you'd expect it to perform a bit better in fact when we do compare it to a conventional open test bench with the 3080 fe plugs straight into the motherboard that setup runs about three degrees cooler but way way quieter now there is also the x proto l if you need triple slot card support which is perfect for those big rtx 3080s and 3090s the performance of the 3090 fe would probably be ok here as well but again there is some restriction for that flow through cooler the airflow can pass into the spine of the case but then it kind of gets trapped and doesn't have anywhere to go ideally the x proto works best with conventional open air coolers with the exhaust airflow blowing out the front and the back of the card there we do get excellent gpu thermal and noise performance as we've seen previously with the rtx 2070 super so just keep that in mind another thing to keep in mind is that the x proto by default ships with a pcie 3.0 riser cable which can pose compatibility issues if you're using both a gpu and motherboard with pcie gen4 luckily though they do actually provide an upgrade to a gen 4 cable for around 50 dollars which is actually a really solid deal and again highly recommended if you are using both a pcie gen 4 motherboard and gpu and the last thing that i'll mention here is the support for custom liquid cooling with brackets that allow you to mount pumps reservoirs and radiators given the depth and build opportunity here i thought it would be best to just save this for a full custom loop build in the future which i'm really excited for so do hit that subscribe button if you haven't already so honestly really impressed with what the team over at exterior have done with the x produ when i first reviewed it nine or so months ago i did not expect this amount of brackets and modules it really does make for a lot of different opportunities and it does make a meaningful impact to the user experience and also the calling potential as well now my thoughts on open cases are pretty much the same it doesn't really change the fact that this is not really a case or an enclosure it's not something that i would personally run my main system on but i can see the popularity behind it and i can see why you guys were so impressed with the experto from the beginning so if you would like to pick one up i will leave it linked down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
