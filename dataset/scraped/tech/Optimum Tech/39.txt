today we're checking out the ducky one three mini which is a revision of course of the one two mini a very popular 60 gaming keyboard and one which i've been recommending for quite a while but with the keyboard industry kind of trending towards better customization modding even and you know generally just more awareness when it comes to the acoustics ducky have released this revision which features exactly that the blue and yellow colorway that we have here is called daybreak which i'll say is pretty unique but there is also a completely yellow model too which looks pretty cool these seem to be the only two launch options for now with the larger 1 3 boards getting a couple more mellow options as well if you prefer something a little bit more muted i definitely would have loved to see a more neutral color way to get things started you know something like completely black or gray but no doubt that is something that will eventually happen down the road there are a few novelty keycaps to play around with included as well if you do want a little bit more flair and all of the keycaps are double shot pbt and so should last a very long time the texture on the surface is a little bit more than what i found on the one two mini which i do actually prefer here so we won't have any problem losing grip and don't be mistaken the 60 case here is still definitely plastic although it does have the appearance of anodized metal but of course this is one of the main reasons that the price is relatively low the typing height options are the same as the previous one two mini so three different settings and i found the flattest and the middle setting to be the most comfortable for me one of the big headline features and upgrades here though is the completely hot swap pcb that means swapping out switches to something a lot more premium feeling that can easily be done now without ever needing to desolder and re-solder a bunch of switches the ducky one 3 is using kale hot swap sockets and i had no problem at all removing and reinserting switches with the included tool literally you could do the entire board here within a few minutes and i really hope this does encourage people to experiment with the different switch options that are out there because i do believe that will improve the typing experience dramatically compared to what you're getting here out of the box the launch option that i have here is using cherry mx clears which are a tactile switch with a fairly noticeable and pronounced bump but they do feel kind of scratchy and rough as usual though you will have a bunch of different switch options at launch like your typical flavors of cherry mx and if you're primarily using this keyboard for gaming you'll probably want to stick with the cherry mx reds the silent reds or the silvers i'd also be really keen to see ducky sell this as a bare bones kit although i'm not sure how well they would sell because i think most people are just interested in a keyboard that's ready to go but for the people who are interested in a more premium typing experience you know you can get that within this board if you put in some lube switches for example the typing experience will be improved dramatically at the same time it's not something that i can really recommend because if you buy a bag of switches for like 60 or 70 dollars then you're almost looking at like a 200 board here which you know it is starting to kind of creep up then to the entry-level custom keyboard market still though i am very thankful to see a hotspot pcb here for those who do want to play around with customization down the road and hey maybe you get bored of your switches after a year or two you can easily swap to something else what can really make or break a keyboard though is the sound and the sound of the one two mini is something that i was you know fairly impressed with for the price and that for a while has been my go-to recommendation if you're after a pre-built 60 keyboard the stabilizers sound worlds better than what razer corsair or glorious keep pumping out at the same price and you just get a really solid feeling keyboard which gives you a lot of confidence in game with the one three mini ducky have taken things a step further by adding foam inside the case so there's now a small layer of foam underneath the pcb although it is pretty thin it does kind of make an impact here and there is a thicker layer of very dense foam between the pcb and the plate although it is just cheap foam packed into a keyboard to fill the gaps it does greatly improve the acoustics of the one three mini does make it sound a lot more solid less like a hollow plastic keyboard which was what the one two mini was so here's a sound comparison of the ducky 1 3 mini versus a few other 60 keyboards so [Applause] [Applause] the space bar stabilizer is also lubed just like it was on the previous model although the lubing job could probably be a little bit better but overall i have no complaints with the stabilizers here by far the best sounding on any 60 pre-built keyboard that i've used the only thing for me really is not lacking the sound and feel of those cherry mx clear switches i do prefer a smoother linear switch but that is totally personal preference now although i do really love 60 keyboards and this really compact form factor that just sits so nicely on the desk especially if you use a really big mouse pad i really cannot live without my arrow keys which unfortunately the ducky one three mini does not have even tapping these they unfortunately do not act as arrow keys and instead you'll have to hold the function key and then press either of this arrow cluster here i do appreciate though how they have shifted the arrow cluster a little bit closer to that function key so you can actually just activate those with one hand whereas before it was like j k l and i on the one two mini whenever i build my own custom 60 keyboards i always put physical arrow keys because i just cannot live with these for gaming it doesn't really matter you're not really using arrow keys anyway but for editing day-to-day use these arrow keys get used an absolute ton so it would really have been nice to see uh ducky implement some arrow functionality within the ducky one three mini as a nice little upgrade over the one two mini and so if you do want physical arrow keys you'll have to go with a slightly bigger model which is the one three sf the one three sf will be packed with the same acoustic dampening and the new features just like the one three midi and you'll have the same switch options as well but it'll just be in a 65 form factor with those physical arrow keys now rgb lighting is something that i don't really focus on a lot in reviews but it's definitely one of the strong points here of the ducky one three mini since the plate underneath the keycaps is completely white you will get some of the most saturated and brightest rgb lighting that you'll find on any pre-built keyboard cycling between the different rgb lighting modes is pretty easy just by holding fn and alt and t and it's your typical sequence of rgb lighting effects you can also choose an individual set color by pressing fn and alt and space that's if you prefer something that looks a little bit more static and also just with the one two mini the windows key can be disabled so that you don't accidentally press those mid game and ruin everything and that can be done by pressing and holding the alt fn and windows key for three seconds so there it is overall i think this is a pretty nice revision from ducky especially since pricing does look very similar to what the one two mini is going for uh and retail these seem to be going for around the 120 us dollar mark at least on mechanical keyboards uh you know nice little improvement when it comes to the acoustics the hot swap is a super nice functionality as well and you know whether you're interested in this or the one three sf these will be my new recommendation after you guys who don't want to go you know completely custom but still want something that sounds pretty decent at an affordable price ducky are planning on launching this towards the end of the year i believe so not exactly out yet although some retailers might be offering pre-orders so definitely keep an eye out on those if you are interested i will have a link down below when it is available though so definitely check that out as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
