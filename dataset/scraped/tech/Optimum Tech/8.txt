there's something that just feels really good about a low friction mouse pad and gaming mouse setup the ultra smooth glide the easy micro adjustments and clean tracking might not be for everyone but it's definitely a rewarding setup so let's say you want the fastest and smoothest glide for your gaming mouse setup do you go with the pulsar superglide glass mouse gates which i recently reviewed or do you go for the skypad 3.0 which is an entirely glass mouse pad which i recently picked up uh and it just offers insanely low friction both of these products they pretty much achieve what they set out to do but there's a lot more to know here than just kind of putting them on your desk and going fast now we have previously taken a look at the pulsar superglides and these are definitely something that i want to share my long-term thoughts on but let me introduce the skypad 3.0 this is a mouse pad that i've been asked about over and over again and there truly is nothing else out there like it my assumption of the sky pad was that it was just going to be this basic sheet of glass that you put your mouse on but it's a little bit more than that most importantly there is actually a very slight nano texture on the surface unlike window glass or even the super glides which are perfectly smooth the sky pad has a very slight roughness it does still feel incredibly smooth to play on though don't get me wrong this texture is mostly to provide some sort of surface information for the center so that it can actually track properly the size is about the same as an artisan xl which is plenty for most people it stays planted on your desk pretty nicely as well thanks to the grips underneath and also due to the massive weight and overall it does feel like a premium product as for how fast it is it's insanely quick in terms of mouse pads it's by far the fastest thing that i've experienced so using our hair dryer test and comparing here with the artisan hen and the logitech g640 yeah the skypad is definitely quick keep in mind that for those that don't know the heian is also a pretty fast mouse pad and the g640 is not what i'd call slow by any means but the skypad is just an entirely different league for those wondering whether using the skypad and super glides is a good idea the answer is no it basically feels exactly what you'd expect scraping two pieces of glass together to feel like which is to say extremely bad especially with all of the tiny little dust particles in between them it's basically a matter of seconds before you've scratched both products so usually with uh these niche gaming products there is a bit of a learning curve right so the super glides for example were obnoxiously fast out of the box and they just seemed impossible at first but i got a bit better with them they slowed down a bit and i was able to kind of have a pretty informed review there was the trackball gaming mouse as well that thing was just absolutely insane and out of this world but again spent a bit of time with it got pretty good with it and i guess you could say my opinion and review kind of grew the more i used the product the skype 3.0 is not like that i basically knew as soon as i started using this thing that it was not for me basically i just couldn't get past the fact that my hand was gripping to the surface extremely hard any small amount of sweat and my hand would just grip immensely hard to the sky pad and as you can imagine this was extremely uncomfortable to play with one of the things that skypad users actually recommend is a gaming sleeve that covers your forearm to counter this but actually found that my forearm wasn't what was sticking that badly at all it was my hand i did experiment with a hoodie pulled over most of my hand just out of curiosity to see how that would be but surprisingly this made things even more uncomfortable the sleeve just kept bunching up and absolutely tilting me and i had no sense of my wrist or elbow pivot which i normally get from a typical pad so really the only kind of way to get a bit of game time with this pad was to use a mouse with a really high back support like the logitech g303 or the end game gear xm1 but i will say even after a couple of days i didn't really see any improvement it just kept coming back to the fact that my hand was jamming up on the pad really hard and that would throw things off entirely any benefits from the supposedly better tracking micro tracking and faster flicks that was counted entirely by this one issue now you probably could find a gaming sleeve out there that covers your entire hand and you probably could put like baby powder on the part of your hand which is sticking to the pad you probably get a desk fan pointed at the mouse pad so you don't sweat as hard but i mean if you're going to all of those lengths i really hope that you are the best aimer in the world because i surely do not want to do any of those things um it's definitely you know possible for those people who don't sweat uh don't have sweaty hands when they play that the sky pad is going to be a viable solution for you and you know for those people maybe consider checking this out if you want a super fast glide but for me and i think for most people that's going to be the biggest hurdle for them getting over this product all right but now let's talk about the super glides the glass mouse gates that i reviewed about two months ago just as i said at the end of that review i actually kept using them i really enjoyed that ultra smooth tracking feeling and the progress that i saw with continued aim training these on the g pro super light along with an artisan here really really nice setup but i do want to bring you back to something that i said in that review i will say though there are a couple of catches firstly i noticed that the super glides are really sensitive to humidity changes and cleanliness changes on your mouse pad so here's the artisan heyati otsu which i've been using for a few months and still looks super clean and with the coil pad skates the pad feels super consistent across the whole surface there's no change in the glide speed or friction with the glass gates though you can definitely feel the areas of the pad which feel a bit dirty and faded and the friction increases over those sections is pretty noticeable and that has been pretty much the main issue that i've been having with the super glides over the long term uh don't get me wrong on a fresh mouse pad like this artisan hand which i washed two days ago so it's basically brand new uh there is like no inconsistency in the glide whatsoever but the more that i would use this mouse pad and kind of you'd get this mark and kind of just build up of dead skin cells sweat that sort of stuff as gross as that is that's the kind of stuff that gets absorbed by your mouse pad those are the areas that will feel noticeably slower when using the superglides i haven't really found this to be a problem with ptfe glides since it's mostly resistant to that sort of stuff but the superglides really grip onto it just to clarify the glides themselves like the glass surface doesn't really deteriorate and slow down that much uh still much faster than ptfe glides for example but i've personally found that it's mostly the increased use of the mouse pad that creates that muddy feeling so unless you keep your mouse pad in pretty much flawless condition i don't really think you can expect totally consistent performance from the super glides think of your mouse pad as a heat map of the most used areas for example those areas you barely touch are going to feel super quick and the hot spots are going to be noticeably slower i'm sure there are mouse pads out there that don't soak up as much muck and dirt that cause that slowdown in the first place but it's at least not an artisan heian heyati otsu or a g640 so honestly both products here have their flaws on one hand the skypad is something that i found very uncomfortable to use although i can see why people like it and the super glides left me with a bit more inconsistency than i'd like i'd prefer not to have to clean my mousepad every week to correct it also if you're wondering which setup here is the faster one uh the super glides or the sky pad as you can see it is the sky pad it is noticeably faster than pretty much any mouse pad i'll say with the super glides i think you could probably get pretty close if you were using like an artisan shidenkai uh i don't have a shidenkai i'm probably gonna pick one up soon test it out i've heard the durability is pretty low on the shidenkai so maybe any users down below can let me know so yeah for what it's worth the skypad 3.0 just with core pads on the bottom actually uh is a much faster setup than what we have here and to be honest uh if you go with a setup like this so core pads and an artisan heian you're already like 90 of the way there like you're already absolutely zooming this is already such a fast setup micro adjustments no problem tracking absolutely no problem super fast glide pretty smooth overall and you know you still have the possibility that you can play games like csgo and valorum hold the angles and you still have a bit of stopping power which you know with the super glides you don't really get that and even with the sky pad it is pretty hard to do so definitely a bit more of a balance setup here i would say that you have a lot more consistency over the long term as well you're not going to feel that inconsistency as you would here with the super glides and it's definitely a lot easier to use than a skypad 3.0 and i know these niche glass products they are pretty cool they're fun to try out especially the super glides which i might try and pair with a different pad moving forward but they do come with their complications this setup on the other hand gets you around 90 of the way there in terms of speed and smoothness and honestly doesn't come with any catches really i actually recommend most people considering these two products just to get something like this instead so yeah those are my thoughts on these two are very popular very kind of talked about and kind of controversial gaming peripheral products if you've also used the skype 3.0 or if you've used the super glides i'd love to know your experience down below so feel free to drop me a comment down there as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
