[Music] it's the timeless debate when it comes to enthusiasts computing air calling versus liquid calling for your CPU having completed many projects that have floated around this very discussion i've yet to actually gramp the highest-performing options from both camps and compare them head-to-head and that is exactly what we're doing today and to make things a bit more interesting we've got some new enthusiasts air cooling options on the table which should put up a pretty good fight also this video will go quite a bit deeper than just the thermal and noise performance numbers because there are a lot of things to consider if you are deciding between an air cooler and a liquid cooler for your build so the testing here is pretty simple all callers will be run on the same test bench under the exact same conditions for the same amount of time and we'll be testing both thermal results and noise levels but before we get to that let's take a look at the coolers that we're comparing first up is deep calls assassin 3 currently deep calls flagship air cooler boasting a TDP of up to 280 watts along with that you get a fairly decent duel towel cooler with 2 140 ml PWM fans strapped to the aluminium heatsink which by the way allows for 54 millimeters of RAM clearance they've managed to cram in 7 6 millimeter heat pipes here which is definitely on the higher end of what you can expect from enthusiast coolers overall a pretty decent package and the total hype for this one comes in at 165 millimetres but will that be enough to beat the age-old king knock tours NHD 15 this cooler is widely considered the apex predator of CPU air coolers and here we have the new updated chrome axe model which is easily the best-looking CPU call it a date in my opinion the entire cooler is finished in matte black which looks insanely premium and has me seriously considering moving to an old air cold system the only not matte black component here is the nickel plated copper cold plate feeding hate to these six six millimeter heat pipes Ram clearance here is a bit better than the deep core assassin 364 millimeters on the D 15 but total height is the same 165 millimeters of course - 140 ml nfa 15 chrome expands compared with it and these fans have quite a reputation to uphold and lastly for the air coolers we have the scythe firmer - the most affordable air cooler out of the bunch at just $59 and the shortest as well at just 155 millimetres still though I have heard pretty good things from this caller and it does have six six millimeter heat pipes feeding a duel tower thin array with two 120 ml PWM fans now for the liquid coolers we're going with the 240 ml NZXT kraken x 52 and it's big brother the 280 ml X 62 and also the custom 360 ml AIO that I built in a recent video and whereas with large tower air coolers memory clearance it does need to be considered it's not something that you need to think about huddle with or liquid cooling have you said that the nhd 15 does allow for a pretty beefy 64 millimeters of memory clearance which should allow for some pretty flashy memory dims if that's what you're into but that number 64 millimeters is for the heatsink area right here not for a fan that you might be mounting right next to it so if you want to mount a fan on sort of over the memory games like we see here you will need to go much lower so with like a vengeance lpx kit or a HyperX fury memory kit instead otherwise you will have to take this fan and mount it towards the rear exhaust 120 ml fan in your case instead just keep that in mind overall with larger Tower air coolers like this it is a good idea to go with low-profile memory instead and we'll get into the thermal results in just a moment but one big factor steering you towards going with either air cooling or liquid cooling is simply how you want your system to look a lot of users these days are opting for we could a iOS simply due to the flashy pomp lock and led designs whereas large Tower air coolers seem to be used by those more concerned with reliability and simplicity of design although pump lock covers allow for some pretty cool hiding effects I will admit dealing with a bunch of cables that come along with them is never something that I look forward to dealing with and I think we can all enjoy the lack of comp when it comes to just a large heatsink with a couple of nice powerful fans not to mention the lighting software that is required to unlock these lining effects is more often than not very clunky and annoying to work with but it is getting better as time goes on so I tested these coolers on an open test bench with a ninety nine hundred K overclock to 5 gigahertz and one point two eight volts and all coolers were run for thirty minutes during a blender render ambient room temperature was also controlled and monitored throughout all of these tests all right now let's jump into the thermal results starting with the warmest result in the stack beside firmer - this was kind of expected seeing as this is the smallest heatsink that we have tested here and the fan speed also tops out at just 1200 rpm still 81.4 degrees C is a respectable and safe result for our overclocked 9,900 k also considering the much larger deep core assassin 3r and only two degrees cooler at a much larger noise level the knock to our NHD 15 was two degrees cooler again but does receive some praise due to its excellent noise performance which we'll take a look at in just a minute some of you may have noticed that so far there aren't any liquid callers on this graph and that's because all of the liquid coolers tested even the 240 ml outperformed all of the air coolers tested to be fair though between the NHD 15 and the kraken x 52 under these conditions they are seriously neck-and-neck and within margin of error I will also note that all of the liquid coolers here have their pump speed set to max we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a minute but at least based on pure thermal performance even the largest highest performing air coolers on the market cannot be liquid cooling especially when you compare them against a larger radiators having said that the difference between the Noctua NHD 15 and our custom 360 mm a IO is only around four degrees and unless you're constantly looking at your monitoring software or demand simply the best that's not a practical difference that will significantly affect the performance of your workflow or applications even in the age of rising CPUs that have clock frequency behavior that scales along with temperature 8 for degree increase in thermals isn't that significant still though it is there to be fair and even a 280mm off-the-shelf AIO will give you slightly better thermals than our best air cooler here but again that's only relevant if you are absolutely scratching for every last clock cycle and degree now when comparing noise levels between air cooling and liquid cooling it can be somewhat misleading because effectively you are just comparing the noise levels of the fans that either cooler is using so when someone says that air cooling is quieter than liquid cooling or the reverse that liquid cooling is quieter than air cooling first off it's just false there's no global rule that one is quieter than the other and the biggest thing here again it's the fans the fan type and the fan rpm both air coolers and liquid coolers can be super quiet cooling solutions depending on the fans that are being used for example our custom 360 ml a IO uses three fans the most fans in this entire stack so it should easily be the loudest fan setup in these results however it does use high performance Noctua NF a 12 by 25 fans and that's what gives it the superb noise performance one interesting comparison though is that the best-performing air coil in the stack in terms of thermals the nhd 15 performed slightly quieter than the kraken x52 at pretty much the same thermal performance effectively these coolers will give you pretty much the same results on paper but as we mentioned leading into the testing there are a lot more factors to consider this includes the design and looks of the cooler memory clearance cable management and something we've yet to mention what do you think you'll be bothered by the pump noise on the liquid cooler before we discussed that here's a quick listen to the noise results of all of these coolers so now let's talk about pump noise uncommon liquid coolers because despite how many generations we are in pump design this is something that still detracts users from liquid cooling and I would say that it's mostly when your system is at idle that it seems to become more of an issue that's when you don't have your headphones on while gaming and when the fans in your system aren't drowning out the noise of the pump it's when your system is just idling that's when your pump noise seems to be most noticeable and irritating but whether this is going to annoy you depends a lot on how loud the noise floor is in your environment or setup for example if your setup has a fan or air conditioner or maybe you leave the windows open then I don't think pump noise is something that will personally bother you but if you have an absurdly low noise floor at your setup and you have all your windows closed and everything's really quiet it's definitely something that can become a lot more irritating because it will simply just become a lot more audible just imagine what an idling pump would sound like in an anechoic chamber that thing would send you insane for real world use though it's mostly not an issue especially if you set the pump speed to something nice and low when it's at idle still though this is for every strong point of powerful air colors seeing as an idling fan is barely audible at all even in very low noise floor environments and another strong point of air coolers is of course reliability although it's never happened to me personally pumps on liquid coolers can fail whereas obviously this isn't a problem with a simple heatsink and fan now all of this is assuming that you do have a case and system that is large enough for all of these coolers in the first place remember the nhd 15 and the 240 ml kraken x 50 to give pretty much the same thermal and noise performance that the kraken x52 does have better compatibility when it comes to cases so that's definitely something to keep in mind and is potentially a plus one for liquid a iOS overall there are just a lot of things to consider when choosing the right CPU cooler for your build and your situation liquid coolers still hold the crown in terms of royal thermal performance and noise performance too when using quiet fans and they do also have a some appeal when it comes to looks but they are more expensive and they do have potential issues when it comes the integrated pump like increased noise at idle additional cable management and being an additional point of failure so although the beefiest hair color is out there like this NHD 15 from Noctua cannot beat the raw firmware noise performance of a decent liquid cooler like a kraken X 62 there are still plenty of reasons why you might want to opt for one in your system instead of a liquid cooler if you are interested in any of the coolers discussed today I will have them linked down below in the description as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
