we all know how important memory speeds are for ryzen cpus especially the last three generations but what about ryzen 5000 after all this is the latest release from amd and despite still being seven nanometer these have been reworked from the ground up and it clearly shows the performance gains over last gen are seriously impressive making these an easy recommendation across the board something else that's really interesting is the faster infinity fabric clock that can be pushed a little bit faster this time around so can ryzen 5000 really benefit from faster ddr4 memory and what does that mean for an ultra high speed kit like this four thousand megahertz cl 15 from g-skill well let's take a look [Music] now the memory kit that i've used across all cpu reviews for quite a while now has been this kit right here 32 gigabytes 3200 megahertz with pretty low latencies so if you are new to pc building just note that the latencies of the kit are just as important as the frequency itself and sure i could have used a 4 000 megahertz kit to compare the 5900x and 10 900k to begin with but what happens when i need to test the ryzen 5 2600 or a 3300x good luck pairing those cpus with a really high speed kit like this motherboard choice is equally as important and although high speed ram compatibility has improved along with the generations of ryzen processors it's definitely something that you'll still need to check with a super high speed kit i'm using the x570 creation from msi which i found to be one of the more reliable and predictable am4 boards to test with and this handled the 4000 megahertz kit without a struggle but to actually get our ryzen cpu to run properly with a memory kit faster than 3600 megahertz we need to overclock the infinity fabric as an oversimplified explanation this is the high speed link between the major components of a ryzen cpu and by default it's synced directly to your memory speed so for example if you have a dual channel megahertz memory kit your infinity fabric speed also known as f clock will be 1600 megahertz what's new with ryzen 5000 cpus is that they have an f clock that can be pushed up to 2 000 megahertz which now allows us to run a super fast 4 000 megahertz memory kit but is that actually worth it well let's take a look at a very broad comparison to start with extremely slow ddr4 2133 megahertz versus reasonably fast 200 megahertz versus the ultra fast 4 000 megahertz cl15 kit firstly in cinebench r20 there's barely a difference at all we're looking at a difference of just 15 or so points between the 2133 megahertz versus four thousand megahertz kit that changes when we look at v-ray though we can improve our score by a little under four percent by jumping from 2133 to 3200 but then only 0.5 percent from upgrading from 3200 to 4000 the speed up when it comes to gaming is much of the same story there's a noticeable performance improvement between 2133 and 3200 but the 4 000 megahertz kit despite in theory giving us a huge boost doesn't between the megahertz cl-14 kit that i use for testing and the 4 000 megahertz cl15 kit you're looking at at most a 1 improvement in frame rate but there's a little more that's going on behind the cnt because the profile loaded by this board whether it's correct or not can be improved on specifically the memory timings and sub timings which can be tightened up significantly for example lowering the trfc value from 700 down to 260 this alone provided more benefit from the jump in frequency alone from 3200 to 4000 although we are still talking about performance gains of barely one percent and by tightening up a few more timings dropping t raz from 36 to 34 and trc from 90 to 50. we get potentially another one percent depending on the game or application at this point though there really is such minimal benefit for the amount of time invested and don't forget that every time you tweak or change one of these settings you're introducing potential instability to your system i think we'd all agree that it's just not worth your games crashing for that extra 1 fps so ryzen 5000 cpus don't seem to be any more memory speed sensitive than previous ryzen generations and you can probably get most of your performance gains out of a 3200 or 3600 megahertz kit and the fact that you can now push the fabric clock up to 2000 megahertz is pretty cool from a cpu testing and benchmarking point of view but in no way shape or form does it provide a meaningful benefit in terms of performance in games or mainstream applications so it's absolutely not worth it the price of this kit is 220 dollars us whereas the price of a 3600 megahertz cl 16 kit is less than half that and we'll get you 99 of the way there at the end of the day it does all come down to price and the good news is that pricing is definitely in your favor at the moment the price difference between a bottom of the barrel 2133 megahertz kit versus the aforementioned 3600 kit is only around 40 us and that is absolutely money well spent so that's the recommendation stick to a decent value 3200 to 3600 megahertz kit with decent timings just as you would with previous ryzen generations if you've really got some time to kill feel free to jump in the bios and tighten up some of those timings but keep in mind that that's mostly going to be beneficial on slower kits since they have more headroom for improvement and you are potentially introducing instability to your system so i'll leave some links down below to some memory kits that you might be interested in as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
