recently we've been focusing a lot on my own personal PC builds and what I've been building and kind of sharing you the process of what I'm using at the moment but today is a bit different because we're actually going to be checking out what you guys have been building so I reached out on Twitter and asked you guys to send me your most epic high TX PC builds and we did get quite the response and I have taken a quick peek at some of these builds and I've just got to say you guys are absolutely nuts like some of these builds are really really impressive so let's roll the intro and jump right in so like I said there are quite a few submissions here way more than I ever expected there are over 400 tweet replies to the initial tweet that I put out just 14 hours ago so there will be some of your builds that I will miss and the selection is going to be pretty random here so I do apologize if I miss your build but without further ado let's jump in I might make this a monthly series if you guys are interested let me know down below and to give you guys an example I mean this is just one of the first ones that I clicked on here you guys you guys a mind blowing this is absolutely insane this is an M case m1 v5 custom loop and it looks like he's got a 92 Mill Road at the back and then he's using a 240 mm at the bottom but he's got a gtx 980ti 8700 k @ 5.1 gigahertz 16 gigabytes of 3600 hertz memory one terabyte of storage it looks like he's used full ek waterblock components here and I've just gotta say this is a sick looking build I think a lot of us would be very happy to have that on our desk one thing I will say you have opposite to do hardline tubing here which is very tricky in the end case m1 and maybe some of the bends could have been tidied up a little bit obviously it's quite hard to work in such a small confined space like that but if I was to give any feedback at all here just to be to tidy up those bends and get that looking just a little bit cleaner your build definitely deserves it in my opinion and it looks like he's got a second build here so he has moved from that build to something else it's a 3900 X RT X 20 ATT I build in the formed at t1 so that's the case that I'm currently using and yeah jewel a I know you build to a 120mm a IO for both the 3900 X and the 2080 TI for those that don't know this is just a 10 liter case and that is a ton of power to be cramming into such a small volume so big props there it looks like he's using the NZXT kraken g12 bracket to kind of set up that 120mm AIO to the RT X 28 TI I have done a video on that exactly specifically I will leave that linked down below overall super tidy build and let's see what else you guys have been building next we have a den a for SFX build from Dan Pearson and I've got to say this kind of graphics card and case combo I really don't think it gets any better than this so he's got an i7 8700 non K but then he's got the gtx 980ti for the win 3 version from EVGA and I mean just take a look at the fitment here this is man this is just so satisfying to look at cable management aside I mean I really don't like seeing that riser cable being squashed down there like that I think that's the riser cable I'm not really sure but I mean you've got a fan splitter here you've got kind of an RGB strip at the bottom yeah a little bit messy and I think you could clean that up I think that build really deserves a little bit of tidying up but it's definitely kind of like OCD satisfying to see when the graphics card fits exactly you know it fills the entire volume of a sandwich layout case like this otherwise at the end of the day I mean you've got a 6 set up here you put the panels on the case you can't see the cable management anyway so I totally understand that great build by Dan and yeah props on using that big beefy graphics card in that case all right next one here is from Alex this is an N case build he says this is his trusty workstation since he moved from his fractal design at node 2 or 2 he wanted something more water calling friendly while still being able to fit on carrion so he's actually taking this with him probably interstate as a carry-on portable PC core components were bought a few years ago with the case and pump res being the newest part he doesn't list what specific hardware he's using but I can give a bit of feedback because it looks like he's using a pretty beefy water-cooled kind of setup here but it's not exactly kind of optimized right first thing I would suggest here is investing in a CPU waterblock if that is possible because at the moment you've got kind of two separate loops which I'm not really a fan of I would really recommend it just hooking that CPU up to the rest of the loop that would make your build a lot cleaner and a lot tidier and it also removes one pump from your system so at the moment you've kind of got two pumps running two separate loops you've got the iceman pump Rose combo review on that one coming quite soon when it finally arrives but then you've also got the Corsair pump so that could be a little bit noisy if you're seeing close to it maybe you don't mind but I would personally love to see this running on that one reap um Prez combo at the back also not really sure what graphics card you were running here I would have recommended a backplate but it looks like the capacitors are kind of just killing there not sure what her graphics card is here also only using a single 8-pin connector so I don't think this is like an RT X card or like a 1080i or anything like that overall cramped builds like this always going to look a bit messy but great job Alex I'm I'm sure that build is handling whatever you're putting it through quite well and I gotta say there are a lot more custom loops here than expected especially in the end case some swagger cases here but I tell you what let's pick more mid-range ones give the mid-range builds a bit more love so here Rasmus so this is more of a mid-range build in the NZXT h2 10i so he's got a 6 quart rise in 3600 r-tx 2060 that a gigabyte model as well could be 450 fatality motherboard a gigabytes of ram and it looks like he's also got a crack in X 52 to cool the Rison 3600 to be honest I really don't think you can go wrong with a mid-range ITX setup like this only thing I would recommend is that I'm not sure the asrock be 450 would be my first pick it would probably be my last pick so not a big fan of that motherboard but I mean rise in 3600 probably not giving you any problems so great build Rasmus I'm sure that one is serving you quite well alright let's keep this going this is pretty interesting so this is a zs a 4 V 2 so most of you probably have never heard of this case I've seen it a few times but it's a Taobao case so it's from China from a website called Taba if any of you guys know how to actually get cases from Taobao into Australia please let me know because I've been trying to figure it out there are a few cases on there that I would love to review and they are actually quite affordable too so let me know down below if you know how to buy cases from that site but overall this is a pretty tidy setup he's got a Verizon 520 600 X a thermal right a XP 90 copper CPU cooler with in October and fa9 fan swap he's got the as rocker be 450 fate healthy motherboard that we just saw previously again not really a big fan of that motherboard I think it only has a single handle to drive and it has the weakest vrm out of all of the be 450 motherboards are from memory so one pretty cool thing here is that he's actually running a GTX 1080 Ti so 260 watt TDP card that's gonna run fairly toasty in a sandwich layout case just like it RT up to 2080 or 2080 T I would as well but to kind of combat the thermals there is actually running a fairly mild under vault he's got this running at 1775 megahertz at 900 millivolts he says at 0.9 millivolts which I mean your cards not on at that point but he means at 0.9 volts so if you guys want to learn about GPU on the vaulting it is an incredibly effective way to just drop you know 5 10 C on a GPU it works for pretty much any modern graphics card I've done a tutorial on it I'll leave a link down below but overall another really sick compact rig looks like he's used custom cables here as well just to kind of deal with cable management something else about this case is I've just learned is that it kind of slides out of the show kind of like the four zone case that would make building in it quite easy so I'm gonna try and get my hands on this case for review again if you guys know how to take hands on it let me know down below all right next up let's see what else we have here man there are a lot of n case builds we might come back to one of those what else have we got okay this one here looks pretty clean from user friendly he's got an NZXT h 299 hundred k overclocked to 5 gigahertz at one point three two volts RTX twenty eighty founders Edition forty four hundred megahertz memory at seal eighteen and looks likes got a 280mm a IO at the front as well let's take a look at this oh that that is clean man those custom cables make a difference that they this build man this makes me want to do custom cables for my own personal rig because I'm currently just rocking the default platinum SFX power supply cables that come with the Corsair PSU but this this the color here is doing things right for a fairly monochrome setup here and then you've got that nice splash of color with the cables so a great job here man huh not gonna spend too much time on that one because I mean you've got your build set up this is a sacred and then I scroll down just two builds and then we have another NZXT h200 I build but this one is an over-the-top custom loop like you guys are absolutely insane like this is nuts this build is absolutely mental I know I've just taken with the specs he's only rocking a 6700 K and an RX 580 so the specs are a bit dated but man look at that water cooling setup that is such an interesting setup like that is just absolutely sick he hasn't gone into too much detail on what specific components he's using here as you can kind of guess there are a lot of parts here and Twitter does have a character limit looks like he's using 8 to 80 ml radiator at the front a 120mm at the rear ethical water block for the GPU but I think the highlight here is the 2 EK reservoirs mounted directly to the top of the case this is definitely the highlight of the build really makes is really interesting kind of setup to look at you a single DDC pump that looks like to power the whole loop which should be no problem at all he's got that mounted on the bracket that comes with the NZXT h200 overall this is just an absolutely sick lip to look at the only thing that kind of kills me looking at this is I wish the specs were a bit more of beef you write this kind of seems a little bit overkill for an RX 580 and a 6700 K it just doesn't seem appropriate to have this big interesting custom loop and then yeah rocking in our x5e it just doesn't seem appropriate for for what that is a great job who was that that was freaky excellent work men would love to see it updated down the road and I know I keep saying it but I just I keep scrolling and I keep seeing more epic ITX builds this is not you guys are insane for what you guys are building so this is a dual 1080 t I built in the t1 okay I thought it was just one but he's working two GPUs Ward called they're hooked up to their own loop I mean just think about that sheer density of GPU power that is just absolutely insane obviously two GPUs is kind of nonsense when it comes to gaming these days but hopefully you're using this for something else like rendering this would be an absolutely insane compact use case for that what's interesting here is the use of an alpha cool one ues reservoir which is actually running a DDC pump I had no idea that you could run that in that case but that's something that I might explore thank you Imran for sharing this build you say you're also running a 3900 X on the Wraith stealth there's probably one reason why you showed just this side of the build and not the other one that man come on it shouldn't be too much harder to cook that 3900 X to a CPU board work like it deserves if you've managed to cram to 1080 T eyes on at the other side overall great build man this is insanely compact and insanely dense and then directly below immense build we have one from Amir this is a really clean then a for SFX setup so he's rocking the assist ryx be 450 I gaming motherboard rise in 3700 x8 core CPU 32 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance low profile memory he's got to say burn 2 terabyte m2 drives and RT X 2070 founders Edition and a 600 watt Corsair SFX power supply and it looks like he's using some custom cables therefore the power supply I've seen these cables a couple of times and I have no idea where you guys are getting them so if you know where to get these cables let me know down below because they're looking pretty sick and they look like they make cable management a lot easier here for those that don't know what we're looking at here is a 92 mm ko setup in the den a for SFX so that specific cooler is called the ASA tech 645 LT I've done a review and kind of built this similar setup before and I know for a fact that cable management is one of the biggest hassles kind of fitting that cooler into that case but amia makes it look super easy here there is tons of room for cable management tons of breathing room for your other components as well so let's see what he's got on imgur here he's got his own little album and we were right this is a super clean build okay so it looks like he's actually rocking a tempered glass side panel so I believe this was a limited run obviously you're gonna compromise on the thermal performance and noise performance of your rig there I would personally recommend and run the vented panels you can have a lot better thermal performance there but I mean no harm to you if you want to see the interior of your rig there is one thing I did notice and that's the orientation of the fans this fan here below the motherboard I would actually recommend flipping and kind of having that pull air from the motherboard and the interior of the case downwards and at the bottom I know it looks like there's not that much clearance at the bottom of the case for that to happen but trust me it is the better way to run that fan that way you're kind of encouraging the airflow through the sides of the case and that's gonna feed both your motherboard and your graphics card and that fans also going to kind of accelerate the to flow from your r-tx 27 is super there so that should help with thermals a little bit I would also recommend doing the same thing for the other fan if possible on the other side I know it's a bit hard to do that because then you've got the fan blades facing the cables directly and that can cause some issues otherwise I mean taking a step back that is just an unbelievably compact rig and it's great to see when people you know do their research and use the right components like the ASA tech 645 LT that cooler was basically made for that case great job by me let's move on and see what else you guys are building but next up we have a super clean and super aesthetic this is just one of those builds that you just look at and it you know it gets that OCD satisfied right so this is from Kosta he's got a Pangaea Green it goes to s 1 mark 2 he's rocking a 9700 K for the CPU and r-tx 20/80 super for the graphics card he's using an H 370 and Wi-Fi motherboard which I'm not really sure why you would choose that motherboard for the 97 ok I would much rather a nice Z 390 or Z 370 motherboard if possible that way you can tune the graphics card and overclock it no problem at all again they're just on the NZXT H 200 build that we looked at previously I really want to do custom cables now that you guys have kind of shown me showing me the way here these cables look very very sick I like how he's sticking to the kind of green theme of the case as well and honestly this this color ghost s1 was really growing on me it's kind of like a conch an army green I also like how he says that he uses this PC for mostly email and light web browsing that's got to be a little bit triggering I know that is for me especially when you've got an RT X xx a be super but costing super clean rig there man you've got to be happy with that this next one though his fairly wholesome so this one's from Andrew he says I bought my mom a retirement gift built her a mini ITX PC and a BMP CC 6k camera so that's the Blackmagic pocket Cinema Camera 6k it's the exact one that were using for filming right here she's now learning how to edit videos her PC is a beast made a Twitter account just for applied to this man you're a good man for doing that for your mom that's uh that's very very wholesome and the rig here is definitely beast as well he hasn't listed all of the specs oh he's listed most of them he's got a 12 core rise in 3900 X a RT X 27 a supermini GUI X 570 or ass motherboard and he's got a decent amount of storage and RAM there as well obviously the cable management he could use quite a bit of work it just looks like he's just plugged everything in and just kind of left it be which is totally okay because you've got a side mounted radiator and a you know side panel there one thing I've owned out there is that the it's very possible that those fans can kind of get caught in those cables so I mean a couple of zip ties that can get rid of that problem straight away otherwise just really wanted to show this one because yeah this guy's doing some good stuff here really hope your mum is you know going well with her filmmaking and video editing man super clean rig there but again I'd recommend cleaning up those cables if you get the chance but I think that's going to wrap us up for this episode again I might make this a monthly series there are so many seek builds that I'd love to take a deeper look out and kind of talk about on the channel here so we might make this a monthly series there is definitely the content for it like there is just so many sick builds here custom cables custom lives and just just really well executed component selection as well otherwise as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
