[Music] so what was previously a sensible compact six core gaming machine is now a terrifyingly powerful 16 core 32 thread hotbox with a ton more multi-threaded power but just how irresponsible is it to run a ryzen 5950x with low profile cooling like this and if you haven't seen the build video yet of this system you should definitely check that out and i will have that linked down below but basically it's just one of the most extreme compact systems that i've ever built inside the 5 liter skyreach 4 mini now this system runs a lot better than you would expect our thermals and noise levels are actually quite good at least that was the case when we had the 6 core 5600x in there today though we're going to see how irresponsible it is to run the 16 core 5950x in here and kind of what you can expect with the limited cooling that we have available now before we dive into the testing to see if this is possible it's important to understand the frequency and temperature behavior of ryzen cpus similar to gpus as the processor heats up clock speeds are dialed back and we get the most performance and highest clock speeds when the processor is running as cool as possible so as an example in previous testing i've managed to get the 16 core from last generation the 3950x to run on just a 37 mil tall cpu cooler amd ryzen cpus are able to do this because they can auto regulate the amount of power and clock speeds that they're running at depending on the cooling that they have available so here for example we are running on a 37 mil tall cpu cooler but clock speeds are 200 megahertz lower than what you'd get with sufficient calling the cooler that we're using in our test system here is a bit larger than that though it's the 47 mil tall alpine phone black ridge but it's also installed inside a case compared to the previous testing with the 3950x which was done on an open test bench now this is the strongest 47 mil tall cpu cooler that i've tested and that means that it's the most effective air cooler for cases such as the skyridge 4 mini the k39 the den a4 sfx and the form t1 in 3 slot gpu mode so let's start off by taking a look at the complete stock performance installing the cpu enabling the memory profile and running blender this is what we get that temperature and frequency relationship that i mentioned earlier that is in full effect right here to prevent the system from crashing the cpu lowers power and frequency to keep things under control with a default temperature ceiling of 90 degrees c this build has the 5950x throttling to 115 watts of socket power as opposed to the usual 140 watts or so and just 3450 megahertz as opposed to the usual 4100 4200 that you'd see with sufficient calling so the system runs it's technically stable with no crashing but clock speeds are around 15 to 20 lower to what you'd see with sufficient cooling and i think the knee-jerk reaction here to lower thermals would be to enable amd ryzen's eco mode which simply reduces the power limit and current limit values of the cpu in this case the power ceiling is reduced from 142 watts down to 87 watts and we get a significant reduction in thermals here as well now just 74 degrees however when we take a look at the clock speeds they're absolutely abysmal in comparison the 16 core average is now just 2460 megahertz you're going to see a huge reduction in all core performance with frequencies that low now though let's check out another option precision boost overdrive 2 is a recent addition from amd and something that we had to look at in depth in a previous video and honestly it's pretty great when it comes to undervaulting i'll have that video linked down below to bring anyone up to speed but the short of it is that it allows the cpu to use a more optimized voltage and frequency curve and the result is that higher frequencies are achieved at the same power and voltage and that's exactly what we see here with a negative offset of -15 thermals don't change at all power is reduced a little but then clock speeds are around 110 megahertz higher on average so here we can reclaim a bit of that clock speed loss due to the extremely poor thermals but we're still around 600 megahertz lower compared to what you'd see with sufficient cooling if we then take this under volt profile and then add both a 115 watt power limit and an 85 degree c thermal limit we can get some realistic usability and performance so here the 5950x runs at 115 watts until it hits 85 degrees c then reduces power and frequency to stay at that temperature target this would definitely be the most optimized way to run the 5950x or 5900x in a cooling limited scenario firstly the best pbo2 undervolt that your processor can handle then a power limit depending on the amount of cooling that you have in our case 115 watts is suitable then a thermal limit of around 85 to 90 degrees c depending on what you're comfortable with i did also experiment with a manual frequency and voltage lock of 3.8 gigahertz at just 0.975 volts it was stable in terms of performance but since there's no automatic power and thermal throttling once you switch things into manual the 5950x would eventually exceed 90 degrees c and keep rising so i definitely wouldn't recommend this versus what we had previously so i think yes this setup can definitely work 16 cores in the skyreach 4 mini or another slim kind of form factor case that you might have in mind it'll work you can get the system kind of stable and running with reasonable kind of clock speeds but the performance is going to be way off compared to something with sufficient cooling say an nk sm1 with a 240mm liquid cooler granted you can't exactly put an end case in a backpack like you can with this i mean this is just unbelievably tiny but i think the use cases for a system like this especially you need a monitor and a keyboard and everything for it to work i think the use cases just like the case are quite slim so i guess you can kind of think of this system as like an intel nukk9 extreme on steroids an extremely portable system designed for creators and gamers with as much cpu and gpu performance that a 5 liter enclosure can handle and to be fair this cpu and cooler setup would work a lot better in a case with some additional active cooling around the heatsink such as a dna4 or a form t1 the trade-off there of course though is the increase in volume and that the overall system won't be as portable and i already know that there will be more than a few comments saying how pointless it is to buy a ryzen 5950x a cpu with so much performance and potential only to handicap it with a small cpu cooler and to some point i totally agree that's why i have a full custom loop for the 5900x in my own system but for some people performance and portability are just as important as each other so i guess that's exactly where a system like this comes in just be aware of the performance and thermal compromises and at least with the current hardware that's out this is as fast as this pc is going to get so i think we'll leave it there for now and if you haven't watched the initial build video i will have that linked down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
