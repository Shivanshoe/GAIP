all right so here it is the extra fight mz1 also known as zeiss rail many of you are probably familiar with what this is but for those who aren't it's a collaboration between rocket jump ninja and the mouse maker extra fire and the result is pretty damn good actually uh part of that is due to my expectations of the mz1 personally a little bit low because i mean you just take a look at this really unconventional shape and you know it's still got a wire that's kind of a bit outdated in 2021 but honestly this is a really solid gaming mouse and especially if you are more focused towards aim and aim potential and you're really into mouse shapes this is something that you could potentially be really really good with one enemy remaining poison's gone so let's get all of these spec stuff out of the way first this is a 79 us mouse which kind of puts it mid-range in terms of pricing and i believe that to be absolutely fair considering what you're getting the sensor being used here is the bmw 3389 and it's positioned pretty much dead center so top end pixar sensor here with flawless tracking and with adjustable lift off distance as well but one of my favorite parts by far about this mouse are actually the main mouse buttons for one we get legitimate comfort grooves that just support your fingers really well and it gets closer to making the mouse feel like an actual part of your hand as opposed to something that you're just holding on to and secondly the physical switches that are underneath here are the klgm 8.0 and i'd say that these are up there with the nicest feeling switches that you can get in a gaming mouse today and that's especially here in the extra fight mz1 i mean these clicks are so so nice probably the best out of the box kind of mouse clicks that you can get on a gaming mouse today very light very clicky and just the feedback that that gives you in game it makes every shot and every click that you're taking just all the more satisfying for whatever reason though when it comes to click latency the extra five mz1 is a little bit slower than i expected part of that is due to the default debunk setting which can be reduced to two milliseconds and that does bring things into a bit more of a normal range so compared to the top results here which have an end to end latency of around 12 milliseconds it's basically like playing with an extra 5 milliseconds of ping in comparison that's not what i would consider to be a deal breaker by any means but i'd definitely like to see extra fight improve this in the future now as for that cable which is a pretty rare sight and a lot of these top end gaming mice coming out in 2021 it's a pretty good cable it's angled upwards out of the mouse shell so it doesn't drag on your mouse pad which is really good but at the same time if you play on a fairly low sensitivity it's just never going to feel as good as wireless you don't feel any weight or resistance of the cable per se but you don't have that same confidence with going for those big swipes for example but again as far as wide mice go this is definitely right up there with the best not as good as a custom paracord in my opinion but definitely as good as the latest ascended cable from glorious and a quick note on the coding it's okay on the mz1 not as grippy as the super light in my opinion but still overall pretty good and by no means slippery i also like that there is no software for this mouse which if it's not needed then great just one less piece of clunky software to have on your pc so it's completely plug and play which is awesome but you can also adjust the rgb lighting dpi polling rate and lift off distance with the switches on the bottom and by holding the side and main mouse buttons you'll also be able to adjust the d-bounce and on the note of rgb lighting which is something that i usually skip over i think it actually looks pretty sick here the mz-1 has this kind of semi-transparent smoky black shell and when combined with the right rgb lighting effects it kind of gives off these spacey galaxy vibes maybe that's just me i don't know but personally i think it looks really cool the mouse does have cutouts in the shell to assist with weight reduction which might be a deal breaker for some bringing the total weight of my copy of the mz1 to exactly 59 grams with the cable i'll also note that the balance of that weight distribution is also really spot on a little bit towards the front as you'd expect but overall really solid so in terms of weight it's definitely right amongst the lightest gaming mice that you can buy today and a lot of that is due to how small it is it's shorter than the cooler master mm710 and even the logitech g305 but somehow to me at least feels a lot better in the hand and that's something that i did not expect looking at the mz1 it just looks kind of weird it's a really low flat and unique shape that you'd have to wonder how you'd even hold this thing in the first place but in the right hands this could actually be a dream fit the shape itself is almost symmetrical but just with some slight contouring on the left hand side for your thumb so it's optimized for right-handed users the intended grip style of the mz-1 that is size grip style that it was designed around is a fingertip grip with a lot of contact with the mouse my grip style though is a lot more conventional it's just a claw grip but that too actually works really well here you're not going to have as much support at the back of the mouse as you'd get with something like an endgame gear xm1 but i found it to be pretty much spot on and definitely better to claw grip than the razer viper mini that's a mouse that i used as my main for quite some time and i'd place as a close second to the g pro super light for me personally except now i'd much rather use the rocket jump mouse instead of the razer in fact if the mz1 was wireless at 60 grams i would 100 switch today from the super light no question there's just something about this really small and lightweight shape that's so easy to throw around and place on the mouse pad it makes going back to the g pro super light feel kind of big and tall but at the same time being tethered to a cable you do feel like you lose a lot of that freedom that you get from a wireless mouse and there will be that adjustment period if you are currently using something that's wireless now one thing that i actually didn't like about the mz1 was the scroll wheel it sits really low within the already low mouse shell so it's a bit hard to reach and the switch itself kind of just jams up every now and then and basically has zero travel this might be a quality control issue but at the end of the day it's definitely worth noting not really a fan here but that's my own gaming experience with the mz1 this is definitely a mouse that i could main any day of the week scores in aimlab and kovacs were right up there with my own personal best and i was able to build a lot of confidence with this mouse really quickly i'm actually kind of keen to just leave it on my desk for a bit and see if i can continue to improve with it the g pro super light is still probably the best overall mouse for me personally right now and likely will be for a lot of people the shape is a lot more mainstream and can be adapted to by a lot of hand sizes and grip preferences but like i said mz1 for me will definitely be in the rotation and it is a whole lot cheaper as well so my overall thoughts on the extra fight mc1 is that it's a winner there's a lot going on here that's really really solid and awesome collaboration between extra fire and rocket jump ninja and i think if it wasn't for the collaboration you would never see a mouse like this you know created from logitech or razer or steel series the shape is just too unconventional and it's just not as streamlined or kind of cool as a g-pro wireless or a razer viper ultimate but having said that if you know what mouse shapes work for you and your grip preferences this could be absolutely sick in the right hands i mean this could easily be end game material for the right player i'll also say that if you're currently using the razer viper mini or the logitech g305 this might actually be a decent upgrade depending on your grip style and i feel like the razer archie v2 as well the shapes are different enough there that they can co-exist but similar enough that you can probably switch between them and choose what's right for you so big props to rocket jump ninja and extra five for creating something really awesome and special here and honestly a gaming mouse that would definitely not have existed otherwise it's a super unique shape but is really the perfect fit in the right hands so i will leave some links down below for those who are interested in the mz one as well as a few other gaming mics that i recommend as well as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
