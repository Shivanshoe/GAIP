so this is the john's plus i-100 pro and itx case with 360 mil radiator support and compatibility with some of the biggest air coolers on the market for those of you who are familiar with the case brand john's bow this is their new sub brand of cases and the i-100 pro is one of the first cases to be launching under that sub-brand in about two months you can think of this case as kind of like an nr200xl quite a bit bigger with larger cooler and gpu support and made with aluminium and tempered glass but do we really need that much cooling and how much better are the thermals compared to an nr200 or an n case well there are a couple of configurations that you can run this case in that i find it really really interesting and i think you guys will be drawn towards if you don't mind to the kind of bigger volume more on that in just a minute so let's take a look if it's worth picking up so first off the johns plus i-100 pro is not really that compact in fact it's one of the largest itx cases that i've reviewed coming in at 26 liters in volume it's twice the size of an encase m1 so footprint wise this is actually going to be fairly comparable to a compact mid tower something like an nzxd h510 having said that hardware compatibility is pretty respectable even better than some of those mid towers in terms of exterior design and build quality it's not bad at all i'd probably rate the i-100 pro about a 7 out of 10 in this regard we're working with thick aluminium panels with a sandblasted finish no ugly logos and the io is located at the top including usb type-c the i-100 pro is available with both tempered glass and ventilated side panels although in terms of ventilation there's not much at all so if you're considering this case i'd highly recommend just getting the tg version instead turns out it's also a little bit cheaper so this is one of those cases where tempered glass actually makes a lot of sense seeing as it doesn't really impede the intended airflow design of this case with three bottom mounted 120mm fans pulling fresh air in through the bottom and another three pulling air through the top you get this kind of air tunnel approach which is really effective but the real reason i took this case on for review was due to the flexible and roomy interior which actually has two main layout options the first one which is how the case ships is an oversized sandwich layout and then you have the traditional layout with a horizontally mounted gpu which in my opinion makes a lot more sense both configurations support up to a 360 mil liquid cooler up top with a pretty generous 68 mils of clearance with both layouts that means 360 ml aios will fit no problem at all and if you're installing a custom loop you could go as big as a 40 mil thick 360 ml pe rad from ek and on the note of custom loops in the traditional layout three 120mm fans can sit directly underneath a two slot graphics card this means that you can also fit an ultra slim 360 mil radiator down there along with some slim fans pretty much identical how i've got a slim 240ml at the bottom of my end case m1 it's almost the exact amount of clearance in terms of height so a custom loop is definitely something that i have on the menu for this case down the road but personally i think this is going to be one of the more popular kind of setups in this case especially for those group of users who don't want to deal with liquid cooling and pumps and kind of messing around with aios there really isn't much risk there but i know there are those group of people out there who just prefer the simplicity of air cooling so this is air cooling in the traditional layout with something nice and big like an nhd15 from noctua and i think this is going to be one of the main specs that gets people interested in this case because you can't really fit an nhd15 in many itx cases out there and also something really interesting here is that even with a noctua nhd15 calling the cpu you've still got 65 mils and 360 mils of clearance here for another radiator or an aio so if you wanted to air cool your cpu but then liquid cool your gpu for some reason it'd be a really odd setup but it is actually possible in the i-100 pro gpu support is also the same for both the sandwich and the traditional layout three slot cards up to 373 mils in length and 160 mils in height but a really important note there are only two pci expansion slots here with both layouts so although the thickness of a three slot card will fit here cards with actually three pci expansion slots like an rtx 3090 fe won't actually fit so i think that's one of the bigger oversights of this case another thing that i would have loved to see with this case to address calling for larger graphics cards would have been an adjustable motherboard tray very similar to the lienly 011 mini that way you'd be able to use a two and a half slot or maybe even a three slot card with full sized fans underneath as the case is right now if you are running a two and a half slot card you can only install a pair of slim fans underneath and then with three slot cards you have to rely solely on the gpu fans which won't be nearly as effective as for the sandwich layout i personally think it's quite oversized and unoptimized for this case especially when the vented panels don't offer that much ventilation at all this air cooling layout is the most attractive to me and probably what i'd recommend for most of you just the sheer amount of volume that you can move through this case with six 120mm fans and an nhd15 is really substantial in terms of cpu thermals we're about 5 degrees better compared to the air cooling that we can achieve in the nr200 although to be fair at a slightly higher noise level and case volume there's no hiding the fact that we can achieve better cpu thermals with liquid cooling in smaller cases but i understand that most of you just prefer the simplicity of air cooling and for that the i-100 pro is pretty damn effective the sheer volume of air moving through this case is also demonstrated quite well with the superb motherboard vrm thermals this isn't going to be a problem with even the warmest results in this chart with 60 or 70 degrees but as always cooler is better as for gpu thermals i tested the rtx 3080 founders edition where we get a pretty decent result thermals here are slightly better than the much more compact encase m1 and you could probably tie this with an nr200 also thermal performance does scale quite well with the speed that you're running the case fans at which brings me to my next point which is definitely to get your hands on some quiet fans if you're building in this case i'd highly recommend the noctua nfa 12x25 and if you prefer a black option the arctic p12s i would also recommend the tough fan 12 from thermaltake depending on how offensive you find the identical noctua design so like i said in the intro i would kind of consider this case as kind of like a larger nr200 with better build quality with the larger volume you of course do get more cooling and especially more potential when it comes to custom lubes however it is quite a bit more expensive with pricing a little bit closer to an end case m1 so the tempered glass model is going to be on offer for 200 us i'm told and then 30 dollars more expensive for the vented model so 230. so 200 dollars for the tg version that's definitely on the pricier end of itx cases so you'd really have to love the big cooling support that you're getting here and pairing this case with some really power hungry components personally i give this case a big thumbs up and in particular this air cooling configuration i think is really awesome super effective for those who don't want to deal with liquid cooling of any sort although i am really interested in playing around with the custom loop in this case eventually if you are interested in this case definitely keep an eye out for it in the next two months and if you are kind of building something a bit more urgent i will leave some relevant itx case reviews linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
