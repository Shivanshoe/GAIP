all right so here it is the new Intel NOC 9 extreme and as a predominantly ITX focus channel here this thing has been really really interested mostly because it's just five liters in total volume which would put it up against some of the smallest PC cases that I have ever reviewed some of the smallest cases that you can currently buy on the market today that means that in terms of portability this thing is pretty much as good as it gets so you know you can put this thing in your backpack no problem if that's something that you need to do for some reason we'll talk more about that towards the end so there are a lot of interesting design and engineering discussions that we can talk about with the NOC 9 but ultimately what holds this back is the price let's talk about that [Music] the NOC 9 extreme is a big departure from what we're used to seeing in the NOC series typically NOx are standalone basically pocket-sized pieces that aren't upgradable but here we've got a modular kind of upgradable small form-factor PC now one thing the NOC 9 Xtreme has going for it is the size and we can talk all day about how you could build a comparable priced ITX PC that has a way more performance and we definitely will but just note that there aren't that many small form-factor cases out there that will easily fit in a regular-sized backpack like the Intel nook 9 will the exterior is mostly plastic and this does help keep the nook 9 relatively lightweight and it's one of the more premium looking plastic exteriors that I've seen out there I would almost mistake this for aluminium both side panels are completely mesh which is a huge thumbs up for me and we'll take a look at the thermal performance in just a bit so at just 4.9 liters it is seriously small with some decent space optimization on the inside as well if you wanted to build an ITX system at a similar volume you'd be looking at something like the volca 3 or 5 or the sky reach for mini and those cases are a bit difficult to get your hands on but I'd be lying if I said that the Nok 9 was using full desktop hardware the main hardware spec that holds the Nook 9 back is that it's only using Intel's H series CPUs that are primarily designed for laptops so these are ninth to processes and you've got the option of either an i-5 90 300 H and i-5 9750 age or the overclockable I 999 a thk that we've got in this one so that's catch number one catch number two is that the nock nine will only be sold as a kit and that means that you'll still need to buy your graphics card your storage hand your memory and cash number three is of course the price which really puts the nail in the coffin for the nock nine in my opinion for most people that would have been interested here so for the base model with the i-5 you're looking at a thousand dollars for the i7 you're looking at 1350 and for the i-91 that we've got here remember it's just for the kit you're looking at 1650 so 1650 plus a graphics card storage and memory the fully equipped system that we've got here is around twenty four hundred dollars us to put that into perspective if you equated for the memory and storage you could build a den a for SFX with an RT X xx atti and a liquid-cooled rise in 3700 X and you'd still be a bit under if you want to equate for that RT X 2070 then you'd still be saving a little over seven hundred dollars and you have a much more powerful CPU so pricing is a big big issue here despite the knock nines overall design and size being really appealing so since this is a kit after all the first thing that you'll need to do when you get it is open this little guy up so that you can install your storage memory and graphics card and get this thing up and running so to start with there are two small screws at the back of the case that locked that top panel in and once those are removed the top panel can slide backwards to unlock this top panel is pretty neat it has two slim 80 mil fans that are positioned it has exhaust and something I thought was pretty cool here is that they're powered on black contact pins as opposed to using cables also the mesh side panels can be removed just by sliding them upwards now you've got a view of the fairly dense and busy interior of the Nok 9 to remove or install a graphics card you want to remove this horizontal bracket that braces the rear panel and the front panel just two screws here at either end now we can see that compute element and something to note here is that you don't actually need to remove this from the PCIe slot an enclosure to open it up and install your memory and storage the two screws that you'll need to remove are still accessible with the computer element fully installed but if you do want to upgrade the computer element down the road there are quite a lot of cables that you'll need to unplug as well as the Wi-Fi antenna that are plugged in at the top these are all unique cables so it's pretty much impossible to mix them up the computer element can then be removed fairly easily once you've removed that single screw holding it in at the back and unlocked the PCIe slot so this is without a doubt the most interesting component of the new NOC 9 this contains the mobile series CPU to MDOT to nvme slots to sodium memory slots and the tiny CPU cooler essentially instead of going with an ITX motherboard which would have been slightly larger and pumped the Nok 9 up to about 6 to 7 litres until decided that a smaller PCIe dockable board was the way to go here instead what's really interesting here is that Intel are listing the computer element as a completely separate SKU which means that you will be able to buy it separately and also that we might see updated computer elements down the road with you know updated CPUs built-in but you've really got to be banking on the fact that Intel are going to follow through with updating the computer element along with their roadmap and you know new CPUs and also the fact that the new CPUs will be worth upgrading to graphics card support isn't so restrictive on the other hand though and I think this was one of Intel's main motivations to make the Nook a bit larger than it has been previously they kind of wanted to build the smallest computer that they could that could support full desktop graphics so here we've got an RT X 27 T which is the most powerful graphics card that you can fit in the Nok 9 and you've got 8 inches of length to play with which is exactly 203 millimeters now underneath both the GPU and the compute elements it's a 500 watt 80 plus Platinum rated flex ATX power supply from FSP this stays super quiet under load and that's plenty of power for what you can fit inside this build the i/o is pretty stacked here most noteworthy you've got two Thunderbolt three ports and two Gigabit LAN ports at the rear as well as a convenient UHS to SD card slot over at the front now the 8 quart 99 a thk that's in the most beefed up nook 9 kit that you can currently buy is actually overclockable and for that reason I do want to do a second video with the nock 9 looking at overclocking specifically because the approach there is very different compared to overclocking a desktop CPU at least at stock though the 99 ath K has a power limit of 107 watts that lasts 28 seconds and then that drops off to 65 watts for longer sustained loads like rendering the result here is that you get a short duration or quarter burr of around 4.6 to 4.7 gigahertz and they sustained all quarter burr of around 3.1 gigahertz so if you're going to be doing longer rendering tasks performance will suffer compared to a full desktop CPUs we'll take a deeper dive into performance benchmarks in that second video where we look at overclocking but for now here's a brief look at what you can expect rendering in Cinebench puts the 99 a thk at just below the 9700 K or rise in 5 3600 and when switching to a single thread the Nok 9 does score pretty well so for sure lightly threaded workloads the Nok 9 shouldn't be too bad at all but I can't say that the i5 and i7 will give the same results overall you will be held back when it comes to longer more multi-threaded CPU workloads when compared to a desktop ITX machine and I guess the weird thing there is that you could build a 3900 X or 39 50 X system for the same price as the Nok 9 that we're testing here the question is though for gaming how much does that mobile CPU bottleneck the performance of something like an RT X 2070 compared to a desktop CPU like the 9900 K so here we have a desktop 9900 K CPU paired with an RT X 27 T compared to the Nook 9 with the 99 a thk higher framerate titles are going to depend a lot more on the CPU as we can see by the 14% performance deficit in overwatch and 16% deficit in Rainbow six if you're playing more single-player oriented titles around the 60 to 100 FPS mark the mobile CPU won't people make me too much at all again though the odd thing here is that the 9900 K Desktop system will be quite a bit cheaper to build or you'd also have a bit of spare cash to upgrade the GPU instead if you want to do that now for thermals the Nok 9 doesn't do too bad in blender the CPU settles down to around 75 degrees C remember though this is with the long duration power limit of 65 watts and 3.1 gigahertz you can see that with the short burst power limit of 107 watts at the beginning we do get thermals that peak at around 82 see pretty quickly now noise levels aren't too bad with that longer duration load seeing as the CPU isn't getting too warm but for gaming loads the Nok 9 can be quite loud now although I will be doing a second video looking at overclocking because I am personally really interested in seeing what we can get out of that mobile processor my mind is pretty much made up about the Nok nine and it just comes down to the price it's much too expensive this build here like I said is 2,400 US dollars which you can build the 2080 ti ITX system for that money if you want on the flipside if you want to go for the base model which is $1,000 for the kit once you spec that up with something like in RTX 2060 I guess you'd still land at around 1500 US dollars which is pretty pricey the other thing is I don't really know what the market size looks like for people who need a portable PC at the end of the day you still need a monitor keyboard and mouse and yes you can buy an RT x 27 t gaming laptop for a little bit less than what we have here so although the Nok 9 can easily fit in a regular-sized backpack I mean it just slides in and you've got plenty of room to spare as well I just struggled to see where that is useful and where you wouldn't just be better off with something like a gaming laptop where the you know horsepower wouldn't be too different at the end of the day you are using a laptop CPU in here and if you are someone who does need this kind of really portable gaming system I'd love to know why it down below personally I do see the Nok 9 being used by businesses and companies maybe those that are involved in design rendering or even gaming sort of like gaming cafes where you do need full desktop graphics performance for your employees or customers but also in a very space optimized and easy solution for example it's a lot easier to get 20 of these up and running compared to 20 custom ITX builds but for desktop gaming you really can build a much better ITX gaming system yourself either save a ton of cash or build a better SPECT machine and then when it comes to gaming on the go I mean you are just better off with a gaming laptop in my opinion stay tuned for part two where we will be diving quite a bit into the overclocking and seeing if we can milk a bit more performance out of this nook 9 as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
