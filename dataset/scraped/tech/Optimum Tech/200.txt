around a year ago I made a video on the best I TX cases that I had reviewed up until that point and a lot of you guys recently have been asking me for a revision to of that video because some of you have been asking whether that list is still the same whether those are still the cases that I recommend and you know we have reviewed quite a lot of ITX cases since that video some good and some pretty bad but I was watching back that video this morning and I was thinking that list of cases would look quite different if I redid this today so this is the second revision these are the best ITX cases that I've ever reviewed which kind of amounts to the last three and a half years so let's take a look [Music] now just to reiterate what we're after here when it comes to a solid small form-factor case firstly it has to be under 20 liters in total volume and the use of that volume needs to be considered as well this is probably my favorite point of discussion when it comes to ITX cases how to efficiently stack and layout that hardware from a space optimization point of view but also to consider how that hardware is called effectively build quality is also something that I'm fairly picky about I will point out if cases have used cheap materials or have design inconsistencies and probably the most vocal point of discussion of that last video was that some of the cases on the list were almost impossible to buy which is a completely valid point so if a case that I recommend here in this list is very difficult to buy or impossible like this one is here I will make sure to note that and this brings us to our first category which is the most compact ITX case and this goes to none other than the vell case volca 3 at just 4 liters in total volume what you can fit into this case is pretty mind-blowing up to an RT X 2070 or rx 5700 that makes it the smallest case in the world to accommodate a discrete graphics card and it's crazy to think what kind of gaming performance you can get from something this tiny I will know that it does use a flex ATX power supply and generally power supplies of that form factor do not have quiet fans that was my experience at least but there are some quieter more efficient models on the market although there are a bit more pricey the model that you see here seems to be discontinued and it looks like there'll be an updated revision coming in July this year there is also an extremely similar case on aliexpress called the k39 which seems to have identical hardware compatibility and possibly even a better build quality at a lower price however I did order one around two months ago and still haven't received it last year's winner was this guy right here the NFC Sky reach for Mini and as you can see it is still extremely compact or the novice compact as the volca 3 and the reason that the volca 3 beats at this year is because to put an RT X 27 or 50s 100 ITX card in the sky Ridge for mini it's just a bit more difficult it's a bit trickier with the volca 3 on the other hand all you need is basically a really good flex ATX power supply and you won't have any issues with hardware compatibility or with powering the entire system next let's take a look at the Best Performance ITX case and one case that really comes to mind here is one that absolutely dominated the GPU thermals and noise levels when I tested it and that's the Slugger sm58 II this case offers the best GPU calling setup that I've seen from any ITX case and I'm confident that it's better than the majority of high airflow mid towers out there as well you can fit three slot graphics cards up to 328 millimeters long which will allow for some of the biggest cards on the market important to note if you're planning on running a 2080 super or 2080 ti if you're using GPUs below that amount of power say 2070 super or 5700 XT and below you can confidently run those cards in pretty much all over the next few cases that we're going to look at but specifically if you want to run a 20 80 TI or 2080 Super without dialing back that voltage the SM 580 is definitely my first suggestion you can also fit a two hundred and 80 ml radiator at the top which I'd recommend for the CPU and that will handle any desktop processor that will fit into this case now obviously if you're prepared to do a custom loop in the end case or the ghost s1 or the t1 then it kind of goes without saying that the best performance case changes depending on what your configuration is but for most of you who are just going to be air cooling and allocating your budget to a big air-cooled GPU you really can't be the SM 580 based off of the GPU thermal and noise performance next up we have the best budget ITX case that i've personally ever reviewed and the decision here is pretty easy it's the silverstone SG 13 it's this microwave looking thing and yes it's plastic and steel but what you're getting here for $60 u.s. is really kind of unbeatable you're getting an 11 and a half liter case which i personally could probably use as my video editing and gaming machine if I really had to you can install two slot graphics card up to 270 Mills along which means all RTX founders edition cards will fit and there's also room for a 120 ml all-in-one liquid cooler at the front air flow and ventilation is also relatively good just make sure you get the model with the mesh front panel and I guess the only downside is that build quality which is just steel and plastic but structurally it is decent and that's a very hard thing to complain about at this price point next up we have the best-designed ITX case and this one goes to the t1 again another pretty easy choice that was made over the last year and this one is a bit heavier because it is housing my main gaming and editing machine and has been for the last 4 months simply put the build quality on this case is simply unmatched it's almost entirely cnc'd aluminium and it really doesn't get more premium than this not only that that the space optimization and the layout design of the t1 is one of the best that I've ever seen in just a 10 liter volume I've got a 240 ml custom loop calling a 9900 KS and an RT x 2080 TI and with an under vault on that GPU this build runs near silent it's probably the first build that I've done for personal use where I've finished it and not had that itch to go and change something or try something new and instead just be completely satisfied one of my favorite parts about the t1 though is the fact that it can be configured in either a 2 slot or three slot graphics card mode which also adjusts CPU cooler clearance you can also install a 120mm a IO in both of those configurations which will allow you to run a decently powerful CPU as well unfortunately though this case is pretty much near impossible to purchase and just know that in the future if that does kind of get resolved whether the shipping issues or production issues kind of get resolved just know that this is definitely worth picking up for a high-end ITX machine last year's winner for this category was the ghost s1 which most of you are probably familiar with if you've been subscribed for a while this one is at least kind of possible to buy it does pop up on Amazon every so often but it's not as optimized or well built as the t1 and I will give an honorable mention to the street comm da2 which isn't as well built or optimised as he goes to s1 or the t1 but it's kind of the third recommendation that I give you guys if you're after an ITX case that is more focused on the exterior looks and appearance next up we have the best ITX case for gamers and this year we were blessed with the NZXT h1 so if you're a gamer and you just want an ITX case that's compact and you want to get it up and running fast and easy this is definitely what I would recommend it's a 13 and a half liter case with a very small footprint one of the smallest footprints that you'll find on a PC case and the biggest point here is that it's incredibly easy to build then if you haven't seen it already I've done a how to build guide for this case and it's very easy to follow even if you're a beginner a lot of other cases that we frequent on this channel and other cases that we've taken a look at here they do require a bit of research and a bit of consideration for example what's the best layout for cooling should you do push or pull for the fans but the NZXT h1 you just install your hardware and it's over which is why I think it's the best ITX case for gamers those users who just want a quick compact ITX gaming system they want to get it up and running nice and fast and easy and they don't want to go through a tiring build process or do hours of research on the best cooling setup you can build an entire system in this case in probably under 15 minutes with very minimal knowledge and yes it's not technically a standalone case it's a kit which comes with an SFX power supply and a 140 million cooler but in my opinion that is 100% the right choice by NZXT by the way I've done a full custom loop in this case which was pretty difficult but can definitely be done I'll leave a link to that down below now if you are just looking for an ITX gaming system but you are prepared to do a bit more research on the best hardware configuration for your budget and kind of the best calling setup you can go a bit smaller which is where I would recommend B Dan a for SFX this is 7.2 liters versus thirteen and a half liters and you can kind of get very similar performance between the two this also has the benefit of being a lot more portable than the NZXT h1 if that's something that you require and seeing as gaming systems these days don't require a ton of CPU power and cooling I feel like the den a fall is the most space optimized case for gamers and is a runner-up to the NZXT h1 and lastly for the best overall ITX case that you can currently buy that means the best balance of all of the previous categories that are mentioned it is the N case m1 v6 which is probably honestly no surprise to most of you seeing as the N case m1 v5 won the same Best Overall category last year but it is amazing to see how much they have improved with the v6 just to name a few side panel ventilation has now been stretched to accommodate open-air graphics cards you get a graphics card support bracket to prevent GPU sag a better feat design tons more airflow at the bottom and the option to completely cover the front io for a super clean look at twelve and a half liters the nkm one can do pretty much anything you needed to do and I really haven't met anyone who has been disappointed with this case particularly the CPU cooling potential in this case is one of its strong points and it's definitely worth highlighting so if you need to run an overclocked 3950 X or 10900 K in a compact rendering machine PM 1 would definitely be my first recommendation and at least at the time of filming the end case is in stock and seems to be shipping pretty much every week but there are restrictions to a lot of countries at the moment as a result of kovat 19 I am currently in the process of doing a dual radiator build in this case which should be the next video which should go up in a couple days if all goes to plan but this just highlights one of the biggest strong points of the end case m1 it's kind of the most flexible ITX case that you can currently buy as well you can configure this for you know balls-to-the-wall custom loop which I'm about to kind of do or you can configure it around air cooling with tons of heatsink you can do one around storage so in terms of flexibility and the amount of potential that you can possibly get from this case I consider it pretty much unbeatable so those are the best ITX cases that i've reviewed up until this point and if you're interested in any of them I will leave links to all of the ones that are available Dumbo and also their reviews and relevant builds as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
