[Music] man it feels like forever since i've picked up a new gaming mouse for review because honestly the whole gaming mouse industry at the moment has been lacking a bit of creativity and innovation we had that big wave of a lightweight mice hype which saw plenty of new offerings hit the table but things have really grown a bit stale since then at least for me but this mouse now this is really interesting this right here is called the g wolves hsk and it's the same company that brought us great mice like the skull skull mini and the hardy but this is really unlike anything else i have ever used before and before you write it off the design might not be as dumb as you think so what is this thing why is half the mouse missing and how could you possibly even game confidently with it well this is purely a fingertip grip gaming mouse and one of the first of its kind fingertip grip is a very popular grip style for competitive gamers it's not even really a deliberate choice by some people but more so just what feels comfortable and natural with this grip you don't actually have any points of contact at the rear of the mouse at all so some would argue that that area is just dead weight and volume the benefit though of shrinking the shell down to this size is that the overall weight of the mouse is reduced to only 37 grams here now that weight reduction might not sound like a whole lot it's only 23 grams lighter than the viper mini but yes you can definitely feel that weight reduction without question it's like going from an ultra lightweight mouse to basically just air in terms of the specs and overall build quality you are actually getting a fairly decent package it's using the bmw 3389 sensor that you'll find in some of the most premium gaming mice today it uses a fairly light sleeved cable although i would prefer if it was a bit thinner and lighter and the scroll wheel is nice and rigid with defined steps however my sample did have something loose within the shell which is kind of annoying this is just a sample at the end of the day so hopefully this doesn't occur on any retail models overall though really happy with how the mouse and the buttons feel so what does this thing actually like to game with well at 37 grams it feels like you're holding absolutely nothing seriously if you're used to a gaming mouse around the 80 to 90 gram mark like most people this thing will feel like you're moving your cursor solely with your hand now i'm not super comfortable with fingertip grip to begin with i typically use a claw grip with the back of my palm resting on the back of the mouse but i did start to get the hang of this thing and it did start to feel really natural and i think the best approach to using a gaming mouse like this is to just completely forget what you're using and focus on what matters which is the game because if you start to think about half the mouse missing then that's just going to distract you and throw everything off after all this shouldn't feel too different from fingertip grouping a model a minus or an ultralight too if anything it might feel a bit bigger because the grip width is actually slightly larger than those two mice i also found that relaxing my grip did help quite a bit in making the mouse feel a bit more natural and comfortable now i wasn't able to beat my own score in aimlab's grid shot which i set with the razer viper mini but i was still scoring around the 80 000 mark which is still a good score for me personally however there are a few things after using this mouse that i think should be improved quite a bit firstly for such an ultra lightweight mouse that feels like absolutely nothing in the hand i wish that the clicks were also extremely light they are reasonably light omron switches but especially if you're playing games where you need to scope in or ads and hold both mouse 1 and 2 at the same time i found it to occasionally throw off the balance of the mouse and feel a bit front heavy i also wish that there was much more of a taper in the sides of the mouse and for a fingertip grip focused mouse it's kind of odd that this area feels like it has the least amount of consideration put into it mice like the viper mini and model o minus are really comfortable for fingertip grip for this reason and lastly the overall coating of the mouse feels a bit cheap in my opinion and i'd love to see this with a nice grippy coating from something like a azawi s2 or viper that really matters when you only have so much contact with the mouse and of course the ultimate question how much does that reduced weight actually improve your gameplay and your aim potential because with most pros picking up something like the g pro wireless which is an 80 gram mouse this is probably not the fact that's going to take you to the next level in fact most of you could probably get 99 of the way there with something like this i'm not saying that lighter mice don't improve your aim potential but the key word there is potential and most of us are nowhere near the potential where something like this would actually make a difference but if you are someone who absolutely can't get enough of lightweight gaming mice and you exclusively use a fingertip grip then this might be something to consider i believe it does have a really high skill ceiling and in the right hands could lead to some incredible god level aim but unless you think that's you i'd point you in another direction for now as alternatives definitely check out the razer viper mini and glorious model o minus i've reviewed both of these previously and i'll leave those videos linked down below as well as the top gaming mice that i currently recommend overall i do think this design of mouse has a ton of merit and potential in the ultra competitive gaming space despite it looking like a cheap toy and honestly just an absolute joke it does actually work and coming back to what i said in the intro it is extremely refreshing to use something new with a completely different approach and design so as always a huge thanks for watching consider subscribing down below if you haven't already and i will see you all in the next one
