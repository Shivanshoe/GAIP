hey what's up guys hope you're doing well and today we're taking a look at your gaming setups i know i said i was going to make this like a monthly series but that was just way too ambitious there's no way that's going to happen but i think every few months we'll sit down take a look at what you guys are currently using what's your gaming setup looking like what kind of pc builds are you guys using uh that way we get some nice fresh unique submissions there's also no criteria for this one it doesn't need to be itx or water cooled or anything crazy uh but yeah literally just your gaming setups let's take a look at what you guys are using and we're going to start off with this one here from justin tran and really really colorful bright setup and i think justin you take the gold medal for the amount of mismatched monitors in a single setup uh i don't really know why you need this many monitors uh maybe you're a video editor maybe you use it for productivity or whatnot but i think for the general gamer this is just way too overkill i think what's happened here is he's upgraded his monitor from one to the other and then he just has these monitors kind of lying around so he's like oh i'll just plug this one in over here i'll just mount this one here oh yeah this one goes up here oh old tv i'll just put that over there personally i would be really interested to see how you use these i could get you know maybe one on the side here one on the top but then having this one up here this one up here it's just like a bombardment of distraction but hey maybe you proved me wrong at the end of the day this is your setup so hey you can do whatever you like uh one thing i really love here are the keyboards so you're obviously a keyboard enthusiast why don't we just read the specs here so he's got a key cult a one of 65 main eo87 a maja a kbd75v2 and an nk65 so this guy is super super deep into the custom keyboard rabbit hole as we'll see all of his builds look super super sick and i think if we kind of added up the cost here of the custom keyboards probably costs more than his pc build which speaking of which is a 9700k an rtx 2080 he's got nzxt all in one liquid coolers for both 32 gigs of ram 650 watt power supply some storage overall the pc looks pretty clean that aio setup as well it's going to run nice cool and quiet uh this man loves his rgb as well so yeah overall really really sick looking setup here man next one here is from han he says my humble setup not the best looking but it works really well for me got into the custom pc world a year ago and have been perfecting every aspect about it since as for the specs are 10 700k rtx 2060 super 360 ml aio and that is in the cool master nr600 let's take a look at this all right so he's got a sick view here but i think this is definitely one of those setups where you would really benefit from an itx pc man i mean this pc is absolutely ginormous in the context of your desk setup i mean you've got like a really compact clean desk there's just so much breathing room and fresh air i really dig this setup i feel like this setup would really benefit from either switching to an itx pc and you know keeping that on the desk or just putting the pc on the floor because you take a look at the minimal amount of mouse pad space that he has there it is absolutely tiny i mean is really really small and look not everyone has to be a hardcore sweaty gamer with a ginormous mouse pad like me and a lot of the other gaming setups that we'll take a look at however if you are using this setup at least a little bit for gaming then i would recommend making that change and another thing i would recommend upgrading here is probably that chair i mean that thing just looks like absolute pain to sit on there's no cushioning whatsoever uh no back support in terms of cushioning either so again hey maybe that's what you enjoy maybe you find that really comfortable to sit on me personally i could probably not sit on that thing for more than an hour before i would uh you know jump over to ikea and get a replacement asap and then here's a look at his pc through the glass side panel so he's got again a 10-700 k that's strapped to a 360mm cooler and then the rtx 2060 super which he's got vertically mounted and he's got some sleeve cables in there as well which look quite nice probably don't need a 360mm cooler for the 10700k unless you're doing some overclocking or something like that unfortunately there aren't many itx cases that will fit a 360. so again probably put the pc on the floor uh you'll just have a lot more space on that desk and you'll also be able to see a bit more of that a lovely view out there as well all right but this one here from miguel reyes this guy has to be trolling i mean he's trolling us this is disgusting this is probably the grossest setup that i've ever seen the amount of trash here it's just an infestation this is just disgusting on all levels i don't even know what to say this is just disgusting miguel if this is actually your setup which i really really hope it isn't yeah i think i'm really concerned for your hygiene and well-being because this is not a healthy state to be living in i also like how whoever set up this is they just ran out of space so they just began stacking the noodles like vertically surely there is a limit to how many noodle cups you can stack vertically behind this uh what is this a monitor i can't even tell what this is uh and i think he did reach that limit because they're kind of tipping over here but i think it's pretty clear what the feedback would be here uh just burn it just burn the whole thing it's not really worth saving it's too far gone i'm kidding miguel if this is actually all set up you need to clean this dude this is just disgusting on all levels please please clean this and then on the complete flip side we have a really dope setup here from trophies he says first build during peak covid it's rocking at 10 700k and an rtx 3080 inside the meshfi s2 everything is super super clean here which i of course like quite a lot and it looks like he's using this for streaming as well so he's got a webcam here probably a logitech webcam he's got the shure sm7b i believe that is for the microphone and he's got two elgato key lights there for lighting as well so really really clean setup i'm not sure what alienware monitor that is but probably like a 240 hertz or something judging by the rest of his specs super super clean oh he does have an artisan mouse pad i've been trying really hard to get my hands on these artisan pads they are always out of stock so very very lucky man and then he's kept the black and white theme for his pc as well are really really clean he has gone for a mid tower which of course i think a lot of you guys think i'm like some itx pc supremacist and if you have an atx mid tower build you guys are dirt uh but it's not like that at all if you have the space for a mid tower build then that's fine and especially if you have an rtx 3080 you know those graphics cars they need airflow so i can totally understand why you would go for a bigger pc if you do have the room for it but yeah super super clean setup here trophies like i said this reminds me a lot of my own setup i feel like i could just sit down here and be really really comfortable like this is very very familiar to me so again big props thank you for sharing and then we have a set up here from sean so he has a ryzen 3900x and rtx 3080 with a triple 1440p ips monitor setup so damn that is a lot of pixels and his pc is super super sick he says he rebuilt it yesterday with x570 32 gigabytes of 3600 ram and some new tubing water block and coolant so this is another reason to build an atx mid tower if you just want to build something super super cool when it comes to liquid cooling can't really see if he has another radiator at the front there although it could just be a single uh either way that is a really clean looking build dude funny story about this guy as well uh we unknowingly used to train at the same gym and then we were just having a conversation about computers one day and he was like wait are you optimum tech and i was like yeah and he's like oh i know who you are so pretty cool one of those little uh random encounters uh these days sean is streaming a lot of escape from tarkov over on twitch so i'll drop his twitch channel down below if you're an eft fan uh definitely check him out in terms of a streaming setup i feel like he's optimized this quite well so he's got his little webcam over here a microphone on a boom arm right over there headphones lots and lots of mousepad space which you guys know by now just is i love that when i see that amount of mousepad space just makes me feel good you know then we have this setup here from austin which is super super clean i mean god damn dude this is mega mega clean for uh you know a nice little compact single monster setup uh looks like he's got the cool master nr200 there he's got the audient evo4 for his audio interface although probably a little bit too far out of reach i'd maybe recommend putting that a little bit closer just so you can kind of adjust things on the fly these photos as well man really really nice uh this one in particular with the keyboard and you've got the boom arm kind of just in front of the lens so it's out of focus and then you've got that depth yeah really really good uh this shot of the nr200 build with looks like a radeon card probably a 6800 xt we'll take a look at that in a second uh this one here with the g pro super light as well yeah big fan of this work dude very very nice and then in terms of what gear is using so he says shu sm7b for the microphone that's hooked up to the blue compass boom arm which is looking super super clean uh dt 1990 pro headphones evo4 interface so that's going to run really really nicely then for the monitor he's using a 1080p 240hz lg ultra gear drop old keyboard with brown switches and you also forked out the cache for the logitech and hermann miller embody chair so really really clean uh single monster setup man and as i've been kind of alluding to here i think this setup could really benefit from another monitor it doesn't have to be anything expensive even 60 hertz but you've definitely got the room for it and i feel like that would benefit this setup quite a lot then we have a nice little compact setup here from olya at ultralinks which if you guys aren't following this guy already definitely make sure you follow him down below uh big inspiration to me when it comes to you know clean minimal design and uh you know i get a lot of ideas from watching this guy's content so definitely check out his channel down below his setup here is not a very big setup he actually has two setups i believe so this is his gaming focus setup where he has his ps5 and his itx pc i think he did mention this in a video but having the table just resting on a few millimeters of that alex draw unit it really scares me he says it's okay i would probably just shift that over just a little bit just to be sure that hey if it works it works as for his setup here uh you have to forgive me i don't know what the monitor is i know it's 144 hertz i'm not sure if it's 4k or 1440p uh but mounting that to a monitor arm was a really good choice because then he's got a ton of space on the desk there then he's got his ps5 here all black i believe he might have done a video on that and then his case here is the zx1 he did do a video on this build and that is using a ryzen 5600x and an rtx 2080 super he hasn't listed too many specs which is obviously fine because he has videos outlining all of that and i'll leave those linked down below but i think for you know a focused gaming focus setup i think this works really really well you probably don't need a dual monitor setup if you're only going to be gaming in my opinion uh yeah big thanks to all your super super clean setup i can i'm totally down with the white and black kind of minimal theme that you got going on here and yeah absolutely love your content as well so keep pumping that out man and then we have another youtuber here mr rocketjump ninja himself the legendary mouse reviewer as most of you are probably aware of and i know we kind of toured a multi-monitor setup in the beginning uh this one i know uh rocker jump is putting to some seriously good use still though six monitors hooked up to a single pc i maybe think that's a little bit too many maybe one or two or three too many but if you're able to speed up your production and it suits your workflow then everything i say is irrelevant because i personally have never used this i would not know where to start with in terms of organizing my editing workflow around it maybe i would have like my timeline on this monitor i'd have like a program monitor or kind of see what i'm editing on the top one this could be used for like a file viewer and then maybe you could have like color grading or something on the right one and then i think the main advantage of splitting it up like this as opposed to just running a massive 48 inch oled or something like that is that you have a lot more flexibility in terms of splitting up the workflow or gaming for example so gaming on a 48 inch oled from this distance would be unbearable it would just be straight up impossible especially for someone like rocket jump ninja who you know would prefer to game on a smaller monitor which his main one here is the samsung odyssey it's a 240hz monitor i believe not sure on the specific model here but yeah again the way he has kind of oriented them is really really interesting and then he has this setup over here which i'm not too sure what you'd be using that for you might actually be kind of plugging the camera in so you can see what you're filming better that could actually be a really good use of it but yeah this i guess is where he does his main shooting of his mouse content and again when it comes to the amount of screens you have it's kind of like this fine balance between boosting productivity and trying to avoid adding distraction that's something that i've actually noticed just by adding a second monitor to my setup i know it sounds odd comparing it to six but sometimes i'll have twitter open or twitch on that second monitor serving absolutely no purpose to my workflow other than just to distract me so i'd be really interested to see how you set this up for video editing or for gaming for example because yeah this amount of screens is super super interesting and yeah thank you rocketjump for sharing then we have a really really interesting setup here from frank he says very small room utilized to the max specs he has a loki ghost s1 build with a ryzen 75800x and rtx 3070 founders edition 32 gigabytes of ram one terabyte pcie for ssd uh main monitor is the 27g 950 so that's 4k 160hz that's actually what i use as my main 4k editing display and the second monitor is a 1440p 60hz but let's take a look at this setup because it is mega mega compact i mean that room is tiny tiny tiny so small i mean the chair is literally pushed up against the wall there's not even enough room for the armrests on the chair they had to be removed so that they could kind of get in and out of the setup this desk as well looks custom made specifically to fit this room which is really awesome and i almost didn't even mention it because i didn't even really notice it but cable management here is done really well too so he's got a little cable channel for the uh monitor display and power uh looks like the monitor arm is probably mounted to the wall itself and then he's got a hole in the desk to route his wires for his keyboard and his mouse receiver so really clean setup here and i honestly don't think that i would be able to do a better job with the amount of space that's been provided here i don't know what this room was before but it definitely wasn't an office room when you take a closer look at it there is barely enough space in this room for two of these chairs like if you just took this chair there's barely enough room for another one so i think that kind of puts into perspective just how small this room actually is then we have another really interesting setup here from moon uh this person must be an absolute giant like literally eight foot tall to have the monitors up here uh not sure if ergonomically that's something that i would do but hey maybe you're just like a really tall human being and correct me if i'm wrong down in the comments but i think the general rule of thumb for monitor height is that you want your eyes to line up with the top bezel or just thereabouts which i guess also looking at the height of the chair probably makes sense as well but for a gaming setup maybe i would probably lower those a little bit otherwise the setup is pretty cool they've got a custom keyboard here g pro wireless for the keyboard nice big mouse pad looks like they are collecting red bull cans for whatever reason i'm not sure why that's a thing i've seen other people do it as well like they kind of hoard empty energy drink cans kind of like as a trophy i personally don't understand why because it kind of just looks like mess to me but hey your setup you can really do what you want with it i really do like these kind of little figurines here i'm not sure if they're pop figures or something else but hey really really cool there and generally the dual monster setup is pretty clean uh and looking at it from this angle it does look like a much better height from the other photo it looked way way too high uh but this one looks quite fine i'm also not really sure what this thing here is at first i thought that was the monitor arm but there's just no way that it'd be able to hold up you know a dual monitor setup like that maybe even one it would be a little bit too flimsy i think it is actually like a cable routing channel so this is like to manage all the power cables and display cables from the monitor and to be honest it is a bit of an eyesore it is like kind of bulging at the seams here and it kind of does distract from the rest of the setup as we saw in a couple of the other setups here there are these kind of just flat white cable management channels that kind of run uh down the wall i think that would be absolutely perfect for this setup i think we've got time for a couple more so this one here is from chad he says here's my setup that i use for editing and probably a bit of gaming as well looking at the specs he's got an i5 10 400 f rtx 3060 16 gigabytes of ram so 600 for the power supply and he has an all air cooled setup in the meshlicious so you definitely don't see too many air cooled focus builds in this case this is usually a case you'd see like a 280 mil aio or something like that but with the noctua l12s on the cpu which in this case is the i5 10400 f that's plenty to cool that six core cpu and i feel like the way that he set up the airflow and the fans in this case works really well too he's got two of the arctic p14s i believe they are and they're set up for exhaust to pull air out of the case so a lot of fresh air going to the gpu and the cpu as well i think this is another example where you have a really tiny desk setup i mean this desk is not big at all it's barely enough for say two of these mouse pads side by side uh but still he's got quite a lot of stuff on it so he really has made the most use out of the space that he has so the choice to mount the monitor on a monitor arm for example helps out a lot here so does the boom arm for the microphone as does the compact keyboard and the compact itx pc i really feel like that's helping the setup out a lot and finally the last setup that we'll take a look at here is from jazz they say they call it controlled clutter but actually it's a pretty clean setup uh definitely not cluttered i don't think i think this is actually pretty clean looks like there's a bit of keyboard enthusiasm and well we also have a t1 on the side there as well so let's take a look at the specs so in the white t1 we have a ryzen 3900x a 3080 founders edition and an x570i motherboard uh one and a half terabytes of storage and a corset sf-750 power supply and they haven't listed the monitors either but it looks like there's a 34-inch ultra wide from alienware for the main one and then possibly a 24-inch lg possibly an ips monitor there for the portrait mode and they do have the mounted on monitor arms which is very very convenient otherwise there would not be much space on this desk at all as it is not a very deep desk uh but yeah the monitor arms really come in clutch there otherwise yeah i wouldn't say this is cluttered at all definitely a good use of space and i do love that little uh keyboard showcase shelf there as well maybe there's room for another one there possibly you could pick that one up and drop it on there i think the only real clutter here would be the cable management which has been hidden quite well i feel like if the frame was just a little bit lower we would see an absolute monstrosity of cables below there but otherwise uh you know do your best to tidy it up if it's not bothering you then it's your setup at the end of the day so i think that pretty much wraps it up we did take a look at quite a few here and i feel like i just want to keep going because there are so many good setups here i mean this one here with the nks m1 this is super super tidy or mid bios update what if what a photo to take uh hopefully that bios update went through no problem uh but yeah if you guys want to take a look at the setups i will leave the twitter thread link down below uh potentially we'll do another one of these soon because yeah there were just so many submissions way way more than i thought so if that's something that you guys would like let me know down below as always a huge thank you for watching and thank you to everyone who submitted in the thread of course do subscribe down below if you haven't already and i will see you all in the next one
