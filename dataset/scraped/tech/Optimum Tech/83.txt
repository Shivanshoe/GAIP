all right now that is one of the most annoying sounds that you'll ever hear from a gaming pc and it's something that i get asked about quite a lot how do you fix it what causes it and should you maybe even return your gpu and of course that's gpu coil wine and strangely enough this has been popping up more and more as time goes on and i think that's partly due to the growing popularity of those mesh open mid tower cases which have a lot more sound that travels in and out of them uh gpu coil 1 is also a lot more noticeable the quieter your gaming pc is so for example if your gpu is water cooled and your radiator fans don't really need to spin off that fast coil wine will no longer be kind of clouded by the sound of those graphics card fans that you had on there before and that coil wind noise itself that zinging sound is generated from the small vibrations of the inductors on your graphics card's pcb as power passes through them and i think it's really important to note that coil wine is very normal pretty much all graphics cards have it just at varying levels there's nothing necessarily wrong with your gpu if it makes that sound of course it's very annoying if it's loud but it's not broken and in most cases this won't be accepted as a cause to rma in fact if you do end up with a graphics card with quite a bit of coil one and you do end up rma'ing it because you're not really happy with it and you get a replacement chances are you're going to get the exact same thing back because uh coi1 mostly comes down to pcb design and the inductors used and how they're installed not so much a lottery between the different samples of the same graphics card design so coil wine between different samples of the same graphics card design are going to be the same however it's definitely a case of some graphics card models and vendors having better designs than others even within the same type of graphics card say an rtx 3070 for example the pcb design and specifically the vrm or power delivery design can vary quite a bit giving you a bunch of cards that emit different levels of coil wine so really your first step to avoid encountering this issue in the first place is to just watch reviews online of the card that you're intending to buy compare it to different models and then go from there then also reading the return policy of the store that you're buying from that's important because that way you'll know what your options are if you do end up with a dud but one of the main contributors to coil wine is when it comes to the frame rate that your game is running at with higher frame rate games causing a significantly higher pitch which can be really annoying i'm sure many of us have encountered this when booting a game up and there's really no frame rate cap there or where there's a game for example that doesn't have a frame rate cap in the menu and the gpu is running at like a thousand fps but it's not just when booting and in menus where you'll see that high pitch noise either but it's also generally in really easy to run high fps games like cs go valerian and other esports titles now if you're getting 400 fps plus in valorem or a similar game and the coil one from your gpu is getting really annoying limiting your frame rate to something lower like 240 or even 300 can definitely reduce the pitch and annoyingness of gpu coil line sure you will be losing some fps but there are actually some input latency benefits to capping your fps anyway outside of using nvidia reflex and realistically the competitive benefit that you get gaming beyond 300 fps is very minimal now there is also another solution out there as well which doesn't require an in-game fps cap and that's one that i stumbled upon by accident and that's just by simply under vaulting your gpu for those that don't know what this is it's basically just taking the stock voltage that your gpu runs at let's say around one volt flat for an nvidia rtx gpu and then lowering that to around 0.86 volts this only takes a couple of minutes to do in msi afterburner and i've made a full guide on how to do this down below for multiple different gpus and it's important to note that we're not affecting the gpu performance here or the frame rate since we're keeping our gpu clock frequency pretty much the same now this seems to reduce coil 1 pretty effectively in some cases because it's reducing the amount of power that the card consumes and consequently the amount of power going through the inductors i will note that the results here seem pretty consistent when it comes to nvidia gpus but a bit inconsistent when it comes to amd cards so here are a few comparisons between different graphics cards at stock then with an under vault enabled and then with an in-game fps cap as well so really with some cards like an rtx 3080 or a 2060 like we saw there is a pretty meaningful improvement especially when combining both an fps cap and a gpu undervolt for other cards though like an rx 590 there's not really much benefit at all and unfortunately that's just how some cards are going to be like i said in the beginning gpu coil 1 is a pretty normal thing to happen but you are going to get some cards that just are really beyond help now apart from a gpu undervolt and an fps cap there are more obvious solutions out there that can make it less annoying while gaming too for example just putting your pc under your desk or further away from you in general and then also switching to a different pair of headphones if it's really bothering you that much it might be worth checking out some closed back headphones or maybe even some iems which can almost totally block out the external sound so really the best solution here is a precautionary one do the research of the card that you're looking to buy before you pull the trigger otherwise you're going to be stuck with a card that's absolutely screaming at you whenever it's at full load otherwise uh gpu coil 1 can definitely be improved by these couple of tips that we've mentioned before uh gpu under vaulting and an in-game fps cap if you're stuck with a certain card which most of us are at the moment definitely try either of those two if not both so really hope this helped you out as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
