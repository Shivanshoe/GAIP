all right so here we are we're finally taking a look at the fractal design here are ITX and for those of you who follow me on twitter or instagram you'll know that this is a case that I passed up on I wasn't initially going to review it as taking one look at the case you really have no ventilation at all so I knew straight away that this wasn't going to be exactly a positive review however since its launch I've been getting so many messages every single day Instagram DMS Twitter and of course here on YouTube asking my thoughts about the era and some people have said that they have already bought it and they want to know my thoughts on optimizing air flow for example so I figured I'd buy one for review seeing as I already said no to fractal design and I'm gonna share my thoughts and of course the testing with you today now instead of me trying to prove to you guys why I wasn't initially going to review it and why you shouldn't buy it let's take a look at this case through a fresh set of lenses and let's start with the positives so I think we can all agree that a lot of thought has been put into the exterior shell of the era ITX the front and side panels are anodized aluminium and we've got some nice soft contouring to give the case some shape it's not the usual blocky minimal cases that I personally go for but its original and I think fractal pulled this off quite well you've got quite a few different creative colour options which is nice the one I've got here is the titanium variant it's a dark silver with a slight tint of blue and it does look pretty nice in person taking a closer look at those panels though one thing to note is the lack of uniformity when it comes to the finish the side panels look a bit smoother and more matte compared to the front panel which looks like your typical sandblasted and anodized metal material mine also arrived with a few scratches on one of the sides and some edge imperfections which is definitely not something that you expect from a 160 lower case most of the exterior is aluminium but the bottom panel is plastic and unfortunately so is the rear panel that one has a bit of flex on the note of case ventilation there really isn't much at all the cutouts in the side panels are a clear example of form over action they're mostly there to look good let's be real the fact that your components will now be able to breathe a little is probably secondary in terms of size fractal did okay here the IRRI ATX is sixteen point seven liters which makes it around four liters bigger than the MKS m1 and just a touch smaller than the streak um da - but the ehre ITX has another case to worry about and that's the new n DX th one more on that in just a minute front io is fairly stacked for an ITX case we've got USB 3.1 gen2 type-c - 3.0 type-a and a 3.5 millimeter headphone and mark jack if you want to use that USB type-c just know that your motherboard will need an internal type c header that's a pretty rare sight now the top panel is interesting some color options will have a tempered glass panel here but the titanium version has a refreshing walnut panel apart from this completely blocking air flow to the top mounted radiator visually it is a nice touch the top panel is also magnetically attached allowing you to perform the easiest and most effective change to this case and that's to swap the wood panel to the included mesh panel thankfully we have at least some resemblance here of the fractal design that we know and love offering some sort of thermal design to what is otherwise a small desktop oven the side panels were also completely tallest these ones are secured via push pins so I think the form factor and the external finish of the ear r-tx is probably what has most people interested in this case I can definitely see why a lot of you would want this on your desk but now let's discuss some more important topics and let's start with the internal layout this is arguably the most important factor when it comes to a small form-factor case it's how the internal layout has been optimized to offer the best hardware compatibility while also considering the thermal requirement of that hardware the first thing that you will see when you open up the case is the side mounted storage bracket which is pretty straightforward either a single three and a half inch drive or two two and a half inch drives it can be mounted here if you need it but it's unlikely that you will because you have another internal bracket with the same compatibility towards the front of the case is where the power supply will be mounted we've got room for either an SFX power supply or an ATX unit but highly recommend just seeking to SFX if you go with ATX you're honestly just wasting space top-mounted radiated compatibility does get eaten up quite a bit and you no longer have that internal storage bracket but now let's talk about graphics card support so the spec sheet claims that you can fit cards up to 295 millimeters in length which is honestly quite a bit and that's quite encouraging but really you're gonna have a hard time fitting anything longer than 270 mils in this case the card that's currently installed in there is the RT X 27 you super founders Edition which measures just 267 millimeters long and even that took some maneuvering to fit in what's much worse though is the restriction on a graphics card height and here you've basically only got enough room for reference height cards so the 27-year Super Fe was basically just short enough to fit in here remember that you've also got a factor in the added length of the PCIe power cable plugs this rules out pretty much all aftermarket 50 750 700 xt cards which are typically quite tall and that's a huge oversight on fractal designs behalf and yes to slot cards only you might have noticed also that both intake and exhaust ventilation around the graphics card is extremely poor now let's move on to calling and for CPU coolers you've got up to 120 mils of cooler high clearance but I highly recommend just sticking to liquid cooling instead at the top of the ear are ITX you can install either a 240 ml radiator or dual 120 mil and this combined with the mesh top panel is going to be your best approach to CPU cooling a 240 ml Radiator can easily be installed onto the top radiator bracket although I think a dual 120 mil configuration would be a bit trickier to manage you've got enough clearance for a 30 ml thick radiator along with a pair of a 25 mil thick standard fans basically your common a iOS plus a bit of breathing room now for optimizing airflow pressure through the radiator I'd recommend mounting the fans like shown extracting hot air directly from the radiator and exhausting it upwards there's an 80 millimeter rear fan included it doesn't do a whole lot but in summary positioning this as intake will help CPU thermals by a couple of degrees whereas leaving it as exhaust will help GPU thermals by about one degree the choice is up to you now building in the era ITX actually isn't too bad the cable management though is a little bit tricky if you're not using any two-and-a-half inch or three and a half inch drives you can use that otherwise empty space to route some of the cable slack there's also a bit of room next to the motherboard tray on the flip side but now let's talk about the thermals and let's start with the positives so for CPU thermals the Aero ITX is actually not bad at all when using the top mesh panel and when having the fans oriented how I mentioned earlier with our 9900 K we're averaging out to seventy five point eight degree C after twenty minutes in blender and that really is not a bad result however when using that beautiful walnut panel we get around a 20 degree C increase for a one hundred and sixty dollar case that is just not acceptable at all but thankfully fractal design have included that mesh panel which does fix that overall the error ITX would be adequate for in ninety nine hundred k 3950 x and below but only when using that mesh panel so up until this point you're probably thinking that this is the case for you the ero ITX has a beautiful exterior and cpu films can support some of the most powerful mainstream desktop CPUs that we can build with today but it's when we take a look at GPU thermals that we realize how poorly designed this case actually is it does seriously make me wonder did fractal design even build a gaming system in this case and turn it on to tested were there any engineers at all who worked on this case or was it just a design team GPUs do need effort we're talking about hundreds of watts of power being dumped into a small volume you can't just close the thing off and call it ok this case truly is a disaster for any gaming system he's what you can expect in terms of noise while you're kicking back to enjoy a few games [Music] so a bit of a message - fractals design team who worked on this case if your customers are looking to buy a 150 dollar ITX case and most of them are going to be building a gaming system they're probably going to be using something like a 5,700 XT or you know 2070 super at least and you know you really should start there as the starting point you should you know aim to support those graphics cards both physically and thermally we don't really have the physical part because most 5700 xes won't fit in this case and then thermally it really is just a disaster some of the best small form-factor cases that I reviewed have taken that approach they've started with the physical dimensions and the thermal requirements of the hardware that they want to support and then they construct a nice sort of shell around that that's kind of an example of how to design an optimized case and this is definitely not that if you were considering this case I would highly recommend the NZXT h1 instead it can be had for around the same price once you factor in the value of the included AIO and power supply it's both smaller and it runs cooler and it is much easier to build in also consider the n case m1 if you don't mind something a bit more premium it can be hard for about 50 dollars more I still consider it the best overall small form-factor case that I've tested and they do seem to be fulfilling orders at least at the time of filming so that's where we're left with the fractal design era ITX and I mean I had a feeling this case wouldn't be bad but I mean for gaming systems it's really bad you should highly avoid this case I don't feel right in leaking it down below I always say you know if you're interested find it down below but I'm not gonna link it I will link some alternatives instead though as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
