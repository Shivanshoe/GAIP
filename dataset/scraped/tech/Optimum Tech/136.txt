today we have a refresh of one of my favorite looking pc cases of all time the phanteks evolve shift and i'm really excited for this one because it addresses some of the major weaknesses of the original evolve shift and shift air and the result is this the shift 2 a really competitive small footprint premium itx enclosure which i think is going to be perfect for gaming systems moving forward fantax have really listened to the community on this one there are a bunch of changes here which completely transform the evolve shift into a really solid case so is this the case for your next itx gaming system well i think the answer is probably going to be yes for most of you especially when you consider the mesh panels which offer a lot more airflow especially for the gpu but let's take a look at what you need to know and how this compares to cases like the nzxd h1 and cooler masters nr200 so on the exterior most of what we loved about the original fantax evolve shift is still here high quality anodized aluminium panels tempered glass or mesh side panels depending on which option you go with and that beautiful vertical form factor that leaves you with a nice small footprint on your desk but there are some welcome changes with the shift too the usb ports have been moved from the rear of the case to the front just under the front panel and the plugs are included here if you'd rather hide them the shift 2 is also 20 millimeters taller than the original so there's now increased room for your motherboard and gpu ports one of the biggest changes though is at the back of the case with the cutouts in the rear panel whereas previously this was entirely blocked then when we take a look at the interior there have been some pretty big changes here too for starters the entire layout of your components has been rotated 180 degrees so now you've got your gpu facing the left side of the case your motherboard on the right side and your case fans at the rear and i think this makes sense both firmly and aesthetically because now the case won't be pushing hot air towards the front panel and with the gpu on the left side so most of you having your pc on the right side of your desk you get to display your graphics card which i think is probably the most visually pleasing part of everyone's system now one of my favorite builds that i did in the original evolve shift was a dual 120mm aio build using a ryzen 5 2600 and a vega 64. however that build won't be possible in the new shift 2. this is because the sfx power supply position has been rotated instead of going along the back of the case like it did previously it now runs along the side this means that you can no longer install a fan or radiator above that bottom panel but the huge trade-off here is the much larger gpu support instead of having that power supply or bottom fan interfere with card clearance we now have a lot more room moving forward with mainstream graphics cards becoming larger and larger this is definitely a welcome change and well worth the trade-off to no longer support dual aios in my opinion so 2.9 slot cards up to millimeters long and 150 millimeters in height are supported here even a 30 series gaming x trio from msi fits in this case with a bit of breathing room you might have also noticed that the graphics card fans will now also face outwards instead of inwards by default which is also a very welcome change versus the old shift since now we have a lot more clearance before the tampered glass panel if you're using a slimmer say two slot card and we also have those mesh panels so this makes a lot of sense so in the end we're left with either two 140mm or 120mm fan slots at the rear of the case where the bottom slot can accommodate a 120mm radiator and there is also a 140mm drgb fan included in the top position then at the very bottom of the case either a 120 or 140mm fan can be installed now i really would have liked to see a gen 4 pcie riser cable used here seeing as pretty much all the future motherboards in graphics cards will be pcie 4.0 not for the extremely minor performance game that you might get in some workloads but instead for compatibility most of the time you'll be all right if you're able to make it to your motherboard's bios and set pcie gen 3 which is going to be most of the case but if you do ever need to update your bios and reset it make sure you also remove your graphics card driver before doing so building in the shift 2 is a pretty straightforward experience i'd recommend installing your power supply first and then routing the cables then installing the gpu onto the riser bracket then your motherboard and the liquid cooler the hardest part is actually at the end and that's routing all of your io cables up and behind that back panel but if you have enough cable length that should be really no problem now we definitely need to discuss aio placement in this case because the only way that you can mount a 120 ml liquid cooler in the shift 2 is with the pump significantly higher than the tubes and the radiator that means with air traveling to the highest point of the liquid cooler by default it's going to end up in the pump and potentially cause some problems if you haven't watched gamer's nexus video on this explaining why this mounting is sub-optimal i'll leave that video linked down below i agree with everything that steve and the team outlined in that video this is 100 the least optimal orientation to mount in aio but i also think that a lot more of the general audience that have seen that video may have taken it out of context and most likely not watched the full content piece for those that remember about a year ago i actually built a system in the evolve shift air for my little brother which used a 120mm aio mounted in honestly the least optimal position now that i look back at it but he's been running that system daily for over a year now and the pump is still running as quiet as it was when i first built it however that doesn't mean that you'll have the same luck different aios have different amounts of air in them which is probably the most significant variable in this whole discussion and they also have you know different pumps and different materials which can cause different rates of permeation so i'm really interested to hear whether any of you watching this are running the original evolve shift with a 120mm aio and if so what has your experience been i'm really interested to hear that down below i'll note that for this build mounting out like shown didn't result in any additional pump line or gargling noises but that's not to say that issues couldn't arise over the long term for now though let's take a look at thermal performance here we're running an rtx 2070 super founders edition with the fan speed locked at 2000 rpm and performance is right up there with the encase m1 very similar thermal and to noise levels using the tempered glass side panel is viable if you're running a two slot card that way there's more of a gap between the graphics card fans in the panel their thermals were around five degrees better than the ndxd h1 while also operating slightly quieter if however you're using power hungry two and a half slot cards i'd definitely recommend using the mesh panels but again tempered glass could be viable with a two slot card when we look at cpu thermals as we're using a 120mm aio here it's only natural that the shift 2 falls to the bottom of the stack keep in mind though and this is really important we're using an overclocked 10 900k here which has the package power hovering at around 220 watts this is what allows us to properly measure a difference against the high performance cases in this stack like the nr200 and the encase m1 so if you're using a cpu which pulls a lot less juice like a ryzen 5600x the evolve shift 2 will be absolutely fine for that there also wasn't a significant difference between running the mesh or tampered glass panels here for cpu thermals so if you are currently planning a compact gaming system i think the evolve shift 2 is probably one of your best options at the moment sure it is tipping the scales of what i'd call a small form factor case at 23 liters but if you don't need something portable and you just want a nice compact footprint case for your desk that's exactly what the shift 2 is perfect for the nzxd h1 is a fair bit more compact at 13 and a half liters and is probably the easiest case that you could possibly build in today but gpu thermals are significantly better in the evolve shift too and that's even with the glass panels then versus the nr200 both are excellent cases at a very similar price point but honestly i think the shift 2 air might be a better pick for a desktop gaming system the footprint is much smaller the build quality is also quite a bit better and i don't anticipate many of you will be exceeding the capabilities of a 120mm aio for your cpu for a gaming focused build no doubt though the nr200 is still up there as one of the best cases that i've tested and it's a great option for both a budget and a high performance system if you need that amount of cooling or prefer the design overall though i'm really happy with the changes that fantax have made to the evolve shift 2. like i said previously this was one of my favorite looking pc cases and now it has kind of the internal compatibility to kind of bring that up to speed really excited to do a bit more content with this one moving forward i'm thinking a build guide with possibly one of the new gpus and cpus so do stay tuned for that if you are interested in picking one of these up i will have links down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
