since its release over two years ago logitech's gpro wireless has gradually become adopted as by far the most popular gaming mouse for competitive first-person shooters over 20 of top-level players are choosing this mouse as their weapon of choice over a range of competitive titles where big money is on the line and today we're going to find out just how much better they can make that mouse with their new offering the g pro x super light on paper this is the best gaming mouse that you can currently buy for competitive fps but it's also 150 dollars that's almost double the price of the new glorious model or wireless so that's mainly what i want to discuss in this video is it actually worth it replaced [Music] let's start off with what hasn't changed here versus the original g pro wireless first is the shape which it's understandable why this hasn't changed since the original shape was embraced so well by so many users so it's still a medium sized mouse with minimal side taper and the hump is directly in the middle compared to the viper ultimate and the model o wireless the g pro x super light is about the same length but has less of a taper in the middle and is a bit taller that last point is an important one for claw grip users like myself who prefer to have a bit more volume at the rear of the mouse as a point of contact the viper ultimate and model o wireless lack this area of support and are better suited towards fingertip grip in my opinion the scroll wheel is also the same as the original as far as i can tell and that's a good thing because this is personally my favorite scroll wheel of any gaming mouse so far the left and right clicks are not the same on the super light they are just a little bit heavier and louder compared to the original and also compared to the viper ultimate and model o the clicks still feel incredibly sharp and fast though with extremely minimal pre-travel and post travel which is what is most important the left side buttons feel about the same as the old model maybe just a little bit softer and you also won't be able to swap these out like you could with the original the right side buttons have been completely removed though which is a very important note for left-handed users and the ridge here is also a little bit more pronounced but that's not something that i personally noticed while gaming something else that's been removed here for the sake of dropping weight is rgb lighting and that's totally fine by me instead we're just left with a light coat of silver paint for the g logo also the three led indicators on the top have now just been reduced to one and by default when turning the mouse on or waking it up it'll display your battery status first then your dpi level although the dpi cycle button from the bottom has also been removed so your only option for changing dpi is via logitech's g-hub software or by assigning one of the two left mouse buttons to do that function now personally i just leave my mouse on 800 dpi for both desktop and gaming use so this doesn't really bother me but i can definitely see how that would be a bit of an inconvenience for some users one of the biggest changes with the g pro x super light before we even get to the weight are the skates on the bottom the skates are something that i usually upgrade to aftermarket ones for any mouse that i use for an extended period of time and every time i've done that it's made a huge huge difference so the skates on the g pro x super light are easily on par with some of the best aftermarket skates that i've used absolutely huge surface area of zero additive ptfe big thumbs up here you can also swap the receiver cover to one with a ptfe pad if you prefer although this will make the mouse two grams heavier and i personally didn't notice a difference in terms of glide they also include some rubberized grip tape in the box which is another common third-party accessory for gaming mice and it's a nice addition here i definitely think this is an upgrade over the base coating having said that if you order the white model you still get black grip tape which just completely ruins the clean vibe here of this mouse so yeah not really a fan of that but now let's talk about the weight logitech are advertising this as a sub 63 gram mouse my model comes in at 61 grams out of the box and just 59 grams when removing the usb cover on the bottom this means it's about the same weight as much smaller mice like the razer viper mini while also being wireless and without using a honeycomb shell that is seriously impressive this makes it around 15 grams lighter than the viper ultimate 8 grams under the model o wireless and 20 grams less than the original g pro wireless and despite those huge weight reductions the g pro x super light still manages to feel like a very high quality balanced mouse with even weight distribution it basically feels like an mtg pro wireless and that's a good thing so at just 60 grams without being tethered to a cable you can just throw this thing around all day the weight reduction on the super light versus the original g pro wireless is black and white it really is a huge upgrade versus the 69 gram model o wireless there is a slight difference there too eight to nine grams might not sound like a lot but in the end that is a 15 difference which does sound a bit more substantial when you put it that way my own user experience with the g pro x super light is an extremely positive one and i can easily say that this is my favorite gaming mouse at the moment in a way it combines my two previous favorite mice the lightweight feel of the viper mini but then that excellent build quality and wireless experience of the g pro wireless it gives you this feeling of no restriction where you have that super lightweight but you also don't have to worry about a cable slapping around on your desk so for me at least this is the ultimate gaming mouse and i do consider it an upgrade over the two previous mice that i was kind of swapping between before the original g pro wireless and the viper mini now for the amount of time that i play first person shooters i can justify the price which is 150 us dollars now that is pretty expensive compared to a lot of other similar offerings like the viper ultimate and the model o wireless but i also think that in comparison to a high-end gaming keyboard or a pair of headphones or maybe even a microphone uh 150 isn't that bad when it buys you the best of the best having said that we just can't ignore the competition the razer viper ultimate which was recently reduced to around 100 although i'm not sure how long that price will last and the glorious model o wireless which is just 80 the reason that i personally don't use either of those mice comes down to grip preference i just don't find that there's enough volume and support at the rear of those mice but some of you might actually prefer that about those mice if you use a fingertip grip those two mice in my opinion are a bit better for that particular grip style if that's the case either of these two are an excellent choice the shape is almost identical between them so it's really going to come down to the minor details and the pricing in your region also if you're willing to pay extra for the charging dock that comes with the viper ultimate so i'm a big fan of the new g pro x supply from logitech and i do think that that price is justified if it buys you the best of the best which in my opinion this really is so really looking forward to playing a lot more with this one if you are interested i will leave the links down below but do keep in mind that stock is looking pretty dry for the moment as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
