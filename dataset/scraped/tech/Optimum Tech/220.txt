[Music] hey what's up guys hope you're doing well during this really stressful period at the moment but I've got a fun one for you today because it's something we've yet to take a look at and that's vr gaming it is something that is definitely accelerating in popularity partially due to the new half-life Alex which is VR only and it is definitely something that I'm interested in testing moving forward now some of you might be on the edge of picking up the new long-awaited half-life game along with the VR headset but maybe aren't so sure of what kind of performance you can expect on one hand vr gaming does require a significant amount of GPU power the scene does actually need to be rendered twice per frame after all but on the other hand valve lists the minimum specs here as just eight GTX 1060 or rx 580 along with an i5 or Rison 5 CPU from a couple of years ago there are a lot of things to consider especially which VR headset you are planning to use for example this one has a refresh rate of 80 Hertz but maybe if you're using something faster you will need a faster GPU along with that to keep up with that VR headset more on that in just a second you also have to consider say the vram capability of your graphics card because there are some cards that won't be able to keep up with ultra textures in this game we'll be discussing all of that and more in this video so what I want to take a look at here is what kind of gaming PC you would need to run the new half-life Alex at a smooth frame rate with decent quality settings because especially when it comes to VR gaming there is a big difference between just being able to run the game and then being able to run the game well enough to have an enjoyable and immersive experience after all framerate drops and stutters can be extremely immersive braking in VR and could also result in motion sickness or loss of balance so specifically here we're going to focus on graphics card performance and which GPUs are sort of going to be most recommended for this title but we will also talk about things like CPU core count and the memory needed to run this game but the recommendation there is pretty straightforward now I'll be testing with an oculus rift s which in my opinion is probably the best spec balanced VR headset on the market especially when you consider how simple and fast this thing is to setup instead of needing to set up multiple sensors around you on walls the rift S tracks inside out instead with cameras on the outside of the headset this is a huge plus for me and I think it will be for a lot of other people as well because I do not have a dedicated VR space and I definitely don't want to have to set up cameras every time I want a place in VR the resolution here is 2560 by 1440 when you factor in both lenses and the refresh rate is 80 Hertz overall I did find this to be enough for games like half-life Alex I am a couple hours into the game at this point and everything so far has felt super smooth let me know if you guys would like to see a detailed review of the rift s down the road when I get some more experience with it but for now just know that we'll be aiming to maintain that 80 Hertz refresh rate so 80 Hertz is what we're targeting here with the rift s but if you're using the previous rift or maybe an HTC vive you're going to be targeting 90 Hertz and if you're using the holy grail of VR headsets which is the valve index you're going to be targeting 122 144 Hertz so essentially the faster VR headset that you end up going with that does mean that you also need a more powerful GPU to render those frames and when we take a look at the GPU benchmarks in just a minute this is not your typical GPU benchmark analysis it's less about a kg pux can hit 62 FPS and then GPU I can hit 67 fps it's more about can this GPU keep up with the refresh rate of this VR headset because as soon as you start dropping below that that's when you start getting an immersion breaking experience so I do you do want to maintain that consistent refresh rate of the VI head that you're going with so let's finally jump into some half-life Alex and let's first talk about how many CPU cores you need to run this game smoothly and keep in mind that the higher refresh rate that you're going the more draw calls your CPU will need to send to your GPU and the more demand it'll be under valves minimum spec here is a non hyper threaded quad core Intel processor and while that will be doable for most portions of the game it will get choked up during dense simulations and gunfights even when running in RTX 2060 during this particular scene here the i3 is clearly bottlenecking performance stepping up to six cores and 6 threads however that does seem to be enough to relieve the bottleneck completely now we get a stable flat line at 80 frames per second with plenty of utilization to spare I'd say that this would probably be enough to support the 122 144 Hertz display on the valve index as well but then again if you have $1,000 us to drop on a VR headset you're probably running at least a 9700 K or 3700 X now on the note of system memory real quick if for whatever reason your VR gaming rig is running eight gigabytes of RAM you'll definitely want to upgrade that before you boot up the new half-life I frequently saw above ten to twelve gigabytes used at any time so sixteen gigabytes will be enough video memory is a much more interesting discussion there and I personally found that this game does benefit quite a bit visually from high resolution textures on the other hand switching between low and ultra shadows fog and lighting there really isn't a big difference visually in the majority of scenes half-life Alex actually looks great at low settings but I'd argue that the high res textures do make a big difference to create a much more immersive environment especially when you get up close even at a distance though I did find that I was able to notice the low-res textures making the game look a bit softer so to run ultra textures in the new half-life you'll want a GPU with at least 6 gigabytes of vram so cards like the 5600 XT RT X 2060 and even the GTX 1060 will be good there for ultra textures realistically though if you have a few hundred dollars to spend on a VR headset you're probably not going to be gaming on anything less than 6 gigabytes of vram but for demonstrative purposes here's what happens when you do so here's the gtx 1650 super which has 4 gigabytes of vram and we can see that when loading up those ultra textures it really is a complete mess you will also experience the same thing here if you had a rx 584 gigabyte or GTX 1063 gigabyte if that's the case then you'll definitely want to drop to about medium note that there is a bit of GPU usage to spare here though with this particular scene so this is clearly a VRAM bottleneck but what about actual GPU rendering performance how much do you need there to play the game smoothly well luckily I did find one extremely demanding scene which has an absolute ton of visual effects and this completely tanks performance on GPUs which would otherwise be able to maintain that 80 frames per second target throughout other areas of the game examples of this are the two GPUs listed at the valve minimum spec which is the gtx 1066 gigabyte and the RX 588 gigabyte these two GPUs have no issues whatsoever with ultra textures in this game but the rendering performance just isn't there when running the game at other ultra quality presets like shadows fog and lighting now to be fair these two GPUs can keep up with the 80 Hertz refresh rate of the rift s for most of the game that I've played so far but this particular scene will tank both GPUs down to around the 50 FPS mark which from personal experience is more than enough to induce eyestrain and the headache dropping those quality settings down to low was enough for both cards to maintain the 80 Hertz target on the rift s but do you note that the lighting and effects just weren't as nice here so I would agree with valve to say that these two cards are the absolute minimum to run this game smoothly at 80 frames per second although you will need to drop the majority of quality settings except for the textures if you want to enjoy this game at Ultra settings with no compromise in framerate drops I found in RTX 2060 to be pretty much perfect here even during this demanding scene with everything set to ultra were holding nice and steady at 80 fps this makes a huge difference to the overall VR experience because as soon as you start dropping even a few frames you do notice it and it is distracting now I did find that in video cards seem to play a bit better than usual compared to competing AMD cards and for those wondering half-life alex is a DirectX 11 title one example here is while the r-tx 2060 created a pretty much flawless experience with the 80 Hertz rift s the RX 5600 XT on the other hand even with the V BIOS update to boost performance still saw some pretty jarring framerate drops again this was with the V BIOS update to raise the boost clock and memory clock a significant amount getting close to rx 5700 performance so if you are playing half-life Alex with a 5600 XT or 5700 and an oculus rift s you will need to drop some of those visual quality settings to around medium so a 6 cubic GTX 1060 or an Rx 588 gigabyte will be enough to play this game at the lower quality settings except for the textures you can load that up to ultra no problem and you know you can maintain the 80 Hertz refresh rate of the oculus rift s if you want to play with everything set to ultra and still maintain the 80 Hertz refresh rate with the rift s that's personally how I want to play with this headset then you're definitely going to want an RT X 20 60 or above but if you plan on playing this game with the valve index with a refresh rate of 120 to 140 4 Hertz then I don't think it's unfair to be sort of expecting to play with an RT X 20 80 super or preferably an RT X 20 80 TI and again if you're spending 1k on a VR headset then I mean most of you probably have these in your VR gaming rigs anyway in fact one way to think about it is overall the amount of money that you spend on your VR headset expect to spend a similar amount on your GPU so hopefully this hope you guys are if you have a game at the moment for example in your planning on getting into VR or maybe it's the other way around whatever the case hopefully you have a better idea of what kind of performance you can expect now and if you are looking for a more straightforward list of which GPUs I recommend for this game and for which headsets I believe that linked down below in the description as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
