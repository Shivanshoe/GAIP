so i made a mistake and that mistake was called windows 11. now windows 11 is actually completely fine if you do a fresh reinstall which is not what i did i just clicked upgrade and i upgraded my windows 10 installation and ever since it has just been a living hell with this system out of the blue i will just get random blue screens my twitch stream has actually crashed once for no reason at all i also get this weird infinite restarting screen sometimes where it never actually restarts and probably worst of all my system just generally feels the slowest it ever has and honestly gaming performance editing performance that all just feels unchanged at this point i don't really feel as much of a difference there as much as i can measure but it's the general desktop use that just feels very clunky and very unstable and honestly just after months and months of blue screens and crashes i honestly don't even trust using this system anymore sometimes the simplest things like closing and opening apps is a massive struggle on the system and the build will just completely choke up and not do anything now the regulars here on the channel will be pretty familiar with the system that i am currently running which is my liquid cooled rtx 3090 build in the end case m1 and for the cpu i'm currently using the amd ryzen 5950x and running windows 10 on this thing it has been you know the best system that i could ever dream of you know i could throw anything at it and it would just true through all of the work no problem at all also yes we are underneath the desk right now because that's where i keep my pc uh some of you might have seen that bit of an update where i did uh go through all of this mounting underneath you can buy these brackets on amazon if you guys are interested and yeah this is probably been you know one of the best things i've done for my desk setup it does make the pc run a little bit cooler although you do now have a lot of heat aimed at your legs which is not the best thing in say summer but if you do have air conditioning it's really not that much of a problem but the best thing about this by far is that it does clear up a little bit of space for your actual desk and workspace now i know that the windows 11 upgrade method that i used here is the reason to blame and not necessarily the hardware or windows 11 itself because i've actually tested both amd and intel on fresh installs of windows 11 and i had no blue screens or weird behavior at all granted i didn't use those test pinches as daily systems so i can't say for sure but i can tell you that those fresh installs that i have done have felt way more responsive and stable and you know i probably could just do a fresh reinstall for my system and that would probably just solve all of my problems but i thought if i'm going to do a complete you know reinstall and wipe everything i have to go through that process of redownloading everything i might as well do a bit of a refresh of some of the spare hardware that i have sitting around and at least share that experience with you guys i also don't want to make this video kind of like a drama video of you know me switching back to intel or something like that this is definitely not that i have no problem with amd ryzen and the 5950x or the 5900x that i've used in this system both have performed insanely well again none of these problems even started happening before i upgraded to windows 11 that's when the blue screens and all of the weirdness started to occur i will actually say though that one of the main reasons that i'm switching from the 5950x to the 12900k is that the 5950x that is in there is the only one that i have on hand so you know if i need to do some benchmarking with the 5950x that is the only one that i have i would have actually have to pull that out of the system anyway whereas with the 12 900k i do actually have two of those on hand so you know apart from you know switching to a slightly faster cpu although it does pull a little bit more power i am actually able to make use of some spare inventory that's just sitting around here and also free up that 5950x for future testing but yeah i would be lying if i said i wasn't excited to see how the 12900k would be you know performing in this system because it is the fastest desktop chip at the moment 16 cores 24 threads with peak boost clocks at up to 5.2 gigahertz and peak power exceeding 250 watts honestly i'm not really expecting that much of a difference when it comes to real world workloads especially seeing that most of my workloads are gpu bound anyway but we will see most of all i am just excited to see what the thermal performance is like and if we run into any challenges there and kind of just share that experience with you guys because i know i have been asked quite a lot about 12 900k and itx systems and custom loops and i know a few of you are trying to maybe attempt the same thing so you know 12 900k in an itx custom loop sounds like a terrible idea on the surface but i am feeling optimistic now the motherboard that i'll be using for this refresh is the msi z690 itx unifi i've yet to actually boot this board up and play around with it but on the surface so far it looks like a pretty solid board apart from the massive heatsinks which get in the way of most cpu coolers decent amount of usb ports here including thunderbolt 4 there's three four pin fan headers and this is also the only itx ball that i've seen to feature three m.2 slots two on the front and then an extra one on the back now as great as this board is honestly any z690 itx board is a downgrade compared to what i was using previously which was the asus x570 crosshair 8 impact safe to say that this board has served me very very well and will be missed dearly now reluctantly this motherboard is ddr5 only so that's what we'll be working with here more specifically i'll be using a 32 gigabyte six thousand megahertz kit from g-skill believe it or not 32 gigabytes of ram has proven to be enough for my video production workflow only when doing you know very heavy post-processing effects have i ever actually maxed that out i'll probably upgrade to 64 gigabytes eventually but not with ddr5 pricing currently what it's at and then lastly we're using the new velocity 2 block from ek a very heavy duty block which i'm sure will get us extracting as much heat from the 12 900k as we possibly can this block also uses a new mounting method which is done completely from the back of the motherboard which should not only give us a stronger mount since it's easier to tighten but it also looks a lot cleaner on the surface all of the other parts like the rtx 3090 gpu the two 240mm radiators and the 750 watt power supply will be staying in there so let's get it all torn down get the new parts in there and we'll take a look at performance [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so here it is taking the two fastest components on the market and cramming them into an extremely compact form factor i'd love to say that this motherboard and cpu swap was a walk in the park but that would be a total lie in fact the amount of troubleshooting that i did for this build is simply unbelievable i mean i really was at my last end with this build to the point where i was like you know what i don't even want to use this pc anymore so it all started when i was not getting any display out from my gpu which of course you should we're not using a riser cable or anything complex like that so when i wasn't getting any display from the rtx 3090 that definitely made me a little bit nervous and at that point you know you try all of the basic stuff right make sure the gpu is plugged in make sure it's properly seated you can try different ports on the gpu tried different cables and different monitors but still absolutely no display so then you go to the next level i swapped out the motherboard i swapped to a different 12 900k i reseeded all of the memory swapped out to different storage drives literally tried everything that you could imagine and i still was not getting any display from the 30 90. at this point the only thing left to do was remove the 3090 from the system and test it on an open test bench which unfortunately proved that the gpu was the problem because again i had no video output from it whatsoever at this point i was 90 sure that i had accidentally spilled some coolant on the gpu and killed it completely so as a last resort i took it apart blasted it with a hair dryer despite it appearing completely dry anyway and then i left it to cool and dry overnight so the next morning the gpu gods had answered my prayers and by some miracle i still have absolutely no idea how the rtx 3090 was working completely fine so after confirming that the 3090 was in fact working i carefully i mean really carefully put the build back together filled the loop up made sure everything was all good and that's basically what we're looking at right now there is another point worth mentioning through all of that troubleshooting i did swap out the motherboard so the motherboard that's in there at the moment is the aorus ultra z690i from gigabyte this motherboard actually uses ddr4 memory so i was able to stick with the same modules that i was using before and just by enabling xmp i was able to get the rated 4 000 megahertz and timings no problem also i will say that i'm pretty happy with how this board is tuning and handling the 12900k at full load we're getting very very reasonable temperatures at full boost typically with these clock speeds i've seen other boards hitting 250 watts plus which does pump the thermals well into the 90s even with a decent cooler but the z690i ultra does seem to be controlling things very very well surely that massive velocity 2 block from ek is helping things a bit too as well as the two 240mm radiators but overall just really happy to see this level of confident performance now as for the gpu there's something really weird to note here for whatever reason running this motherboard with the pcie slot as gen 4 which it is by default results in an enormous amount of windows hardware errors now i didn't get any blue screens or crashes but i also haven't run the system that long to say that that can't happen only for about a day and a half at this point setting the pcie speed to gen 3 fixes this completely but it's just not something that you should have to do especially when this is advertised as a gen 4 product now typically there's not a huge difference in gpu performance between pcie gen 3 and gen 4 even in doom eternal which is generally a pretty heavy game on pcie bandwidth we're only looking at about a two to three percent difference in frame rate so you know not enough to get upset about at this point but also no excuses for gigabyte either because this just shouldn't be a problem in the first place now just like before i am running an undervolt on the rtx 3090 although this time around i'm doing it a little bit differently typically i recommend a gpu under vault for builds where you are a bit more thermally constrained you can basically get the same performance at lower power and thermals but this time around i've decided to try something a bit different since we do have some decent thermal headroom here i've still undervolted the gpu but this time i've aimed for a higher clock speed at the same power and temperatures so as we can see the gpu at full load sits at around 55 degrees c with the power at around 330 watts with and without the undervolt but the difference here is that we're now running about 60 megahertz higher essentially it's a free 60 megahertz overclock without any increase in thermals power or noise i could probably push it a little bit further here maybe up to plus 90 megahertz but i'd rather just play a bit on the safe side and not risk any crashing i'll also note that i did upgrade the side radiator fans from the noctua a12x25s to the phanteks t30 since we do have the room to do that and in my testing these are a higher performing fan all in all there seems to be about a three degree improvement on the 3090 temperatures at full load compared to when i had them with the noctuas now it's also worth going over how i'm controlling the fans in this build now because this motherboard does not have a two pin temperature sensor which i used in my previous build to measure the coolant temperature and control the fans so this program here is called argus monitor it boots up with your pc and runs hidden in the background and with it you can set up fan curves that just aren't possible with your motherboard's bios so here i've set up fan curves for my side radiator the bottom radiator and also the ddc pump all three of them are controlled both by cpu and gpu temperature where at any one time the hottest of the two will be the one controlling the fans so whether i'm doing more cpu heavy workloads or gpu workloads like gaming for example the fans will always be spinning up the appropriate amount the cpu fan curve is pretty straightforward a slow ramping up towards max temperatures but the gpu curve is a bit more planned around relaxing the fan curve where the gpu will typically be sitting while i'm gaming so a steep ramp at around 50 to 60 degrees c which is typically where it'll be sitting and yeah in effect this is about as practical as fan curves for liquid cooling can get without a coolant temperature sensor on hand it does take a bit more trial and error and tuning to get the fan speed to sitting where you want them but in the end you should get to something that you're pretty happy with this is pretty much how the system will remain now uh it'll be under the desk as it did before but you know in terms of parts i don't think anything's going to change here until nvidia released an rtx 3090 successor which probably won't be anytime soon so if you're interested in any of the parts i will have them linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
