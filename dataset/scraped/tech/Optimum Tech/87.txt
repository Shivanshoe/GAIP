the click latency difference between a wide and wireless gaming mouse is the same at least that's what we've been telling ourselves for the past couple of years but today we're going to see if that's actually true modern gaming mice use different sensors different buttons and most importantly different firmware and software to sample that information including different debounce times and the real answer is that yes there is actually a measurable difference in click latency between the top gaming mice out there especially between the top wireless contenders in fact when it comes to mouse latency maybe there are other factors here that are more important than just whether the mouse is wide or wireless so really excited to show you guys this testing let's take a look so what we're testing here is end to end latency that is the time that it takes for a mouse click to actually register as an input on your display this does mean that we're also including a bunch of other factors in the chain as well but since those are constant we'll be able to measure the difference between the changing variable which is the different gaming mice also since we are measuring latency on a very lightweight desktop app and using a 360hz monitor with one of the fastest pcs that you can build today the rest of the latency in that chain is very minimal as you'll see so to actually measure latency we'll be using nvidia's latest revision of the ldap which is short for latency display analysis tool this one actually has a microphone input which means that instead of relying on a wide connection between the mouse button and the ldap as you can see here we can use an audio input instead so with the microphone plugged in the ldap listens for the mouse click starts the timer and then waits for the input to be registered in the software in the form of a flash now if you think that using audio as an input here is an inaccurate and unreliable way of testing don't worry because i did too that was until i compared the results between a hardwired connection and the audio input as a trigger there i found absolutely no difference in the average end-to-end latency between using the audio as the trigger versus a direct wired mouse button signal so direct wire versus audio as the trigger we get the exact same result also given that the distance between the mouse click and the microphone is only a few millimeters we're only looking at a few micro seconds for that sound to travel that short distance when you consider that these results do make sense also some quick testing on polling rates here to see how much of this will impact the following tests this is the sampling rate of the mouse so it makes sense that higher polling rates result in lower latency most gaming mice top out at a thousand hertz or one sample every millisecond but others like the final mouse ultra light 2 are limited to 500hz so testing with the g305 here i found about a 1.6 millisecond difference between the 500 and 1000 hertz polling rate it is a measurable difference although not a deal breaker at around an eight percent increase in end to end latency so just keep that in mind out there if you're choosing between mice that are locked at 500 hertz but here's the graph that we all want to see what is the true click latency of the top gaming mice out there including both wide and wireless i think the first thing that i want to point out here is the fact that there is in fact a measurable difference here it's not just as simple as they're all the same if we take a look at the bottom of the stack at 28.7 milliseconds of latency versus the top of the stack at 14.9 that's almost a 14 millisecond difference so a picture that is playing with an additional 14 milliseconds of network lag for example the concerning part here is that that's 14 milliseconds at the start of the chain which will affect how mouse clicks are registered in game not just how they're displayed that's very different for example to comparing 14 milliseconds of latency on monitors where it's just affecting the display not the actual registered input in game like this so to put 14 milliseconds into another perspective if you play on a 240hz gaming monitor your gunshots will be delayed by a little over three frames but let's start picking apart the stack here highlighting the wireless gaming mice in wide and leaving the wired models in blue there really isn't a correlation between what's better to go with for lower latency both have good and average performers also it turns out that razer's optical switches and their claims about industry-leading response times aren't a load of marketing fluff after all they actually managed to top the chart here with both the razer viper mini and viper ultimate on the same note this is exactly why a default out of the box glorious model o wireless performs towards the bottom of the stack so this is due to the model o wireless having an exceptionally long debounce time out of the box of 10 milliseconds d-bounce is a feature that forces a delayed signal on the mouse to avoid double-clicking something that razer has managed to get past due to their optical switch design you can improve the latency result on the model o wireless though by reducing the debounce setting in their software and here we can see that that does have a pretty significant impact on reducing latency even setting it to zero milliseconds i didn't experience any double clicking in my testing so i would recommend trying towards those lower end values so now subbing in that new result for glorious we're about one millisecond behind the logitech g pro x super light that sits in third in fact what's really unexpected here is that we actually have wireless mice beating wide when it comes to input latency so this leads to another question what happens when you plug in a wireless mouse well as you'd expect the click latency does improve ever so slightly but it's a pretty small difference the wireless connection on the g pro x super light is just 0.3 milliseconds slower compared to having it plugged in and the model o wireless was just 0.6 milliseconds slower so i think we'd all agree having that freedom of wireless far outweighs the benefits of having a half millisecond reduction in click latency i'll also mention that i am a little bit disappointed in pwnage despite giving this mouse an excellent review this result shows that the software and firmware team can do a lot better specifically the de-bounce adjustment slider in their software which i found to do absolutely nothing i tested both ends of the slider and the default middle and i got the exact same result every single time i still rate the mouse pretty highly i think the shape and customization is quite good but the software and tuning really is lacking here which is disappointing to find so some really interesting results here and if you're someone who was hesitant to jump to a wireless gaming mouse for fear of increased click latency and i know there are a lot of you out there this just shows that that's not something that you have to worry about anymore in fact some of the fastest gaming mics in this list were actually wireless but also with a lot of wireless gaming mics coming out from smaller brands like pwnage i'd be interested to see what the latency results look like there too as a disclaimer i still think that mouse shape size weight and feel are the most important elements to finding what the best gaming mouse is for you but i'm really really excited to introduce this new element of testing to upcoming gaming mouse reviews so definitely stay tuned for that if you haven't already do hit that subscribe button down below as
