the dna4 sfx was one of the original small form factor cases for gaming pcs and it was really the case that kickstarted this trend of sub 10 liter sandwich layouts with two separate compartments for your hardware and today dan and liam lee are announcing a new case it's called the dna 4 h2o as the name suggests you can kind of think of this case as like a dna 4 but with much larger liquid cooling support and it also supports slightly larger graphics cards as well turns out this case is the smallest case that i've reviewed that supports a 240mm liquid cooler with a pair of full-sized fans not to mention pricing here is quite a bit better than you'd expect a lot better than the smaller original dan a4 but what has changed in the gaming pc industry since the first revision of the dan a4 there are a lot more space optimized cases to choose from graphics cards are now much larger and cooling demands have increased as well so let's take a look at what you need to know about the new dan a4 h2o what kind of thermal performance you can expect what kind of system i recommend building inside this and how it compares to your other choices out there [Music] so liam lee actually sent us over as part of their digital expo that they're running today link will be down in the description if you want to check that out but this is a case that they're aiming to launch in quarter three of this year so let's see if it's really worth waiting for starting with the exterior it's exactly what you'd expect from leon lee in fact it feels a touch more premium than the original dan a4 and the encase m1 which leanly also produce the case is entirely aluminium but the surface finish this time is a lot smoother which i prefer it's visually very similar to the finish on the formed t1 in fact if you're familiar with the form t1 these two cases share quite a lot in common depending on which layout of the t1 you're planning to use but more on that towards the end at around 10 and a half liters it's about 3 liters larger than the original den a4 and about 2 liters smaller than an encase m1 at this point you've got some really hard choices to make between these cases and the realistically small volumes that separate them now as for that riser cable lee and leave told me that they'll be shipping the dna 4 h2o for 120 us with a gen 3 riser but there will also be a gen 4 riser option for around 30 to 40 dollars more for those of you who aren't aware pcie gen 3 rises are increasingly becoming a big problem as both motherboards and gpus move towards pcie gen 4. my friends over at hardware canucks actually did a great video on this where they show how frustrating and unpredictable pcie gen 3.0 rises can be when using a gen 4 gpu and motherboard i'll link that video down below but for the new dan a4 h2o i'd absolutely recommend paying the extra cash for the gen 4 riser even with it it is cheaper than the regular dan a4 and within about 10 dollars of the subbed mesh licious which also offers gen 3 or gen 4. now for gpus cards up to 305 millimeters in length and 150 mils in height including the power connectors will fit here but card thickness is a lot more complicated i measured 50 mils of clearance which means exactly two and a half slot cards will be touching the side panel but for cards that are between two and two and a half slots they'll be fine so take this sapphire pulse rx 5600 xt for example the shroud overhangs the i o bracket by a few millimeters but there's still some decent clearance before the side panel in the dan a4 h2o so long story short 50 mils is the absolute limit ideally don't be installing cards thicker than around 47 mils and an important note for flow-through cooler designs you'll typically want to avoid them for sandwich layout cases which can't accommodate ample breathing room between the flow-through fan and the power supply this unfortunately is one of those cases we'll take a look at the testing for that in just a moment now in terms of the build process it went a lot better than i was expecting the first thing that you want to do is install your 240mm radiator and fans that involves removing the power supply bracket and the radiator bracket on that side this is where i encountered the strict radiator compatibility for this case not all 240mm radiators are going to fit the nzxd kraken x53 for example is 123 mils in width so i couldn't get it fully installed but then the phanteks 240 mph was no issue at all since it's exactly 120 mils in width so with the aio positioned this way the fans will be drawing air in through the side panels and exhausting it out the top lining up the fan screws is a bit tricky because you don't have much visibility or wiggle room here but once you get a couple of them installed the rest line up nice and easy i then installed the motherboard then the sfx power supply which took a couple of steps but overall pretty straightforward and then finally the graphics card also the bottom panel is removable to give you full access to cable routing which i found very helpful i will also note that this is completely blocked there's no ventilation on that bottom panel but the case does sit very low anyway in the end you can get a really clean and tidy looking build in the den a4 h2o but how does it actually perform well in terms of cpu cooling performance is really good at 1100 rpm we're getting thermal and noise performance about even with the encase m1 but performance scales a bit better once we increase the fan speed that's likely due to a more efficient airflow path we can also see the direct difference between slim fans versus full thickness fans between the form t1 and the dan a4 h2o there's about 6 degrees between them although the den case is a touch louder vrm thermals are also in check seeing as there is a fan directly above the motherboard's vrm and again we do see some good scaling here with the increased fan speed and airflow as for gpu thermals they're also quite good for a sandwich layout case one degree better than the form t1 however this is with a two slot rtx 2070 super founders edition which isn't truly fair to some of the other cases in this chart which can accommodate larger graphics cards with more cooling so just keep that in mind for now this is the best that we can do for comparing a single gpu among a range of cases but context matters for cases that can accommodate larger graphics cards you will get better results and as suspected the flow-through cooler design of the rtx 3080 founders edition is not a good pairing with this case at all there's very limited clearance between that flow-through fan and the power supply and unfortunately the radiator fans aren't enough to overcome all of that trapped heat so overall the dna 4 h2o is looking like a really solid case especially at the 160 dollars also price tag with a gen 4 pcie riser cable and i've made a lot of comparisons in this review against the t1 and the encase m1 because at around 10 and a half liters that's kind of where this case lines up and is competing against but one area where those cases are significantly better is when it comes to flexibility whether you want to go for full air cooling or with an aio setup or maybe even a full custom loop you can do an almost infinite number of system configurations in those cases not to mention they do have triple slot graphics card support so i really do like the dan a4 h2o but it feels like a very rigid case where you're kind of locked into doing this single approach what it really should be compared to here is the subbed mesh litters because although the sizes are a bit different about 10 liters versus roughly 14 liters the systems that you're going to be building in either one will be very similar as is the price point personally i do think the meshlicious is still the case to beat in 2021 but then a lot of it does come down to personal preference the dna 4 h2o is a lot more minimal and elegant looking build quality is also better and maybe you've got your hands on a slimmer graphics card and don't need that thicker graphics card support at the end of the day the choice is yours but i'm really interested to hear what you think about this case down below in the comments as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
