so fractal designs define seven landed on the review table this week and I just couldn't help but think how many of us still need a PC case this large I mean don't get me wrong there is still a market and need for a large a ATX system with multiple radiator support but I really feel that as time goes on the number of users who can practically make use of all of the volume and radiator mounting and harddrive mounting space in something like the defined seven is slowly decreasing we've talked about this briefly in other videos SLI and crossfire scaling in games are pretty much pointless leaving gameís with a single GPU and the mainstream socket CP used today scale all the way up to 16 cores and 32 threads thanks to AMD so let's talk about this a bit more will of course take a look at what's new with the define seven in compared to the previous r6 and we'll discuss what sized PC case it might be best for you [Music] now a lot of you are probably expecting me to say that cases this big are entirely pointless and that you should just buy an N case m1 and call it a day but there are a few scenarios we're building compact is impractical and actually holding your system back granted those scenarios are becoming less common and that's kind of the topic of this video and before we go any further I just want to address the premise that your system needs to be as compact as possible that is your case shouldn't have any extra spare volume inside it and I just want to make it clear that that is not correct there is nothing wrong at all with building a standard ATX gaming system in the define 7 it's just not a very good use of space but for those who do have a big desk and a big room for your gaming system and you know you really don't care how big your PC is by all means the extra space and expandability room and something like the defined 7 does make sense but for most of us who are building a gaming or editing system to put on a desk or under our desk it does make sense to generally build something compact and you know just generally a good use of space so let's take a quick look at fractals new define 7 and I do mean a quick look because there really isn't that much to go over compared to the previous define R 6 most notably fractal design seems to be undergoing a bit of an identity crisis at the moment and it might just be me but I personally think the new defined series cases look a little bit worse aesthetically than the previous one that let me know your thoughts down below along with their rebranding the cutouts in the power supply shroud are no longer consistent and angular but now seem a bit more random and messy and this irregular pattern continues pretty much anywhere throughout the case personally I think this looks a bit dated and is a step backwards the case has been elevated a bit more now allowing a bit more breathing room for bottom mounted radiators and power supplies and they've tried to be a bit more creative with the shape of the feet here again I did prefer the old ones one positive change is the completely taller side panel approach now which uses pushpins entirely for being secured and both the left and right side can be opened via a little at the rear but something that the define r6 was well known for was the ability to switch between either a storage focused layout or one that was optimized for radiator compatibility and the defined seven optimizes this a little bit further you still get the exact same radiator compatibility in the open layer up to four hundred and twenty miles up top three sixty mm at the front and two 80 ml at the bottom but the compatibility is now improved when using the storage layout now a 420 ml top-mounted run is supported in both layouts whereas 360 was the limit previously and believe it or not the total number of drives that you can install in the defined case has been increased up to seven three and a half inch and two two and a half inch drives but that can be expanded up to a massive 14 three and a half inch and four two and a half inch drives front IO has also been nicely updated with USB type-c the integrated fan hub gets a tasteful redesign and you still get the feature-rich defined case as always with removable dust filters all around and top panel ventilation is completely up to you overall the new defined seven is an excellent large mid tower case but how many of us can really utilize all of the volume inside this case I really do feel like it is a minority and the first point I want to bring up is storage so obviously this is a very clear focus if you are building in a defined series case you have a ton of storage space but my point here is that even a more moderate mid tower case like the NZXT H 5 10 or fractal design mesh fic can fit multiple three and a half inch and a two and a half inch drives and with the current density and capacity of storage I can't help but feel that that's going to cover at least 95 percent of users for those who do need more for whatever reason it's probably more sensible and practical to have your expandable storage on a nas instead but of course there are workflows out there that do demand for a ton of local storage and for those who might be interested in building something more moderate like 1 to 4 terabytes of storage yes that is considered moderate these days your best bet there is likely to stick with MDOT 2 and vme drives they're becoming increasingly more affordable we fast and of course very space efficient most decent ITX motherboard these days do support 2 m dot 2 slots on board this is likely a big reason most users are steering towards a mini ITX build but another reason you might want to build in the define 7 is the sheer amount of radiator space I mean we have up to a 420 ml up top up to a 360 at the front and up to a 280 mm at the bottom and I guess the question I want to ask here is how much cooling does your build actually require and what I mean here is what is the practical difference between your liquid cooled GPU running at 45 or 50 degrees C compared to say 60 or 65 degrees C because that really is the minimal thermal difference that you would get by moving from say a more conservative liquid cooled mid tower case like the NZXT h 510 to something a lot larger like the defined seven plain and simple there is diminishing returns in cooling the more radiators that you have a single 280 mill or 360 ml loop in a well-ventilated case will get you 90 percent of the way there even the corsair one which we reviewed a while ago has separate 240 ml all-in-one coolest for the CPU and GPU and that proved to be more than enough to keep a ninety nine hundred k and 20 80 TI system running cool and very quiet my point being that system was just 12 liters in volume compared to the 62 litre defined seven we've also taken a look at how you can build your own custom lip in similar sized cases yourself but of course that is a lot more difficult to do one valid reason that you'd probably want to liquid cool in something like the defined seven instead though is if you're using multiple GPUs or running a loop with a heavily overclocked thread ripper or xeon w processor that's where a multi ran solution is recommended but of course the number of you running that sort of configuration is very very slim even with thread ripper workstation builds running stock with the 32 core or 64 core we've seen how we can call those chips with a regular off-the-shelf 280 ml closed-loop cooler but now let's talk about e ATX motherboards because of course that is a big reason that some of you might choose a case like the defined seven instead but again there are mid-tower cases out there a lot more compact than this one that do support e ATX motherboards of course this is one example where Mini ITX is not an option but regular compact mid towers are still a great choice but on this train of thought another reason why you might not want to go with a mini ITX build is due to memory capacity although this is improving some enthusiasts IT exports do support up to 64 gigabytes of RAM across two dims if your workflow requires a lot more like 128 gigabytes or so then the mid tower builder that can support ATX and EAD exports is the way to go so in closing I think we can all see that the number of us who can fully leverage large volume cases like this is gradually decreasing three and a half inch drives are becoming a thing of the past memory density is increasing and the amount of performance that you can slot into an ITX motherboard is greater than ever for gaming focused builds I really do believe that ITX is the sweet spot but for those who need more storage more memory potential expandability down the road and maybe even a build around thread ripper then a compact mid tower isn't a bad use of space at all for those using multiple liquid-cooled GPUs multiple radiators and an absolute plethora of three and a half inch drives there's the fractal design to find seven and just to be clear I can definitely recommend the define seven as a workstation enclosure if that's what you're into but realistically most of our systems in this case would be looking of lonely and lost I would love to know your thoughts on this topic down below and if you're interested in picking up a defined seven for your new overkill workstation build I will have it linked down below as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
