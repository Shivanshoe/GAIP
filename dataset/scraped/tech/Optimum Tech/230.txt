[Music] so frequently we take a look at very high-end very compact gaming and workstation build but systems this compact don't need to be expensive the one that we're building today comes in at around $900 u.s. uses eight gtx 1660 super uses a liquid called six core 12 third CPU and all in just an 11 and a half liter case as someone who likes small form-factor and minimal pcs if i had about nine hundred dollars to spend on a gaming pc and one that i could also use for editing this would no doubt be the system that I would build alright so no messing around here this is an exceptional little gaming system that you could build today if you wanted it absolutely tears through 1080p gaming it's super quiet can double as a video editing or mini production system as well thanks to the six core CPU and best of all it's nice and compact at around nine hundred US dollars this build is targeting the sweet spot for high refresh rate 1080p gaming performance anything more than this and you're going to start seeing diminishing returns in regards to frame rate so let's start off with the case seeing as this is the piece of hardware bringing this entire build together and here we're going with Silverstone's SG 13 although this case is almost five years old now you'd be hard-pressed to find anything today this compact and this affordable at just 59 US dollars and 11 and a half liters the SG 13 gets a strong recommendation from me personally this case makes you feel honest that mainstream ITX cases have kind of gone backwards focusing on ATX hardware compatibility and tempered glass but really it is hard to beat a well thought-out simple and well ventilated mini enclosure the majority of the construction is steel with a bit of plastic for the front panel and the model that i've got here has mesh ventilation for the front graphics cards up to 270 millimeters long are supported to swap cards only although it is a little bit forgiving and the height restriction is 130 millimeters the cpu of choice here is the horizon 520 600 and although this is a preview processor the price cuts definitely make this a solid choice for just 120 dollars you're getting some very decent performance both for gaming and production workloads and the six cores and twelve threads will accommodate a stable gaming experience it is overclockable although don't expect anything crazy just a bit of a bonus if you're into that manual tuning I'm also aware of the risin 5 1600 AF but I just couldn't find those available online anywhere now the motherboard is something that I overspent on a little for this build we're going with the associate B 450 I Strix however my train of thought here was that the aim for socket does now support up to 16 cores and choosing a premium board now that can potentially support that upgrade path down the line might be a smart move for storage we're going with a single 500 gigabyte m2 nvme SSD and the one I'm using here is a WD black drive this one is a little bit pricey so honestly I would choose something a little bit more affordable I'll link one down below and thankfully memory prices have dropped a decent amount we're able to slot in 16 gigabytes of 32 hundred megahertz memory for just $70 us now for the most important component of this build the GPU and here we're going with the gtx 1660 super looking back at my 1080p gaming benchmarks compared to other GPUs in the same price range the 1660 super really is a standout when it comes to overall value at 229 dollars it's just $10 more than the regular 1660 but it's not far off the 279 dollar 1660 ti when it comes to performance I would consider this the sweet spot for 1080p gaming at the moment you're not going to have any problem with high frame rates in eSports titles and higher settings will be no problem for those single player triple-a games the specific card that I've got here is the asou stuff which can be found at the 229 dollar MSRP it's nice and compact that will fit our case no problem I'll also note that if you are interested in doing a bit of streaming the 1660 super does have the new invent encoder onboard and my experience streaming with this has been really really positive we will be using a 120 ml liquid cooler in this build in this case it's Corsair age 55 this gives us a bit of headroom for overclocking the Rison v 2600 as well as just better thermal and noise performance overall another approach would be to take that $60 or so spent on the liquid cooler and put that towards upgrading the CPU to the Rison v 3600 you will get better performance overall but thermals and noise levels will be noticeably worse I will link both of them down in the description but the choice is up to you and lastly for the power supply we're going with the Corsair SF 450 it's rated for up to 450 watts has an 80 plus of gold efficiency and it's certainly plenty for this little build now that we've got a rundown of the parts let's get this thing up and running [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so our SG 13 gaming build is complete and thankfully everything went to plan there aren't any compatibility issues to speak of here so every discussed part will fit with no issues probably the most difficult part was installing the 120 ml nie at the front it's just a bit awkward with the front a ok Buhl's directly below it I will also mention that I don't have the original corsair fan that came with this AIO so I've used a black knocked over instead now taking a look at the interior it's really refreshing to see hardware that stacks together so nicely and look so clean at this price range even managing the stock power cables was fairly simple seeing as they are bunched up together fairly closely and they don't need to make any awkward turns I will mention that you'll need to make sure that you have an 80 X 2 s FX power supply bracket for this build the SG 13 doesn't chip with one from memory and either does the SF 450 so I'll link one down below just in case overall really couldn't be happier with the results here at this price range and taking a look at thermals while gaming they're all around quite good cpu thermals at stock show that we do have quite a bit of headroom for overclocking if that's something that you want to spend some trial and error dialing in with the horizon 5 2600 sitting at around 60 degrees C with a room ambient of 23 C the GPU on the other hand was a bit warm up but still within a safe range in the low 70s this GPU has a thermal limit of 83 degrees C at which point it'll start throttling the clock speed and performance and we do have quite a bit of headroom before we hit that the memory kit that I'm using here is a low latency kit of 32 hundred megahertz memory it's Co 14 enabling XMP and the BIOS was unsuccessful but by loosening the timings 2 CL 16 it was rock-solid I'd recommend seal 16 in the first place though and the one I linked below is supposedly validated for this board so you shouldn't have any issues there and so I had a bit of time gaming on this system playing through a few rounds of Apex legends and the experience here was really solid although I do play with mostly low settings for as much framerate as possible there's definitely plenty of headroom in the tank here if you prefer more visual fidelity and higher settings so gaming on this bill was excellent and noise levels weren't too bad either so overall I'm pretty pumped about this system I'm really happy with how it all came together and it's a big break from the usual high-end ultra high-end systems that we're used to building on this channel and that I'm really so familiar with but I think that's why I like this system so much it's that despite using a more budget or mainstream oriented parts list for this build we are still able to achieve a really compact and relatively powerful build overall so again if you guys are interested in building something similar it is highly recommended you can find the links down below to all of the parts used as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
