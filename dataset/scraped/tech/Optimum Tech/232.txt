[Music] it seems like gaming mice just keep getting lighter and lighter a couple of days ago I received a sample of an upcoming 45 Grand Mouse and I couldn't help but think how white is too light at what point are we just forgetting about the real features that make gaming mice great in the first place like a comfortable shape and light buttons I'm not disagreeing that wider mice may improve your aim but in this video I just want to ask to what extent is that true and also share my own experience I've had the chance to swap back and forth between a ton of gaming mice everything from the Logitech of brick 502 to many of the ultralight sub 50 gram mice that attract a lot of hype today so that's what we're diving into in this video as well as this new 45 gram G wolves skull mini so my gaming mouse journey lack many started with logitech g502 proteus spectrum it had a pretty cool intriguing design a ton of programmable buttons but little did I know this was not ideal for first-person shooters mainly due to the weight of 120 grams Plus this didn't affect me too much at the time nursing as I used to play with an absurdly high sensitivity that too was not ideal for my own playing style I'd been upgraded to Logitech G 703 a medium to large economic and wireless mouse at that time that was the lightest wireless gaming ass that you could buy at around 106 grams then I really started to get interested in smaller more lightweight gaming mice as I started playing with a more competitive intent so over the last 10 or so months I've switched from the affordable Wireless G 305 to the legendary cheaper Wireless then to the underrated and Game Gear XM 1 and then finally back to the G 305 which I used today and am a huge fan of and now over the course of this upgrade journey my aim has improved quite a bit but definitely has some room to grow and I mainly attribute this to switching from mostly wrist aiming with a higher sensitivity to using a lower sensitivity and pivoting at the elbow this allows you to have a lot more control over the actual distance in game especially when tracking targets or being more precise this aiming style is a lot easier and more comfortable with a mouse that weighs 70 to 80 grams compared to one that weighs 100 grams or more and yes that twenty to thirty grams is definitely noticeable and of course there are plenty of exceptions to this rule there are many pro players out there that play with a higher sensitivity and rely solely on wrist aiming but the majority of pro players do pivot from the elbow if you're unsure of what sensitivity would be ideal for the games that you play I'd highly recommend checking out a website called the pro settings dotnet they have a huge database of competitive FPS players in titles like csgo overwatch Rainbow six and apex legends I'll leave a link to their site down below so now that we have a bit of background to how liner gaming mice can be beneficial for aiming in competitive shooters let's talk about the super lightweight category of gaming - at 55 grams and below and the gaming master that inspired this video is this one right here the 45 grams G wolf skull mini this is a pre-production model seeing as the mouse hasn't been released just yet but at 45 grams not including the cable though this is the lightest gaming mouse that I've ever used but does that actually make you a better gamer and while my experience with other super lightweight gaming mice has been really solid so far I do still prefer to use something a bit larger and heavier as my main Mouse take the final Mouse ultralight - for example coming in at around 250 grams I'm personally a big fan of this mouse apart from the fact that you can no longer buy it but unless you are using a fingertip grip or have really small hands it is pretty much impossible to use forget claw gripping or palm gripping this mouse if you have medium to large hands not going to happen my experience with the glorious model Oh - was a similar story although slightly larger than the ultra light - and more user friendly for claw grip users like myself the super lightweight is heavily outweighed by the fact that it's just personally uncomfortable to use cooler masters mmm 7/10 mostly fixed this providing a nice large support at the rear of the mouse as a point of contact for the base of my hand but with this mouse I encountered other issues like the main mouse buttons pinching my fingers so moving on to the G wolves skull mini to put this mouse through its paces I opened up Kovacs aim trainer and messed around for about 10 to 15 minutes and then tried to beat my previous high schools set with the G 305 for reference that Mouse is about 80 grams with a with iam triple-a battery and has a shape mostly ideal for claw grip users so over the course of about an hour my scores gradually kept increasing one by one but there were still a decent margin off what I had achieved with the G 305 specifically accuracy was quite a bit lower and my aim didn't feel as steady I will say that out of all the ultra lightweight mice that I've tried this one has the biggest shell so it's a bit more user-friendly for the masses but this kind of creates this odd feeling making the mouse feel empty and hollow in that sense it's a bit weird to use and definitely take some time to get used to the other thing that you give up with these super lightweight mice is a wireless connection generally this doesn't bother me too much it is definitely something that you can get used to especially if they have lightweight cables that are used with a bungee but in the case of the G wolf scull meaning the cable is on the thicker end this isn't an issue for smaller mouse movements but for bigger sweeps the cable web can be pretty noticeable so coming back to the question of this video can ultra lightweight gaming mice improve your aim for me I feel like my aim has definitely improved by switching to mice between the 70 and 80 gram range at that point gaming mice are light enough but still have great build quality buttons and shapes and you've even got a few wireless options out there too but going even lighter in weight you do start to trade off a few features Wireless is out of the question and generally you are restricted to very small options only appropriate for smaller hands all those with a fingertip grip so maybe we are losing sign of what actually makes a great gaming mouse there's a lot more to it than just weight after all if that were true all professional FPS players would be using a variety of the lightest massive yet the more popular choices are commonly around that 80 gram mark and that's where I think the sweet spot is at least for now if you are looking for a new gaming mouse there are plenty of great options around that 65 to 80 gram mark the G Wolves Hardy for example I consider one of the best all-round mice at the market right now at 61 grams because although it is extremely light it's not too light that it starts affecting other critical areas of the mouse and there's also much room for improvement for gaming mice when it comes to other features for example a lightweight cable at the moment still nothing feels as good as paracord and the buttons and scroll wheels are still something that companies managed to mess up but if you are interested in upgrading your gaming mouse and potentially upgrading your aim in first-person shooters I believe a link to some of the better options that you can find today down below in the description as well as a link in the top right hand corner to a video I did recently discussing those very options as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
