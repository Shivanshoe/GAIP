[Music] all right so for modern gaming systems you really can't go wrong with cases that are 20 litres and under we've seen plenty of gaming fields before that really don't compromise too much on thermal performance and noise performance but are seriously compact to the point where you can put them in a backpack or carry-on luggage if you want we've even seen how you can take something like the rise in 39 50 X 16 core CPU and put that in a 12 and a half liter case like the end case m1 and again just get really good performance overall but what if you want to build something a bit bigger let's say you're interested in thread river like the 32 core 39 70 X or the upcoming 39 90 X the monstrous 64 core CPU or let's say you just want a multi-gpu set up for deep learning or parallel compute or something like that this is an upcoming case called the chimera CX 2 that would be ideal for just that this can accommodate multiple GPUs and EA T X motherboard and a 280 ml radiator installed at the front all in a 23 litre compact and aluminium enclosure the designers of the case have allowed me to take a look at their prototype here so to give them a bit of feedback and also to get a bit of feedback from you guys just a heads up there won't be any thermal testing in this video because they didn't ship me a side panel apparently there was a mishap with shipping but still though we will be taking a very close look at the Camaro CX 2 and if you are in the market for a very compact e ATX workstation enclosure this is potentially a case that you might be interested in so by no means is this a tiny desktop enclosure but at 23 litres it is extremely compact for a case that can house a ATX motherboards with some room to spare it's also one of the smallest cases out there to accommodate 165 millimeters of CPU cooler clearance and this means that you can install some of the most powerful options out there like knock tours and HD 15 by virtue of this though the footprint of the CX 2 is a bit larger than these servers cases which are also aimed at compact workstation builds the design is overall fairly boxy which I do like but at first glance the CX 2 almost looks like a prebuilt from Dell but looking a bit closer you'll notice things like the premium of build quality so for those of you guys who are familiar with the nkm 1 and the den a for SFX those two cases are manufactured by Leanne Lee some of you probably could tell that already because they do use very similar panels or identical panels to what you'll find on something like the Lian Li tu 150 also an ITX case so the same thing here with the CX 2 it's going to be manufactured by Lindley which means that we're still going to get those nice premium aluminium panels with a nice premium but lightweight construction it also means that we get a handle as an option just as we had with Glee only to you 150 exact same design but down just bolted on a larger case I'm not one for handles personally I just see these cases more appropriate for desktop systems where you're not really going to be carrying them around the street but I do feel like a handle is more appropriate for a larger case like the CX 2 it does use magnets to lock into place and also to recess back into the panel but this current handle design poses a lot of issues with this build because the handle folds are back into the case you end up with this pretty big box on the roof in the interior so here is the handle it snaps out of place like that and as you just saw the box that this leaves in the interior poses a tremendous amount of issues at least on this prototype here I have spoken with the designers of the case and they are thinking of switching the handle to a new design because the issue is that this imposes to the rest of your build is really quite severe so for example eh hex motherboards which would have otherwise fit don't fit because the vrm heat sinks are simply too tall another issue was that I couldn't actually install an ATF power supplier at the back here because the box was just too deep into the case and other issues like not being able to properly secure a fan to a CPU cooler not being able to access the header ports on the motherboard and a whole range of issues but hopefully they do get disordered because this handle just does not work for this compact nature of this case now the thermal design of the CX 2 is completely front to back aiming for this sort of a Windtunnel approach similar to the new Mac Pro the top panel will be completely blocked off to help channel this air to the back of the case and for the side panel we have the option of again a completely blocked off panel like the top one or you can go for a completely vented panel or a tempered glass panel radiators can be mounted at the front and bottom so a completely liquid cooled system will be no issue at all bottom radiators up to 240 mm are supported with total thickness depending on how many PCI Express devices you have installed and you can install a 280 mm at the front with radiator and fan thickness depending on the length of your graphics cards all up I measured the interior length of the case and 340 millimeters so you'll be hard-pressed to find any graphics cards that don't fit here now as an example within our TX 2080 super founders Edition which comes in at 267 millimeters long you've got a little over 70 mils of combined radiator and fan clearance to play with at the front the configuration that you're looking at here has a standard 280 ml a i/o installed at the front leaving about 20 to 30 mils of clearance between the graphics cards if you plan on using water blocks on your cards usually they will take up that extra 20 mils because they are slightly longer than the PCB but if you want to do a dual radiator configuration it will be a tight fit but it can work again just keep in mind the 340 ml combined length measurement so that would be the total thickness of the front mounted fans and radiator plus the total length of the bottom mounted radiator itself power supply mounting is interesting in the CX 2 if you want a liquid cooling your CPU you can mount an ATX power supply towards the back of the case towards the motherboard just keep in my this isn't going to be ideal for vrm thermals you might want to implement your own onboard vrm calling there that option would be ideal though if you want to populate as many PCIe devices as possible and make use of all eight expansion slots otherwise you can actually install an SFX power supply at the very bottom of the case by removing the bottom three expansion slots and swapping that over to the included PSU mounting bracket so installing an SFX power supply at the bottom of the CX 2 will take up three expansion slots but then it clears up all of this room at the top if you want to run a massive air hole up like the NHD 15 personally I do think that 165 mill air cooler clearance is a big selling point for this case because there aren't many cases out there these compacts that have that clearance available one big issue though that I came across when installing an SFX power supply at the bottom was the length of the SFX power supply cables themselves now the EPS and the PCIe cables are usually about 400 mils long but the 24 pin power cable on the coarser SFX power suppliers are only 300 mils long and I didn't find that to be long enough to reach the bottom of the SFX power supply to the 24 pin connector on an ATX board so that can only really be fixed with a 24 pin extension just definitely something to keep in mind for storage brackets will be included for three and a half inch and two and a half inch drives for mounting at the bottom and the top just keep in mind that this will eat up radiator and fan space all right so that's mostly what you need to know about the CX 2 in terms of compatibility and whatnot but now let's talk about the pricing and availability and these are two things that are just generally not in these premium small form-factor cases favored now the price here does look fairly reasonable when you consider that the MKS m1 and the dente 4 SFX are currently retailing for about 210 US dollars and they're available they're aiming for the CX 2 to be sub $200 so hopefully we can get it in the you know 170 to maybe 180 dollar range but the big thing is availability for me personally I am just not confident in the availability of this case if I am completely honest after seeing the MK m1 and the den a for SFX being out of stock just so consistently and when they are in stock they're just really small batches it doesn't leave me much confidence for the cx2 and trust me guys I really want to be wrong here I want this case to succeed and this could very well be a mainstream recommendation from me but again I do feel like it's going to be limited and held back by how many they can actually produce and so if you are interested in this sort of thing they're like a really compact e ATX enclosure that doesn't compromise too much on radiator support I can highly recommend the slyger Cerberus and Cerberus X the pricing there is a bit steep it's going to be a bit dearer than what the CX 2 is aimed at build quality is also a lot better on the CX 2 but it's definitely not appalling on the slider cases but the big thing there is that the servers and servers exit are actually in stock you can buy them now and they ship pretty quickly I have built in both of those cases and can definitely recommend them now I can also see the CX 2 being popular for those who have a massive you know 80 X or e ATX system but just wanted down science without compromising too much on their hardware and you know having to buy a mini ITX motherboard and sfx power supply and stuff like that this potentially can fit full ATX hardware in it and allow you to downsize the volume and footprint of your rig tremendously so the chimera CX do then is potentially two things it's a compact II ATX enclosure that's already for thousands of dollars of workstation hardware and it's also an entry-level small form-factor system for those wanting to bridge the gap to smaller volume cases so those are my thoughts on the CX - I'd love to know your thoughts - down below in the comments as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
