hey what's up guys hope you're doing well and it's been almost six months since our last uh desk setup review so we're a little bit overdue definitely time for one i'm also working on a couple of videos at the moment which are pretty cool videos but they are just taking a very long time so just waiting on some parts and things like that so i thought in the meantime let's uh do another one of these desk setup reviews and see what you guys have been up to and this one that we're scrolling past uh has caught my eye i actually kind of saw this one to start with take a look at this lighting setup it is absolutely insane this guy has an aperture like light box this is not just any light box as well for one it's a pretty expensive one and two it is absolutely huge so most likely he's using this for twitch broadcasting i think this would be a little bit overkill for like zoom calls and stuff like that but i think it's safe to say this is like the god tier lighting setup for your desk and also something that's caught my eye here is the elgato low profile boom arm for the microphone which just seems to be coming out at the perfect spot there like just wraps around the monitor really well i'm not sure if you guys have seen uh what i use but it's basically what he's got up here it's the rode psa1 i've pretty much got it mounted right behind the monitor kind of similar but a little bit lower than what he has and it's just so awkward to use so i think one of these low profile boom arms might be the play and here's a look at the pc it is absolutely knocked out out i mean that is probably the most amount of noctual fans that you could fit in this case i think maybe you could fit another one on the side panel but that's probably getting a little bit crazy there he's running some pretty decent components here as well ryzen 5600x and an rtx 3070 fe and that will have no problem staying cool with that setup does look like they've changed it around a little bit from this setup to the other one from mousepad for example this one is the vaxi pa he hasn't listed it but i picked it up recently it's a very smooth like nice control pad i might end up you know including it in a mousepad roundup i actually think it's quite good uh custom keyboard kbd67 light with black ink v2 switches very very nice uh aqua and thank you for sharing then we have another uh streaming setup here from colin so many streamers here let's check this guy out okay looks like he's got a few followers twitch affiliate thank you colin for sharing let's take a look at your setup here because these light boxes this lighting setup i just know it's just going to be absolutely god here when it comes to you know soft lighting and just looking really good for the setup not only does it like make you look good on camera but of course it's gonna make your entire setup you know just feel lit properly if that makes sense it's kind of a hard thing to explain for people who haven't seen this kind of soft clear like perfect white lighting before but it does just look really really good overall though it's a pretty neat and tidy uh streaming setup here from colin aside from all of the lighting and stuff that i like to no doubt about uh his pc is looking pretty fresh it is the 011 mini air i think that is and that's running a ryzen 3900x rtx 3080 32 gigabytes of ram and he has an absolute ton of fans and airflow hopefully again he's got that kind of configured up and set up correctly otherwise not a whole lot to say here from colin uh i don't want to say it's a generic streaming setup but it is a bit of a generic streaming setup uh this little wrist dress caught my eye for the gaming gaming mouse these always amuse me i don't know how people use those uh but hey more power to you and yeah colin thank you for sharing all right now scrolling down here honestly i didn't want to feature another streamer setup i think that's a little bit unfair to people who just aren't streaming and haven't poured tons and tons of caption to the setup but this one is not like that this is a streaming setup but obviously it's a little bit different it's not the kind of uh western world streaming setup with a ton of rgb that you know we may have seen in the last two and look you know it's hard to make criticisms on you know how messy it is and oh you know the walls aren't painted or stuff like that maybe i can criticize on like the safety of the powerpoint adapters um and stuff like that but hey you know he's working with what he's got uh you know let's uh let's take a quick look at his channel let's see what he's got very nice very nice oh no way no way he's live no way he's live good for him man his stream actually looks really really good he's got the green screen you know so you can't see the mess behind him you know what let's uh let's comment let's see what he says subscribe mood only stream looks great maybe he doesn't have a chat window maybe he's like not monitoring chat or anything like that anyway we'll even be he's probably a little bit preoccupied with the uh ranked gameplay but hey you know good for him very surprised actually with how good the stream look especially the lighting actually looks okay looks like he's got a ring light here behind the monitor but yeah thank you for sharing man so many streaming setups this one here another streaming setup this one here another streaming setup uh this one i'm not sure is the streaming setup all right this one this one here is actually kind of interesting so here we have one from evol uh vg279q for the monitor i think that is a 144 hertz ducky one two meaning for the keyboard uh final mouse starlight 12 artisan xl soft for the mousepad actually the exact same mousepad that i'm using at the moment very good choice and then for the microphone he's got the hyperx quadcast which i've heard good things about but uh one thing i'd recommend is you know if you're actually playing if you're not actually doing this yet just move that a little bit closer to you because the audio quality with the microphone that far away from you know yourself it's just gonna sound not great at all no microphone in the world i don't care how many thousands of dollars you spend will sound good you know being that far away from you it's just it's just how it works so again evil if you're not already you know consider putting that microphone a little bit closer to you when you're actually gaming your teammates uh will thank you and also this keyboard positioning is super super interesting to me i have no idea how people play like this i mean you've got to be really like cranking your elbow super super hard and playing like like this almost like i play with a bit of keyboard tilts like maybe like 30 degrees or something but this is just on a completely different level i've seen a lot of people who play fortnite have this kind of keyboard angle i'm not sure if it's just like a bit of a hype trend sort of thing or if there's actually a functional benefit to that game you know having a slanted keyboard but otherwise you know pretty neat and tidy setup are what earbuds do you have it just says sony earbuds uh you might want to swap those out for some you know high quality iems even some budget ones which we've kind of taken a look at might be worth a bit of an upgrade for you uh but yeah otherwise thank you for sharing next up here from maker on my car sorry i'm probably butchering that name but uh we'll just call you by a twitter handle which is called aimgod uh and yeah a bit of an aim god set up to be honest the biggest thing that's catching my eye here apart from these random multivitamins that you've decided to put on your artisan hand or artisan raiden mousepad uh is the mouse this is the zon konig m2k which i think is the lightest mouse in existence actually let me just fact check that for a second because i'm not sure if you can even buy these at the moment so this is a 24 gram carbon fiber mouse 8 000 hertz polling rate damn this would actually make for a pretty cool video but of course it's kind of limited to fingertip grip only because you've got no back support you also have no side buttons either which is kind of a deal breaker for some games otherwise they're you know pretty interesting product i mean just look at how dense that pcb is for a gaming mouse that's pretty interesting uh let's see how much one of these things costs 300 euros for this thing oh my god and you can't even buy them they are sold out i think actually no the matte carbon fiber one you can buy honestly we might do a video on this thing it's actually pretty interesting cool i mean this guy has uh aim god in his twitter handle surely he's you know pretty good looks like he is radiant in valor as well okay cool let's let's just say we bought the right mouse guys uh the artisan raiden i have not used this one i think it's one of their faster ones as well i might eventually pick that one up and you know give it a try for the headphones he's using the i 300 iems which is what i have as well and then for over ear headphones he has the hd558 and then for the monitor pretty good choice uh zowie xl2546k honestly not a whole lot to say here that keyboard angle is a little bit weird to me i do not know how people play uh with their keyboard angle like that maybe if you don't have control for crouch or you have like a left alt for crouch instead maybe it works like that but otherwise yeah thank you for sharing now obviously with over 200 submissions here we can't go over every single one uh but this one from flaming ninja gaming you know pretty decent one thing i will say though is to well maybe you actually can't do it but i was recommending that you probably put your pc just off the desk because it is just taking a monstrous amount of space on that desk and i totally get it you've built this like expensive pc you've obviously spent a good amount of money on this thing but at the same time having it sitting there as like a display piece you know it looks cool but it is taking up quite a bit of space and i honestly think that your setup would be a little bit more welcoming and a little bit more comfortable to use if you kind of relocated it off to the side there all right this one here from jason got quite a few likes i think because of the supernatural green and wood aesthetic which just looks super super clean in a way it's not so much of a like minimal kind of ultra clean setup which is what i would prefer to me you know i don't want to dump on his setup here it does look a little bit cluttered and some of you might feel the same way for other people they kind of take comfort in having lots of things and i think the green aesthetic does kind of add to that comfort level for some people typically with these kind of setups as well they're like fake plants so like you're sitting at your setup you feel calm and you have this greenery around you but in the back of your mind you're just kind of thinking how these are just fake plants and they're just maybe not adding to anything but hey maybe they're not fake plants maybe they're real if so more power to you in terms of the actual setup itself looks like you're quite into mechanical keyboards uh would have actually like to hear what keyboard you're using it looks like we do have some more photos down here but yeah lighting is on point photography is on point as well probably doing a bit of photography yourself uh yeah would have loved to hear more about those custom keyboards especially because i'm starting to build a couple more myself and it's always interesting to hear what switch options people go with and whatnot it does look like there are a couple you know custom keyboards hanging around there yeah otherwise very interesting setup there from jason and thank you for sharing scrolling down a bit here we have this setup from eight i think is the pronunciation there and look i think i've been pretty good with uh cable management and whatnot i've been pretty lenient with the cable management that i've seen so far and to be honest you know when it comes to cable management i get it you've got to use your setup you got to plug stuff in plug stuff out upgrade you can't always have this pristine cable management setup i get that this on the other hand is just completely just it's on the other end of like bad cable management and again i get it you've got a ton of peripherals you've got a ton of stuff plugged in but like what is this what is this like this is just like a bad accident waiting to happen you know you've got your feet under there like you know you move from under your table imagine you just like catch one of those chords you unplug something and like you drag your monitor off the table or something horrendous like that overall the setup itself is not too bad i'm not a big fan of the monitor placement i feel like you know you should always have one monitor pretty much centered right in front of you and then one off to the side somehow i actually think a dual monitor arm would be perfect for this setup if you have uh vase amounts for those monitors that way you reclaim a bit of space on the desk and you're also able to position the monitor right in front of you let's check out this guy's stream let's let's see how it's looking because it looks like the lighting and whatnot was pretty on point and yeah one thing you can't see in the setup is the cable management so i guess the cable management is okay so long as you can't see it you know on camera we'll say though this guy's vibing he's uh you know he's pretty comfortable in his setup so maybe the cable management doesn't really matter oh the movement though all right he missed some shots there but i'm sure he's actually really good his movement's pretty good oh his friends are good too he plays with some pretty good teammates yeah most important thing with your setup by far is that you're comfortable you look pretty comfortable in your setup but i think it could be even better if you had uh you know better cable management that way you're not worried about you know tangling yourself through cables at least that's what i'm doing when i'm looking at this setup and again monitor arms i think could help quite a bit here and here is pretty much exactly what i mean just scrolling down a little bit here we have this setup from helchi and just take a look at how clean this setup is i mean nothing special nothing too flashy or anything i mean it does have some pretty good components but in terms of the cleanliness and just the welcomingness of the setup if that's even a word but yeah the setup is just so welcoming uh not only does it kind of contribute to the visual cleanliness of the setup and how inviting it is but i actually would go as far as to say that you would actually pop off like you would actually play quite a bit better by having that extra mouse pad space by having the monitor in the correct position and the correct height i really do think that stuff actually makes a difference yeah this is definitely one of those setups where i could see myself just sitting down barely adjusting anything and just being totally comfortable and just you know having a good gaming session or work or whatever it might be definitely one of the nicest setups i've seen in this series and that might surprise some of you some of you might think that you know the best setups are the triple monitor rgb streaming rooms you know you don't have to be a streamer you don't have to be any of that to have a really good setup i actually think it's more impressive when you are a little bit limited when it comes to space and maybe even budget but you just really maximize on the basics and you just get the basics really right which is exactly what the setup has done man i gotta say you guys like really blew it out of the water this time there are so many submissions uh i feel bad scrolling past them like this one here with the pc uh mixing a bit of soft tubing and hard tubing is you know not something that typically looks good but i think uh ro tablet here has pulled it off quite nicely very very nice rtx 3090 in there very nice liquid cooled pc setup looks great as well again just setups where there's nothing really to pick apart but still want to show a bit of appreciation for again here you know nice encasement build little portable pc here and this setup here from uh iskalim they say my humble third world gaming and studying setup trying my best in competitive pub g uh but it's rough with the 60 hertz monitor but we're grinding let's take a look at this uh yeah so another one of those third world gaming setups which you know you got to do what you got to do pretty interesting here they've used books to elevate the monitor because it's not hard adjustable and they've also used a kind of a little peg clip onto a flag here as the mouse bungie so you know third world gaming setup i can imagine that wireless gaming mice like a g-pro superlat would be super super expensive over there so you know they've kind of just improvised and just worked with what they've got then we've got another streamer set up here from ness uh amd ryzen 9 3950x uh rtx 3090 super powerful gaming setup here uh but one thing we're going to talk about here we're going to talk about these desktop icons does this not give you anxiety i mean it's not only nas here but we've seen some other setups here where you guys just have a ton of desktop icons like i mean this one here from gaiuki for example just take a look at how clean this look i mean it's like massaging my brain when i look at this uh this one on the other hand right below it it's just like pure anxiety i don't know what it is maybe i'm the only person maybe you guys can sound off down in the comments as well but yeah when i kind of look at all of these icons and all of these programs just kind of like begging to be open just like staring me in the face just like opened me up for me like all these things that you have to do i rather just like nuke all the shortcuts all together and that way you just have a nice clean slate to work with every time you sit down at your pc all right this one here is nuts this guy says uh i'm 14. just just keep that in mind i'm 14. my cable management is terrible my laptop components are blah blah blah i have a super light gmm k compact rtx 2080 9700k dude you're 14 and this is your setup like that is just mind blowing to me like when i was 14 i had a ps3 and like a broken monitor like i don't even know like you're 14 and you've got like an ultra wide this is probably like high refresh rate you've got nice 60 keyboard you've got a super light you've got like triple monitor setup it's just it just blows my mind like very very very lucky not only that but yeah the setup itself is actually pretty damn good i'm not sure if someone has set this up for you but overall looks pretty inviting the lighting looks pretty good as well looks like there's some rgb lighting underneath the desk uh cable management could probably be a little bit better but hey i don't want to be too picky about it yeah overall to have a setup like that and be that young all right this setup here from brett is definitely worth a feature they've also listed quite a lot here which is always helpful i think this is one of those prime examples actually where you can be you know a competitive sweaty gamer but you can still have a nice presentable and clean setup like you can always tell by what monster people are using this guy's using an azawi xl 2546k like i can bet that he's definitely taking his competitive gaming you know pretty seriously or he's at least uh you know playing competitive titles but at the same time you know he doesn't have g fuel spilled over his keyboard you know he doesn't have cable management or like 50 different gaming mice on his desk and also i'll say um it's very rare to see form t1 in titanium i'm pretty sure that's like a really rare configuration maybe there was only like one or two drops of that case in that color so yeah definitely pretty cool to see that out in the wild and then in terms of what else he's using uh ducky one two mini with silent red switches looks like he's got some uh custom keycaps on there as well and he's put that in a dark green tofu case which is looking pretty clean and then he's using the xtrify gp1 tropical for the mousepad uh if you guys were interested in that now if you don't believe me when i say that there were a ton of uh setups submitted i mean just take a look at this there are so so many and let's actually go right up to the top because i actually started about halfway through this time for a little bit of a change and again with the desktop icons oh why are you guys doing this i don't get it like some of these shortcuts are just for the most random things as well like sometimes you'll see like a shortcut for vlc media player or like i don't know actually we do see that here there's one right there like personally i don't get it when you want to open a program you hit that windows key you start typing the program it pops up i also like when people uh uninstall programs or just delete the shortcuts and they just leave that empty like chasm or graveyard there for the program kind of like a bit of a memory a bit of a you know i used to have that program installed but now it's not there anymore but yeah man we need to clean up these desktop icons and it's not just uh ernie here it's honestly it's quite a lot of you this one here as well like you can tell that the desktop icons are getting in the way of the wallpaper when you kind of like you know orient oh you know i just can't let's move on all right this setup here from brian i mean let's take a look at a bit of an overkill setup because i think my personal bias for setups is like clean minimal maybe a bit of a competitive gaming flair i can kind of lean towards those setups but every now and then i know what you guys want to see it's kind of like just something where you can tell someone's just thrown a bunch of cash to their setup and again what are we doing with these desktop icons man especially when you have like 200 windows scaling and the icons are absolutely ginormous honestly just crazy i don't know what you guys are doing but something really interesting here is that pc so at first i thought this was like um the new leanly 011 i don't even know the name of it but it's one where you can kind of like orientate the internal layout of the pc but i believe this is actually just a regular mid-tower pc which they've just like kind of flipped on the back which is really really interesting because you can just see the power supply shroud just chilling there at the bottom you can also see the front usb which is located at the top of the pieces usually here but of course because it's flipped it's over here now and it looks like there's some kind of improvised uh mounting situation probably 3d printed or custom made but yeah overall looks like it's working quite well this setup here is interesting literally a bed gaming setup from evil eyes man this is either like really comfortable or really uncomfortable like i could just imagine myself sitting there and just like having the most rounded back and just having like severe health issues uh honestly maybe this person uh is like wheelchair bound or like they have a kind of condition where they have to sit in this way and in that kind of case like i am sorry i don't want to dump on your setup too bad actually maybe we can kind of click their twitter maybe get a little bit of uh context too just a bunch of retweets [Music] and this is the setup that i need to kind of just cleanse my brain after what i just saw so this setup here very very good lighting when the lighting is done perfectly i know we're kind of we're talking about lighting at the start of the video but good lighting just really does make a really big difference and honestly this is probably one of those setups where i have like nothing else to say like you know we could harp on about oh you should upgrade to this you know audio interface or this monitor would be a good upgrade or you know this keyboard doesn't sound good you should try this one but i don't really care for those kind of comments to be honest because i honestly don't think there is much value in those kind of comments you know saying you should have to upgrade and upgrade and do this and you get that that road can just be played forever and ever and ever and you know sometimes you know your desk set up and what you have it's not all about having the best it's also about using it to the best of its ability also i have a question about 40 keyboards they look so so good i mean i have this thing with small keyboards they just they look amazing but they are impossible to use right like how do you use a 40 keyboard other than you know for typing stuff and whatnot i mean for me if i'm typing away scripts and stuff like that then i don't type a whole bunch of numbers anyway but for gaming swapping weapons and stuff like that isn't that impossible am i missing something here i feel like i'm missing something because 40 keyboards they're kind of popular and if that was an issue i feel like people wouldn't use them in the first place but yeah any 40 keyboard users let me know down below because i'm kind of keen to try one they look really really cool especially in that setup there just looks super super clean would love to see the rest of the setup but that is the only picture they provided this setup here is actually kind of interesting so uh mode 65 talking about keyboards that's one i've always wanted to try out but check this out so they've got a sim racing setup over to the right there and you would think uh you know to do a bit of sim racing and whatnot they would kind of drag the setup over but then you know if you need to sit at your desk then you have to keep dragging it back and forth all they do is like swing the monitor around and that's it like you're racing like straight away like that would take five seconds to do maybe this is something that is like brutally obvious for people who have sim racing setups like maybe this is totally normal but i think this is like really really cool something that i personally have not thought of before yeah overall does look like a pretty uh comfortable setup thank you jojo for inspiring me for my future sim racing setup and then again we have another desktop icon offender these ones are just all over the place like what is it what is this guy got here he has a desktop icon for geforce experience like otherwise the rest of the setup is pretty well put together it looks like they have a custom keyboard they've got a shure sm7b for the microphone go xlr mini uh and then a vax cpa mousepad with a final mouse starlight 12 phantom their only text that they've written here is pepsi is better than coca-cola which you know i'd have to agree uh if we're talking pepsi max versus coke zero then you definitely have to go to pepsi max right i mean coxa is okay but if we're talking the full sugar stuff i think you definitely have to go coca-cola then full sugar pepsi just it tastes like syrup it tastes a bit weird honestly not much of a fan but yeah otherwise nice to see a clean-ish fps kind of setup if we had you know nice wallpaper and maybe some different desktop maybe just get rid of the desktop icons all together and yeah i think we're talking but i do think that pretty much wraps it up again there are just so many cool setups here this one from oma with the kikron q2 very nice keyboard love the keycaps a great setup altogether to be honest a lot of the commentary and the suggestions from my end are kind of uh repetitive i would say but yeah you guys definitely get the idea because definitely less criticism overall for this time around so hopefully you enjoyed this episode just as much as the last ones as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
