probably the biggest advantage of building your own custom mechanical keyboard is that the options when it comes to these switches is almost limitless as opposed to your typical off-the-shelf keyboards where you've got a few Cherry MX or Gator on switches to choose from there are many aftermarket switch is out there that you've probably never heard of that offer a much more premium typing experience now of course if you're a mechanical keyboard enthusiast than a lot of what you're about to see is probably familiar but if not then you've probably never heard of the novel keys of blueberry switches or cream switches or the tactile Zeile PC Zelia switches so let's climb it he bit deeper into this rabbit hole and see what these are all about so if you've yet to explore the vast land of these aftermarket mechanical keyboard switches then this video will definitely serve as a nice little guide and if you are familiar then you'll at least be able to see many of these switches side by side and compare them first up some tactile switches for those that like a little bit more feedback from their switch and let's start with the novel Keys blueberry switches this is a relatively new switch they have a bottoming out force of 80 grams so a bit on the heavier side a fairly deep actuation point of three millimeters and a really unique aesthetic with those vibrant blue stems key switch actuation is right at the end of that long and relatively heavy tactile bump I wouldn't recommend these for competitive gaming for that reason but for those that want a typing experience with a lot more tactility these are definitely worth considering the stem in housing is made of a self lubricating P om resin which is said to offer an extremely low friction coefficient and overall these are fairly smooth switch next up we have a very popular tactile switch option from zero PC the Z Lea's these are tactile but non clicky switches offering a smooth stroke with a noticeable bump for feedback I did notice that the tactile bump on the Z Lea's feels a bit smoother than on the blue berry switches which in my opinion feel a bit more like a step there are four switches in the Z Leo series with different bottoming out forces and small tweaks between them 62 grams 65 67 and 70 grams this allows you to really fine-tune the way your keyboard feels whether you prefer a lighter and easier typing experience or something heavier and more pronounced otherwise there definitely aren't major differences between them that I can tell only 78 grams stands out as the variant being noticeably the heaviest so don't think too hard between 65 grams and 67 grams in my opinion because they feel almost identical the big thing that stands out with these switches is just how smooth they feel while at the same time offering a really pleasant tactile bump with a nice roll-off we also have the silent tactile switches which are basically Zelia switches but a lot quieter the switch bottoming out and topping out sound has been reduced significantly and the way that this has been done is by adding dampeners to the top and bottom of the stem they still have the same tactile bump and feedback as far as I can tell but are much easier on their ears if you're typing in a quiet environment you can also hear a bit more of the spring on the silence than the Celia's let's say you don't really want a quiet keyboard and you actually want something really loud super clicky and you want everyone to know you have a mechanical keyboard well definitely consider the novel Keys Kel box thick clicks just don't bring them in to work as opposed to the previous tactile switches that we saw which generate a tactile bumper from the leaf and the stem these feature a click var and a pretty thick one this bar gets pulled down by the stem with each press and then it releases back creating that loud and defined click one thing I did notice with these switches though is the small amount of pre travel just before the stem actually meets the Crick bar so just keep that in mind if you are interested in picking these up next up let's take a look at some of those lesser-known linear switches out there in the wild and we have to start with the novel Keys cream switches these feature the same self-lubricating p.m. housing and stem as the novel keys of blueberry switches so they do feel very similar structurally and the switch stroke is nice and smooth you will still get a noticeable benefit from lubricating them though in my opinion the actuation point comes in at two millimeters making this a more suitable choice for gamers and the bottoming out force is 70 grams if you're looking for a linear switch that is a bit lighter or something with a more unique aesthetic the meter laser switches might just be what you're after and are easily one of the coolest looking switches I've ever seen I know they're hiding underneath your key caps anyway but still super cool nonetheless the cyan switches have a 60 gram at bottoming out force whereas the pink switches are slightly heavier at 70 grams the difference is noticeable but not major also one thing I'll say is that although both the pink lasers and the novel keys cream switches both have a bottoming out force of 70 grams the creams do feel noticeably heavier a bit closer to 75 or 80 grams however this next switch might just be my favorite linear switch of all time and perfect for those who want something slightly heavier but definitely very smooth out of the box so these are the Gator on Inc blacks and if you're someone who doesn't want to go through the extra work of lubricating the internals of the switch these I can definitely recommend out of the box that have almost no internal friction at all and are just super buttery smooth so I'd say these are perfect for a slightly heavier switch and me just preferring linear switch is in general I really like these overall and to round things out we have the linear options from zero PC first up the Helios v2 which is exactly what I'm using in my own mechanical keyboard build and I've been super happy with these feel extremely similar to the laser switches that we looked at in the beginning the 70 gram ones I'd say they're fairly close in terms of smoothness and feel but the Helios are just slightly smoother and for a truly silent and buttery typing experience we have the 62 grams Securi oz 67 gram rose illios and the 63 and a half gram helios so just like the zero pc tactile silent switches these have silencing bumpers on top and bottom of the stem for that sound dampening there's really not much more that you could want from a silent linear switch they're all extremely smooth and for those wondering you can feel the difference between the heavier 67 gram switch between the 62 and 63 gram and personally I think the 67 gram is perfect and this roundup of switches is just really the tip of the iceberg for all of the possible switch options that you have out there but for those looking to get started with a custom mechanical keyboard build you really can't go wrong with any of these options for a tactile build I can highly recommend the Helios lineup and for Lydia's all of the options that we had a look at have a really nice and premium feel so just choose depending on how heavy you like your switch if you are interested in picking any of these up I will have some links down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
