so for the last few months i switched my headphones pretty much exclusively to iems for gaming for editing and listening to music i wanted to see what the advantages and disadvantages would be versus my open back sennheiser hd58x's and i guess what mostly sparked this idea was i was kind of just getting a little bit tired of just wearing headphones all day and just the overall bulkiness and the overall clamping force just for you know sometimes could be 12 hours sitting at my desk so you know no matter how comfortable these hd58x's were i did find myself just readjusting them every now and then and just getting a bit tired of that force so the thought then of swapping them for an iem which could be potentially a lot more comfortable and deliver an almost weightless experience that to me was really interesting so the first pair that i grabbed were these the final audio a4000 a 150 iem that quite a lot of people are really happy with these are a very fast sounding iem tons of details and clarity in the mid and high frequencies but for gaming honestly i was a bit disappointed i know for sure that a lot of audiophiles out there will love these because for critical listening with the right music mostly female vocal tracks with those fast crisp instrumentals they sound very detailed and technical but for my set of use cases gaming and music with a lot of energy and bass they just weren't giving me that punch that i was after for example a common use case of mine shooting a gun in pretty much any game sounded really flat and overly detailed sometimes even fatiguing and in terms of the feedback you don't really feel anything i would even go as far as saying that i was missing more audio cues in game than usual with my hd58x's things like footsteps gunshots and enemy positioning the overall presence of those low frequencies were a bit lost so i kept using these on and off mostly off for the last few months and kind of just swapping between my sennheiser hd58x's but mostly resorting to the open back headphones especially when it came to gaming these i felt for long hours you know they were comfortable but the you know real emphasis on those mid and high frequencies did become quite fatiguing to me uh but these were great for me when i really wanted that sound isolation and just a little bit more focus in my workflow for example when editing these were really great for that eventually though i picked up these the sennheiser ie300s and these completely blew me away the audio profile on these especially for gaming is simply phenomenal they're a pretty bass focused iem very fun sounding is what i think most people would describe them as but just the clarity and presence of that bass for an iem was really surprising to me it exceeds anything that i've heard or felt from my sennheiser hd58x's and again specifically for gaming the difference is so noticeable it's less about what you hear and more about what you feel so with these you really feel when your bullets are connecting in game just the impact that certain game weapons have and how those bullets sound and how those are separate and layered against everything else you really notice that with the ie300s most importantly though the comfort which is the main reason i went through all of this experimenting was exactly what i hoped it would be for those really long sessions the a4000s were good but the sennheisers are a fair bit smaller and just molded perfectly with the right tips these stay in my ears for hours and don't budge at all now at first i did have some ear tenderness and discomfort after those really long gaming and work sessions since i didn't wear iems before this that tenderness eventually wore off after using them just more and more and experimenting with the different sized tips that come included and just finding the right ones for my particular ear size but now after using them for a few months i would say that for me at least i do prefer the feel and comfort of an iem over any full sized headphone the completely weightless feel is so nice after really long hours compared to headphones which can end up feeling like you're wearing a helmet after a while of course you also have the added benefit of never having headphone hair which is really nice depending on how often you go outside and the added portability of an iem is a huge point as well so yeah i 300s absolutely love these two bits i mean uh this is definitely what i would call a good purchase in my books great comfort and the sound signature is an upgrade over my hd58x's in my opinion but at 300 us dollars they are not cheap as a gaming peripheral right unless you can get more use out of them uh you know i would expect them to last quite a long time but still as a gaming peripheral as an earbud 300 bucks is pretty deep not exactly a price range where i can say hey give these a shot because they might not end up being your thing and i guess one benefit here is that you don't need an amplifier to power them like you would a lot of headphones in that range but if you're playing online games with friends and using voice chat i would still recommend that you get yourself an audio interface which has zero delay mixing such as the audient evo4 or the wave xlr if you don't balance at least some of your microphone audio through the iems during online gaming you get this really weird blocked effect where you're talking into the microphone but you can't actually hear yourself talk and it's just a really uncomfortable experience personally not something that i could get used to so for normal desktop use i have the balance set to 100 desktop audio but when gaming i have it split about 50 50 between microphone audio and desktop again though the price is pretty deep so what if you want to try something at a bit of a lighter price well that's where i'd recommend these instead these are the moon drop arias and for just 80 they are a super good value really balanced great starter iem the i-300s are a much beefier more premium sounding iem as you would expect for being almost four times the price but to be honest if i had bought the moon drops first i probably wouldn't have felt the need to upgrade the sound signature here i find is really balanced and clean but still with enough low end to keep someone like me happy almost like the hd58x's but in iem form some audiophiles might actually find them a bit too bassy even but for gaming specifically i actually think the sound signature here will be spot on for a lot of people gunshots don't sound rattly or fatiguing like they do on the a4000s and the clarity and detail is rock solid for the price point so then what are the negatives well firstly if you don't have an audio interface with zero latency microphone and system audio mixing i would actually say stick with over-the-ear headphones when it comes to online gaming otherwise immersion is going to be completely broken whenever you go and talk and can't hear your own voice speaking of immersion sound stage is noticeably better on open back headphones to test this out i went and compared a few of the same game clips and songs with iems against my hd58x's and the audio imagery and space around you just feels much bigger with the hd58x's that's not to say that you don't get any soundstage with iems this group of iems in particular are pretty good at that for the tiny in-ear drivers but just think of it as more of a boxed in type of sound space i found it more than enough for gaming directional audio cues for example were no problem at all but there is a noticeable advantage here for the open back headphones you know one common thing that people will say about openback headphones and i've even said this in the past as well is that that open sound stage and that open back nature it just has you know better imagery allow you to pinpoint your enemies and really dial in their location a lot better and that is true you do have wider sound stage a much better imagery of what's happening around you but it's not like you're missing that with the iems i've realized that sound stage probably isn't as important as i thought it was initially with iems you definitely still hear those directional audio cues and enemy positioning but it's just in a smaller space so honestly that pretty much wraps up everything i have to say so far generally i would say that for gamers probably avoid the audiophile focused iems with a really flat sound signature because they can potentially be pretty fatiguing when it comes to gun shots and certain game audio you can get a really great sounding iem for gaming though in the case of the arias and the i-300s depending on your budget and i'm sure that there are plenty more out there that i haven't tried that are great as well for now though i am really enjoying the weightless feel and comfort of the ie300s and that really impactful sound if you are interested in checking them out i will leave them linked down below in the description as well as some more resources for you to maybe dive into this audio stuff a little bit deeper as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
