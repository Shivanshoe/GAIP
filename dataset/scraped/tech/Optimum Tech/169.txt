hey guys hope you're all doing well and since there is so much hype around the rtx 30 series right now and everyone's kind of planning their own upgrades for this system or maybe a new system altogether i thought i'd share some of my own upgrades that i'm making to my system today so here we have a monoblock some new ek torque compression fittings and finally the proper sized radiator that is going into my system as some of you might remember when i first built this system back here the radiator that i initially used was a little bit too thick and that kind of caused the top panel to bow a little bit and that was definitely less than ideal and i also want to discuss my plans for the upcoming rtx 3090 which is going to be an absolute monster gpu but i do plan on testing it in this tiny little system back here first and that's something that i do want to discuss with you guys as well so definitely a bit more of a laid back video today kind of just going over some personal rig upgrades i'll also be test fitting a couple things in this rig because the new water blocks are a little bit smaller so yeah let's roll the intro take a look and let's get into it [Music] so here it is my own pc that i use for gaming 3d rendering video editing and all the production side stuff that happens on the channel is done on this pc right here most of you are probably familiar with this pc the last update was around two months ago but for those of you who are new to the channel and don't exactly know what you're looking at here i will give you a quick brief rundown so the case is called the formed t1 doesn't usually look like this all of the panels are of course taken off i'll leave a link down below to where you can buy it and how you can buy it they are in quite high demand at the moment but it is an extremely good case one of my favorite ever the cpu that i've got in there is the intel i9 9900 ks it's an eight core processor that boosts up to around five gigahertz i'll mention why that is still the kind of cpu of choice for this rig in a little bit that's plugged into the asus strix z390i motherboard along with 32 gigabytes of 3200 megahertz memory and then for the gpu we have the rtx 2080 ti so the main reason that i'm so excited to upgrade this system from the rtx 2080 ti to the rtx 3090 is because my use cases for this system video editing gaming and 3d rendering are all gpu bound that means that i don't really see any performance gain from upgrading the cpu for this system compared to upgrading the gpu the camera that i'm using right now is the blackmagic 6k pocket cinema camera so working with 6k footage and there have been some instances where the rtx 2080 ti just hasn't been enough to edit on a 4k timeline in davinci resolve studio which is kind of hard to think about like how is the top-end gaming gpu not enough to edit 6k footage but in some cases the 11 gigabytes of vram has been a serious bottleneck and has forced me to reduce the timeline resolution to something like 1080p and then for those of you who have seen the last two videos on the channel you'll know that they involved quite a lot of 3d rendering done in a blender of course i don't have the rtx 3080 or 3090 in hand at the moment so i still wanted to show some interesting kind of footage and animations and blender is something that allows me to do that however again it is extremely gpu intensive i personally prefer to render with the gpu in blender i find it a lot faster and more efficient moving forward i'm not sure how much blender i'll actually use in future videos because it's only really useful when you don't have the product in hand and you want to kind of explain something using animations however although i am super excited to upgrade to the rtx 3090 and speed up my own production workflow i really doubt i can do it within the constraints and volume of this case when running the 2080 ti at stock it'll settle to around 70 degrees c with a fairly low fan speed of around 1200 rpm i'm able to get that down to around 60 to 58c by under vaulting the gpu and reducing the total power from 260 watts to 200 watts i've done a video explaining how to do this previously and i will leave that linked down below but coming back to my initial point the rtx 2080 ti here in this kind of configuration in its stock form pulling 260 watts is definitely the limit of this custom loop with a 240mm radiator i don't think i'd be able to push the power any much further than that however the rtx 3090 doesn't pull 260 watts it supposedly pulls 350 watts so i guess that kind of illustrates my doubts for this system moving forward [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so there it is a complete tear down of my build done in less than 10 minutes which is always a surprisingly quick and easy thing to do for an itx build because the parts are always so small and easy to work with but now let's talk about the few upgrades that will be going into the system firstly we have the radiator now this build has been well overdue for a radiator swap as some of you might remember when i first built this system around six months ago the radiator that i used was a few millimeters too thick this meant that the top panel was actually bowing a little which was less than ideal the radiator that i was using previously was the 240 mil alpha cool st30 and i'll be swapping that for the 240 mil se classic from ek which comes in at 27 millimeters thick that's this radiator right here and paired with a couple of slim fans from noctua that means that we shouldn't get any bowing or top panel flexing like we had before then we have the monoblock which i've already installed onto the motherboard and that was pretty straightforward and i will note that this is mostly a visual upgrade for the system i'm sure that most of you are familiar with what a monoblock is but for those who aren't this is basically a cpu water block that additionally calls the vrm on your motherboard that's the circuitry that's responsible for the power delivery to the cpu the vrm on this build is far from overheating it's not causing me any problems at all but i am interested to see what the thermal improvement will be mostly i think that we can all just agree that a monoblock looks far better than a regular cpu water block and since there is one made for this board which is actually pretty rare i thought why not and then lastly i'll be replacing the handful of compression fittings in this build with the torque fittings from ek which i recently used in the cooler master nr200 custom loop [Music] [Music] [Music] and so now the build is complete with a fresh set of new fittings the right sized radiator and a new monoblock which looks absolutely sick but little did i know that the next several hours would be spent troubleshooting the significantly warmer cpu thermals in fact when i first launched blender just to do a quick thermal check the cpu immediately spiked to 86 degrees c now when cpu thermals spike like that immediately i knew at this point it was most likely a mounting issue with the monoblock so after a few remounting attempts and making sure that the thermal pads weren't preventing a solid mount i was able to get the thermals down into a safe range but this was still around 10 degrees warmer than before eventually after significantly more time troubleshooting i eventually just swapped back to the original alpha core water block that i had in there before and that immediately saw cpu thermals return back to normal so ultimately a big thumbs down for this monoblock i have no idea why cpu thermals were so much warmer i mean i didn't even have to run a long thermal test to kind of see a difference i noticed the difference as soon as i booted up blender and just kind of ran a normal stress test also a quick note before i actually rebuilt the system i wanted to see if a larger ddc pump would fit alongside the new rtx 3090 water box from ek in this specific case those new water blocks are just 230 millimeters long which means i regained quite a bit more room in this build and it turns out that yes a ddc pump will comfortably fit in here you'll just need to improvise your own mounting the pump that i've got powering the system at the moment is the dc lt 2600 from alphacool which has been absolutely awesome powers this loop no problem at all despite how small it is and it's pretty much the sole reason that i'm able to build a custom loop this compact important note though when i first installed this pump it was literally silent you really couldn't hear it at all but over time it has developed a very quiet noise still very quiet but at least it is now audible just something i thought i'd note if this build does see an rtx 2090 upgrade with one of those compact water blocks from ek then i'll likely upgrade to a larger pump as well so it's a big shame that the monoblock didn't work out for this build i was kind of really mainly excited to get this installed today because it is such a nicer looking block than really any cpu water block in my opinion but oh well sometimes things just turn out that way and it is at least nice to get the proper sized radiator finally installed into this system so as always a huge thanks for watching make sure you're subscribed if you haven't already for the upcoming rtx 30 series content just around the corner and i'll see you all in the next one
