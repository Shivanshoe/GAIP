so i understand the skepticism behind ultra lightweight gaming mice especially when we're getting into that 40 to 50 gram range like we are today does reducing weight that far actually make a difference is there a point where maybe a gaming mouse can be too light well after testing out the new starlight 12 phantom from final mouse and being able to finally buy one testing it out for the past few days uh i am convinced that this is the direction that the gaming mouse industry needs to go in and i mean you know this is the g pro super light here 60 to 62 grams i never thought i'd be using a gaming mouse that would kind of make this feel not heavy but like it actually has some decent weight to it this mouse comes in at about 50 grams so again about 10 to 12 grams lighter than the g pro super light and about 25 grams lighter than the razer viper ultimate there is a smaller model supposedly that one comes in closer to 45 grams but even what final mouse are calling the medium here is pushing things a bit on the smaller end for my own hand size so just keep that in mind despite it being cold medium it is roughly the size of a viper mini playing first person shooters with a 50 gram wireless gaming mouse just feels unlike anything else that i've ever used since there's less momentum and inertia of the mouse due to the lower weight i noticed the reactions and corrections in my aim specifically felt a little bit cleaner and more responsive it's a hard thing to explain but it feels like you're aiming a bit more naturally and less like you're interacting with a tool to perform that action for you hopefully that makes sense in fact it kind of reminds me of when i first tried the logitech g pro super light about a year ago i was just blown away by how free my aim felt didn't feel bogged down or like it was carrying any weight so taking a further 10 to 15 grams off of the super light it's kind of like experiencing that all over again now this all begs the question can you go to light and honestly after experiencing the starlight 12 i don't really think so sure you might find yourself a bit more jittery or unstable at first when trying a much lighter mouse but that's probably just exposing something that you need to work on that's where aim training can be super helpful to help train that smoothness and get used to that lower weight now the way that final mouse were able to make the starlight 12 so light in the first place was actually by making it out of metal so yeah this is a metal mouse although it doesn't really feel metal if i'm gonna be completely honest uh the complete outer shell is made out of magnesium except for the bottom which is plastic so try not to flex that part but making it out of magnesium which is the lightest structural metal it definitely shows this thing is really really strong while being really light at the same time honestly there is zero flex or creaking here if you are someone who does like death grip your mouse uh you won't have a problem with the build quality or anything like that which is really not something that you see from gaming mice once you get around that 50 gram mark taking a peek on the inside we can see quite a bit of reinforcing just to eliminate any flex of that outer shell and we can also see that the battery is positioned really far back that's to help offset the weight of the pcb and keep the balance of the mouse as centered as possible and yeah that's pretty much the end result something else that final mouse have really dialed in here is the feel and tensioning of the clicks so the main clicks they feel really light and crispy basically no pre-travel or wobble at all and these are using four-spinned klgm 8.0 switches all of the other buttons feel pretty great too not a whole lot to say here if i'm honest but here is a quick sound test something that final mouse do need to work on though is the input lag for those main clicks as we can see here we're about six milliseconds slower than what logitech are currently achieving for their fastest gaming mice which also use mechanical switches so hopefully final mouse can deploy an optional firmware update to reduce the debounce of those main clicks or maybe make it adjustable because for a top tier gaming mouse i did expect it to be towards the top so six milliseconds slower than the g pro super light as much as i want to sit here and tell you that is a meaningful difference and that's gonna make a huge impact on your gameplay the truth is it just will not especially for most of us who are not competing on the land and we're playing online shooters you already have so many variables there like ping tick rate and the input lag of your entire system still though i do think final mouse can do a little bit better here maybe implementing like a zero or one millisecond debounce that would probably get them pretty close to logitech levels and i really would like to see them do that now in terms of the shape basically if you took the viper mini made it a little bit longer and also smoothed out the hump at the back to make it a little bit flatter that's basically the size and shape that we're working with that means that compared to the g pro super light and the viper ultimate it is a noticeably smaller mouse that could be good or bad depending on what you're after i have medium to large sized hands and typically use a claw grip but i really had to claw grip this thing aggressively to get a proper and secure hold uh it was definitely an uncomfortable experience for the first couple of days but now it is feeling a little bit more usable so if anything this is just a reminder that the overall shape and feel of the mouse is way more important to you than anything of course lightweight specs are the primary talking point here but that honestly means nothing if you can't hold the mouse properly so i'm about three days in with the starlight 12 phantom here definitely getting a bit more used to it and again it brings back memories of when i first tried the g-pro super light despite the shape of that mouse not being anything impressive i basically forced myself to use it until it felt comfortable simply because the specs were so good and i knew the potential was there the starlight 12 phantom has me feeling kind of the same way having said all this there are some things here that i'm not a fan of firstly the honeycomb sides i definitely would have preferred these to be solid i feel like my grip would be a little bit more comfortable that way i might experiment with some grip tape down the road but we'll see how we go next is the engraving on the main buttons you do get used to it but sometimes it does feel a little bit weird so probably would have preferred these to be smooth lastly and most importantly is the way that final mouse do business uh with their hyped up drops that sell out in just a couple of minutes uh the one that i have here is one of 25 000 so it's good to see that they are at least becoming a bit more accessible and i really hope they continue to do more drops in the future because what they have created here is a really good product and it is a unique aiming experience if you really want to get your hands on a starlight 12 i'm not here to really say whether it is worth it for you or not i'm telling you it is a really good mouse and it is unlike anything else that i've used but i would not pay scalper prices for it i mean 400 to 500 on ebay i'm not sure any mouse is worth that much unless you're like a really competitive gamer so ideally i would just wait for final mouse to do another starlight 12 drop follow them on twitter and make sure you have the date dialed in hopefully you can actually get your hands on one but in terms of like what gaming mouse i would recommend instead of the starlight 12 i think the closest that you can get in terms of like size shape and overall feel would be this one right here this is the ponage ultra custom sim 2. so as you can see it's a very similar mouse here in terms of the overall shape and size the sim 2 is actually based off of the viper mini it is also wireless and has the same klgm8 switches although the starlight 12 does feel a little bit nicer in that regard honestly this is pretty much as close as you're going to get for overall feel but at the same time it is still a fair bit off i mean the starlight 12 medium is around 23 grams lighter than the sim 2 and that does leave you with a different aiming experience having that completely wireless feel that just had barely 50 grams i really hope that more companies figure out how to do something similar because it really is something but yeah that pretty much sums up my overall thoughts on the starlight 12 phantom from final mouse really happy that i was able to finally purchase one and share my experience with you guys hopefully you found it helpful it's looking like this or the new g303 is what i'll be using moving forward really want to get a lot more use out of the starlight 12 but i do have to grip it quite aggressively but we'll see what happens in the future otherwise a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
