so how much of a difference actually is there between a super budget gaming mouse that you can find on amazon for like 15 bucks and something top tier like a logitech g pro super light because i'll be honest uh so far my testing has showed that you know what maybe there isn't actually that much of a difference in terms of you know the different price categories when it comes to the input lag and the build quality and the kind of performance of different gaming bias even in those really different price categories you know performance is really quite similar for example if you take a look at the razer viper mini which you can buy these days for just 30 dollars it is actually one of the best gaming mice that i've tested when it comes to input lag and the shape the coding and the glides all of that stuff is really solid as well so how bad actually are those super cheap gaming mics that you can find on amazon for like 10 15 bucks well i was wrong they're actually really really bad a lot worse than i thought so let's start with this one here this is called the dare you victor i bought this one on amazon for 15 us and on the surface you know it's not a terrible looking mouse and it seems to be modeled after logitech's g403 it definitely feels very similar in the hand the cable unfortunately is one of the worst that i felt though super super thick very heavy not nice to play with at all speaking of which the total weight of this mouse is over 90 grams other than that the glides are kind of average but all of the switches are actually not bad in terms of overall feel the input lag on the switches though are pretty bad and so far they are the worst on this list averaging 28 milliseconds of total delay on the other hand the sensor input lag that is the total delay for mouse movement to be registered on screen isn't actually that bad and does outperform some of the well-known wireless contenders in terms of actually using the mouse in-game though this one actually did okay for a 15 mouse i mean the big things here are that it's heavy it has a thick cable and the sensor placement is a bit more forward than most mice that i've used but that just takes some time to get used to the next mouse that i've tried though is a lot more terrifying i mean this thing again straight from amazon 19 wireless pretty cool honeycomb shell nice and lightweight uh but the most horrifying thing here is how many people have actually bought this mouse this thing has over 421 reviews on amazon with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars so why is it so bad for 19 well take a look at this the sensor input lag is so bad here that i needed to extend the x-axis on my graph a lot more than i thought i'd ever have to 48 milliseconds of input lag for the sensor is just straight up a crime the click input lag is a little bit less atrocious but still pretty bad at over 28 milliseconds on average but what's really concerning here is the insane standard deviation that means that although we averaged 28 milliseconds for the click input delay there were more than a few readings here that exceeded 50 milliseconds of input delay total weight comes in at 96 grams which is a bit surprising seeing as this is advertised as a lightweight gaming mouse and even has a honeycomb shell and yeah compared to my 60 gram super light it feels like an absolute brick also the glides on this thing are super scratchy and will probably tear a hole right through your mouse pad within a week take a listen to this we haven't even gotten to the worst part about this mouse which is by far when it comes time to actually use this thing in game whenever you do any moderate to fast movement the sensor just freaks out and stops tracking so if you need to do a fast 180 or flick to an enemy you literally can't do that you'll just end up aiming at the sky or the floor for whatever reason i tried every single dpi setting to try and give this thing the best chance that it had and it was still an issue so honestly i have no idea how this mouse is even allowed to exist let alone how it has 4 out of 5 stars on amazon in fact the only way that you can get a kill with this mouse is if the enemy just somehow walks into your crosshair because aiming with this thing is absolutely horrible even playing with less mouse movement and only trying to use my wrist sometimes my cursor would just continue to move even though i wasn't moving the mouse at all so it's safe to say that the firmware and sensor on this thing are absolutely busted there is no way in help this thing is worth twenty dollars the next wireless option on this list is a little bit better though and that's the dare you gemini and i was really looking forward to testing this one out because of the wireless transmission in gaming level millisecond transmission brings stable signal as wide mice do please rest assured well actually no average sensor input lag comes in at 25 milliseconds which makes it a little slower than their own wired option and click latency is about the same for 40 us it's a lot better than the previous wireless trash that we just had a look at but it's starting to creep up towards some other well-known budget mice the shape here is actually okay pretty comfortable overall with some really nice side tapers and to be honest it fits my hand size and group preference pretty well for that reason it was actually not that bad to game with still hitting some nice one taps here and there buttons feel okay and same with the glides on the bottom there's no getting past the fact that this thing is heavy af though by today's standards total weight comes in at 105 grams so if you play on a low sensitivity like myself the sheer amount of momentum and inertia when flicking the mouse it really makes me appreciate the ultra lightweight mice that we have today nothing could have prepared me for this next absolute abomination though from version tech just have a listen to this for a grand total of nine dollars though on amazon i'm not really sure what i expected but damn this thing is atrocious i also really like how they paracorded the cable to make it look like a nice lightweight flexible cable but in reality this thing is stiff af i mean you could probably go rock climbing with this thing and you might even be 100 safe it really feels that strong and rigid it also has the spongiest side buttons that i've ever seen on a gaming mouse today i mean i'm not even sure how this amount of pre-travel is even possible but hey here it is the main mouse buttons though are not too bad the input lag of the switches though are absolutely horrendous almost 40 milliseconds on average which is by far the worst result that i've seen so this company is likely using some super cheap mechanical switches paired with a d-bounce time of like 30 milliseconds that way they don't have to deal with any units that get sent back for double clicking the sensor input lag is pretty terrible as well over 30 milliseconds here on average with a standard deviation which is huge it's fair to say that the sensor and firmware that's being used here are absolute garbage but it gets worse just like the xyu lang x3 wireless that we tested earlier here during any fast mouse movement the sensor will simply just stop tracking the effect here is a little bit different though the mcu on this mouse won't try and guess where you want to aim and point you immediately at the sky or the floor although eventually that's where you will end up aiming mostly though you will just not move in the direction that you had planned this is both frustrating and incredibly hilarious at the same time because i have never seen anything this bad it's like the sensor just gets overloaded with information and has a complete mental breakdown the only way to play with this thing is with a really slow mouse movement and with wrist aiming only again i'm just really amazed how this thing even exists on the market because let's face it it is completely broken this one though is really interesting because it's one that you guys actually recommended for me to check out and it's called the deluxe m800 this one is 40 on amazon wireless and it's based off of the viper mini although it is a little bit bigger this one actually has a paw 3335 sensor so since it's based off of the viper mini just a little bit bigger it does actually feel like a wireless viper mini that is to say it feels really good in the hand and for me i actually played okay with it buttons feel good too and the glides are ptfe so a bit better than average and for a lot of people this is going to be a pretty comfortable fit part of that is because the total weight comes in at just 72 grams which is really impressive for a non-honeycomb wireless mouse in 2021. sensor input lag results are about average and what you'd expect for a mid-range wireless gaming mouse in 2021 the click latency though is a lot worse than i was expecting and about 16 milliseconds slower than the viper mini that it's modeled after i'm not sure what switches this mouse is using and as far as i can see you can't lower the debounce delay and that is a real shame because otherwise it does seem like an okay budget wireless mouse there is something up with the sensor as well it doesn't feel as flawless as a lot of the top tier gaming mice out there sometimes i felt like my sensitivity was changing and overall it felt a little bit inconsistent so there it is a clear picture of what really separates the you know name brand gaming mice that we frequently review on the channel to the random no name you know really budget gaming mice that you might find on amazon or ebay yeah there is quite a big difference honestly i was pretty surprised by how straight up unusable some of these gaming mice were they likely appeal to really young kids who really don't know any better and just see a cheap gaming mice with cool lighting effects and for those kids i feel very very sorry now if you are in the market for a cheap gaming mouse 30 dollars is about as low as i'd recommend going with really solid options out there like the logitech g203 the razer viper mini and with a bit more cache you can get something wireless like the g305 so hopefully this one was as fun for you as it was for me and down below in the description i will leave some links to gaming mice that i actually do recommend as always guys a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
