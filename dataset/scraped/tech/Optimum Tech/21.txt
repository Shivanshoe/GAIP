so liam lee and the creator of the den a4 sfx they got together and created this this is the new den a4 h2o we had a look at the prototype a few months ago some of you might remember but this right here is the finished model and at about 11 liters in total volume you would be really surprised by how uncompromising this pc case actually is and to be honest i think this is about as small as you can make a pc case today while still retaining the full hardware compatibility and thermal performance of modern high-end components we're talking huge three-slot graphics cards and support for 240 mil liquid coolers all in a pc case this small and i think the timing here is absolutely perfect there is no other case right now that can fit these components in this size the nk someone is a little bit bigger and the form t1 is a little bit smaller but both are just unavailable the new a4 h2o fits right in between those two legendary itx cases both in terms of size and hardware compatibility but it's quite a bit cheaper and will actually be available to buy visually as well it can definitely sit beside those two highly regarded pc cases the clean boxy simple exterior feels like the tribute to small form factor that this case aims to be there's no modern trends like tempered glass or mesh just a nice compact optimized pc case i will say though that the new a4 h2o is a little rougher around the edges compared to what i'm used to seeing from lien lee and dan case it's still a premium aluminium construction don't get me wrong but the tolerances and fitment could be a little bit better then on the inside honestly nothing too crazy it's your typical sandwich layout with your motherboard and power supply on one side and your gpu on the other and then a 240ml liquid cooler up top we've seen this layout done over and over again and honestly it's nothing too worth you know going in depth on however i will say the a4 h2o gets pretty much perfect scoring in my books you know in regards to how much volume is divided up for each compartment when you are really pushing the limits of this case you can appreciate how well everything just fits together it just seems to give you the perfect amount of tolerance and breathing room for each side without giving too much extra so then how hard is it to actually build in so to get things started here we have these four thumb screws at the back of the case now i will admit they do not look the best uh they are also kind of pointless as you're about to see pretty easy to remove though you've just got two for each side panel but then take a look at this we're using the same kind of push pin mounting mechanism as a lot of other leanly cases but man these are just so stiff for whatever reason i have no idea why but if you just want to run the case without those thumb screws on the back in my opinion it does look a lot cleaner uh that is totally doable because as you can see the side panels are very very locked in then on the interior of the case you'll find all of your cables of course and then zip tied to that you'll find your screws for your motherboard your power supply uh your ssds and uh also two zip ties which is a bit of an odd choice to include only two zip ties but hey maybe those will come in handy so this is actually my first time working with the case so i do apologize if it is not as fluid as some of my other builds but the first thing that is recommended to install here and man these push pins are really just unnecessarily strong the first thing that we're going to install here is our 240 mil liquid cooler now then a4 h2o as the name suggests this is a liquid-cooling focused case this is not a case that you want to be uh air cooling in my opinion because you only have about 55 mils of clearance for the pump block or the cpu cooler so let's go ahead and mount the liquid cooler the first thing that is recommended to do here is remove the power supply bracket thankfully these screws are not too hard to remove you've got two at the top there and another two at the bottom and this should just be able to be removed yep that's nice and easy put that to the side and then as you can probably tell this compartment up here is where our liquid cooler is going to be installed so it's going to be a top mounted configuration and we're going to have the air pulling up through the case so we're going to have air coming through the side panels and then exhausting up the top we have 240 mils of clearance i guess you could say a 240 mil aio will fit up there and then in terms of like the thickness clearance we have 55 mils of thickness to play with so that means a 30 mil thick rad and 25 mil or standard thickness fans so i'm guessing the next step is to remove this radiator bracket here which sits on the top of the case so we're going to mount our liquid cooler to this and then drop it into the top of the case the specific liquid cooler that i've gone with here is the ekaio basic 240 mil uh no real specific reason other than i know it looks super clean i know it fits in this case no problem uh the nzxc kraken series will fit as well and yeah also just kind of wanted to try something a little bit different i know the ek aio is a pretty popular option in small form factor itx cases and just cases in general the main point being is that we are under that pump block height limit we do have flexible tubing as well so that's going to be nice and easy to route within the case and the physical size of the radiator itself too that's not going to be a problem in this case also kind of cool to see that ek do include a fan splitter for their aios that's not something that's included with all of the liquid coolers out there the next thing that we're going to do is mount our fans of course the radiator bracket which we have off to the side here is going to go on the other side so we will have to completely mount the fans and then we'll take a look at what that looks like all right pretty straightforward fans are mounted next up is to mount the radiator bracket and i'm just going to go ahead and install the aio pretty much dead center on the radiator bracket i'm guessing that's going to be fine sometimes with cases you'll need to kind of install it a little bit offset on one side but it looks like this should be fine we'll see in a moment and this should be as easy as just dropping this in now that should just drop nicely in so yeah really really satisfying fitment there you just drop the radiator in and it just sits there quite nicely and then yeah to finish that off we basically just have the four radiator bracket screws so just pushing these cables off to the side here we'll be dealing with those in a moment one thing that i do actually like about this case is how clean this radiator installation and fan installation is because usually this top section is exposed but dan and lee lee have gone for the option of just having this kind of really clean guard here not sure if that has any impact or improvement when it comes to thermals but at least when it comes to the visuals of the case it does make it look a whole lot cleaner but just putting the pump block off to the side there because the next thing that we need to do is install our motherboard now not really worth going over too much you know what i'm using here because everyone is going to be different and to be honest it doesn't matter too much but i will note the stuff that does matter so first off the ram dims you don't want to go with anything too tall i think i've gone with pretty much the tallest dims that you can install possibly in this case and the reason for that is because you do need to actually route the aio tubes over the ram dimms so we will see how these fair up i might actually swap these out for something that's a little bit more low profile but again we'll see how these go and the next kind of really important thing is what kind of cpu you go with because obviously an itx case we are limited with the amount of airflow that we have we're also limited with the cpu cooler now 240mm liquid cooler relatively powerful but with cpus like the 12 900k kind of being possible to install here that is not something that i would recommend so here we have the 12700k i do believe that's going to be the limit here but again we will see how that turns out so just moving those cables out of the way also note the pcie riser cable down the bottom there definitely don't want to like squish that so just make sure that there's room for that too and just dropping the motherboard in is actually pretty easy a little bit easier than i was expecting and i've just flipped the case here so you can see what i'm doing a little bit better but basically we're just securing the motherboard to the case and the motherboard screws will be the smallest screws that you'll find in the little packet the bottom left hand screw is actually almost impossible to tighten due to the huge m.2 heatsink and due to the panel guards you can't actually get the screwdriver in it's not actually too much of a problem because the motherboard is quite secure in there but yeah just note that only three out of the four screws are actually possible to install next order of business will be that pcie riser cable which is you know conveniently already pre-bent and sitting there so just line that up and then push it in you should hear a nice satisfying click next order of business is mounting our pump block to our cpu and in terms of tube routing you know i've had a quick look at it mounting it like this and having the tubes route on this side of the motherboard and also having the tubing go kind of above the motherboard that kind of looks like the most uh sensible way to do things but unfortunately i'm not sure if you guys can see this the pump leads are actually hitting the vrm heatsink and this is one of the issues that i brought up in my recent kind of 12 900k itx problem video is that the clear out zone is just kind of shrinking and shrinking and shrinking on the z690i motherboards which is really a shame and i'm just gonna try again see if i can get this secured but it just doesn't look like that's gonna happen unfortunately that would have been a really clean tube rounding option uh it might be an option for other motherboards out there but at least on the z690i aorus ultra and definitely on the z690i unifi from msi that tube riding with the leads on the left side of the board is just not going to happen so let's now try with the tubes on the right side of the board and it does look like that is possible but we are pushing on the ram dims here which i you know definitely do not like the tube routing is also not as clean kind of kinks around the motherboard dimms and yeah i'm definitely not liking how i'm pushing on these ram dims here i don't know if the camera is picking that up hopefully we don't have any like boot or compatibility issues there but yeah this is literally the only way to mount this ai oh with this motherboard all right so skipping ahead a little bit i've installed all of the motherboard cables pretty straightforward and honestly pretty boring to show on video but there we have the usbc cable the usb 3.0 cable i've connected all of the fans i've used the fan splitter that's kindly provided by ek and i've plugged in our top radiator fans as well as kind of you know pre-routed this tubing here for our next step which is installing the power supply so of course for this step we'll need our power supply bracket which is the first bracket that we removed in the beginning we will of course need our power supply screws which we'll find in the small packet and the power supply itself now a word of warning here this case does support sfx l units which basically means same sort of footprint that we have here this is an sfx unit but it is quite a bit longer and i really don't think that is the way to go here in sfx cases i mean when you have an option like this this is the sf 750 from corsair 750 watts 80 plus platinum rated with any single gpu configuration that you're going to install in this case you are just not reaching the output of what this thing can handle i mean even if you have 12 900k rtx 3090 running you know full load at the same time you're probably getting close to what this thing can handle but i mean that is really a very rare use case so i think you know all things considered trying to be as compact as possible while being quiet and also you know having a sensible power rating sf750 is kind of what i'm recommending here and then in terms of installation pretty straightforward the fan is going to kind of face this perforated side here and then we're just going to go ahead and screw those four screws in at the top next thing you want to do is make sure the power supply is of course turned on because that's going to be almost impossible to reach once the build is actually fully put together and then also plug in that power supply cable and one thing that i'm definitely noticing here is how difficult it is you know to properly route these aio tubes since the only way that we could route ours was on the right side of the motherboard and not kind of up and over you know we do have quite a lot of excess tubing here which is you know let's take a look it's probably going to be a bit difficult to work with and at this point we should also be dealing with our power supply cables those are going to go that way gpu cables are going to go through and it looks like that power supply is now seated in the correct position but the only thing now is i don't know if graphics card installation is going to be a pain with that kind of tube access on the other side we'll take a look in just a second so just securing this bracket is a little bit more difficult than it needs to be because we are working with a bit of extra force next thing that we're going to do is plug in our power supply cables which is actually pretty straightforward motherboard 24 pin goes there and the cpu8 pin can actually route down the bottom here and then up to the left and then you could potentially use some zip ties to tidy this up make it look a little bit neater but i think all things considered this actually looks quite clean more importantly though let's take a look at what's going on on the flip side because like i said we do have that excess tubing hopefully that doesn't get in the way as we can see it kind of is so that is quite a problem definitely want to make sure that we clear that up so yeah not super happy with how those cables are routed up the top here i do think that they are going to be hitting those fans and just to show you how yeah tightly packed everything is here it is a pain just to get this power supply out all right so that seems to be sitting a little bit more comfortable in there definitely don't want to have those tubes or those fan cables you know touching those radiator fans that's going to be a bit of a pain and the next order of business is installing how graphics card now i actually think this is going to be pretty difficult because the graphics card that we're going with here is pretty much the biggest that you can install in this case which is the rog strix so in terms of what we're working with here you can install up to a three slot graphics card up to 322 millimeters in length i believe which is pretty much exactly what the rog strix is so to make life a little bit easier it's advised to go ahead and remove this bottom bracket that way you can kind of reach in from all angles here and we're also going to be removing the front panel as well so first things first you're going to release this little tab here for the pcie riser cable slot and honestly the first thing i'm probably going to do here is plug in the power cables for the gpu because i think this is going to be pretty hard to access once we actually get the card installed so that's it power cables are installed and yeah this is a huge graphics card but i guess the test here is just to see if this thing will actually fit honestly i have my doubts looking at it it is just super super massive but the next thing that we're going to do here is remove the pci expansion slots and now we have probably the craziest part of this entire build which is actually fitting this graphics card in here which yeah i do have my doubts honestly looking at it how am i actually gonna even get this in here do we feed it through the front i think that might be the best option all right maybe plugging in the power cables was a bad idea let's leave the power cables for the end so the dna for h2o has this big kind of cutout at the front which is i guess there so that you can feed the graphics card through but let's see how usable this actually is all right i can't believe this is actually looking like it's working now obviously if you're working with a much smaller graphics card you're not gonna have this kind of problem but this is actually looking like it might work again the dimensions say that this card will fit but it is really up against the upper limits of what we can install here and it is actually looking like it's gonna fit and we do actually have fitment wow that is actually kind of mind-blowing that that fits so yeah the card is pretty much fully seated at this point i've locked the pcie riser cable tab at the bottom now we just have to screw it in at the back here and then plug in our cables and now plugging in these pcie power cables for the gpu should be no problem at all since we can you know remove that bottom panel and have full access to the bottom so there we go power cables are installed actually not too difficult since we have that big opening at the bottom here and that we can actually remove that panel uh that will be going on next but yeah actually not too difficult considering what we just did i mean the rg strix is a freaking huge graphics card and the fitment here is just absolutely crazy and to give you an idea what the fitment looks like here i mean this front panel cutout was an absolute lifesaver if this front panel cutout wasn't here then yeah there is just no way that you're installing a graphics card this big so there's another look at the fitment uh let's get the panels on and honestly just see how this thing performs let's start with the cpu where we were pretty much spot on with the 12700k being the limit of what you can install here now i haven't done any under vaulting or anything like that and we're running our radiator fans at around 1300 rpm with the 12 700 k at full load pulling 190 watts plus in cinebench we do actually hit the thermal limit of 100 degrees c on a couple of those performance cpu cores blender is a bit more tolerating the i7 here pulled slightly less power overall but things are still getting pretty toasty so a small undervolt in the bios will help things a little bit for the cpu here as well as a faster fan speed i would say that the 12700k is still actually fine here for most workloads but definitely do not bother with the i9 12 900k if that's a chip that you do want to take full advantage of you are much better off with the meshlicious or the nr200p max the gpu on the other hand now that's where i was pretty impressed the gpu that we've installed here is the rx 6700xt rog strix which tops out at around 250 watts and as we can see here that has absolutely no problem staying cool at all although i will say fan speed was a little bit louder and faster than i'd like by default so dropping that down to a much quieter 1200 rpm or so we are still able to maintain very reasonable gpu temps so i'd say looking at this an rtx 3080 with a small undervolt would be probably about as far as i'd want to push this case myself while still maintaining comfortable noise levels and then i would definitely still recommend going with a beefy cooler design like the rog strix now as a point of reference when we drop in the rtx 2070 super founders edition and compare that to the rest of our test data performance is pretty good overall it's two degrees better than the form t1 when both cases are running a top mounted 240mm aio and only a few degrees warmer than one of the highest airflow mid towers that you can buy at the moment all in all it's about the kind of gpu thermals that you'd expect coming from a dan case of this size and all of the cases that it's beaten by on this list are in fact larger cases so do keep that in mind as for current founders edition cards like the rtx 3080 that would also be a good pairing here for the a4 h2o but you would need to install the included standoffs for the riser cable you'd pretty much end up there with a similar airflow setup as we've tested in the form t1 and that does perform okay those standoffs weren't included with this review unit however so that's not something that i can test it just yet so overall pretty impressed and i would say that this is one of the best itx cases that you can buy at the moment alongside the meshlicious and the nr200p max those are slightly bigger cases in some people's eyes they are you know considerably larger cases that this is as small as i would recommend going if you're also considering you know the sizes and the thermal constraints of modern hardware so if you're considering a three slot gpu if you're considering an i7 this is about as small as i would recommend going i would especially recommend this case if you're not going super crazy with your components so 12600k rtx 3070 that would run pretty much perfect here in my opinion and up to a 30 80 6800 xt would also be fine but there you definitely want to go with a big cooler design and maybe even consider under vaulting once we start getting into the i9 builds the 3080tis 3090s and stuff like that that's where it definitely does make sense to go a little bit bigger but otherwise this smaller form factor is totally viable most of all i'm just kind of personally happy i guess to see an itx pc case come out that is truly itx and truly compact but at the same time it's really attacking that challenge of big graphics cards and decently powered cpus as well like i said in the intro this is about as small as you can make a pc case today while you know not compromising on any of those things which is really really great to see so i will leave a link down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
