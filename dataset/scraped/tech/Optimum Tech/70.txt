all right so who remembers this pc build right here this is the phanteks evolve shift that i built for my little brother about a year and a half ago it has an rtx 2060 super a ryzen 5 3600 and honestly he has been using it every day ever since and he has no complaints today though we will be doing a pretty beefy upgrade to this system to help him transition from a 1080p to a 1440p gaming monitor and i thought i'd share that upgrade process with you guys and of course we are still sticking with the itx form factor because he does enjoy the small footprint of his current build but his next build will be a lot denser and way more powerful so to quickly refresh this build it uses a ryzen 5 3600 32 gigabytes of 3200 megahertz cl 14 memory one terabyte of m.2 nvme storage and sf600 platinum for the power supply and rtx 2060 super for the gpu and all of that is housed inside the original fantax evolve shift mesh so he's been using this daily for a 1080p gaming machine and he currently has a dual monitor setup with his main monitor being the 1080p 240hz alienware that i used to use as my daily driver and i guess the main inspiration for this whole build upgrade was that i had planned to give him the lg 27 gp850 that i recently reviewed however this current build with an rtx 2060 super just isn't quite up to speed to get the full use out of that display that monitor uses a 27 inch 1440p 180 hertz ips panel and honestly it is suited towards his current game library a bit better than the 1080p 240hz that he's currently using if you're interested in the full review of that monitor i will leave it linked down below now i've already done a bios update for the motherboard so that we can just drop in the new cpu upgrade for him but before we talk about the upgrades any further let's just give this thing a quick clean because this thing is incredibly dirty and just like any teenagers gaming pc i don't think this thing has ever been cleaned once so let's sort that out real quickly because this thing is absolutely filthy and then we'll talk about the upgrades [Music] all right so just as i expected this pc was pretty dirty uh lots and lots of dust especially in the bottom radiator which was running a push-pull setup and it even looked partially clogged now though let's talk about the new parts that are going in here so first of all the cpu where we're going from the ryzen 5 3600 to the ryzen 9 5900x literally doubling the core count here from 6 to 12 and also upgrading to the seven nanometer 5000 series the 5900x is actually what i'm using in my own production system at the moment and i can see this being a cpu that will outlive many gpu upgrades for him in the future speaking of which we'll be upgrading him from the rtx 2060 super which has served him very well up to the rtx 3080. this should yield around an 80 increase at least in gaming performance at 1440p which means that hitting high frame rates should be absolutely no problem and honestly that value is likely closer to 90 to 100 when also factoring in the cpu upgrade as well the specific card that we're going with is the factory overclocked gaming x trio from msi it's two and a half slots a little over 320 mils in length and this is actually the perfect fit for the case that we'll be switching over to and that is the subt meshlicious a 14 and a half liter itx enclosure that is smaller than his current evolv shift but can fit bigger graphics cards much bigger radiators and has significantly better airflow and the i o is easier to access also having four mesh panels should result in some really good thermal performance and airflow too and that is definitely a must when running an rtx 3080. i will also note that we will be using the version with the pcie 4.0 riser cable since both our motherboard and gpu are running at 4.0 by default and otherwise with a 3.0 cable we would encounter some compatibility issues now despite upgrading all of these parts we will be keeping some of his current hardware his motherboard for example fits perfectly fine in this particular build and that's the same for his storage and ram we're also reusing his power supply which is the 600 watt 80 plus platinum from corsair and despite what you might think this will handle the ryzen 5900x and rtx 3080 perfectly fine so let's tear down the evolve shift and get this new build up and running [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so here it is the finished build and having built in this case a couple of times previously luckily it wasn't too much of a hassle by far the most challenging aspect of this build was cable management most notably keeping all of the cables away from the fan blades on the radiator but after securing a few zip ties that's no longer a problem and cable management overall is kind of average in the meshlicious you're not left with a ton of options here especially with that big 24 pin motherboard cable but at least with the mesh side panels on it does help disguise and diffuse a lot of that interior clutter otherwise though i think this build looks absolutely sick especially the graphics card chamber which just looks super super clean now i didn't want to spend too long testing this build out because he is currently without a pc so i do want to get this over to him as soon as possible but overall thermals are looking pretty solid right about where i expected we're getting really solid boost clocks out of that rtx 3080 with a pretty comfortable fan speed too and as i always typically recommend for these power hungry gpus setting an undervolt can be really effective in reducing thermals noise levels and power so here we've set a pretty conservative undervolt in msi afterburner full guide on how to do this down below but here we've set 1920 megahertz at 900 millivolts which is the clock speed that the gpu is boosting to anyway so we don't lose any performance what we do lower though is the power consumption and also the thermals and fan speeds which do go down a nice chunk in return in the end though here's how the system sounds at full gaming load so overall super super happy with the performance that we're getting here and i think my brother is going to be absolutely blown away as well it's a huge step up from what he was using before and i think paired with his new monitor as well it's just going to be an absolute treat for him and in a way i think this build will feel pretty familiar to him because this build and his previous build they're not too dissimilar both are vertical mesh itx enclosures but the performance that he's going to get is just truly on a different level so if you guys are interested in the parts that went into this i will leave them linked down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
