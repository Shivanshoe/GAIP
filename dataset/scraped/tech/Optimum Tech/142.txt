[Music] today it is finally time to check out amd's rx 6800 xt which is their answer to nvidia's rtx 3080 and man does this thing pack a punch amd are claiming that this card is faster than the 3080 while pulling a bit less power and costing 50 less on paper this thing sounds like the perfect rtx 3080 killer and there's only one thing left to do at this point and that's to see if that's actually the case now most of you have probably studied the spec sheet inside and out by this point but for those of you who haven't here's what we're working with the 6800 xt comes packed with 72 compute units on amd's new 7 nanometer rd and a2 architecture and a whopping 16 gigabytes of gddr6 memory it's the middle child in the family for now and starting at 649 us dollars this is definitely positioned as an enthusiast-class gaming gpu and we've already taken a good look at amd's new cooler design in our previous video and which cases this will and won't fit in and later on we'll take a look at the therma and noise performance as well for now though let's dive right into the benchmarks let's start off with red dead redemption 2 a very popular title running the vulcan api which amd gpus have historically played really well with and this game is absolutely no exception not only is the average fps clearly beating the rtx 3080 here but the frame rate stability was the real standout when we take a look at the graphs we can see exactly what that looks like at 1440p the 6800 xt is around three percent faster when it comes to the average frame rate but a massive 53 percent faster when it comes to the slowest one percent of frame rate the gaming experience delivered here would also be better than the 30 90. bumping the resolution up to 4k those 1 percent lows are still extremely strong but the 3080 now takes the lead on average by over 11 look out for this trend in the future graphs as well generally the 6800 xt does a bit better at 1440p than 4k whereas it's the reverse for the 3080 which does better relatively at 4k in shadow of the tomb raider the 6800 xt and 3080 were extremely close the rtx 3080 leads here by a few fps on average but it's also the slightly more expensive card and no your eyes aren't playing tricks on you there are clear visual differences between the amd and nvidia gpus with nvidia opting for a more contrasty image with more saturation all of this footage by the way has been recorded completely externally with the same recorder at 4k there's a mere two percent performance difference between the two on average and less than one percent for the lowest one percent of frame rate when we switch to 1440p the 6800 xt just edges out on average but this time it's the nvidia card that has the slight lead when it comes to frame rate stability in star wars jedi fallen order this was one of the bigger margins that we see in favor for the rtx 3080 at 1440p we see a six percent lead on average here for the nvidia gpu but when we switch to 4k that lead grows to 25 this isn't the most optimized of games but that is definitely what i'd call a night and day difference but then we have death stranding running at 4k and here the 6800 xt beats the 3080 by a few percent so it's clear at this point that the results are mixed depending on which game you're playing and at what resolution here the gaming experience would be about the same between the two with the 6800 xt leading by 4 on average as we've seen though this gpu does a lot better at 1440p and there it can almost deliver performance on par with the rtx 3090 for a 650 gpu the price to performance here is simply outstanding but then the results flip back around rainbow six running the vulcan api has the rtx 3080 ahead by seven percent at 4k but the two are much closer at 1440p lowest one percent of frame rate is eight percent faster here for the 3080 but with both cards north of 250 frames per second here the gaming experience would be virtually identical between them when it comes to battlefield v the rx 6800 xt dominated this game and even at 4k managed to outpace the rtx 3080 dropping the resolution to 1440p average frame rate is about tied here with nvidia's 1500 rtx 3090 and you might have noticed at this point that i've staggered the order of the games depending on whether the 6800 xt or 3080 has the lead that is very deliberate because that's basically how this story plays out between these two gpus for most titles in the end it really is going to depend on which games you're playing for now though let's shift our discussion to ray tracing amd's rdna 2 architecture is the first to feature ray tracing support in games that have it implemented and as we know this has been a serious investment on nvidia's behalf so here we're looking at control running with the xt and the 3080 at 1440p without raytracing enabled and the 3080 leads here on average by just under 5 when we enable ray tracing on both gpus it's clear which of these cards has dedicated ray tracing silicon both cards take a pretty big frame rate hit but it's the 30 80 which is almost 50 percent faster in the end of course there are limited titles with decent ray tracing support but it's definitely something that you'll want to keep in mind especially for future games like cyberpunk 2077 furthermore nvidia's secret weapon dlss 2.0 this allows the rtx 3080 to render the game at a lower resolution then upscale it using deep learning with it enabled the 3080 gets a 60 frame rate boost with no visual downgrade and you still have those ray trace reflections f1 2020 is another title where nvidia's dlss is definitely worth enabling offering a 17 frame rate boost over the stock rtx 3080 performance able to overtake both the 6800 xt and even the stock rtx 3090 here to be fair amd have the slightly better outright gpu rasterization performance here but they really do need to come up with their own version of dlss and quick at the moment the supported games are slim but the list is rapidly growing and the performance difference here with it enabled is simply huge in fact amd's outright gpu performance is more impressive when we consider how little power the 6800 xt actually pulls at full load total system power at the wall was measured at just 424 watts that's over 50 watts less than the rtx 3080. this is even more impressive in the context of gpu clock speeds which were the fastest that i've seen on any gpu that i've reviewed higher clock speeds require higher voltages to stabilize which in turn means higher power consumption so in terms of performance per watt the 6800 xt is absolutely stomping the rtx 3080. thermals were also very well managed the gpu temp stabilized at around 75 degrees c on an open test bench with a room ambient of 22c with the gpu hotspot safely sitting at around 95c fan speed was also very low at just 1250 rpm here's an idea of what that sounded like finally let's close off with some production workloads in blender we're limited to using opencl as opposed to cuda on nvidia gpus and that means that render times are around 30 slower than the rtx 3080 in this scene however when we bump up the resolution and sample count the 6800 xt is now 42 percent slower then it only gets worse from there when we factor in nvidia's more optimized optics renderer the 6800 xt will take 130 percent longer than the rtx 3080. when it comes to v-ray as far as i know this does support opencl but the 6800 xt just couldn't be found on this system so if you do use your system for 3d art i'd say you'd be better off with a 3080 this also includes renderers like octane and redshift which only work exclusively with nvidia gpus but there is really good news when it comes to video editing just as you can encode videos with the h.265 encoder on nvidia gpus you can do the same with the 6800 xt and it's actually pretty damn fast in fact i found it to be on par with the rtx 1390 when it came to export times here which is super impressive video stabilization time was a bit slower though so your actual workflow might be a little bit slower depending on the program and effects that you're using and i won't forget to mention that the 6800 xt has a huge 16 gigabytes of video memory to play with that does give it a lot more headroom when it comes to higher resolution footage over the 30 80. but here's where things don't look so great if you're someone who enjoys recording gameplay and capturing highlights and replays you'll be making your life a lot easier with an nvidia gpu amd's radeon relive has been a huge gamble depending on which card you're using it with and the implementation for the 6800 xt is simply broken even just enabling the instant replay functionality in the background causes huge repeated stutters at fixed intervals in games and when you go back and watch one of those replays the file is somehow corrupted and i'd love to say that this would be fixed in a future driver update but it never is i still see issues like this even today with the 5700 xt's amd's smart access memory is something that i've skipped for this review but it is something that i plan to dedicate a full video on this allows ryzen 5000 series cpus to share the memory on radeon 6000 gpus when plugged into a 500 series motherboard for a slight performance boost amd's own claims here are mixed but the average claimed performance gain seems around five percent so then rtx 3080 or the new rx 6800 xt well i think it's clear that these two gpus when it comes to gaming performance are fairly evenly matched the rtx 3080 is generally better at 4k although not exclusively and the 6800xt seems like the better pick for 1440p gamers if you are just a casual gamer that wants a big upgrade in frame rate then your best bet is probably just to choose the most affordable one in your region which is most likely the 6800 xt or the one that's simply in stock ultimately it is the radeon 6800 xt that's the best choice when it comes to gaming performance for the money and also gaming performance per watt but i can't help but feel that with the rtx 3080 you are actually getting your money's worth for that extra 50 dollars you will be able to record your games with nvidia's shadow play boost your frame rate by a significant amount with dlss in a few titles you'll also be able to stream your games with their onboard envence encoder and also have cuda support in production workloads these aren't fluff features some users would easily consider these to be deal breakers so if you can't live without those features then it's the rtx 3080 if not then more power to you save the 50 and go with the 6800 xt you are getting a seriously impressive gpu here amd's rdna 2 architecture is absolutely no joke especially with the performance per watt that was seriously surprising to see i will have both of these linked down below so you can check pricing and availability in your region as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
