so here it is nvidia's rtx 3080 the first gpu to launch amongst their new generation of ampere gpus and with it one of the biggest generational leaps in performance that i've seen if you're in the market for a high-end gpu you are in luck because this thing absolutely shreds this is the first video among many for nvidia's new rtx 30 series where we'll be taking a look at rtx 3080 gaming performance rendering performance and how well it handles specific operations like ray tracing and dlss and of course we will be taking a look at how much power this thing pulls and what kind of thermal performance you can expect as well so let's take a look now most of you are probably familiar with what's going on here with the rtx 3080 on paper after all there has been a ton of hype over this new series and rightfully so but for those who aren't familiar with what's going on here let's quickly breeze over the specs and how they compare to last generation the new 3080 is built on a smaller 8 nanometer manufacturing process and features some big architectural changes programmable shaders on ampere can now do two shader calculations per clock as opposed to one on turing the new rt cores have double the ray triangle intersection throughput and the new tensor cores can automatically identify lower weight edges within a deep network the 3080 is also the first gpu to use the new high speed gddr6x memory from micron of which it has 10 gigabytes of it also has a streaming multi-processor account closer to the rtx 2080 ti and a listed board power of 320 watts that's the same as last generation's titan rtx now the specific card that i have on hand for testing today is the asus tough oc and this card was absolutely brilliant handled all of the testing no problem at all and was really quiet while doing so and we'll take a look at thermals and power consumption in just a few moments i also have this absolute mammoth which is the gaming x trio from msi which actually arrived around 20 minutes ago there will be a dedicated review for this one tomorrow now this is also the same reason that this review is going up 24 hours later than all of the founders edition reviews because i was not sampled from a founder's edition card from nvidia so that's really unfortunate but it seems like they were just really strapped for cards and samples when it came to the anz region and yeah we were not sampled with a card i am doing my best to try and buy one over here but that is not looking so great so far so i do have to give a huge thanks to both asus and msi for organizing some aftermarket cards for me especially asus who were able to organize a card very quickly and basically made this performance review possible i can also say that the tough oc model they sent over was exceptionally good this card does have a factory overclock over the founders edition though as well as a 20 watt higher tdp bringing the total board power on paper to 340 watts overall an excellent looking card with a clean design and the fans don't begin spinning until the gpu temp exceeds 55 degrees c all of the testing that you're about to see is fresh testing from the ground up with the latest drivers available and windows version 2004 the test bench uses an intel i9 10900k locked to 5.1 gigahertz that's plugged into the asus z490 maximus 12 hero along with 32 gigabytes of ultra high speed memory from g skill and that's clocked at 4 000 megahertz and cl 15. so with this set of hardware we're essentially opening up the gates for as much gpu performance as we can and that is especially important for the rtx 3080 now in addition to the usual bar charts which we'll get to in just a moment i also thought it would be useful just to show the live frame rate performance of the 3080 alongside some other gpus i think this paints the bigger picture of performance and you can also see things that you might not see in a static graph also all of this footage was recorded with an external recorder so there's no performance penalty of the recording itself that you'd get from something like shadow play or obs so here specifically we're looking at the generational improvement between the gtx 1080 the rtx 2080 and the new rtx 3080 and it's clear the 3080 is a big big leap ahead it's just in a completely different league now we're running a fairly demanding set of quality settings here the game is near max down at 1440p and that's why some of these gpus are struggling so hard i will likely lower these settings to something more realistic for our rtx 3090 review but even when we compare it to the 1200 2080 ti from last generation the new 700 3080 is over 30 percent faster in red dead redemption 2 and a massive 75 over the standard 2080. so the rtx 3080 is very very quick and as a 2080 ti owner myself of course you can't help but feel a bit of buyer's remorse but it's important not to hold on to that technology moves quick and the fact that this level of performance is here in the first place is a great thing in rainbow six the 3080 averages over 185 fps at 4k resolution which makes it 35 faster than the 2080 ti and 70 faster than the 2080. that performance carries strong into 1440p this thing can maintain above 300 fps at 1440p max quality no problem it's important to remember that this isn't even the fastest card in their lineup the 1500 or rtx 3090 launches next week so keep the perspective of what this card actually is it's a successor to the 2080 and for that amount of money you are getting a lot more performance now the 2080 received a lot of humiliation at launch for barely being faster than the 700 1080 ti before it which does make this performance leap for the 3080 look a lot better in comparison but the performance margins here definitely make up for that gap in my opinion and what i mean is over the last two years of gpu releases from both amd and nvidia i've become really accustomed to climbing into the graphs and really digging into the data to find the differences but here just by watching it run alongside two of the fastest gpus from last generation you can see that it's a clear big jump thanks to that faster gddr6x memory performance specifically at 4k is where the 3080 stretches a bit further beyond the 2080 ti and the 2080. in shadow of the tomb raider the 3080 is 28 faster than the 2080 ti at 4k but quite a bit less when we drop the resolution to 1440p in death stranding the rtx 3080 maintains some really nice frame rates in 4k resolution whereas the 2080 sits a lot closer to that 60 fps mark that's a night and day difference in terms of gaming experience and again we do see much better performance scaling for the 3080 at higher resolutions versus last generation against the 2080 ti it's 28 faster at 4k but 20 faster at 1440p still though this is an excellent gpu for either resolution with a clear leap ahead of anything that we've seen yet but 4k gaming specifically is where it really excels so if you game on a 4k monitor or maybe you're a couch gamer and you prefer a 4k tv the 3080 will be a noticeable upgrade over pretty much anything even a 2080 ti in battlefield 5 at 4k ultra settings last generation's rtx 2080 will have some moments where it dips below 60 fps but that just isn't going to happen on the new 3080. now for those that were expecting double the performance over the rtx 2080 because of what you might have seen in nvidia's own chart or some early sponsored reviews you just need to reset your expectations and look at these numbers with some fresh eyes manufacturers will always over promise on their product and sponsored reviews will never really show the full picture because they aren't really allowed to and it's important to never buy into that 100 percent now the 30 series are supposedly packed with more compute horsepower for ray tracing and ai operations so that's something that i was really interested to test with control this game looks seriously phenomenal with rtfx enabled and by enabling dlss you can entirely recover that performance drop back now this game is absolutely brutal at 4k and this illustrates how much of an upgrade the 3080 is over something like a gtx 1080 or vega 64. those two cards are absolutely crippled at 4k whereas the 3080 is at least playable with plenty of room to reduce the settings a little bit and obtain a higher frame rate when we take a look at rtx performance scaling versus some of the cards from the 20 series the rtx 3080 gains a 5.3 boost with both ray tracing and dlss enabled the 2080 ti gains a smaller 3.2 boost and the 2080 actually loses around 2.7 of frame rate performance so it's safe to say that the 3080 does pack more rt and dlss performance versus previous generation but i would admit it's not as much as i was personally expecting as this is second generation rtx you'd expect a pretty massive improvement in dlss and ray tracing performance versus nvidia's first implementation with the 20 series but honestly only expect a small bump it is totally possible though that current rtx games aren't utilizing all of the new rt core and tensor core power in f1 2020 the rtx 3080 gains a 17 frame rate boost by enabling dlss whereas the 2080 ti gains 27 and the 2080 gains 24 so dlss performance scaling versus the 2080 ti and 2080 isn't anywhere near as good in this specific title now blender is one of my own specific use cases for this gpu and one that i was really excited to test out the 3080 is actually so quick here that for future blender testing i'll need to increase either the sample count or resolution to show the actual performance improvement the bottom line for now is that this is looking like an excellent card for 3d work you also have an extra 2 gigabytes of vram to play with versus the rtx 2080. i additionally tested the v-ray and here the performance gains over the 2080ti and 2080 are insane so the 3080 is looking like a proper workstation gpu when it comes to rendering performance in terms of clock speeds for the asus tough oc model here that i did all of my testing with expect stable clock speeds at just underneath that 2 gigahertz mark here there were extremely small deviations in clock frequency here which is great to see and from start to finish we're basically looking at the same performance with no drop off as the card warms up and this is because the thermal performance was right in check as well this card runs exceptionally cool that was really surprising to see because with a board power well in excess of 300 watts you'd typically expect very warm thermals as well but that's not the case here nvidia's ampere architecture seems to be relatively thermally efficient despite all of that power the asus tuff was also relatively quiet here with the fans just at 1750 rpm now as this card is factory overclocked i couldn't squeeze out much more in terms of a manual oc ampere is voltage locked as well just like touring and pascal so don't plan on overclocking them too far upgrading your power supply though that is definitely going to be something in order for more than a few of you especially those with units under 600 watts i found total system power at the wall for the rtx 3080 to be around 60 watts higher than the 2080 ti 75 watts higher than the 2080 and a mind-blowing 180 watts higher than the gtx 1080. again this is a factory overclocked model with an additional 20 watts over the founders edition but most of you will likely be picking up a similar spec card so the overall performance of the rtx 3080 is exceptional and it lands it as the best high performance gpu that you can currently buy at 500 less than the rtx 2080 ti from last generation sure nvidia did need to pump quite a bit more power into the 3080 for it to kind of reach those performance levels but the 3080 is kind of controlling that power quite well and with most of you who are looking at these kind of triple fan two and a half slot designs you are not going to have any problem when it comes to thermals and noise performance specifically at higher resolutions is where the rtx 3080 can really flex beyond the 2080 ti this thing is excellent for 4k gaming i will say that one thing i was a little underwhelmed with was the performance scaling when it comes to ray tracing and dlss i think most of us were expecting a huge bump here over first generation but i think this gpu is especially exciting for those users who might have bought a high performance card like the 1080 1080 ti or vega 64 and just skipped the 20 series all together the performance gap between those gpus and the 3080 is absolutely massive but you'd still be paying the same amount for what you did for those gpus when they launched now for those wanting a bit more performance than the rtx 3080 we do also have the 3090 which is releasing next week although for significantly more cash 1500 u.s and then we do of course have the 500 rtx 3070 which should offer some pretty exceptional value but that's pretty much going to wrap us up for the rtx 3080 performance benchmark review and i would love to know your thoughts and comments down below as always if you are interested in buying one of these cards you can find them linked in the description a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
