[Music] Gaming mice are probably the only category of PC gaming where you'll find top-tier quality and features in the budget products that means super flexible cables some of the best sensors on the market and comfortable lightweight shells so maybe you're looking to upgrade your setup or just improve your team in first-person shooters without spending a ton of cash you'll definitely want to check out these really affordable options first so I've got five gaming mice in mind that I want to talk about today or at fifty dollars us or under and the good news is whatever grip preference or hand size you have you've got some options here [Music] now I want to start first with the gaming mouse that inspired me to make this video because I personally think it deserves a bit more attention and that's raises new Viper mini this is the third Mouse in their viper series after the original viper and Viper ultimate but personally I prefer the Viper mini over both of those somehow Razer are able to put this out there for just $39 which is pretty insane because I think this is easily one of the best mice out there currently regardless of price one way that they were able to achieve that lower price point was with a cheaper sensor the mini uses the pmw 33:59 as opposed to something more advanced like the 3389 that you'll find in the viper ultimate but that doesn't make the Viper mini sensor any less accurate or suitable for first-person shooters you're definitely not going to have any issues with spinouts or precise tracking now one main drawback of using that cheaper sensor in the Viper mini is the higher lift off distance that is the amount of distance that you can sort of lift the mouse off before it stops registering input and on the back of mini it's pretty higher to that two millimeters usually a lower lift off distance is more preferred for first-person shooters but I think on the Viper mini it is definitely still within a comfortable range you can supposedly adjust this within the Mouse calibration section of the Razer synapse software but it doesn't make any meaningful difference in my experience at the end of the day though it all comes down to that shape and whether this is going to be comfortable for your hand size and grip the Viper mini is definitely for those who like to claw grip or fingertip grip their mouse as it is on the smaller end if you do prefer to palm grip your mouse and have the whole hand resting on the entire shell stay tuned for one of our other options but I have tried a lot of very small ultra light gaming mice in the past and I think that overall the Viper mini has the most balanced and considered shape it doesn't feel cheap or unbalanced like the MM 710 it's not too small like the final Mouse ultra light - and for a lot of people I actually think this is perfect for a small lightweight gaming mouse the weight comes in at just over 60 grams which I believe makes this the lightest Gaming Mouse without a honeycomb shell so if you're bothered by those honeycomb cutouts on a lot of lightweight mice that we're seeing these days the Viper mini is pretty much perfect now if you are currently on the fence about transitioning to a small lightweight Gaming Mouse because currently you might be using something like a Logitech g7 or three there is definitely a learning curve and at first you might completely hate it and put it back in the box and return it but I really think that if you give it a couple weeks maybe three or four weeks even that you will prefer it quite a bit because I do believe generally that most people will end that up with a small and lightweight gaming mouse on the note of the cable it's easily one of the best that I've used it's not as loose and flexible as the old glorious model Oh cables but in my opinion that's a good thing it's wide enough to the point where it feels almost as good as Wireless when paired with a good Mouse bungee but also rigid enough that it doesn't swing with every single mouse movement and lastly all the buttons feel great not excellent like the ones on the G pro Wireless but still some of the best on the market the scroll wheel on the other hand is a bit average overall this is easily one of the best gaming mice for first-person shooters on the market and for just $39 it really is an absolute steal but if you're looking to get into the Wireless game but don't want to spend 150 US dollars on a jeepers wireless or VIPRE ultimate the G 305 is a seriously good option at $49 so again just like the Viper mini this is a smaller Mouse and not really an option if you like the palm grip having said that it does use the very popular shape from the Logitech G 102 g 2 or 3 and G Pro now you will find a regular double-a battery in the box which will give you some decent battery life and bring the mouse to around 100 grams but by swapping to a triple a lithium battery and a double-a adapter sleeve you'll both reduce the weight to a little over 80 grams while also increasing the battery life to a few months the G 305 is also an excellent option if you game on a laptop and don't want to carry around a wired mouse but also don't have a ton of cash to spring on one of the more premium options no complaints on the buttons or scrollwheel for this one I've easily got a few hundred hours on this exact G 3:05 and it still feels brand-new so if you're looking to cut the cord and go wireless definitely consider this option from Logitech but now let's talk about the current range from glorious all of these are $49 and you've definitely got some options here in terms of different shapes and sizes and how could we talk about lightweight and affordable gaming mice without talking about the glorious model oh this is definitely the mouse that sort of challenged the industry and pushed companies like razor and Coolermaster to follow suit and create really light mice but also at a decent price point you can think of the model as kind of like the vanilla ice cream of lightweight gaming mice it's got a really safe shape and size and I honestly think that 90% of gamers out there could adapt their grip to find the model really nice and comfortable then we've got the much smaller model o - which is one of the smallest and lightest gaming mice that you can currently buy just 58 grams and I'd really only recommend this one if you have smaller hands or game with a fingertip grip really don't underestimate how small this one is even for claw grip it might not be suitable I did try using it for claw grip for a while but I found that there just wasn't enough support at the back and it was just too small overall and lastly the model D which is for those users who prefer a large amounts with an ergonomic shape but still value something really lightweight so if you've got really large hands or just prefer to have the full mouth shell in your palm this option is it seriously good personally though I would spring the extra $10 or so and get the extra 5 m4 instead the buttons feel a bit nicer and the shape is much better in my opinion specifically the lower main mass buttons which feel a bit more natural to aim with all of the glorious mice come with the pmw 3360 sensor the updated ascended cable which is one of the best on the market quickie Omron switches and a honeycomb shell with RGB for $49 that is really hard to beat especially with some of the most comfortable shapes on the market so it's pretty insane how much value you can get out of a $50 Gaming Mouse these days just a year ago that was certainly not the case and if you look at other PC gaming categories like keyboards for example $50 to $100 keyboards just are not that good and you really do benefit from spending a whole lot in that category whereas gaming mice you can get away with a 5000 Mouse's actually really superb with really premium features so I will have all of those options linked down below if you are interested and I'll also link this mouse bungee here this is the razor Mouse bungee v2 it's one of the better bungees that you can get on the market and if you are going with some of these wired options it's not totally necessary but it does definitely help so as always a huge thanks for watching consider subscribing down below if you haven't already and I'll see you all in the next one
