there has been a ton of interest for B 550 motherboards and rightfully so but I think the big question that a lot of people are asking is are they really worth it because on many cheaper be 450 motherboards you do get rise in 3,000 support out of the box and future rise in 4000 series support the power circuitry is also strong enough for the majority of users and you can save a ton of cash instead of going for X 570 so today I have to be 550 IT exports up for testing MSI's a be 550 I edged gaming AC and a Seuss's be 550 i ROG Strix and the comparison goes in the other direction as well how close is B 550 compared to X 570 and maybe the more important question is how close is the pricing so let's take a look now I think the biggest reason for all of the hype behind be 550 was the native support for rise in 3000 CPUs out-of-the-box and more importantly the future support for next generation of Rison processors Xen 3 that way users didn't have to worry about possibly receiving a board with an older BIOS that didn't support third gen rise in CPUs and they wouldn't need to buy a new board if they needed to upgrade to the next generation but all of that be 550 - dove fizzled out when AMD announced that they would actually be supporting fourth-generation rise and CPUs on B 450 and X 417 motherboards so that will be done via a BIOS update and if your motherboard has the BIOS flashback option you'll be able to easily update the BIOS on those be 450 and X 470 boards without a second or third generation CPU now with B 450 especially on an ITX motherboard I really do feel like it's stacked enough in terms of how many USB ports and the bandwidth of the PCIe lanes that you're getting B 550 in comparison you do get PCIe 4.0 enabled honor those CPU based lanes so for both your graphics card and your primary m2 Drive you also get faster USB even with a Titan RT X though the most powerful GPU that you can currently buy right now you will not see a performance benefit here with that higher bandwidth ceiling now there are MDOT to nvme drives out there that can saturate a gen 3 slot so that's something to consider if you need the absolute fastest peak transfer speeds out there in general though PCIe gen 4 should not be the sole reason that you're buying into B 550 and then bumping up to X 570 you do get PCIe 4.0 lanes throughout the entire chipset and more lanes in total also faster and more USB and more solder ports so if you're building a verizon 9 mid-tower workstation this could possibly be worth it for you the variety exports you're just not going to benefit from the majority of those extra ports and lanes there's just no physical room for them on the board but enough talk about PCIe lanes and the chipset differences because there are other more important differences between these boards one thing I'm glad to see on be 550 is a USB type-c front panel header so finally this is becoming more common since we're seeing type C on a lot more cases these days another one is Wi-Fi six networking and I've personally seen users make their choice of motherboard based on this alone you won't find this on B 450 without an external controller also be 550 does not require active cooling lack X 570 does so the physical chipset itself does not draw that much power to the point that it does need one of those small fans on the board you will still see some active cooling on these ITX ports just to help out with VRM or m dot 2 cooling so for example the rog strict sport has it for the vrm and then the msi board has a for the m dot to drive I've personally never been bothered by the small fans I to actually appreciate them for the additional cooling that they provide but at the end of the day if they do bother you that much you can just unplug them now if the upgrade list of B 550 hasn't sounded so great so far then I totally get you because it's mostly just faster IO but we're also getting a much beefier vrm this stands as one of the biggest distinctions between B 450 and X 570 especially on ITX boards where you are limited physically with how many PCIe lanes you can put on the board anyway and at least with these to be 550 ITX boards here we are getting a nice upgrade the Asuza be 550 i strokes gets upgraded to an 8 + 2 phase vrrrm with 50 amp power stages but do note that's not eight true pwm phases just like the x5 70 i board still though a lot more output than any be 450 ITX board that you'll find out there the B 550 I board from MSI also gets an upgrade over B 450 with eight power stages dedicated to CPU power and another two for the SOC and these are 60 hand power stages MSI also claim that this is an 8 + 2 PWM setup but I do believe they're running to power stages / PWM phase just like the B 550i ROG Strix now when it comes to vrm thermals under load here's what we're looking at I tested all four boards with the six Rison 3950 axe and overclock that to 4.2 gigahertz across all calls at a voltage of one point two eight volts the stress test here blender is one of the most demanding real-world workloads that you can put this cpu through it's a 30-minute render and we're testing on an open test bench with no direct air flow so we can see here that the to be 550 boards are a massive upgrade in terms of vrm output and really aren't too far off the X 570 board of course you can go a bit higher than one point two eight volts on a rise in 3950 X but you probably don't have that level of CPU cooling capacity anyway in an ITX case again this represents one of the worst case scenarios that you can put these boards through so at this point be 550 is looking like a pretty solid choice but just keep in mind that you will need to pay for those upgrades the B 550i ROG Strix for example is listed at around 230 dollars u.s. which makes it around $40 or so less than the x5 70 I version and $80 also more than the B 450 I version but honestly with pricing and stock so sporadic at the moment I'm really hesitant to make any recommendations based off of pricing alone so I will kind of make these recommendations based off of the CPUs that you might be pairing these boards with I still think the be 450 I Strix is a great pair 4 CPUs like the 3300 x30 630 700x especially if it allows you to save a bit of cash and then upgrade to a faster CPU or memory kit those processes will most likely be for gaming and like production workload type builds and you definitely don't need a super beefy vrm for those tasks and then we have the B 550i which can really hold its own even more impaired all the way up to an overclocked 3950 X so for a 12 core or 16 core rendering build be 550 is absolutely a sensible choice also if you really want to run a high speed memory kit alongside your CPU for example a low latency kit above 30 200 megahertz don't bother with a be 450 board in my opinion as it's just too much of a gamble just opt straight for EB 550 or X 570 and then honestly X 570 is a bit of a hard sell of ABI 550 based off of specs alone but you do get a slightly stronger vrm and more i/o I'd only recommend this for enthusiasts rising builds we're spending that extra cash it doesn't make a difference to the rest of your build but really at the end of the day it does come down to that pricing in your region at least here in Australia there's a $180 AUD difference which works out to be around 120 USD so in that case be 550 would be the smarter choice over X 570 in my opinion if I had to pick between the MSI and Asus be 550i boards here it would honestly just come down to pricing I would just choose the cheapest one available the msi board doesn't have a 12 volt RGB header like the assist board does and I'm not a fan of putting the front panel connector all the way down to the bottom left of the board however both of them are very very similar they both have a BIOS flash back 3/4 pin fan headers a front panel type-c connector and also a fairly similar clearance when it comes to CPU heat sinks vrm thermal performance is also very close within a few degrees so hopefully that helps you guys out if you are planning a new rising ITX build in the near future and if you are interested in any of these boards or other ones that I recommend I will leave them linked it down below in the description as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
