something has just announced the galaxy s 20 ultra and it's an absolute mammoth of a smartphone we're talking 16 gigs of ram and a camera with a hundred times zoom it's not just better than any flagship phone they've ever released before it is a tier above you could almost call it a super phone so today we're answering the big question does the Galaxy S 20 ultra destroy the iPhone 11 Pro max I think the results might surprise you the first thing you'll notice putting both these two devices side-by-side is the ultra is an absolute unit of a phone it's massive for most people's hands the iPhone 11 pro max is a large device but Samsung takes that and then adds about 5% more height and almost 10% more thickness to be honest though I don't think that in itself is a problem it's large enough that you can forget about it being a one-handed experience but as long as you go in with that as an expectation you'll spend more time at gawping at the Magnificent display you get then worrying about how you're gonna hold it but more on that in a minute what is weird though is that even though Samsung's phone towers above apples in size it's actually lighter and I'm gonna be honest feels a little bit cheaper while Samsung has actually upgraded the metal they use in their phone rim from 7000 series aluminium to something that's now 1.2 times stronger Apple uses stainless steel which has many times the mechanical strength of aluminium anyways it'll be far more resistant to dents and scratches plus I just like the density of the material the iPhones weight just makes it feel a touch more premium and well it is a little early for me to try it myself if we dropped both phones on their sides my money would be on the iPhone surviving with far less damage that said though whilst it only feels okay I think the s20 ultra looks fantastic compared to the standard s xx which visually looks not too distinct from the company's own mid-range phones this beefy camera module makes the ultra look whoa badass when you're holding it you feel like you're holding cutting-edge technology I love that idea but I will say that the design is a little Sheltie compared to the iPhone it's got an enormous camera module with text just highlight its new space zoom feature but the iPhone is a little more understated classier its matte finish gets instant plus points for me because of its ability to resist fingerprints and avoid that kind of stickiness you can sometimes get with glass camera module is protected by Gorilla Glass six but its sheer size means that it's gonna cause major wobble if you put a phone on a flat surface oh yeah and both phones have ip68 water and dust resistance ratings and neither has a headphone jack slight bummer yeah but Wireless is where we had it I think having a headphone jack on a mainstream flagship 2020 smartphone is gonna be a rarity anyways so design and build wise I would slightly side with Apple but now is where the tables start to turn and by the way I'm launching a pretty massive giveaway starting today of one Galaxy S 20 ultra and/or galaxy s 20s it's free and international and all rules are going to be in the description I'm gonna say it now the display on the galaxy s 20 ultra is the best display on a smartphone period I could just leave it at that but it is better than the iPhones in so many ways that I think we should talk about it for starters what they have in common is that both use OLED technology for deep contrast and they both have an almost identical brightness of 800 nits across the whole display but then well the s20 ultras panel is just colossal in size we say that every single year because somehow each generation these screens just keep getting bigger and this time round you're looking at a whopping at six point nine inches then why not sound like a big jump versus the six point five inch iPhone screen but in terms of screen area that's a difference you'll feel Samsung's tiny hole punch camera which is 40% smaller than past generations combined with tiny bezels all the way around means that the Ultra feels almost borderless and futuristic compared to Apple's large notch and thick black rim now back when the iPhone 10 came out which is the first time we saw Apple use this front design we thought it looked slick and futuristic because fair enough up against Galaxy s8 that was Samsung's equivalent at the time it was but since then whilst Apple is using the same design Samsung's has come so far and to put a number on it the s20 ultra screen to body ratio sits at around 90 percent versus Apple's approximately 84 what is interesting though speaking of borders is that the s20 lineup is the first time Samsung has backtracked on curved displays compared to the s10 and other previous flagships these new displays look almost flat there's still a slight curve which is more than you can say for the iPhone but it's nowhere near as Atticus before I'd say it's fair enough the curves didn't really have any functional benefit and I don't think there'll be that many people that missed them there is more to this ultras displayed oh it's a quad HD plus panel giving it around 30% more pixels than the iPhones display but the best bit is that it's refresh rate is double whilst the 11 prose panel refreshes are pretty normal 60 times per second Samsung's does 120 and it changes things you know how Apple has always had this reputation for buttery smoothness that it's Android rivals just haven't been able to replicate well the s20 completely will reverse that trend for me using both side by side for the first time as samsung felt like the more fluid experience and it's not just that Samsung's display refreshes twice as fast but it also has twice the touch response rate that means that it's faster at registering your touches which makes everything just feel more instant and responsive I should clarify here the display on the iPhone 11 pro max is top shelf but the display on the Ultra is unlike anything I've ever seen before now I mentioned Apple's sizable knotch and so while we're here it's worth noting that it's not there for show it has all the sensors needed for face ID which if you've never used it works incredibly and if you have you'll know what I mean just by scanning your face face ID is secure enough to make bank transactions autofill your passwords and so on Samsung's face scanner is fast but it only uses a 2d camera so it's more of a tool for convenience than it is a safety measure the phone does though have an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner pretty much the same as the one seen on the note 10 last year now just before we get to cameras which is arguably the main event of this new s20 ultra there is something else I always like to keep track of with new phones processing power and what there are a lot of different variables at play here the main takeaway is that both are kind of on par depending on your region Samsung uses either the Exynos 990 or the snapdragon 865 chipset so versus last year's s10 that's around a 15% faster CPU a 25% faster GPU and an AI engine that's at least twice as good but that actually puts it slightly behind is the a13 Bionic chip in the iPhone there will be some tasks the Samsung does better but for most games and apps I'd expect them to run a tiny bit faster on life something that does kind of make up for this though with an absolutely absurd amount of RAM 12 gigabytes on the base model and over to 16 gigs and when you factor in that this is the fastest round we've ever seen on phone the performance ceiling here is sky-high the iPhone by comparison only has four gigs so something will definitely have an edge when you're juggling heavy tasks but just bear in mind that because iOS is optimized to not need as much RAM the difference won't be as noticeable as it sounds on paper I've tried opening apps flicking between them and there was a tangible difference between the performance of this s20 ultra and even Samsung's phones from just a few months ago but something I actually noticed even more was just how fantastic the haptics are here the ultra uses the same vibration motors as the Galaxy Note Templar it but it's been further tuned to offer what I'm gonna say is the most satisfying physical response to touches you've seen on a phone I really would recommend you go into store you try the phone because I would rank it above Apple in this aspect ok then it's no secret that the camera is a very important part of the s20 ultras proposition I mean this is quite possibly the largest camera module I've ever seen so to start with a side-by-side looking at specs Samsung's camera makes the iPhones look a bit like a toy but we have to be careful here because the specs can be a little bit misleading its main camera has a 108 megapixel resolution versus 12 on the iPhone it has a 48 megapixel telephoto camera with support for 100 times space zoom versus the iPhones Macs of 10 times zoom the ultra wide cameras then are almost identically SPECT with both having a white 120 degree field of view but on top of that Samsung has an additional in-depth vision sensor which the iPhone doesn't so on paper this kind of gives you the impression that these two phones are in completely different leagues like they're not even comparable and that is kind of the case but also not really so that main camera or 108 megapixels you can take 108 megapixel photos but most of the time you probably won't the benefit comes mainly because of something called pixel pinning there's quite a few fans out there that can do this they merge for smaller pixels into one bigger one to make those resulting pixels cleaner and more noise free well the s20 ultra uses something called Nonna binning converting not four but nine pixels into one and so whilst you do still end up with a 12 megapixel photo from this 100 an 8 megapixel camera the size of those pixels and the resulting quality is three times greater than the iPhone so Samsung's 12 megapixel photos have an incredibly crisp finish and this translates to it's night mode too when you take a nightmare shot now you can hold your phone still for eight seconds and capture way more light than you're used to with a Samsung Apple's night mode is really good but Samsung's is now better in my opinion for the first time you can actually record 8k video at a proper frame rate it's only 24 frames per second which means you'll definitely benefit from sticking it on a tripod when capturing but just the fact that you can shoot a K video is staggering 8k is four times the resolution of 4k and to give you some idea this shot right here is a still image taken from an 8k video shot on this phone and just this screen grab alone is a 33 megapixel image in its own right that you can then zoom all the way in - aside from the low frame rate though this 8k footage also takes quite a long time to render on these new phones before you can watch it back in 8k so it might not be a future you keep on what about that zoom though a hundred times that sounds almost unbelievable and it kind of it's the numbers don't tell the full story see in my briefing samsung only talked about their hybrid zoom capabilities not once did they actually disclose the actual optical zoom value of the camera which is the figure we usually use to compare phones they say the phone can losslessly zoom in 10 times but from what I can see the actual optical zoom range is only about four to five times now still impressive mind you and certainly Dwarfs the iPhones - times zoom but it does mean that if you were going to try zooming in a hundred times like it suggests doing right on the back of the phone most of that zoom is digital and the end result is just not going to be all that sharp and then you got the ultra wide which has seen some small but important improvements the field of view is now actually slightly smaller than past Samsung phones but has the benefit of almost none of that weird distorting fisheye effects that were used to seeing on ultra wide cameras and switching between the lenses on Samsung's phone no longer feels like switching between lenses which is something the iPhone has done really well from the start so as far as the user is concerned using these cameras on both phones just feels like using one camera but one with a whole load of options and that's how it should be some songs for additional sensor is just a depth camera meaning that when you take a portrait mode shot for example you're just getting a bit more information about how far away your background is the phone also has a 40 megapixel selfie camera versus Apple's 12 they're both very good and I should say at this point when it comes to cameras the battle is not won with hardware it's won with software and Samsung's camera software is catching up rapidly with apples but at the same time their hardware has just leapfrogged apples for something that is a great position to be in and speaking of software obviously with either of these two phones you're buying into a completely different smartphone ecosystem of course Android versus iOS in itself that could be an entire video but there's a couple of things worth noting with this comparison in particular Samsung's phone ships with Android 10 combined with their 1 UI 2.1 skin and this delivers quick share it's one touch sharing between Samsung phones and tablets finally an Android equivalent to Apple's airdrop there are a couple of other smaller things like help samsung has increased the vibrance of their icons but largely not a huge shift from the software you'd find on the note 10 last year the iPhone 11 pro max looks like an iPhone and that's either a great thing for you or not such a great thing you'll benefit from a lot of iOS is traditional advantages like getting a lot of games and apps a little early you're generally getting less bloatware on the phone compared to the Samsung which comes with a whole suite of apps you'll probably never touch and buy phones have fantastic integration with Mac's if your Mac user plus what you lose in the lack of customization you gain in software support the very nature of Apple only releasing a few phones per year means that they can really focus on delivering updates you can expect a new iPhone to stay up to date for around five years after launch whereas I'd only give the s20 old travell to now just before we conclude here there's a couple of things I want to touch on firstly that I love the fact that companies are finally paying attention to battery no matter how great a phone is it's camera if performance if the battery's dead it's useless so with that in mind something has fitted their device with their largest battery ever I believe five thousand milliamp hours and Apple has done theirs at 3969 that obviously sounds like a clear win for Samsung but I can tell you right now with apples battery optimization and the fact that Samsung's new display will literally suck battery like a vampire this is anyone's game and you're gonna have to wait for the full battery comparison to see the true winner so do you subscribe if you want to see that coming fairly soon both phones ship with decent but not all that impressive Chargers out the box you get a 25 watt charger with the Samsung and you get an 18 with the iPhone it's good that the s20 ultra can theoretically support 45 watt charging that's very fast but it's a bit of a shame that when you buy a phone at this price you have to pay extra to get a charger that can do that I also spend some time with the speakers on this new phone and they're good pretty much the same deal as with past Samsung flagships you've got the main chunk of audio that comes from the bottom firing speaker but then also through this sliver of an earpiece at the top I would lean slightly towards the iPhone in terms of overall speaker quality but then Samsung is leagues ahead in connectivity to start as it has a hybrid dual SIM slot by default which means that you can have one sim and a microSD card at the same time up to an extra terabyte of storage and 5g literally no Apple phone as I've now supports 5g but with the ultra you're getting pretty much the most complete package of 5g connectivity even for wireless charging Samsung's phone can wirelessly charge faster than Apple's and it can reverse Wireless charge other phones that's something that has not yet come to the iPhone 11 pro so bringing this all together where do we stand well the s20 ultra is undoubtedly phenomenal it is so many new and impressive things all at once but the one thing that will count against it is the fact that for the first time ever Samsung is more expensive out of the final confirmed prices of time of filming right now but I'm told that you can end up paying as much as 200 to $300 more for our galaxy s 20 ultra over an 11 pro max to be really honest though I think that's fair game what you're getting and it leads me to quite an interesting conclusion for quite a few years now my smartphone recommendation has been if you're on a Samsung phone buy the latest Samsung if you're on an iPhone buy the latest iPhone because neither company's phones have been so far ahead of the others that it makes sense to go through all the hassle of switching ecosystems but the s20 ultra now offers so much more than its iphone counterpart that for some users this might make sense it's camera it's display its storage we're talking about a phone that can have 1.5 terabytes of data stored on it with a micro SD card slot it is just a nuts phone and so what I'm saying is for the first time this is a device I can recommend to not just Samsung and Android enthusiasts but even iPhone ones too it is that good if you enjoyed this video don't forget to enter the giveaway all the rules are in the
