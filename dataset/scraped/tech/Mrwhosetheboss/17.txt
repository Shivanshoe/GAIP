i'm about to spend ten thousand dollars in the next 200 seconds ordering the most impossibly thin tech on the entire planet okay i mean how thin do cameras get well it's definitely not you wait a paper camera what this is gonna be saucy okay uh thinnest tablet in the world the remarkable two it's only 299. okay 399 when you don't get their subscription no i just said i didn't want the subscription yes i'm sure okay you have to buy the pen separately 129. the the cover is 119. oh you cheeky little did that actually just become 700. i feel like i've just been robbed anyways let's find a charger for it well would you look at that the size of a credit card you will do just fine hmm slimmest earphones in the world the slimmest printer in the world so one of the things that i normally try and do when i'm ordering stuff is to see if i can build a computer setup in the theme of that video so world's thinnest mouse check we've got a mouse mat fractions of a millimeter thick check what about the keyboard though it's pretty thin i'm sure we can do better though oh logitech that's very thin it's just it's just the keys if only you could have a keyboard without the key sticking out okay um that's probably going to do the job this is a keyboard made completely of glass but of course for a computer setup we need a computer so we could get like a really high-end gaming pc but built into a really thin case like this um well this is the coolest pc case i've ever seen in my life we could get one of those really mini pcs um no no okay this has got to be special let's get something custom made this is not gonna be cheap speaking of computers though i've wanted a good windows laptop for a really long time now let's see dell xps 15 which is 17 millimeters thick that's less than two centimeters there's the razor book which is actually 15 millimeters i think we got our answer the acer swift 7 is 9.95 millimeters thick less than a centimeter oh my god i'm looking at the thinnest screen i've ever seen i'm just gonna buy it i'm not even gonna show you yet this is gonna be worth the wait okay what kind of stuff do i just wish was thinner a suitcase why not the narrowest sunglasses ever the skinniest wallet ever i'm so confused like how does that even hold anything and then finally to finish off the budget i want to see if we can find a speaker now this might be a bit of a challenge because you'd normally need to make speakers chunky so that they can get enough bikes i like the battery bike wait that's a speaker ah it's not for sale how convenient so i think this is the slimmest speaker that you can buy it's apparently as thin as your phone and this is even thinner because it's not actually a speaker in itself but it can turn anything you stick it onto into a speaker okay someone take this laptop away from me right two months later and it's time to unbox it all so let's start thin and just keep getting thinner i mean all you've got to do is to look at this packaging to realize just how thin things are going to get okay so starting at nine centimeters you know that custom pc i was talking about we got it and you're actually looking at it right now so basically i found this company called novatech and they have a sub brand called rain gaming which has some of the coolest custom pcs i've ever seen so i told them i'm looking for the thinnest extreme pc on the market and from there we came up with the idea of building it into my desk now i'll admit this is still not the most razor thin pc you've ever seen we could have made it thinner but wait till you see what it can do i mean just for starters mechanical legs so with one tap of a button this can go from below my waist to above my head mr who's the boss themed colors across all cabling and lighting electrochromic glass such that if all that color becomes a distraction i can just tap one button and bam it'll pass a specialized current through it which changes the chemical arrangement of that glass to make it opaque but on top of all of that power we're talking a 12th gen intel i7 12700 kf processor nvidia geforce rdx 3080 ti graphics card and wd black sm850 storage which is so fast it can copy an entire one terabyte hard drive across in just three minutes we'll keep adding things to this pc setup as we go through the video and unbox thinner and thinner devices okay dropping all the way down to just five centimeters we have a rolling suitcase and you're probably thinking five centimeters i couldn't even fit my underwear in that but it expands it seems like a very solid piece of kit this feels wrong it's not a suitcase surely i love the concept of this it only ever takes up as much space as it needs to now at half the thickness of even that we're only three products in and already reaching 2.5 centimeters hp's sprocket this is a printer that's just ridiculous so in theory i should just be able to pull up a photo on my phone oh something's happening it's really fast and the picture goes right up to the edges i'm quite impressed pretty high resolution but if you think that's thin okay just for perspective here's a pair of apple airpods pretty thin credit where do but nothing compared to this monstrosity inside this pack should be the yobyo card 20 earphones oh look what they're called card because they're so slim that it's it's not just that they'll fit in your pocket these could fit in your wallet i wonder if they've just given them like no battery life now i honestly have zero idea what to expect from this one it genuinely looks like someone's taken a proper camera and then just sat on it repeatedly to flatten it it's quite a strange product like it does actually feel quite solid and well made but then to look at it's more like a middle school origami project but then it is actually a proper digital camera with real interchangeable lenses so let's stick our sd card in here we've got a slider to select from a bunch of different filters one thing's for absolutely sure though these photos are an entire mood it's got a really old-school quirky style to it you know i would genuinely say that testing new speakers is one of my favorite things ever to do and that pleasure is never greater than when you're testing a record-breaking one this lenovo 700 is just 1.1 centimeter thick that is unbelievable how is that going to sound because normally for proper bass you need physical depth for the speaker to be able to like push air i think this is smaller than my phone the speaker's so thin the sound is so fat especially when you factor in that they've also apparently squeezed an eight hour battery life into this oh but we can actually get even thinner audio and to get this thin we're having to use a completely different technology this is blade it's not a speaker and of itself but you can place blade onto anything and i mean anything to turn that device into a speaker it sounds like science fiction instead of turning your music into a sound wave directly it's instead converting it into a mechanical vibration that can use the space inside another object as a sound chamber to induce that sound wave from it instead okay so you can kind of hear the vibration already right [Applause] it's like magic oh my god i can feel the bass through this cardboard box the bass i'm getting while it's sitting on this pc is insane okay we're about to break the one centimeter mark and i still can't quite believe that the product we're doing that with is a laptop this is the record-breaking acer swift seven apparently made possible through a razor thin magnesium aluminium alloy material and also presumably a severe trimming of the speakers and battery no it barely feels heavier than my ipad i feel like the hardest thing to complement here is the fact that this is two layers this is a screen a keyboard ports it's everything it genuinely feels like i'm using a dummy unit that doesn't actually function let's try watching a quick video the screen is a bit dim though and the speakers are oh yeah oh god moving on okay time to completely switch tact coming in at 0.9 centimeters thick these are the rove sunglasses slightly cheap packaging but we'll look past it and there it is i feel like i need to stress this 0.9 centimeters is how thick they are when folded if i unfold them with one two three four five six oh seven this is so thin i feel like i could slice something with it fruit me just for science oh we're in [Music] no way i didn't think i'd be doing this today now sweeping in at just 0.8 centimeters we have that keyboard which is effectively just a sheet of glass with touch sensors on it doesn't sound the most appealing to use like the reason that normal keyboards are comfortable is that the keys will travel as you press them in this one doesn't have that and what is that font i can't complain too much though it's extremely thin and the core concept of this design is straight out of a sci-fi film plus if i turn it on here it also has leds baked in yeah this ain't the best kind of crazy though is that even thinner than that sheet of glass there is a company called espresso who's managed to build a fully working display it's not the highest spec screen out there it's a 1080p lcd but still the dimensions are shocking and it feels quality this is an aluminium and glass shell it reminds me a lot of an ipad in terms of design let's come back to that when we have all the pieces of this setup okay not so fun fact about me for quite a while now i have struggled with falling asleep i think my brain is so used to just constantly churning out video ideas that it doesn't know how to shut off anymore well these earbuds called the cocoon night buds are designed to solve that problem they're pretty funky looking but that's because of this hub in the middle here which is packed with sensors that we'll be able to detect when you've fallen asleep so you no longer need to keep setting these sleep timers for your content these earphones will automatically fade out your music the minute you no longer need it but that's not even the coolest bit they can also track your sleep quality and help you understand it they can detect snoring and mask the noise from it and they're so thin from every angle a quarter of the thickness of normal bluetooth buds for such that it doesn't really matter what position you're lying down in you can't really feel them they just they feel like an extension of your head based on a quick first impression i am a big fan of this and the sound quality is not the best but pretty good [Music] i think you just broke the box on my head okay well here's the product kind of looks like i damaged it more than it damaged me we're talking a mouse that is just 0.5 centimeters thick incredible novelty but i just i can't quite understand apart from specifically this video who would buy this i feel like as we're getting further and further through this video each successive product is becoming more and more of a feat and this the remarkable 2 tablet might be the coolest so far it's not an android tablet per se but it is a smart tablet of sorts and it just feels a bit surreal to hold it's like it's got the density and the weight of a coaster for your mug it doesn't feel like there's anything in there so for starters this is an e-reader just like a kindle but with a high-resolution large screen you can read web pages on it but more importantly thanks to this pencil right here you can write all right let's just give this a shot a sub to the channel would be remarkable this is shockingly responsive for an e-ink type display and oh check this if you write with the pen completely upright it comes out narrow but if you use the sides it's thicker you can even rub out using the eraser on the back but then maybe the coolest aspect of this is that with one tab i can convert all this handwritten text into an editable format and then literally pick up my phone and carry on where i left off don't really know how to rate this one though i've never really used anything like it thinnest power bank in the world coming right up what in god's name okay hold up this is my normal power bank this is the clutch charger it's it's literally the size of a credit card and it's not as useless as you might think it still has led indicator lights to show you its charge level it's got the usbc cable baked inside it i guess because it's so thin that it otherwise wouldn't fit and the battery capacity itself is still three thousand milliamp hours which you know we've seen more we've seen way more but that's still enough to get your phone from completely dead to anywhere between 50 and 100 depending on what model is speaking of credit cards though at just 0.15 centimeters which is basically two-dimensional at this point we have the win wallet i mean it's safe to say this is at least five times thinner than any other wallet i've ever seen it is very cool but i'm just thinking like when you get to a stage like this can you really call it a wallet like at this point isn't it basically just a 3d printed clip all right so just before the thinnest thing in this entire video i've got something pretty mind-blowing to show you you know how we had that thinnest espresso display well that is nothing compared to what royal has come up with okay so the display connector has got to go into the power board we're gonna need a power supply this is like really high stakes lego and then if we had a power source oh my god i genuinely think this is the coolest piece of tech i've ever held in my hands what you're looking at right now is a fully functional android device that's barely thicker than a piece of paper and it is completely flexible this is basically a development kit it's royal saying to other companies look look at our screen look how versatile it is look how bright and beautiful it is look how thin it is these screens already exist on some foldable phones that you might have already seen but it's just being able to hold the display on its own and use it as a standalone device it kind of just opens you up to what's potentially possible well let's see if we can make a call actually where am i going to fit a sim card in on that i sound like a broken record at this point but we are getting even thinner oh my i just realized something you know this like incredibly incredibly thin mouse mat we have here this is the mouse mat with a layer of packaging all around it it almost feels like i'm gripping air [Applause] oh oh i have never seen a mouse pad like it oh wait there's another layer to peel off that that's just ridiculous so there you have it the thinnest extreme pc setup ever okay so you know how we just got like the thinnest wallet ever and we were wondering what exactly we could pay for with it well surfsharkvpn hear me out here this service is not ten dollars or five dollars it is 249 a month which split between the seven people i share it with comes out to just 36 cents and that 36 cents gives me anonymity especially when i'm logged into public wi-fi networks which are the most vulnerable better prices for products that use my browser cookies to try to make things more expensive for me access to the full internet including sites blocked by my region like tv shows from another country and encryption every minute that you spend online companies are recording data about who you are and what you're doing which means that even if these companies don't have any nefarious intentions when there's a data breach that data can fall into the hands of someone who does things like your location information so give it a go and if you do hit the link in the description and use code boss it's not just that you get it for that 249 a month price but you also get three months for free on top of that fully refundable if you don't like it to
