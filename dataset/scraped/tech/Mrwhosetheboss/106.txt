that's probably the coolest smartphone box i've ever seen okay i still can't believe this is real so we've got seven of the rarest limited edition smartphones ranging from six hundred and twenty dollars to a hundred and twenty two thousand dollars yeah giveaway but yeah let's start with the cheapest because what's kind of confusing me is how is this 620 that's the same price as the normal version of this phone the oppo ace2 and that phone comes in like a tidy little box like this this one's presented like a like a fine wine apart from all the warning signs around it wow this is how you do it this is how you make a limited edition phone look at this proper solid plastic this and just to kind of explain this whole limited edition is based off a japanese anime it's called neon genesis evangelion which is about how do i say this um pilots who insert themselves into robots to control them that sounded better in my head but the point is that this capsule is the capsule that the pilots insert themselves into so that they can mount the machines yeah anyways so you open it up from the top it's just this one compartment here we've got the phone on top and wow you've got a very custom case not for me but i support where they're coming from like if you're gonna buy a phone like this you want something that looks different and so it would be a shame if you had to cover that difference up with a normal case we've got a custom pair of earphones we've got a custom 65 watt i think it's a super voot charger cable uh this is kind of very lightly custom it's mostly just a normal black cable but with like gray and red accents i'm a fan of this even the sim ejector tools custom i couldn't tell you what it is but i'm sure it's relevant it's busy there's details and different colors and accents like everywhere and again not for me but i appreciate this it would have been very easy for oppo to just take a normal version of this phone and like just whack an evangelion logo onto it but they haven't done that see what the home screen looks like that's not a particularly pretty home screen but all of this still just makes its price all the more confusing like why it's a good phone it's got a top-end snapdragon 865 chip and 90 hertz oil display and they put in all this effort to only make 10 000 units of it which might sound like a lot but you've got to remember that with a company the size of oppo when they make phones they're planning on selling 100 times that anywho it's not just that one this whole concept of affordable limited edition phones it kind of seems to be part of oppo's strategy because then you've got this they're even rarer find x2 league of legends collectors edition only 3 000 units made exclusive to china how much is it 800 the same price as their normal find x2 maybe i shouldn't have dimmed before this that's probably the coolest smartphone box i've ever seen look at this wow no way oppo are the current kings in my book of the limited edition what's happening oh i'm done the kings this is incredible this is so well done i'm so impressed so this phone i i kind of really like it but i don't love it so the gold accents i'm a fan the gold camera cutout i'm a fan in the teaser images it looked really magical and mystical it had like a 3d element to it but in reality it's actually just a bit flat that makes it sound bad it's not bad it's just minor gripe ah this is so cool okay got a little card here which says one of three thousand and it's like holographic i love these limited edition sim ejectors that's so fun we've got another super fast 65 watt charger custom earphones again i'm getting spoiled they've got like a pearlescent finish in them god cable oh that's that's nice this is like uh almost metallic-looking braided usb-c cable ah that's a case and that's a nice case do you know this almost fixes the one complaint i had with the back you know how i was saying that the design looked a bit flat this kind of adds that depth it's not like you've got a window to look into the radiating aura inside your phone with or maybe i'm just overthinking it i'm so impressed though and the whole thing does make you wonder why did oppo bother like surely designing everything here from the paint job to the accessories to this insane packaging to the software skin on this phone for just the sake of 3 000 copies all to be sold at the same price as the normal phone this is not making money so i'm assuming the purpose of it is to serve as like a an organic advert they know that if they just create something outrageous they're going to get another round of media coverage and that might bring people's attention to oppo's other phones alrighty the next one's actually from xiaomi this is a weird one in the as far as i can see you can't buy it so a couple of months ago xiaomi launched their me 10 t phones and this is like a commemorative package to show off their highest end version of that the meat nt pro so this is the phone and in some ways this is like the highest end that money can buy it's got a 144 hertz refresh rate a 108 megapixel camera a 5 000 million power battery but in other ways it's kind of fairly mid-range like it's got an lcd display not oled anyways got a case i think that's the first thing very nice sort of hyper textured carbon fiber we've got like a an oversized wallet here and then just like a an entire compartment of stuff there's like a a luggage tag and then there's two more bags that i think i'm just to refer to as little pouch and big pouch really really nice high grade set of accessories they've just got very little to do with the phone all right now for something a little smaller this is samsung's shot at a limited edition the bts galaxy s20 plus now the phone on its own just this little box here is 1200 that's more expensive than every limited edition so far but this actually comes in two parts and the whole thing together is fourteen hundred dollars and for those who don't know bts this is like a dream collab for a phone company they're a korean pop group with possibly the most devoted fan base on the planet like as soon as they announced this samsung broke every previous record they had for engagement levels their twitter was off the scale anyway the the box is fairly normal looking you've got a special edition sleeve which has seven hearts i think that's to symbolize the seven different members of this group and take that off okay to be fair they've put in some effort here this is what a normal galaxy s20 box might look like and compared to that we've got embossed purple text we've got a bts logo they've even actually hidden tiny little hearts in the pattern on the front okay let's take a lookie standard power brick standard cable and standard pair of akg earphones i mean so far this isn't as inspired as opposed editions but i'm guessing a big part of their budget probably went into just getting bts on board there is also a top compartment here ah this is where you get some special stuff goodness me okay so you've got a a set of psychedelic looking stickers here i think it's got the names of all the different members and you've got photos of all of them and here's the phone i like almost everything about this this is super well done except for that pink heart in the camera and let's just have a very quick look at the user interface not really fan of that to be honest i feel like if you're going to make a custom edition the very least you need to do is to make sure the icons on the home screen are all themed and the second part of it is galaxy buds well galaxy buds plus actually and as far as i'm aware this is a special box again lots of bts detailing they're kind of exactly what you would expect them to be they're purple shiny bts style galaxy buds the only weird thing actually is that the color of that doesn't seem to match the color of the phone now the second box is oh okay uh you get a case for the case there is one more thing i've got a sneaking suspicion what it is it's more photos i've got an entire collection of these guys faces but no like on a serious note like i could imagine someone being very very happy with this people just love bts like i remember one time samsung literally just posted a photo of one of the guys in this group holding their phones look at those engagement numbers all right screw it it's my time to shine i'm putting that one on instagram i'm expecting some big things all right the phones you've seen so far have been very much about trying to sell something at a similar price to the normal phone but just doing something special so that it gives people something to talk about but this is where we start getting expensive this is still an oppo like the first two phones but instead of being a find x2 this is a find x2 pro and instead of being a collaboration with league of legends this is a collaboration with lamborghini that's when you know it's serious and while i couldn't find an exact number of units made i remember i did see a headline saying that when it launched in germany there were only 35 phones available it's pretty clean looking this is nice this feels really really high-end okay it opens like a lamborghini this is like the i think they call them scissor doors they have on the actual cars oh yes that is my kind of case oh that's so nice it's like two-tone it's textured it's matte big fan and all these accessories actually so you've got a car charger here which is part carbon fiber on top and is that matched with gold it's such a it's such a classy finish this is a this is a set of wireless earphones which is actually a rarity to be included in a smartphone box because this is normally the way that companies get you to spend just a little bit more than you were planning to and again carbon fiber and gold okay this this speaks to me this is a nice cable i haven't even seen the phone yet but i'm just i'm such a fan of this look and it's finished off with another 65 watt charger this is probably my favorite so far i like the fact that they've kept it fairly simple it's not crazy they've stocked to two colors just black and gold and what they have added is class like this lamborghini logo at the bottom here i think that adds something to the phone the only thing i would say right is that i like car branded phones i think they're cool but i don't really want my phone to look like a car they've actually adjusted the shape of the phone to make it look like a sports car bonnet and i don't think i quite like it the software is not bad but i think it's one of those things i'd probably use for a week or so and then change back to something a bit cleaner a bit more conventional okay it's time it's time we moved from very expensive to extreme because the smartphone sitting inside this box is worth no less than nine thousand nine hundred and ninety dollars i was showing a drawing of it like a month ago and i forced myself to not look at it since then so i've pretty much forgotten what it looked like but this is special it's made by the company caviar they basically just create the most ludicrous custom smartphones and just for a bit of context this is based on the apple one computer which is the first product ever made by apple literally when the company was just a few guys working from a garage the apple one is like it's like the holy grail for apple collectors wow okay that's incredible though so underneath we've got a certificate of authenticity we've got international warranty and we've got a brochure about the apple one collection there is ear pods which i guess you wouldn't get with a normal iphone lightning cable and oh okay so this is one of caviar's specialized sim ejector tools it's shaped after a fish because caviar are fish eggs oh this thing is just nuts i actually love it so at its core this is a 128 gigabyte iphone 12 pro but just very very custom the back is mostly wood nothing crazy valuable but they're sticking with the theme they're trying to make something that looks like that first computer there's so much going on here like this logo that you're seeing in the top right that's the same logo that apple carved into the apple one computers it is crazy to think that this company who's now so sophisticated and polished they were just 40 years ago like doodling the word apple onto their products this is a monitor the kind of screen that you would plug the apple one into and for this phone it's actually made of titanium and then right at the bottom this is what you're paying for this is an actual fragment of an apple one computer and i'm assuming the scarcity of that part is the reason that they only made nine of these phones and this one's actually number one but yeah the detailing is spot on this is cool all right on to the last one this is the most expensive phone i've ever held actually scrap that this is the most expensive thing that's ever been in this room it's it's probably worth more than me we're talking 122 000 okay i'm really struggling to to wrap my head around that figure like if the apple one phone at ten thousand dollars is like extreme then what do you even call this this is like the ultimate god-tier unfathomable sell your kidney phone for 122 000 you could buy 122 iphone 12 pros 244 playstation 5's or you know a six bedroom house in albania alrighty okay let's do it i don't even have any words this is just i mean it's even got a light shining down on it that's ridiculous i think it's gonna be pretty much the same stuff as before so we've got uh international warranty as well as some sort of certificate of ownership it says caviar iphone 12 pro and they're calling this victory pure gold which i guess is a is a bit of a spoiler as to what's in it so we've got yep normal apple charger we've got earpods again i mean airpods would have been nice and same cable same sim ejector tool okay so i've got the product page loaded up here the entire thing is 18 karat gold it's so heavy oh my god it's like you've got like a gold ingot it's probably at least the weight of one and a half maybe two phones okay uh that would explain the price um so you've seen diamonds right you might know that they're graded on a scale you have diamonds with imperfections then diamonds with slight imperfections then diamonds with very slight imperfections and then the highest two grades of diamond are very very slight and flawless and the diamonds being used on this are very very slight but the kicker is that there's 55 of them where do you go from here i mean even if you could afford it i struggled to see someone buying this phone and still taking it out day to day it's just so much value to have in your pocket but i mean it is beautiful you just you don't see stuff like this every day if you're wondering what it is i don't think it's based on like one thing in particular but i think it's largely inspired by french baroque design baroque not broke although you might be after buying this phone kind of looks a bit like my old curtains can't really unsee it now and actually i just realized if you look really closely there's almost there's almost like microscopic detail here everything from between the flowers to between the rails on the sides it's almost like it's probably done with a laser just gonna carefully put this back and that's pretty much it this has been an absolutely crazy video it's been two months of me kind of emailing people collecting all these different phones just for one killer bit of content so if you did enjoy it do consider subscribing that'd be amazing my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one you
