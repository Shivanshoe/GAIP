you've probably seen the news just a few weeks ago facebook announced that they're changing their company name to meta because they're planning on building something called the metaverse i don't think enough people are talking about this the metaverse is going to change my life it's going to change your life so we need to understand what it is why people are excited about it but then also how it has the potential to end society as we know it the concept of the metaverse is this throughout history we have constantly been moving towards more and more engaging mediums we've gone from text to photo to video [Music] we've gone from reading books and papers to now spending most of our spare time watching tick tocks on the internet and the metaverse is what comes next an internet that you're not just looking at through a screen but that you're actually inside of take anything you could think of doing right now shopping chatting with friends meditating to asmr videos on youtube and now imagine that in the time it takes you to just snap your fingers you could be doing that thing in a way that feels real with other people who feel present in a setting that's whatever you want it to be a living shared everlasting virtual universe that's meta's vision of the metaverse achieved through a combination of augmented reality and virtual reality which they've said that they will subsidize the cost of in an effort to get as many people on this planet to be a part of the metaverse and in case i wasn't clear this is pretty damn cool then there are some undeniable positives like just to get the obvious out the way the metavest will allow you to live out your fantasies in one single evening you could be slaying enemies in handheld combat you could be playing a quiet game of chess on the streets of new york and surfboarding across the tropics of the bahamas all with incredible realism but at the same time the reassurance that you yourself are safe at home and on a similar note there is also a comfort to the idea that you'll also be able to express yourself however you want to you know how now you have a profile picture for your social media accounts the kind of the image that represents you to other people well in the metaverse you won't just have an image you will have an avatar a fully three-dimensional living depiction of you but you in the way that you would want to be did you ever wish you were three inches taller now you can be did you ever wish you had a bigger forehead now you can have one you can be any gender you want you can be any race you want you could be any creature you want yes milo i choose you and to be very clear longer term your avatar is not going to look like these cartoon people i think they just use them to make it seem a little bit less creepy the truth is though meta is also working on the tech to create completely lifelike avatars fully rendered with every hair on their head and if we pour on their skin this is not a game this will feel like real life and what i'm saying is that this realism combined with the sheer amount of choices you'll get will allow you to feel like you're not being constrained by the body that you are physically born into in real life you could be someone with a severe disability in a wheelchair but in the metaverse forget walking you could be able to fly and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be uplifting on the subject of flight though you know i've always dreamed about the idea of teleportation because i'm always trying to be as like efficient as possible with my time being stuck in traffic jams kind of horrifies me but in the metaverse there's going to be a relic of the past each person will have their own home space you create the aesthetic that you want others to see and then you can invite people to just appear within it wait what the teleportation will be the equivalent of just clicking a link in your browser now practically instant and if you compare that to the concept of real teleportation of literally deconstructing every atom in a person's body at one point in time and then recreating them somewhere else i think one of those two options is more likely to be the future of transport and it's not the real one besides if we are moving towards the metaverse and if all interactions are gonna happen virtually anyways we wouldn't even want to physically teleport we want to be at home with our headsets oh my god i'm lost man and it's not just travel that will speed up massively it's also learning you know how now we look at libraries as really old-fashioned because like why would you try and find out info from a book when you can google exactly what you want well the metaverse is going to make googling it seem just as old-fashioned you'll be able to learn about things by just touching them or even hell looking at them and to be able to obtain that information in a more visual interactive way than we've ever seen before you'll be able to travel not just to any place but also to any time the industrial revolution ancient rome dinosaurs being able to actually experience living with the dinosaurs can you imagine and hey if you can learn faster you can also do things faster i think the metaverse is going to make us even more productive take the current situation a lot of us now are working from home i mean to be honest i never really had a proper job but you know what i mean well in the metaverse we'd still be doing that but it could also mean that you could always be in your most optimal environment whether that's surrounded by others or completely alone whether that's in an office in outer space or sitting in a magical jungle whether you're surrounded by beethoven symphony while you work or just like the sound of silence it's up to you plus the tech will allow us to input faster a lot of us have grown up writing everything with pens nowadays people are shifting to tapping things on keyboards in the metaverse we'll be using voices gestures and even making things happen by just thinking about them i'm not joking meta is working now on electromyographic or emg input devices which can detect and intercept the impulses in your nerves the signals from when your brain is telling for example what your fingers what they should be doing and translate those signals to the corresponding actions in a virtual space or in other words you will be able to send a message to someone by just thinking about moving your fingers you won't even need to physically move them and this metaverse hardware it's not as far off as you think fun fact next year meta is coming out with a headset currently being code named project cambria which in one fell swoop will apparently solve two of the biggest current barriers to the metaverse one that it will be comfortable enough and the display will be sufficiently close to the resolution of your eyes but you won't feel like you're wearing a headset and two it'll be able to track your facial expressions in real time which if pulled off correctly will mean you'll be able to have conversations with realistic body language in a virtual space so these are the obvious benefits from the metaverse experiences expression teleportation knowledge and productivity but there's also a couple of potentially unexpected ones like the environment you see producing real products is really inefficient the production of a real car for example can quite easily result in 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions the production of a virtual car zero zero zero 0.00000 zero zero zero zero you name a number one and that gap in emissions only gets greater when you start to talk about potentially using that car i totally get that the idea of a virtual car sounds very odd and not at all comparable but think about it in the metaverse we have teleportation both virtual cars and physical cars are just as useless as each other you'd only drive on if you specifically fancied a drive not actually to get anywhere in particular and so what i'm saying is that it's quite likely that the more users that join the metaverse the more we shift towards purchasing digital goods and digital experience and so the fewer planes trains cars ships delivery vans we're going to use and thus our impact on the planet might well nosedive and the final kind of exciting thing is that the metaverse will also be a new economy the meta is developing a store within it called horizon marketplace which is not just them selling stuff to us but a platform where anyone can be a seller you could create virtual clothing you could craft a new virtual experience and charge people to try it you could design a completely new world anything and you're no longer constrained by the physical materials you can get hold of only your imagination and your ability to code and i've got no doubt that every forward-thinking brand will also make sure that they have a presence here because i mean if we're spending all our time in the metaverse and that's where we're going to meet people and appear to others then our virtual appearances and our virtual homes are actually going to start to matter more than our physical ones the point is in a new world you will also have new opportunities to earn and if you're wondering well how do we make sure people don't just buy one copy and then redistribute my creations my best guess is that transactions will largely happen through cryptocurrencies i've got a full video explaining those up there but essentially the idea is that crypto is built with the ability to verify the authenticity over virtual goods or in other words it already has the systems in place to be able to trace the ownership of them so honestly this whole metaverse thing has a pretty great sales pitch the ability to be together with anyone to be able to teleport to anywhere to be able to create and experience anything but it's also pretty scary there's four key things that i think we need to be very mindful of like data let's be honest facebook has had a pretty rocky relationship with how it's handled user data in the past and remember that's from an era where we were still somewhat separate from our digital selves but in the case where we become our digital selves where our profiles are not just a few holiday photos that we choose to share but literally everything we do in this metaverse we're going to have to put a whole new level of trust into a company that doesn't exactly reveal how they're using this information we're talking about data collection on the level of measuring your brain activity you wouldn't even give your family that kind of access but this is a future where you could be giving it to meta but something potentially even scarier than the data problem is that we are talking about how companies will be able to create virtual experiences that feel indistinguishable from real ones right i mean on one hand that is a miracle but isn't it also a little bit alarming we are already being shown predominantly only the content we agree with and the content that we want to see but if you take that concept into the realm of the metaverse we could completely lose touch with what's actually real the power to curate not just your newsfeed but your entire world now means that if you hate seeing homeless people well your metaverse can pretend that they don't exist if you didn't think kovid was real in your version of the metaverse it wouldn't be you if you only loved one tech brand and hated the rest in your metaverse that's all you'd need to see you won't even really know if what someone is saying to you is actually what the person behind that avatar is saying or if it's just what meta wants you to hear because it will keep you on the platform for the longest well let's say one of your friends accounts got hacked you could be sitting in the same room as a cyber criminal and you wouldn't even know we'd effectually be surrendering control of our entire sense of reality to other parties whose incentives are nothing to do with our best interests just making sure that i guess you see as many adverts as possible but there's more you might not know this but one of the biggest challenges of running a social media platform is actually in the moderation of it facebook already has entire warehouses filled with people who are just scanning for the absolute worst things people are posting hate speech terrorism exploitation and just trying to prevent as much of it as possible from spreading but it's one thing to try and police written text where you can very easily scan for potentially harmful keywords if meta want to carry on this moderation in something as complex and as open as the metaverse then they're gonna need to do it in a way that's incredibly invasive they're gonna have to be watching exactly what tattoos people's avatars have what the writing on their clothing is saying every single item you design or purchase for your home space every action will have to be monitored if they don't want it to turn into chaos okay these are all concerns but do you wanna know what my most fundamental fear is about the metaverse it's that we talk about all the cool things it will enable for our avatar that they'll be able to do what they want look how they want experience anything but it all leaves a big question about what happens to us at the end of the day right as incredible as the technology is we're still people we still need to eat healthy we need to drink lots of water we need to work out meet a partner have a family and i'm not convinced that the metaverse is going to help us continue to do that i think the metaverse is effectively the next generation of social media with all the positives and the negatives of those platforms taken to the absolute extreme you'll experience the highs of immersive shared experiences like never before but also harassment in a way that feels far closer and more uncomfortable misinformation that's more convincing and activities that are more addictive it's being pitched to something that will sit alongside our real lives to to complement them but i can't see a world where it wouldn't become our lives in a world where something of this power exists you won't be able to just pop off your headset and carry on with your day as normal the metaverse will feel no more optional than the internet does now you'll need it for work to get the required productivity you'll need it for social opportunities because that's where all your friends are you'll need it because relative to your life in the metaverse your real life will kind of suck can you imagine every night taking off your headset and going from this handsome prince who's just won the approval of your entire clan on an intergalactic voyage to then seeing your actual self in the mirror and remembering that you're not that person that you don't have the perfect face and body and that you can never do the things that your avatar can do the incentive won't be to start looking after our real selves because we can never get there it'll be to actually put our headsets back on and spend even more time in the metaverse and i think this will apply to jobs too the metaverse video shows us an example of what i can only assume is an architect who in the metaverse can productively design buildings with his team but if you really think about it assuming the metaverse becomes what it's setting out to we're not going to need the buildings that they're designing a matter of fact in a world where you can just tap a few keys and have whatever you want appear in front of you surely most people won't have jobs in the realm of technology it's increasingly possible for more things to be done by the few people who know how you won't need engineers you won't need gardeners you won't need window cleaners you'll just need people with ideas and people who know how to turn those ideas into virtual goods we talk about the future as driverless cars and hyper-connected cities but if the metaverse takes over we're not going to need cars we're not going to need cities all we'll need is a good internet connection and a seat okay the last thing i'm going to say about this is that the metavest is not one thing that one moment it's not there and then suddenly it is it's not a question of if we're going to get there or how we're going to get there the metaverse is actually here it's now and it's only going to keep evolving towards what the company meta is talking about just take fortnite this started off as a game but it's now so much more than that it's become the platform in which a whole generation of people hang out they go shopping in they even attend concerts in fun fact i recently got some graphic design work done for my channel and the guy i hired asked for payments not in dollars but fortnight v bucks because to that person buying in-game items was more valuable than buying real life items the metavest is not just a facebook thing it's the universe that all of these big tech companies together are slowly but surely pouring tens of billion dollars into creative together facebook is just the first one to make its part in it official i think it's an inevitable future but there is one thing that i think could ease a lot of my concerns about it to keep the metaverse open source i.e to make sure that all the code of how it's working remains public so that'll mean less concerns about your data less concerns about spying it'll be less about trust us your personal information is safe more like i can see that my personal information is safe and while this will probably make developments slower because with open source projects there is much less of a profit incentive compared to keeping your secret source behind closed doors maybe that's a good thing maybe that will give us more time for the regulation and people thinking to catch up with the technology itself on the note of data though you probably know the holidays are coming up black friday cyber monday we're all about to be buying gifts from lots of different stores signing up to lots of different services and handing out our data like it's everyone's birthday but let me ask you a question do you have any idea how many companies hold this data and more importantly how to actually get it back a lot of people assume that at the point where they delete an app from their phone or deactivate one of their social media accounts that their data just disappears but the truth is unless you specifically write to a company and exercise your right to be forgotten all your sensitive personal data address phone number everything will just sit on a growing number of servers from every single thing you've ever signed up to and well it goes without saying the more servers the higher the risk of a leak and this is what mine is trying to counter they're the sponsors of this video and their app gives you a visual summary of exactly which companies know what about you and then how to get it back so if i sign up with my email address on sameion.com i can see that oh there 751 companies have my data so the idea is that i can just click on any one of these companies it'll tell me what type of data they hold the risk level they have for a data breach and then i can just hit reclaim if i decide that i don't want them to have it any longer and that's it with mine i can send a data erasure request to that company from my inbox so i'll leave a link down below to find out more it's completely free to use but the big picture right here is that to enjoy the internet today you need to be open to handing out your personal data and that's why you need mine to get it back to check out one of the most pro smartphones i've ever seen click here or to see why i'm worried about humanity which links quite a lot to this topic that video's here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one
