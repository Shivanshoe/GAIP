welcome to my top 18 tech fails each one so disastrous that they've had to be banned so number 18 is an app called send me to heaven it doesn't actually kill you like the name suggests but it does kill your phone it tells you to throw your device up as high as you can in the air and then catch it on the way down the higher the throw the more points you get but then the higher the chance of a concussion when it does come back i've just agreed to like 16 different disclaimers okay three two one go see what i got 5.35 meters you taking the mic i guess unsurprisingly it didn't take apple long to permanently ban the app for all iphones two out of ten fail all right number 17 i probably don't need to tell you that tesla makes some of the highest rated electric cars in the world right now incredibly tech focused and almost minimalist the entire thing is often controlled by just one big screen in the middle but this also has its downsides as people have recently found that when you fast charge your tesla at a charging station the car's electronics can get so hot that this screen stops working properly it's been seen to become unresponsive sometimes even just go straight up blank which given that the screen on a tesla contains like 90 of the controls for your car is a pretty major blunder and as such tesla has had to recall 130 000 of them to try and fix it 3 out of 10 fail horrendous mishap but saved partly by the fact that no one seems to have had an accident because of it yet okay who here likes a good time do you also like danger and head injuries by enchants no well hasbro does because in 2004 after years of development the famous toy company came out with this the super soaker monster rocket and it was a technical marvel yes i've had to blow this entire thing myself it is a seven foot rocket locked into this base here it's got a tank that's filled with water and basically what you do is you pump air through it to load that water at a high pressure into the rocket oh milo you come to watch oh never mind right so now that that's at its maximum i should be able to press this trigger to release that lock and water will be ejected out at a blistering pace to launch this rocket into the sky now you've probably gathered this already but the monster rocket was not a safe toy the water tank in the rocket had a tendency to explode the cap on top of the bottle had a tendency of flinging off and smacking people in the face and because the rockets themselves flew so high they also managed to knock people out on the way down yeah hasbro was literally giving kids concussions so no they didn't last very long on store shelves i have no idea how this is going to go three two one oh no i guess that makes it even more of a fail then can we just animate it in the edit while i leave some bad feedback on ebay i feel even worse though for the owners of the polaris razer cars see polaris is one of the top brands for these high-speed off-road vehicles and so it's kind of unfortunate that they've managed to have not one but two separate waves of recalls for these razer cars in the space of a few months it was bad enough that one of the battery cables was incorrectly routed leading to electrical failure but also and this is quite problematic for a car the steering wheels were coming off can you imagine you're just kind of going for it 100 miles an hour against a rocky cliff face until you suddenly realize oh that would be my steering wheel this has no doubt given a lot of users a free near-death experience and for five especially unlucky drivers it's caused them to completely lose control and actually their vehicles to flip over while they're still inside i almost can't believe i'm saying this but number 14 is a video game and when i first came across this i was like come on you can't ban a video game for violence but then i saw it we're talking about manhunt 2 released back in 2007 and it is genuinely chilling you play as an escaped mental patient and the game encourages you to go around stalking victims and when you find them and when an opportunity presents itself murdering them in the most sadistic way possible but the strangest part of the whole thing is the callous tone with which the game presents this it's almost as if it's just a normal thing to do so almost immediately upon release it was banned in britain and ireland suspended in the united states and pretty much all of the most violent parts censored around the world which as you can imagine didn't do wonders for the sales volumes four out of ten fail okay we all have a good bargain and so when indian automotive company tata motors announced the tata nano a full four seater hatchback car available to buy for the equivalent of just 1 400 if people quite understandably lost their minds it didn't have air conditioning and it was a bit of a squeeze at full capacity but for someone whose budget would only otherwise allow for a scooter or a motorbike it seemed like a fair price to pay now the lesson we learned though is that there are only so many corners you can cut on a car before it starts to become a hazard the nano also compromised on the quality of its circuits airbags metals its batteries every single part of this car was basically the cheapest that tata motors could get leading to at least 10 cases of these nanos spontaneously exploding into flames now what's another thing that really doesn't mix well with fire hazards oh yeah babies as the company lorex who specializes in baby monitors found out the hard way in 2016 the company released their flagship product the ironically named care and share range and it was popular it was their most technologically advanced yet it allowed parents to not just see their kids from afar but also to snap photos of them motion track them if they moved it even had night vision unfortunately all of this tech being crammed into such a tight space led to not 5 not 10 but 488 reports of overheating including situations where the battery packs were actually expanding causing the outer casing of the monitor to physically shoot off potentially explosive electronic devices in the same room you keep your toddler five out of ten great plan and if you are finding this interesting then a sub to the channel would be naughty ah the electric blanket cozy cuddly warm and highly flammable all you need to do is to ask the customers of invospar who in 2020 bought themselves a shiny new silky velvet electric blanket which like most electric blankets has a thin layer of electric cabling inside of it which is used to raise its temperature but inverse bars cabling lost control of that temperature how did customers find out by using it by waking up in the middle of the night with burns across their body can you imagine you'd be having like the worst nightmare ever and then you would wake up and realize that the pain was actually real eventually the u.s product safety commission they had to get involved issuing a mandatory recall of 7 000 of these blankets and if we have a look at the invoice bar websites now there is not a sign of one of them so i can only assume that they were told to never sell a blanket again anyway if you think that last one was scary then welcome to the top 10. these ones are probably gonna keep you up at night so this thing right here is a pacemaker it's a tiny little device that you can get implanted inside of you it's hooked up directly to your heart and it sends electrical signals to it to make sure that it beats in a stable rhythm now with that in mind this is pretty much the one piece of tech that you do not want to go wrong but you know what video we're in introducing the healthcare company abbott who built their pacemakers to be radio controlled but then they didn't add in any security measures meaning that any other person could buy a remote control from ebay and use it to i kid you not hack the patient's heartbeats to either run the battery of the pacemaker down or even to make it go so fast that it could kill them instantly thankfully abbott did act fast before anyone died asking all 465 000 people who had one to come back to their practice and urgently updating their pacemaker software but wow six out of ten fail you've really got to trust a company before connecting them directly to your heart but it actually gets creepier still with clearview ai the company who described themselves as world's largest facial network and unfortunately it is exactly what it sounds like this company holds and collates billions of photos of people's faces gathering them from literally any source it can find including your social media pages without asking you they market themselves as if they solely exist for law enforcement like if the police wanted to find out who a potential criminal is they can hand clear view just one image of them and then this company can link that to every shot in their database and more often than not come back with all of that person's details however they've recently been accused of going one step too far by actually selling this data to just private companies and people for nothing more than market research purposes imagine a world where a complete stranger could just take one random photo of you while you're walking down the street and then through that find out everything from your home address to your nan's phone number should technology of that power even exist thankfully governments have stepped in making it completely illegal in canada and australia and in most other countries constricting its use to purely governmental right have you had a fitbit the google owned fitness company that helps you to burn calories through the use of their smart trackers well calories aren't the only thing they're burning right now in the ever-moving race to squeeze as much tech as possible into a tiny space for their fitbit ionic smartwatch the company didn't give their batteries enough calling so they started to overheat but i'm not talking to the point of like oh this is getting a bit toasty they were getting hot enough to burn through the skins of people's wrists which is kind of terrifying because it's not like at that point you can just quickly fling it away if you suddenly get burned it's strapped in at least 78 burns were reported which was enough to push this company to recall all 1.7 million of these ionics that already pushes it into a six out of ten fail category but it might actually be about to get worse because now a lawsuit has been filed which says that the burn problem actually affects all fitbit devices and that the company's just been trying to sweep the issue under the rock okay time to dial things up further from skin burns to explosives i'm of course talking about this guy now you're probably quite familiar with the note 7 story already samsung released the phone people absolutely loved it but then it started exploding thanks to samsung trying to cram the battery into a space that really wasn't big enough for it people got second degree burns thanks to this phone and so maybe the even more surprising part of this is that we've actually managed to get one after these started blowing up and they were banned from trains planes in just about every single public location almost all of them were urgently recalled but a few remain oh my god look at that a real galaxy note 7. so let's see man it's so crazy that this used to be like the cutting edge it just looks so dated next to the current s22 ultra but yeah i mean this is the real original home screen of the galaxy note 7. the last thing a lot of people saw before disaster the note 7 never killed anybody but apart from that it was pretty much as bad as it could get we're not talking like hundreds of thousands of dollars lost not even millions the latest estimates suggest that samsung lost 17 billion dollars from people turning to other brands because of this 17 billion dollars i mean that's enough money to buy the white house 43 times over 7 out of 10 fail and so i will now turn this off and probably never touch it again all right number six now is where these products become fatal starting with pelleting the company who's developed a bit of a name for their smart treadmills they allow people to join in on live classes from the comfort of their own homes well it looks like this company spent a little too long focusing on the tech and not quite long enough on the safety this significant gap underneath the track combined with an incredibly grippy material created the perfect opportunity for both kids and pets to be dragged underneath this is giving me shivers just looking at it there were no less than 72 reports of this happening thankfully this kid was fine but many of them had abrasions broken bones and lacerations one child even died so obviously this product was taken back and never sold again i can't give it less than a 7 out of 10 fail but this next one might surprise you it's the selfie stick case in point in 2014 the combination of more and more people wanting to share their personal stories with others combined with the improving image quality of smartphones meant that selfie sticks exploded in popularity you couldn't go to a tourist destination and not find like 20 people walking around with what amounts to a three-foot metal lance in front of them and there are two problems with this one that these are a genuine hazard to people around you with countless reports of accidental poking slicing and even gouging but two they're an even bigger threat to the user who in many cases just completely forget what's around them resulting in at least 150 reported deaths through a gruesome combination of cliff plunges drowning and even electrocution that is five times the amount of deaths reported from shark attacks in the same time period so this bad boy is at least an eight out of ten and even though selfie sticks aren't banned everywhere now you will regularly find restricted zones where you can't take them out now if you were alive in america during the 1980s then you'll remember lord arts and if you do there's a not negligible chance that the lawn darts made you unalive not technically a tech product but very much a disaster the idea was simple darts is fun outdoor time is fun let's mix the two together and see how many eyes we can take out you would stand in one circle and then try to throw the darts into another circle 35 feet away from you however the combination of having to throw these so hard for them to get there with the variability that comes from wind and the large sharpened metal tips on the ends made this one of the most horrific product launches of all time like if you think the 72 injuries from that peloton were bad lawn darts managed to fast-track 6 100 people straight to the emergency rooms of hospitals most of them being younger than the age of 15. right as if it couldn't get any worse number three is a medicine that can kill people i wish i was joking so you know pfizer that big drug company who's become one of the main suppliers of covet vaccines yeah they haven't had the smoothest history one of their biggest previous products was an anti-inflammatory pain relief medication called bextra and fisa had big hopes for dextra as far as they were concerned it was a technological marvel a revolutionary class of painkillers safer than normal medicines and of course 20 times the price and while that's already a tough pill to swallow the real crime that this company committed was going behind the backs of the fda the u.s food and drugs administration the fda had only approved the use of vextra for a very specific purpose but pfizer feeling like they had a mainstream winner on their hands started also marketing it as a more general treatment for pain around the body plus in an effort to shift as much of this stuff as possible they started selling it at two times the initially agreed dosage the result 87 cases of severe and i mean very very severe sometimes fatal skin reactions combined with an elevated risk of heart attacks for all patients and so quite deservedly backstrap was taken off the shelves pfizer had to pay a 2.3 billion dollar fine and the subsidiary who supplied the medicine was slapped with criminal charges for false marketing and deception so yeah this feels like a pretty good time to award a 9 out of 10 fail and while we're on the topic of medicine we can't make a list of band tech and not at least mention thoroughness long story short there was a lady called elizabeth holmes who created a device that could perform hundreds of different types of blood tests but only using a single tiny pinprick blood sample it was completely game-changing in concept because it would single-handedly invalidate all of the fafsa having to take many different samples and then sending them to many different labs to undergo many different tests this one unit would do everything except it was a lie it was shown that the machine didn't work and that holmes actually knew that it didn't work but had gone to an extreme extent to trick investors into thinking that it did but it's not just that thoroughness was not useful false blood readings are life-threatening they're the difference between getting the treatments that you need to live and not and i guess what makes this one of the biggest tech fails of all time is the sheer fall that this girl had when the public found out one moment she was the multi-billionaire poster child for silicon valley the next she had a net worth of zero the potential to be sentenced for up to 20 years in prison and even a hulu show being made just about her failure i really want to give theranos a 10 out of 10 fail but the next one is just such a catastrophe that i'm gonna give it a night okay so you might have heard of the boeing 737 is the most successful commercial plane in existence so many different airlines use this one machine and so it was a pretty huge deal when the boeing company announced its successor the boeing 737 max it could travel further faster and more efficiently it had lower running costs and a much nicer interior except it hadn't been tested thoroughly enough before making it public a combination of some sensors that weren't working as planned and some new software which was not explained properly to pilots led to not one but two crashes in quick succession and let's be very clear when a plane goes down it is a tragedy no one survives so this one product caused the death of 346 people before it was suspended by most countries the 737 max it has recently started recirculating again now but boeing has apparently lost tens of billions because of it a true 10 out of 10 fail in all aspects right i've spent 20 minutes now telling you about tech that you should never use so i want to finish with just one but you definitely should the opera desktop browser it's just like your current browser but with five things that take it to the next level when you're watching videos like this you can tap one button to turn them into floating videos to watch in the background while you're doing other things your social media accounts can be linked to your browser so without leaving what you're doing you can reply to your instagram dms or your facebook messages it has a built-in ad blocker which stops all of those really annoying often inappropriate ads from appearing which as a byproduct also speeds up the browser you can import all of your bookmarks and settings from your current browser into opera and it literally takes like five seconds and then number one is the pin board which is like the one place to collect all of your web content so if i'm planning a huge shopping spree for example i can use this to keep track of all the various different products that i'm eyeing up there's actually a ton more really cool things about this especially for shoppers but i won't spoil it i will let you experience it for yourself so link in the description to get it for free to check out my full playlist of tech fail videos that's here or to see one of the most fun flagship smartphones that i've ever tested that video is here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss i'll catch you in the next one
