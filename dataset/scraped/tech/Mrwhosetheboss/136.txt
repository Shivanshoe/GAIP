so this is the galaxy z fold two and as someone who was a long-term user of the original galaxy fold it's kind of exciting it literally takes the fold and addresses almost every single problem people had with it but i would argue that the one problem they haven't fixed is actually the biggest most fundamental problem on the facebook though whoa you know i was watching this reveal with a smile slowly creeping across my face the front screen on the first fold was a bit of a joke this tiny panel with a weird aspect ratio but they fixed it replaced with something that now pretty closely resembles a good mid-range smartphone display the old fold was cool to look at but it didn't feel like a premium product that you just spent two thousand dollars on but they fixed it by swapping the plain sticky glass back of before to a similar map finish found on the note 20 ultra and the whole look these flatter more defined lines give it character it looks like a really high quality book now and i meant that as a compliment the fold had durability issues and even had to be recalled just because it was getting damaged so easily but they fixed it probably the z42 has a redesigned hinge mechanism that should be snappier and it uses a display with ultra thin glass elements in it for better scratch resistance you're probably getting the idea this new model is more powerful it's more fluid with a 120 hertz screen refresh rate on the inside displays and it's got better cameras this isn't the best camera system samsung makes but it's close enough and when i was watching this reveal trailer it's kind of cool i was genuinely having a flashback to 2013. the year that samsung showed us this trailer of a foldable phone and we just lost our minds it seemed like a piece of science fiction or even just a figment of someone's imagination and it is nuts to think that just seven years later they've pretty much built that i'm happy samsung made this it's fresh it's exciting it pushes other companies to experiment and it even looks like it's going to be super fun to use so what is my problem with this seemingly huge upgrade well to put it simply i don't think this is the best way to make a foldable and even though samsung has had this vision since 2013 and it's wildly impressive that they managed to execute it now that this is a real product with a real price tag i just want to be really practical about it how many screens do we have on this phone two the front screen and the inner folding one how many can we use at any one time one how many sets of cameras do we have three one on the back one on the inside one on the front what is the maximum we can use at once one now just for a second put this side by side with the outward folding huawei mate x how many screens one which you'll be using no matter whether you're folded up or folded out how many sets of cameras one and at any point in time you can use all of them you can take rear camera photos using all of them and also your selfies with the same high-grade cameras this is one of those things that i didn't fully appreciate until i started using phones that could do this it means that when you're taking let's say an instagram story your quality would go from something like this to something like this plus because you've got screen on the back of your phone that also allows the person you're taking a photo of to see themselves while you're taking it now i'm not saying huawei's foldable is better than this z-fold 2. it isn't they priced it really high it's only got a standard 60hz display panel and of course no google services which means you really need to know what you're doing for me to recommend it to you but i do think their form factor makes more sense when you fold up the z42 you have one display at the top stacked on top of a bunch of components stacked on top of two more layers of folded display and then more components the outer screen design by only having one display just saves on a huge amount of thickness and i'm not really someone who cares about a couple of millimeters here or there but in this case it's the difference between something that feels like a smartphone first but just one that happens to be able to flip out into a tablet versus something that feels like a tablet first that if you really needed to you can fold it up into something resembling a tv remote even folded up that huawei was 11 millimeters thick which is thicker than almost every normal phone but close enough to still feel like one the galaxy fold is over 15 millimeters that's two phones worth of thickness and even though we don't have an exact number for the z42 yet it's thicker than it could have been that's the point plus from what i've been told this new samsung only uses a 120hz display on the main inside panel but only a 60hz screen on the front that's gonna be so jarring if you've ever used a 120hz display it's amazing but you'll also have noticed when you go back to using 60hz screens you really feel it and with this kind of setup you're going to feel it every single time you open and close your device oh my god my device is so fast oh wait no it's not it's just normal if you have one display you can have 120 hertz no matter which form factor you're in and the fact that samsung's design requires three separate sets of cameras for each way you decide to use your phone takes up internal room so even though this first fold was literally half a phone thicker than that huawei mate x it still had a smaller battery and this brings me onto the elephant in the room price the first fold and almost certainly the next galaxy z4 2 are inhibitively expensive phones to be fair so with the huawei foldables and i do have a theory about this that for the time being none of these companies actually need or even want people to buy their foldables that they're just serving as a really subtle form of advertising to build associations in people's minds as being innovative companies it would also explain how even with the pandemic they've made sure their note series and all their other important products are still on time but the fold that's delayed but the point i actually want to make here is that even if samsung did want to make their phones affordable let's say one year they decide they want mass appeal then they can't really do that with a form factor like this because they've made their cost of production sky high like think about it with this phone they've got to build not just one super amoled ultra crispy panel but two and they have to make sure that both are as good as each other for consistency and two sets of front cameras cost money there's a bit of a fallacy with this kind of thing i remember when that first galaxy fold came out people were talking about how it had six cameras as if it was some sort of benefit literally there's an android central comparison here versus the huawei and again i'm not defending the huawei phone but this comparison marks having six cameras as one of the main plus points it isn't it sounds impressive but the reality of it is if you could get away with using just three high-end cameras for everything you would you'd end up with a slimmer phone that's cheaper to produce and one that takes consistently good quality photos whether they're from the rear camera or the front camera because they're the same now i don't wanna make it seem like i'm trampling all over this idea and that the fold is doomed to fail because really now that huawei is out of the picture for a lot of consumers samsung doesn't really have any competition the point of this video is not to say that the z42 is going to be a bad phone i might use it and decide i love it but the point is more that the money you pay for it is not being used very efficiently now that huawei outward folding style is not perfect it does present a couple of issues a that the screen is more prone to scratching being on the outside and b because an outward fold has a larger radius than an inward fold there's a risk of a more obvious crease and i don't want to downplay these these are issues but i feel like they're solvable issues and when you solve them you'll end up with a better phone huawei's second generation mate xs was already way more resistant to both scratches and creases so with one more iteration of this they'd probably be there plus display materials of improving every year and if need be you could just build a slightly raised border around the screen the same way that samsung's inside display has a border and that would more or less prevent your outer screen from touching surfaces you leave it on you might remember a video i made about apple not too long ago back in 2007 every company was out there just giving people what they wanted you want a bigger screen here you go you can have it you want a better typing experience here you go here's a nicer keyboard but the reason apple succeeded with the iphone is that they took a step back and decided to give people what they didn't even know they wanted and that's what i think needs to happen with foldables for the first time since 2007 we're back in that same place again almost every phone looks one way but all of a sudden we've got this entirely new category that really could be anything don't get me wrong listening to consumer feedback is a brilliant way to improve your product they will tell you if something isn't quite right but in this particular case with a new product category consumers don't have a point of reference to actually know what they want yet if samsung sticks with this style and just keeps fixing problems that the consumers have they've almost assumed that in this entire wild west of possibilities for how to build a foldable that they got it right first time and i don't think they did also two other quick things in all official images they kind of use specific wallpapers to hide where the front camera is on the inside display but based on the leaks that's because the actual position they ended up with doesn't look particularly good and i think it would have looked way better in either the far left or the far right corners also i just think the name galaxy z fold 2 5g is not a good choice i get that samsung's trying to unify its foldables under the z brand name but honestly for the first time with that original galaxy fold non-techie people were asking me about a phone that original fold brand had power and i think if samsung had just called this the galaxy fold 2 that would have brought a lot of those people back in again but as it stands now with the z and the 5g this looks like it might be something else from the outside so yeah brilliant looking phone might be incredible to use all i'm saying is that i think it could have been better but thanks a lot for watching if you enjoyed this video a sub would be incredible my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next you
