i actually feel like a superhero oh this is such a thrill i'm about to show you the top 14 real superhero abilities things straight out of a movie that you will actually be able to acquire this decade thanks to technology we're gonna have so much fun with this and we're gonna keep powering up as we go so at number 14 we have a company called mojovision who developed a display technology that allows us to experience augmented reality just like iron man does so you know how right now to use augmented reality we need some sort of screen right whether that's using it whether that's using your smartphone like people did with pokemon go or a headset which puts the display right in front of your face but mojo vision has created the next and arguably final level of this a contact lens that puts a display directly onto our pupils because this thing is sitting so close to our eyes it can get away with using a micro led screen the size of a grain of sand and so the result is that it draws practically zero energy and can therefore be powered by minuscule batteries that also fit within the outer ring of the contact lens itself three out of ten on the super power scale okay echolocation is a phenomenon that we've observed for years in the natural world where animals such as bats they emit sound waves into the environment and then listening to the echoes that return as those sound waves bounce off various objects can determine where things are humans can do this too in a very approximate sense by snapping our fingers or tapping a cane on the floor but now a startup in kazakhstan called seswal has developed true echolocation for human beings with the potential to make us all battery they've developed a specialized speaker system that you basically wear around your neck it emits continuous high pulse clicks that bounce off surrounding objects and arrive back at it and then it uses this to quantify their distance their shape and even their material and the best part about the whole thing is that because this is using sound it works just as well at night as it does during the day but one scenario where sound completely falls apart is when you're in a noisy environment like a hurricane introducing the molar microphone which instead of sitting in front of your mouth actually sits inside your mouth and so even in the most extreme weather conditions it allows you to talk and be heard clearly that's not even the best bit because it also lets you hear the other person when they speak instead of their sound coming into your ear via a headset or an earpiece or an airpod this mic allows you to receive that same type of auditory information but instead using a new auditory pathway through your tooth through your cranial bones directly to your auditory nerve which means that you can discretely cheat your exams i mean coordinate rescue missions we're talking encrypted wireless communication clear enough to whisper in a hurricane that's a four out of ten superpower right there you know i can't help but feel like in these superhero movies it's never the heroes who get the best tech always the villains just like green goblin with this goblin glider and i almost can't believe i'm saying this we've managed to make one of those too with the omni hoverboards an octocopter that looks like pure sci-fi but is actually a really simple device a carbon fiber frame eight underslung rotors a pair of snowboarding boots and a hand throttle which is actually just a modified pair of pliers that you use to control your height plus unlike petrol-based jetsuits it is a fraction of the price and runs on pure electricity so it's quiet and clean five out of ten there's nothing like an eco-conscious villain and somehow you can now according to the omni hoverboard website actually order one upon request although given that drones are already such a big privacy debate i can't imagine that a flying platform with an actual person on top whizzing around your neighborhood is going to go down so well now we all love the idea of being strong i mean there's a reason that gym memberships are growing by 10 a year in most countries well how would you feel if just like the hulk you could double your muscle mass without ever setting foot in a gym sounds like a pretty good deal to me and it's actually achievable thanks to crispr cat9 a gene editing tool that allows scientists to cut and paste segments of dna more precisely than ever before it turns out we all have a protein in our bodies called myostatin that basically tells your muscles to stop growing when it thinks you have enough remember more muscle isn't always a good thing but let's just say that your entire objective in life was to become a living pork chop then just for you scientists figured out how to use crispr to be able to knock out this myostatin protein which means that your muscles will no longer be kept in check they've tried this already on dogs mice cows fish and no joke i've never in my life seen animals this jacked i swear even this mouse could probably take me so it's seeming pretty inevitable that this will also work on humans too but what if there was an even faster way what if just like war machine you can actually slip on an exosuit that will instantly give you the strength of not two but 20 humans i'm not making this stuff up the sarcos guardian exo is a very real next generation full body robotic exoskeleton that can detect where you're planning to move your limbs and then redirect its power into whatever thing you're pushing pulling or lifting this thing is insane you could lift your entire collection of appliances your refrigerator your washing machine all while maintaining perfect ergonomic posture it prevents you from falling over and just like our superhero buddies you can mount and unmount the suit in 30 seconds flat i want to say 6 out of 10. so we've had wind we've had earth the one element that we've not yet touched is fire and the pyro mini is a real gadget that you can actually buy that grants you this power they split this construction video into 15 parts are you taking the mick you know i've been very badly in the past where you know my skin's literally been hanging off my hand why is this so emotional i'm trying to shoot fire from my wrist and that is a good size load there so welcome to our state-of-the-art testing facility so i've nicked a toy from milo as our test dummy sorry okay so what this does is straps onto your wrist and then uses flash paper which is a type of tissue that's treated with nitric acid to burn very quickly to allow you to shoot flames from it so the second that i trigger this it's gonna fire out tiny fragments of this flash paper and then set them on fire as they're leaving the barrel which in theory should carry that fireball outwards hey how's it going oh this was originally intended for magicians as like a finishing flourish to their magic tricks but who hasn't dreamt of this all right here goes nothing i can't believe this i actually feel like a superhero oh okay i missed but that's the beauty of this thing it's double-barreled which means that i can just take a step forward come right up to its face and try again this is such a thrill oh two full loads right in the face i'm so sorry i love you really that is a six out of ten who is the most iconic superhero though it's got to be superman right well we're halfway to becoming him too one of superman's key pillars is his ability to stop bullets in their tracks and now thanks to a breakthrough new material us mere mortals could have that too and let's be very clear i'm not talking about big bulky bulletproof vests thanks to the power of graphene which is effectively a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a perfectly formed lattice you're going to be able to stop bullets with a material that's not just practically invincible but also practically invisible see when mechanical pressure is applied to graphene because of its insane physical structure which has a ludicrous surface area to volume ratio it can distribute that pressure incredibly quickly the whole reason that bullets are so deadly is that they concentrate momentum into a very small area but by spreading that out it allows your body to absorb the impact and the most insane part of this is that this bulletproofing can be achieved with just two layers of stacked graphene so just for perspective this t-shirt i'm wearing is about 250 000 atoms thick this bulletproof layer will only add two atoms to that figure seven out of ten you really get the feeling that when superman was being designed the creators just kind of thought of every single thing that would make a person super and handed it to him the guy even has x-ray vision which at the time was not at all technologically viable notice i said at the time see the reason that we've been unable to see through walls so far is that walls are opaque they block visible light but what they don't block is radio waves radio waves emitted from our microwaves our light bulbs our smartphones they travel through walls and so there is a team of researchers at mit who've created a system called rf pose that allows them to pick up the disturbances in radio waves caused by someone on the other side of a wall it's incredible you can see in real time a person walking behind a wall and this ai-based system using its understanding of the kinds of disturbances that a human would make to radio waves to be able to carry on tracking them even though as far as your eyes are concerned they are gone and this is useful for so many things you could put it in everything from an old people's home to keep an eye on residents and to make sure they don't fall over to rescue missions involving finding people buried under rubble okay we've talked a fair bit about superman but even with all of his frankly ridiculous powers the most popular superhero now is in fact your friendly neighborhood spider-man with his ability to climb buildings we finally figured out how he does it but the answer doesn't lie in spiders like we've been led to believe but in fact geckos who are still able to scale walls and hang upside down even though they're much heavier creatures and the key to their success lies in their toe pads which are covered in tiny hair-like structures called set-eye which create an adhesive force as they come into contact with the surface so the company draper has used this exact mechanism to develop a material called microhold which is the key component of their z-man climbing system i feel like i should just reiterate how much of a big deal this is this system allows you to without a ladder or a rope or any kind of harness climb completely vertical glass metal or brick that's an eight spandex outfit not included okay let's shift gears for a minute to medicine where one of the key focuses in recent years has become diagnosis how do we find out if something's wrong before it becomes a problem the answer according to many at least is nanobots incredibly small robots about the size of a cell that can be released into your bloodstream travel around your body to your various organs and assess your health from the inside current nanobots are pretty basic scientists have just figured out how to make them move off their own accord but in the future they could sample blood from all your different organs they could take temperature readings they could tell you that you've caught a bug days before your symptoms kick in and even detect cancers right before they start to spread and dissect them from the inside effectively giving you the power of regeneration and the coolest part is that being connected devices the next time you need to go into the doctor's office to have your bloods taken let's say when you're feeling rough your doctor will instead just be able to see your stats in real time over the internet but if you're more of a bruce banner whose key strength is not insane muscles or his ability to prevent a blood clot it's his mind then you'll be pleased to know that hum is a wearable head wrap that can make you smarter in five seconds so part of the function of our brains is something called our working memory this is where we store all of our temporary information like numbers names shopping lists and this kind of memory relies on what's known as theta waves theta waves are what coordinate the various different parts of the brain to allow this working memory to be possible think of them like the conductors in an orchestra keeping everything in harmony and so what this wearable does is generally boost the power of theta waves the company is suggesting that if you're stuck with a maths problem or an exam putting home on for just 15 minutes will enable an almost superhuman level of brain activity even if this isn't the product to take over you can be rest assured that brain augmentation is on its way how do you top that then well it's one thing to have a powerful mind it's another thing entirely to have mind control but this too is becoming possible thanks to the drone from ultra electronics all you do is you place this band around your head and just from that what it's able to do is to pick up activity in your brain's visual cortex so to put it another way it will know not just what your pupils are looking at but also what your brain is interpreting from that information and so with this in mind the company have also designed a computer program to go with it which creates multiple zones on screen each representing different commands for this drone because the headband knows what's being triggered in your visual cortex it will know what zone you're thinking about and so it can then map those thoughts into commands which the drone then executes that's just mind blowing nine out of ten it's tech like this which could turn normal soldiers sitting in trenches into super soldiers capable of so much more but speaking of soldiers we've got to talk about explosions when there is an explosion let's say that a bomb was dropped on a city it creates two problems for humans fragments and shock waves created by the very sudden compression of air we can stop these fragments with reinforced doors and body armor but the shock waves are a problem as they can go through it all so to protect troops in combat the company boeing has obtained a patent that effectively allows them to just like scarlet which create a real force field the plan would be to equip all high priority targets let's say a car carrying the president with ultra high power lasers that when fired into each other can create an actual plasma field a small area with a completely different molecular composition to normal air and thus can disrupt the shock wave that relies on the compression of this normal air to continue to propagate now if you've ever wondered what a superhero would eat i have a strong suspicion it would be hewle this video's sponsor this is not an exaggeration huel is the only way that i manage to get everything that i want to do done whilst giving my body good nutrition you just mix heal powder with water in the provided shaker and voila you have what tastes like a thick milkshake but what's actually a full meal made with coconut peas rice protein flaxseed and more just natural ingredients and if you want to take it to the next level you've got black edition it takes normal fuel but manages to cut the carbs by 50 while adding in 33 more protein i've just actually started a workout plan like four weeks ago and i'm using this black edition to get my protein intake up and to make sure that i'm getting the key vitamins and minerals too so here the link in the description to give fuel a shot you'll also get a free shaker and a fuel t-shirt trust me when i say best fitting t-shirts i own to check out my video all about the thinnest tech in the world click here or for the cheapest gadgets you've ever seen that video is here my name is aaron this is the boss i'll catch you in the next one [Music]
