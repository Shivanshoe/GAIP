okay so generally in the smartphone market there are two types of companies those who wait for others to do things before putting it into their own phones and those that always try to be first and i think it's fair to say that vivo firmly falls into the latter category they were the first with a completely full screen phone the first to use an in-display fingerprint scanner the first to bring a motorized pop-up camera and here they are yet again claiming to have the next big thing for smartphones this is the vivo x50 pro a smartphone with a camera that's different we'll put it that way it's presented well and it comes with a pair of earphones with some silicone tips there's a 33 watt fast charging brick clear case and manuals and right at the bottom a usbc charging cable now for the fun bit [Music] you know if someone asked me to draw out what i thought a typical 2020 flagship smartphone looks like from the front i would probably end up with something like this it's got a 6.56 inch 1080p amoled display a fluid 90hz refresh rate curved display edges and a little hole punch camera in the corner mind you this isn't a complaint because unlike most flagships this phone sits closer to 600 and the display is good it's bright and actually has a smaller bezel than even the oneplus 8 it's just we've seen this before but what we haven't seen is what's going on on the back of the phone the camera setup looks almost alien like it's from another planet because as well as the five times optical zoom camera at the bottom the two-time zoom camera for taking portraits and the eight megapixel ultrawide which are all fairly normal sized the main camera is just enormous you could live in there they call this the gimbal camera and when i say the word gimbal you probably immediately think of a smartphone stabilizer like this and that's sort of right viva have tried to basically boil down that mechanism to fit inside the body of a phone so how does it work well the first thing to understand is that the whole objective of a stabilization system is to make sure that the camera itself is moving as little as possible and there's two existing ways that companies do this the first is electronic image stabilization which kind of cheats slightly when you use this when you're using eis your camera zooms in and then it uses the extra room it now has around the edges to try and match every frame of the video with the frame before it so eis kind of creates the illusion that the camera is staying still even if it's actually moving but a lot of high-end phones actually take this a step further they use something called ois or optical image stabilization and essentially instead of creating the illusion that the camera's still even when it's not with ois the camera actually is still ois means that the camera looks at the movements you make with your phone let's say i move left and the camera itself will physically move in the opposite direction so that it counteracts that movement it'll move right so that brings me on to this what viva basically tried to do here is to create a system that takes ois to the next level so first of all it doesn't just shift around in a flat plane up and down left and right the camera rotates like this and that's important because a lot of the time when i'm shaking my camera around when i'm kind of moving around like this i'm not just going directly up and down or left and right i'm actually tilting my phone maybe like this but when i do that here when i move let's say from here to here the camera has the ability to correct itself from here to here and the second thing is that just the ability to move here is around three times that of any other normal ois system so instead of just being able to stabilize this motion it could in theory stabilize something like this but this is a first gen product how well does it actually do in practice i'll say this better than i thought it would be the second you open the camera app and click on video it becomes very clear that something's happening when you're just holding the phone it looks a bit like it's frozen still in the air all those micro movements you naturally make with your hands they're gone so seeing as the huawei p40 pro has probably been my favorite camera phone this year and because the vivo looks suspiciously like it's targeting that phone this felt like a good place to start so the first thing i tried was just twitching both phones around and the vivo just moves less which is good but i guess you probably expect that it's got an entire mechanism built to counter this movement but to be honest when you start walking with it i would say the vivo only trades blows with the flagships sometimes i feel like it does do a better job but sometimes i actually feel like just the basic ois in those phones is a little more natural this could be because i'm using the phone on pre-release software but we'll have to wait and see the first big advantage though comes if you try to pick up the pace if you run it'll be very clear that the vivo has something that the others don't i'm just not usually convinced that people do this very often just run around while recording but there is another perk to this gimbal system see because most phones are using primarily electronic image stabilization in video for that to work the software has to basically look around and understand each frame to be able to match it with the one before that but this requires light so you might have noticed this when you're moving in a situation of fairly low light most phones will fall apart they'll struggle to piece together the frames needed for stabilization but because vivo's got this gimbal to fall back on it doesn't need that eis as much so in this particular case it's actually way ahead this was a very dark scene here right now it's up against the galaxy s20 ultra it's low light i'm walking fairly carelessly taking 4k video on each it's raining this is a phone's worst nightmare and yet it's kind of cool that i can pause this video at any point and chances are it'll be clear on the vivo and blurry on the samsung and just to be absolutely sure it was working i tried again versus the iphone and sure enough it's pretty much the exact same scenario and while i was out there while i was doing all this testing i noticed something else that's pretty cool so you know how when you're taking a night mode photo on a phone and you try really hard to hold it as still as possible well because the phone practically holds itself still it does a pretty good job of keeping the subject crisp so at this point i decided to spend some time using it alongside the huawei p40 pro at night not because i thought it would win just because i thought it'd be interesting but the results kind of surprised me it's been super cloudy over the last few weeks so i haven't managed to test its ability to capture the moon or capture stars at night because that is something that huawei's amazing at but as far as just standard handheld night mode photos the results from this looked just as good so as you probably guessed then it leaves phones like the standard galaxy s20 in the dust which as you know is still a 900 phone and something i've really grown to appreciate is the style modes when taking night mode shots you can pick between four different modes and each one produces its own fairly distinct take on the same scene i mean technically they're just filters but i've not seen this before with night mode and they do work really well the rest of the cameras here are pretty normal stuff but decent the 8 megapixel ultrawide is serviceable it's not as good as that of most flagships but i'd say the zoom is actually better you can get to 5 times even 10 times magnification and you still have a pretty nice result there's a couple of cool portrait modes i've been playing around with i found the rainbow mode strangely addictive i was just sat inside on a dull afternoon taking photos that you could argue look quite convincingly sunny and there's something else called movie camera which locks onto a subject and keeps it in frame at all times this here was shot while not actually moving the phone at all it's just tracking the ball but the quality of this mode takes a definite hit okay to bring this all together to answer the question that's been playing in the back of my head since i first opened this who is this phone for because on one hand this is the most stable camera on a smartphone most of the time but would you have instead preferred it if they put that money towards having the best chip out there as opposed to the upper mid-range snapdragon 765g that we do get maybe this doesn't have an ip rating it doesn't have wireless charging would you wanted those instead maybe but what i can say is that the x50 pro is far better than i thought it would be as a phone i saw the commercials i saw how it's being marketed as if it's one selling point is stable video but in reality it's surprisingly well-rounded i mean for starters the stabilization isn't just for video it helps in photos too but even just generally i feel like for six hundred dollars the phone has a lot going for it the display is fantastic and i think they've made a lot of good decisions when it comes to how it was built especially with this p40 pro like finish on the back i'm almost kind of impressed that they've managed to fit not only a 4 315 milliamp hour battery but also this entire gimbal system into a phone that's eight millimeters thick and its camera bump is quite a bit smaller than what we've seen from top tier phones this year but i guess what i'm really trying to get at is that i'm really glad this exists whether or not it turns into a huge hit success i don't know but it feels like the start of a new trend that's going to benefit all smartphones viva were the first to make an in-display fingerprint scanner and i would say this tech is far more well baked than that was originally but look where in display fingerprint scanners are now they're everywhere so to sum up viva x50 pro i'm happy about the technology going on here i'm very happy about i should probably also mention that like most phone companies now they also do have a pair of true wireless earphones that work quite well alongside if you enjoyed this video a sub to the channel would be incredible my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
