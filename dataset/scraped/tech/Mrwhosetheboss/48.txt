this is the vivo x70 pro plus and i think we finally reached a stage where i can say it is a camera with some phone this is a sponsored video so i'm not making a review but this x70 pro plus is just a seriously unique and interesting phone so i want to show you my top 10 coolest things about it and number 10 is actually the unboxing experience because in a year where most companies are trimming down i think this company is ramping up you'll notice immediately that it is a chunkier package than most then inside you can see a glossy strip on the right you've got this photography redefined text and more curiously this ridiculously huge camera module peeking out the middle that would be the phone and then below that you get a 66 watt fast charger a pair of earphones a pretty nice hardbacked but soft to the touch case sim ejector tool and a usbc cable okay within two minutes of holding this phone i already knew what number nine was gonna be this feels incredible for starters i've got no idea what they've coated it with but this might be the greatest finish i've ever seen on a phone like black is usually the first color to attract fingerprints right this thing is not just resistant but practically immune you can't make it dirty even if you try secondly the buttons most phones have these really clicky feeling buttons and i actually didn't realize that i didn't like them until i used these they're still tactile but it's almost like there's a layer of cushioning which makes the impact softer and then the last thing is that this is incredibly well shaped i noticed it immediately but i couldn't quite tell what it was so i pulled up a whole bunch of phones and realized what they've done is while most phones have either completely flat sides or they have some curve on the back with a flat screen or sometimes both the curve on the back and the screen vivo's actually built this phone such that the curvature radius of the front exactly matches with the curvature radius of the back whilst also making the scene between also follow that same arc or in other words a completely continuous phone all the way around the only thing that i would say is that i think vivo should have dropped this glossy section entirely and then pivoted the cameras so that they're horizontal because as it stands your fingers can overlap with this module and you know how i feel about that number eight though right off the bat this might just be the most powerful android phone on the market it comes with a snapdragon 888 plus the fastest chip available 256 gigs of the fastest ufs 3.1 storage and 12 gigabytes of the fastest lp tdr ram all on the base model plus an interesting feature called extended ram which allows the phone to use four gigabytes of its normal memory as backup ram if the phone ever runs out of that 12 gigabytes if you're into benchmarks it is hitting over 50 000 more points than my maxed out snapdragon version of the samsung galaxy s21 ultra but the reason that i haven't put this power further up on the list is that fast as it is this isn't a fundamentally different spec sheets to other top-end flagships also number one on this list is kind of crazy but where it does start to diverge is the customization features of the peculiarly named fun touch 12. it was already one of vivo's stronger features on their last phone with the previous software you could pick everything from the fingerprint scanner icon to the face unlock animation to how charging is displayed but you can now delve even further being able to also adjust things like how you want apps to exit and how you want your home screen to appear when you unlock your phone it's stuff that you don't even think to ask for but when it's there it's just yet another way to make your phone yours and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be touching but i think this next thing might be even cooler so we're not short of fantastic displays on flagship phones nowadays but this screen is quite possibly the most jacked panel you've seen in your entire life listen to this it is a 6.8 inch amoled quad hd display with a 120 hertz refresh rate okay that's all the expected stuff but then also full support for 10-bit color or over a billion different shades with ltpo technology which allows the refresh rate to not just be really high but also to go as low as one hertz to save battery anytime you're looking at something still and this is one of the first screens to be made with e5 material which enables higher brightness and reduce power consumption by a further 25 percent you would need a really good eye though to discern the difference versus other high-end flagships all right number five i think it's time to talk about the elephant in the room it's pretty clear from the way this thing looks that the primary selling point here is the cameras and to give them credit there is quite a lot of stuff that they can do that you probably haven't seen before even this shot right here is taken on the phone so the x70 pro plus takes everything from vivo's last flagship the large sensor and wide aperture for lots of natural background blur really like quite a lot of background blur the intense levels of dynamic range which probably aren't for everyone but i'm a fan advanced focus modes like eye tracking long range zoom and the ability to refocus portrait mode shots after you've taken them a lot of stuff however this time around they swapped out the main camera's plastic lens which is what most smartphones tend to use for a high transmittance glass lens they're saying that it'll mean purer images and while it's pretty tough for me to conclusively say that this is what's making all the difference i love the concept of it and i can say that photos do look better now the other camera facet that vivo loves talking about is their partnership with the imaging company zeiss how do you use zeiss's tea star glass coatings to reduce reflections from bright lights or how they've created a special portrait mode called biotar that mimics the rotational bokeh of zeiss's iconic biotar lens well with the x70 pro plus they've gone a bit crazy with this there's three new zeiss inspired modes one's called distagon inspired by zeiss lens known as hollywood distagon because of how much it used to be used in hollywood there's planar inspired by a lens that's over 100 years old believe it or not and this one's meant to be the natural lens a kind of interpretation of how our eyes see the world and then sonar which delivers what they call creamy bokeh which sounds kind of gross but it's actually just referring to the smoothness of the background behind you less about bokeh specifically more about just separation they've then got a whole bunch of non-zeiss portrait modes and my favorite party modes which first uses the flash to take a bright photo of the person's face and then it tells you to shake the phone so that it can use the flashing lights around the subject to create this vibe of the ultimate messy night out i don't know whose idea this feature was it's very nutty but have i had fun with it yeah and viva has now also added the option to use zeiss's natural color science in the camera but to be really honest i am struggling to tell the difference its normal camera colors are nice though it's not going for raw realism but i like its style but here's something that i've never seen a phone do so you might know that the company's last flagship already had possibly the most advanced ultra wide camera out there it was a 48 megapixel reasonably large sensor with a gimbal stabilization system that allowed the cameras to physically move much more than normal to counteract your hand movements you get all that here too but this time around there's one of their super stabilization options they've also added the ability to level the horizon or in other words it won't even matter if you rotate the phone 360 degrees it can still capture orientation locked gimbal stabilized footage that said slightly heartbroken by the fact that this mode is capped at 1080p oh also though side perk of having one of the best ultrawide cameras is that this also doubles as one of the best macro cameras when you bring it close to subjects okay number two this is where things get kind of special vivo has actually built their own custom chip it sits inside this phone completely separate to the main snapdragon ship to specialize in imaging tasks it does things like reduce noise when you're shooting in the dark brightens images reduces blur etc and because it's literally made for this one purpose only it's apparently quite efficient at doing so again a pretty hard one for me to test but vivo says that depending on what exactly it is that you're doing with your camera having this piece of hardware to run these algorithms can reduce power consumption by up to 50 percent compared to if software was doing the same thing whilst creating a better output and that brings me to number one which is obviously night mode everything about this phone the wide aperture the large sensor size full glass lens t-star coating v1 chips software modes are all implicitly created around shooting in the dark you might have seen this tweet i made a week ago that said i just started using a phone that took the best photos i've ever seen that was this so what actually happened was literally seconds after that unboxing i turned this phone on i skipped the entire setup ignored every menu went straight to the camera and legged it outside to find out if this was as good as viva was saying it was and it is i mean daytime shots nowadays are more about preference than proficiency but at night it takes landscapes like this moon shots that look like this and portraits with almost no light that look like this i had the iphone 13 pro max with me at the same time so i just started snapping side by side after side by side and first of all the difference in brightness is ridiculous now i'm definitely in the camp of brighter for the sake of being brighter is no good in a nightmare shot but this is brighter because it's actually capturing more information have a little look at the difference in skies in this photo so then i was like okay let's try the ultrawide cameras and remember this is against the 13 pro max this is with all the upgraded sensors and lenses that they've used the difference is literally night and day i also tried video so with this new v1 chip the x70 pro plus can also do something called super night video it feels like a feature that is nearly exceptional like it's almost bringing the brightening power of night mode photos to video but in motion it breaks down a bit it's not as smooth or as refined as it needs to be but then i turn the phones up and try taking a shot of the sky and i'll show you what i took this is the iphone this is the vivo this is the iphone this is the vivo this is the iphone this is the vivo you probably get the idea there's also different styles of night mode varying vastly in quality some of them look like you've just dipped your finger in butter and rubbed it over the lens others add layers of character but hopefully you've caught my drift here vivo x70 pro plus is possibly the most fun i've ever had with a phone do consider subscribing if you enjoyed my name is aaron this is mr who's and i'll catch you in the next one
