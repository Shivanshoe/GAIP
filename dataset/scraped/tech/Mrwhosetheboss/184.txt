foldable smartphones are in a weird place right now we've pinned them as the future as replacements for our traditional slab of glass smartphones but looking at the galaxy's head flip Samsung's second-generation foldable it might not initially seem like the future so I dug a little deeper first of all though I was lucky enough to get a retail box of the phone so let's take a quick look at what it comes with and by the way I've launched a Galaxy S 20 ultra and for Galaxy S 20 giveaway so all the rules for that are in the description the packaging off the said flip is definitely a grade there's an outer sleeve with just the letters ed on it and if we take that off the word flip nice there's a couple of other interesting things going on here though if it starters when we take the lid off and look underneath a separate compartment in which you have not just manuals but a special case made for the flip it's reminiscent of the case that came with the Galaxy fold but a little cheaper feeling it'll be decent at protecting the front in the back but it'll leave the hinge exposed you get a card that talks about the design of the flip and I personally like touches like this it doesn't add value to the phone but it adds value to the unboxing experience of course there's the smartphone below that but right at the bottom a 15 watt charger which is actually the same as the one found on the galaxy s 10 last year and finally a USBC cable for charging a pair of Wyatt AKG earphones that go straight into the phone's USB C port and an adapter to help you transfer stuff from your old phone to start with then there's actually a lot to like here for example a whole number of engineering improvements from the first galaxy fold it's been tested for the same 200,000 folds or in other words 200 folds every day for the next three years but the hinge itself actually feels better this time it can do what Samsung calls free hold or hold its position at any point in its rotation which has a functional benefit you're effectively splitting your phone into two separate usable zones so you can have your camera preview at the top and controls at the bottom or one app in one half and another app in the other we've got this t-shaped component right from the get-go which was introduced in the second batch of galaxy folds to keep dust and debris from getting underneath that display and there is now no gap between the screens when you fold it up the phone snaps shut satisfyingly I should add and when it's closed it's fully closed unlike the original I could go on the display is now glass instead of plastic which grunts it far better scratch resistance and of course the phone is far smaller the flip folds up into a footprint that is just over half the volume of the original we're talking the difference between what looks like carrying a lunch box in your pocket versus carrying a small wallet for people who wear jeans especially women's jeans which are notorious for their tiny pocket size this is an important difference and while the display is smaller it's still a good size large enough to properly enjoy content on so from a structural engineering standpoint the Zed flip is in many ways everything we hoped a second generation product would be I even like the idea of this tiny front display which shows you the time date and battery those are quite possibly the three main things people turn their phone on to check for so the fact you can do it without opening the phone sort of has a mindfulness element to it now if you ever just turned your phone on with the intention of checking the time only then to get distracted by a notification or an app and then spending 10 minutes scrolling pointlessly yeah me too but this kind of prevents that to get into your phone you have to make a conscious decision to open it up so you're only going to do that when you have a purpose plus this micro display can be used to take photos admittedly it's got the wrong aspect ratio to fit the whole image in but it's enough to be able to roughly frame a shot and means that you can take selfies using the high quality rear camera of the phone that's a big plus point my only design criticism is that whilst clearly Samsung I've done a lot to make this as usable as possible with one hand it's a little tough to open it with one hand without seriously risking some sort of $1400 accident now before I can get into what's truly going on here we've got to address the elephant in the room this is not the fold to the Zed flip is not a successor to the first galaxy fold it is not a top tier a pro grade smartphone and I'd go as far to say it doesn't even count as a second generation foldable device at all let me explain for starters the spare vacations for all intents and purposes this phone has nothing to do with the smartphone's it was released alongside even though the original Galaxy fold launched alongside the Galaxy S 10 phones as a sort of foldable counterpart to them the said flip has more in common with last year's s10 lineup than it does the S 20 phones this year it has what is essentially the Galaxy S tens camera with actually the omission of that phone's telephoto lens no large image sensor as seen on the s20 no 8k video recording no instant snapping of a hundred and eight megapixel photos it does carry some of the new software features though like single take which I love as a concept if you press one button the phone takes a whole load of photos and videos for you so you can sit back and actually just enjoy the moment the phone still has an ultra wide camera too which is a good call and the nature of it being a flip phone means that you can use that ultra wide camera for ultra wide selfies but there's a few more things that are missing the said flip is limited to 256 gigs of non-expandable storage and 8 gigs of ram and that's not the superfast ram we saw with the s20 phones either it's okay just like the 3300 milliamp hour total battery capacity it's okay it's fine nothing special it uses last year's snapdragon 855 plus chipset which is fast don't get me wrong but around 15% behind what the s20 can do it doesn't support 5g which again not a deal-breaker in 2020 but if you're buying a new phone this year you probably plan to use it till 2022 or 2023 and by then I reckon you'd want the option and it's also missing arguably the biggest selling point of the s20 series their ludicrous new displays every single s20 ships with a quad HD plus panel that can also refresh at 120 times per second they're just phenomenal whereas the flip comes with a still good but not outstanding Full HD plus 60 Hertz AMOLED screen and let's talk about this display for a second well it is super white do you remember when Sony tried to be different and launched an ultra tall smartphone with a 21 to 9 aspect ratio well the very nature of the flip mechanism means that we're left with an even taller 22 to aspect ratio two main things to say about this on one hand it is a good-looking screen and it's a definite improvement over the almost square inside display of the first fold see I've been using that phone for four months now and the biggest problem is just that mobile apps especially Android apps and not made for squares plus the tallness of this display means that in all feed based apps like Twitter like YouTube you can fit a ton of content on screen at any one time the other side to that coin though is that for a lot of things it's a little too white loading up a YouTube video for example and these are the kinds of black bars you'll be faced with you can zoom in to fill the screen sure but you'll be losing a whole third of the image there's also still a noticeable crease going down the middle anyways bringing it back to the main point on the face of it this whole thing seems a little weird and Samsung launches these brand new smartphones with absolutely bleeding-edge technology and features but they're most futuristic looking phone is actually a generation behind in terms of capability the Zed flip is spec wise rather underwhelming especially considering it is as expensive as it's absolutely balls to the walls Galaxy S 20 ultra and let's be very clear if this thing didn't fold in half it would be a solid mid-range phone in 2020 so what on earth is going on here if this phone isn't for pro users because of its specs and it isn't for casual users because of its price why enough did Samsung launch it let me ask you a question bearing in mind that the Galaxy S 10 phones last year have sold over 40 million units how many units do you think Samsung has sold at the fold 10 million 5 million no around 500,000 units Samsung knows full well the Zed flip is not going to be an S series replacements it is not built for the mass market or really even to make a big direct profit from but that's ok because it is still the best foldable currently out there and that's more important it's better than the Motorola RAZR we saw last year more capable and refined in almost every aspect and for most intents and purposes an improvement over the original fault - whilst being more affordable no normal user who just wants the best upgrade to their Samsung Galaxy s8 is going jump to the flip but Samsung knows that and the way they're marketing this phone gives away what their true intention is think about it this phone was first ever officially shown to the world at the Oscars one of the most high-end fashionable award ceremonies in the world Samsung didn't show any specs just the fact that it's a phone that can fold and it looks wacky they then straight after launching announced a collaboration with the New York Fashion Week there's a limited edition version too but not a collaboration with Star Wars or the Avengers like they've done in the past this a Tom Brown edition a high-end new york-based designer clothing brand you might be starting to see where I'm coming from Samsung has purposefully sidestepped trying to make their foldable a pro users phone instead playing to its advantages and making it the coolest the galaxy's head flip is not a phone for techies nor is that a phone for casual users I think there's that flip is created to make Samsung cool don't get me wrong the company have a great reputation for quality tech as it is but there is definitely in some circles a tendency for people to pick I phones just because Apple is considered fashionable and Samsung wants to change that even if Samsung makes no direct profit from this phone just the fact that it is out there especially if it gains traction as a luxury design icon is doing wonders to Samsung's brand it makes Samsung appear as a manufacturer of not just cool technology but also class and luxury so in conclusion the flip serves three roles a almost like a piece of advertising just having a phone like this floating around in the public turns people's attention to Samsung it won't win over the tech nerd who wants 120 Hertz displays and it probably won't sell massive numbers but it will win the hearts of the masses because let's face it it's cool as hell and it feels great in the hand B for the limited but growing number of people specifically in the market for a foldable this is as good as you can get right now so the flip appeals to them too and finally as an experiment the first fold didn't sell well but unlike the traditional slab of glass smartphones foldables can take a number of form factors and this device is just another example that Samsung hasn't actually decided yet which is the best if you bought it as the galaxies fall - you'd be missing the point this is just another option compared to the fold don't treat this as a second generation foldable device treat it as a second stab at a first generation foldable I wouldn't personally buy it because of this but from that angle it definitely has its place don't forget the giveaway rules are in the description and let me know would you by Bizet flip for a $1,380 my name is Aaron this is misty who's the boss I'll catch you in a minute [Music]
