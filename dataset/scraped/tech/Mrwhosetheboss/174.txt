Wow very special Samsung unboxing today I've even dressed for the occasion and a couple of other cool things too a for example the Galaxy Tab s 6 this is Samsung's answer to Apple's top end iPad pro while costing 1/3 less and for everything I've heard online this is meant to be the best Android tablet on the planet but I'll be the judge of that this is nice packaging and that is razor thin I did not expect how slim this thing is if you starters it already comes with an S Pen in the box that puts it one step ahead of Apple the Apple pencil is an extra $100 and compared to the thin little stylus you get with the note smartphones this actually feels like a pen it also snaps on the back and charges wirelessly which is amazing but it doesn't feel hugely secure like I could just yeah anyways I've just booted it up and the quality of this screen you can tell this is the kind of tablet that was designed to watch content on like the video looks fantastic and audio as well it's got Dolby Atmos sound coming from all four corners is the new Motorola RAZR iPhone that everyone wanted to love in the general software it kind of just looks like a Galaxy Note that's a little bit too much to eat the software is very firm like with one cool feature if you tap here you can shoot straight into samsung decks mode their desktop windows like OS to do that on a phone you'd have to plug it into an external monitor I will say this decks does feel pretty unfinished compared to traditional windows like as an example I'm on it now and if I flip to the normal mode and then back to decks again all my windows have gone back to their defaults right so a couple of cool Samsung gadgets before we get to the main event which is this guy I didn't actually know this until a few weeks ago but Samsung has their own official dual wireless charging station but what I saw online I couldn't quite understand the price this is ninety pounds here in the UK that's over $100 worth of wireless charger so let's find out why so straight up this is a lot smaller and lighter than I was expecting but let's plug it in and take it for a spin there's a fan that sits behind one of the pads blowing air at the bottom of your phone the reason why is that while you have normal wireless fast charge on this side if you flip to the other side you've got faster fast wireless charging 2.0 I mean that has sound great fast wireless charging 2.0 but in the end it caps out at 12 watts which compared to the 40 watts of power that Xiaomi recently showed off with their wireless charging well anyways nice product but definitely falls into that category of things that's a little bit more expensive just because it's an official product on that note though I've been meaning to try Samsung's official smart cases for a while now and I got to say I am yet to try a smart case that I actually think was a smart decision but we'll see I should actually point out at this point that the Galaxy has 20 Ultra has been my main phone for a few weeks now and with it I've been using the official silicon case it's a nice case but the issue I've been having is that it's almost a little too grippy for its own good you know when you have your phone in your pocket and you might have a card or some earbuds also in that pocket and well because of how grippy the case is every time you pull your phone out it either gets stuck in that pocket it pulls out the inside of your pocket or worst case scenario also brings with it to the entire contents of your pockets so first up the smart LED view cover first of all pretty much 360 degree protection if you're the kind of person who worries about your phone this is a peace of mind product there's actually a slot inside to keep the card and if you close it the front is lined with LEDs which has a couple of features you can tell you at the time and I can show you notifications so it works but the thing I really can't stand about these wallet cases is that when you open it and when you actually want to use your phone that is not a comfortable way to do it all those painstaking decisions made with the design of the phone to make it as palm friendly as possible they're out the window the minute you decide to use something like this I was a little more hopeful for the second one the smart clear view cover instead of fully covering the front of your screen this kind of interacts with it so screen on screen off and all of a sudden you've got this window of information it's still got that same comfort problem when trying to use the phone but I do like the fact that when it's shut you can still use the screen and finally just before the limited-edition smartphone the last thing I've been hearing quite a lot about is this the Samsung t7 touch their new generation solid-state external drive no no it's a storage drive I'm not usually very excited by these either but the specs on this one are pretty monstrous absolutely tiny I wasn't expecting that this is a 500 gigabyte Drive Wow Wow now USB standards are pretty convoluted but for those you who know this is based on USB 3.2 Gen 2 which gives it theoretically insane bandwidths and a couple of other final cool things Samsung great set as drop resistant up to 2 meters which means you'd kind of almost have to throw it to break it and there's a fingerprint scanner here to encrypt it I wasn't that convinced by that wireless charger we saw earlier but this this I could get behind now welcome to a smartphone worth two thousand four hundred and eighty dollars Wow Wow this is the Samsung Galaxy Zed flip Tom Brown edition and Villas you don't know tom brown is a new york-based fashion brand famous for their formal menswear collection hence the jacket I could be wrong but off the top of my head I think this might just be the most expensive phone Samsung has ever officially sold themselves but I almost thought it would be more expensive see Tom Brown is a company that doesn't mess around and had a look on Amazon for some Tom Brown clothing and it is just extortionate you want a pair of sunglasses there'll be $300 what about a shirt $600 and cuff forbid if you want a jacket $2,300 so with that in mind the phone almost seems like a bargain it isn't I should be very clear about that but you are at least getting a lot of limited edition stuff in here so let's crack it open Oh [Music] this is just immaculate Wow the brands colors especially with this product are white blue red and this gray theme and they've stuck with it incredibly consistently so this is a note you have in your hands not just an iconic smartphone for a unique collaboration I guess the idea is that the Samsung galaxys head flip is a fashion focused smartphone as it is so it kind of makes sense to fill up with a fashion brand that pushes it into I guess a whole other tier there are actually two different layers to this unboxing but this stuff as well as this stuff but we'll start on the top let's go here this is amazing each of them even have Tom Brown tape Tom Brown tape so this is a Tom Brown edition galaxy watch active - so the straps are genuine leather it's Tom Brown branded of course and if we booted up a custom Tom Brown watch face I'm not gonna lie I don't love it there's kind of a pencil drawn tine on it right box number two and I believe this is our galaxy buds plus limited edition oh that's nice us and that finish has something I always look forward to on tech products and something that I'm really happy about here is that compared to the custom Star Wars Galaxies buds which did have a custom case but normal buds in this case you've got the Tom Brown branding on both as I suppose you'd expect this limited edition is literally twice the price of that one worth noting though on the subject of galaxy buds plus is I've actually been using a pair for quite a few weeks now and I'm a big fan battery audio just sold seamlessly they connect your Android phone have all been amazing with just two issues first of all I'm the kind of person who likes using neckband wireless earphones and the benefit to them is that they're not going anywhere you have them around your neck you can't lose them but the buds plus and just generally true wireless earphones come in they're small slippery case and in my case have slid out of my pockets into the seat I'm sitting in obviously hope not but even as someone who's pretty careful with their tech I feel like it's just a matter of time before I lose these the other thing is that occasionally like with every Air Bud they come a bit loose in your ears and that's fine but the problem comes is when you try to readjust them the entire thing is a touch pad which means all the time I was accidentally triggering play pause and skip tracks well I didn't really want to now just before that bottom tray we've got the smart phone and this is a nice smart phone box it's a little plain but I don't remember the last time I've seen red packaging for advice on Tom Brown smartphone itself and you get a 15 watt travel charger you get a USBC cable and AKG Wyatt earphones there's no headphone jack but these will plug straight into the USB C port I'm gonna try and pretend like this isn't what I've been waiting for for the last four weeks oh I feel so smooth that's Tom Brown that's Tom Brown plastic but it's loud that was fun and here we go here we go my first impression is the fact that I like the matte finish it still got that kind of plain gray color that I wasn't a big fan of with the main s 20 series but it's made better by the fact that it's got these shiny chrome accents but at least adds a flavor of flair and hmm the thing we've all been waiting for a develop to be really honest this feels nice in no way does it make sense financially but at the same time I get it I can see the appeal of the device it's not value for money but it is desirable we're at a stage where companies can use specs from last year and an average consumer might not even realize this is a fashion focused smartphone endorsed by a serious name in fashion it looks and feels fantastic in the same way that a nice pair of shoes might and there is a custom software skin which really does stretch the definition of minimalism ok so custom wallpapers custom icons which I'm not gonna lie I don't particularly like them so the entire thing is redone like they have put a lot of attention to detail here but that's not to say I prefer it I think that Samsung's own stock icons stop wallpapers look better there's also a new keyboard sound here which they were quite proud of it's meant to sound like a typewriter I mean it's nice I do like it but I don't think it's something you couldn't just get with a third-party keyboard ok so there's also a custom Tom Brown application and I wasn't told at all what it does so this is new to me no surely surely it's not just a blank screen what so we've got blinds ok the blinds open I really hope I'm missing something here does it do something a few open it nope right well I'm just gonna have to assume that it does do something apart from this but as far as I can see this is not a feature worth spending money on oh and the other thing is they've replaced the live wallpaper with a Tom Brown live wallpaper but it's actually not running at 60 frames per second it genuinely looks like it's lagging so not great let's take a look at this tray finally and that is done well what Tom Brown lacks in the ability to make an application they do make up for in packaging you've got a standard galaxy watch strap which I'm not gonna lie I prefer and it does still have the Tom Brown branding on it and the last thing is a genuine leather case for the phone see this feels really well done this is yeah this is an A+ case this I raped so putting the whole thing together is this worth two thousand four hundred and eighty dollars well okay software wise you're not getting anything new that is at all noteworthy that's pretty clear but the hardware is beautiful the packaging is beautiful and all this custom limited edition stuff genuinely feels limited-edition so if you are fashion focused and you do have money to spare on something like this without needing to think to practically about how much bang for buck you're getting there is some merit in this limited edition thanks a lot for watching my name is Aaron this is mister who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
