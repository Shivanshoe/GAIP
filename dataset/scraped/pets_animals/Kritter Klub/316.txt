Kkiru, female
The beauty of the peafowl community Every peacock's dream girl Despite their passionate courtship, Not interested Kkiru leaves away Sad eyes She doesn't even look Peacocks would woo and do cutesy things to win her love But she wouldn't open up her mind to them Kkiru's sad love story Mother peahen's day with vigorous vibes begins Scattering meals Tremendous amount being scattered.. I cried every day, even all the villagers are aware of it. 
People ask if I caught him whenever they see me. What she wanted to catch so bad is.. There he is Huh? Peacock? He's Dotteu Kkiru's hubby.. Kkiru and Dotteu are a married couple Yet, while the peafowl's aviary was being remodeled, Emergency situation occurred when Dotteu flew away As if it's his own house, he goes into a stranger's house Oh gosh, no way Ah, please UH? He's going somewhere Following after him, yet !!! Don't follow me, seriously That's how he ends up going into the mountains... Slips Dotteu! Where did he hide? Feeling desperate - There he is!!
- Can ya see him?
- Yes, I can! Woah, how can he be there? Staring from over there Okay, I'm sorry, it's my fault Please, come back.. Staring That afternoon Dotteu came back to the residential area again Dotteu's not here Didn't notice yet Hides again to avoid villagers Photo of then After he ran away from home, Dotteu has often been spotted in the residential area He pooped here and left Causing nuisance to a neighbor village It definitely stinks, maybe because those are bird feces Residents also attempted to catch Dotteu I could see him every time I visit here But I couldn't when I came up to catch him At that time, the peafowl's house Devoted care What Dotteu is means to her is... I was in despair for several reasons, having a panic attack He gave me a comfort when I was at my worst.. You wouldn't understand, but he's like my child.. Grief from her own child leaving home and ardent love waiting for her husband Yet Why wouldn't he come back home? Guess he's pretty upset now Crew: Why? I brought her a new hubby This is Haengbok. New hubby Haengbok replaced Dotteu's void My type Perhaps he has a grudge against the owner Enough now.. Please feel better and come back Will he come back as his owner wished?
