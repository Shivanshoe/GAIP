Hope you meet a good mother, live happily, and come back May we meet as stars in the sky The time left for the grandmother : 3 months Caregiver : In 2011, she received surgery for last-stage pancreatic cancer but now it recurred after the surgery Next to the grandmother who makes it through day by day by taking narcotics Eunbi the family has been with her for over 10 years Even though the disease is getting worse Caregiver : As Eunbi will be left alone and she doesn't want to get away from the grandmother It's difficult for the grandmother to be hospitalized The reason why she can't let go of Eunbi amid unbearable agony Grandmother : Such a poor girl was born in a terrible place I saved her who was nearly dying at a puppy mill in Paju city That's how Petit and small Eunbi has become everything to the grandmother Was very clever and smart With her cleverness, perhaps she could feel the grandmother's pain Grandmother : She doesn't eat 'cause she gets anxious seeing me sick She won't try to play either, so it's better to let her go soon.. It's what's best for Eunbi Eat some Despite the grandma's concern about ruining her health Eunbi just stays by her side PD : Will she enter a hospital if we take Eunbi? Caregiver : Yes, maybe. She couldn't have checked into a hospital so far because of Eunbi She has postponed hospitalization, but the time of farewell has approached Grandmother : Eunbi, sorry that I couldn't protect you until the end Meet a good mother, live happily, and come back to me Let's meet as stars in the sky again For grandmother For Eunbi They're everything to each other Because they love each other, Now they have to leave each other "Eunbi, farewell" "Mom, goodbye" The moments of farewell they've imagined in their head for hundreds of times But the sorrow never fades away Where will Eunbi go next?
