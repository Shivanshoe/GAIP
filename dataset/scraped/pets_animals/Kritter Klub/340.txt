Terribly tangled, concreted bunch of hair A dog hovering around the neighborhood in such a ragged shape Informant: Thought he was a wild animal. At first sight.. I fell on my hams cuz I was shocked When you see him, uh, beast! You'll think of a beast This place, this is where he always stays For six years already, our guy who's roaming around the town in an outlandish shape is... Producer: Uh? T.. There, there! From a distance, the dog peeks from the bushes Producer: Woah that's massive! As he feels the presence of people Hurriedly walks away from the scene.. What kind of story has he been carrying all this time? Where he stopped is Under the shade of a pine tree (Reserved seat) The dog could pause for a breath at last Tangled, thick fur full of dirt Informant: I visited this place in January and found him I only know that he always stays here.. Even though she wanted to lend a hand He's too wary to gain distance on him While we were asking around about the dog... Resident: We've never heard anyone who keeps a dog in this neighborhood, never Resident: Reckon someone came all the way here to dump him, so he won't be able to find the way back home... If you go to the end there, there's a yacht harbor. People dump a lot there Perhaps, he was dumped in this place by somebody, like the others were Scratching heavily Not being able to find somewhere to lie down comfortably, The dog roams about the streets and lives on a precarious life that doesn't seem to come to an end One thing that looks odd is Even when he's wandering about the surroundings In the afternoon,  he'd always be back under the tree and keeps his usual spot However..! Boksil! A call from a stranger. Upon her calling, the dog rushes towards her at once A remarkable story of the ragged dog 'Boksil' What story does Boksil have to tell?
