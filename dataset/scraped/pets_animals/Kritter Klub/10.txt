(Jiggle-Jiggle) Takes up the entire angle Aeong: Wut yo lookin’ at? Aeong: First time seeing a cat groomin? Fatto catto ‘Aeong’ (Pretty serious with grooming) Production crew: Is she pregnant? Guardian: Ohhhhh noooooo~! Haha Aeong’s a boy haha Looks reliable from the back (Mhmm, definitely a boi) We're sorry we misjudged you Production crew: Does Aeong not like to move around? Guardian: He HATES it. He tries to lie down all-day Aeong, how much do you weigh..? [Guardian  + Aeong’s weight] [Guardian’s weight] 11.1 kg..? Guadian: Aeong, shall we exercise? (Avoids eye-contact) Guardian: Ommu~ my baby, let’s exercise~ Aeong: Let go of meh (Dragged) Aeong: Oh wait, hyper-ventilating DONE FOR THE DAY Unlike other active fwends Aeong: Oh. So fun.  Are you done? Actually, there’s a reason why the guardian can't push him... Guardian: It’s been 3 years since he (Aeong) became my family He weighed 8.5kg when he first came Aeong was already pretty big at first encounter He also was scarred from being abandoned Their lives are as precious as ours, so it made me sad that animals are hated and abandoned So, I’d feed him better food than what other cats eat She wanted to give him more love so the guardian started giving him good food... Now Aeong refuses to move at all and that got the guardian worried (How is he, doctor?) Vet: Woaaaah!!  He’s pretty heavy. It feels like there are two cats inside WAT? Health examination proceeds..! Vet: Overweight cats’ characteristic is that they shouldn’t self-serve their own food For their sake, they should refrain from it He needs change for his health's sake! Aeong: Wow.. I.. Now, with a set amount of food serve only the appropriate amount! :) Guardian: Until now, I overprotected Aeong out of pity Now, won’t be too lenient with him Setting 6kg as a goal,  Aeong will now be exercising lots~ :) (Let’s take a step at a time) HOORAH!!!!!!!!!!
