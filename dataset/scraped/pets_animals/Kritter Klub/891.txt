Zookeeper : They're lazy So if I knock down their house, they can exercise again It gives them the wildlife experience Dude, where's my house? They get flustered by the sudden disappearance of their house after hours When life gives you lemons, make lemonade In the words of DJ Khaled, Another one! We're not homeless anymore (All in a day's work) (nothing makes me happier) Clawing at full speed On glass nonetheless Working hard, I see Now will you stop destroying my house? Nope! (destroys again) The side eye is real No chill.. Again, the answer is nope! Life is not fair (join the club) I think he thinks of it as another beaver (self-love)
