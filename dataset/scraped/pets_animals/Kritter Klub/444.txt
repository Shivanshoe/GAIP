Hey there? I’m Young-ok I wanna introduce my fwend, Kkamang No.. Don’t.. Shivers in anger I said you don’t need to.. Kkamang~ If she goes here~ She’d go there
If she goes there~ She’d go here Peekaboo What da hell She can see the room from this side She can also see us sitting on the sofa She’d run away when someone is coming to the kitchen And again, she'd run away if we come out from the room She keeps walking around this table in the middle In this way.. been going around one million twenty-two times WHY? We've tried to rescue him since 2018 But as we failed several times and throughout the process, 
she became more scared of people, unlike our intention Kkamang used to be a stray, mother dog Due to her severe wariness, Her pups were rescued before her.. and eventually, she was left alone.. In our perspective, the pups were rescued safe and sound, 
but for Kkamang, they were gone from her She could be rescued after 3 years finally She stays in the kennel full 24 hours She stayed inside the whole time except for 30 sec Should appreciate that she came out to the living room But I demand for MORE The family’s trying to get closer, at least 0.3 inches more Hold up... I can’t eat in this way "I'll give it a try" Said Young-ok Kkamang~ Look. 
This is how you eat Fully committed to doing her mission Huh? It worked..? She eats..! Young-ok, hurrah I brought Young-ok so that Kkamang could learn from her in order to realize as ‘Ah~ I can do that with people’ Looks like she has no clue Regardless of all this.. Young-ok living dat simple life in such complicated world Kkamang~ Come here Suprisingly, not getting seduced How is she going to eat today.. Eats well, as expected Doesn’t eat, without an exception No thoughts Took only 2 sec as the door's closed Uh!? She’s out? How was the stroll? Is this.. a signal? Kkamang, Oppa's comin.. Don’t come any closer!! Her unpredictable emotional flow.. Hold up for a bit
I'll summon Chan-jong To be continued in Part 2...
