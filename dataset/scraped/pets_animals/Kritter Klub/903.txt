Come here~ Trembling Not happening It can't walk outside of the carpet Sit down hand please high five I can do all things on the magic carpet Shall we eat? Come here My heart says yes, but my head says no For most dogs, If they slip and fall while playing That memory stays with them Nowhere else to turn step by step Let's drink water I'm free!
