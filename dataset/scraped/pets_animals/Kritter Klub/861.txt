Even in the pouring rain, Jindol, jindol, come here Where are you heading again? Let's go home I must go outside Come one, you're gettting rained on Even though the family's stopping me I have a reaosn to go outside PD : Uh, he's going out, no Even in such a foul weather Or being old and not well, But I... (Traces of breaking the door to go out) I must find someone Daughter in law : A grandmother never scolded him when he went out and she took him out when he followed her 'cause she was always on his side Grandma and Jindo Spent the whole life together Wherever the grandma went Jindol always followed her But 2 years ago, The grandmother suddenly passed away Daughter in law : When I was looking for Jindo, I was told that he went to hospital I only heard the news that he went there, but never knew that he really did Resident : During memorial ceremony, Jindol sat and shed tears Sitting on the ground, he shed tears running down his face He looked so pitiful When the grandmother passed away Jindol could never know that day was the last day with his grandma Now the grandma only remains in the frame Perhaps the dog went out every day to find his grandmother As he couldn't speak, he must have though where's my grandmother? After the grandmother's death, he became a nomad Never stays at home but roams around all over the hood While walking on the streets the dog stops by the store But in no time, he comes out He often came here when the grandma was alive Jindol's grandma was a friend with a grandma in this house Jindol's grandma would so pity him if she sees him like this Straggering, once agian, heads to a pavilion where he used to visit with his grandma, a temple where he used to come with the grandma They were always together But now The grandma is in nowhere Can't see Jindol who's struggling just to stand on his feet Got lost somewhere.. where he can't recognize anymore Jindol tries to go out again Vet : Confining him in a narrow space to take care of him just because he's old As a fundamental solution, the family should understand his such traits and be more accepting to let him go to wherever he wants to be. That is far more important than a treatment From now on, the lady decides to walk alongside Jindol, where he used to walk alone Daughter in law : On a rainy or snowy day so when I opened the door in the morning, Jindol was always there first If his memories with the family are grown upon the reminiscences of  grandma, He might become a lot happier I couldn't be with him because of my work before But now that I quit my job, I will walk him out and do my best to fill in for my mother in law's absence The  time of longing, he had to bear alone Hope he relies on his family and won't feel lonely anymore..
