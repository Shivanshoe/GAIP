Is that Vein the movie character? Why then the mouth is covered? Mideum, English Bulldog Haengbok, another English Bulldog Are they fierce? No they're not that fierce but they fight a lot I used to think fighting is a normal thing for bulldogs but my mother got hurt while trying to stop them When these two were young, they used to be friendly but now they're like enemies I told you not to do it Now he bites his own son I'll teach you a lesson He's bleeding Poor thing.. Lunch time for the bulldogs Eating separately He's normally full of charms Time's up! They each have their own private playing time Trying to make them reconcile by making them play in the water together Awkward Forced to reconcile LOL Not working at all Why do these family members fight with each other? They used to be friendly until their grandmother dog died The two dogs became enemies after the grandmother passed away What if there's a dog to make them stop fighting? They continue to fight What the.. When trying to stop their fight.. but failed The father dog is trying to make his son obey him so they think they have no choice but to fight Changes surrounding environment Solution for reconciling: Try to make them look at each other in a comfortable space Still enemies We need to make them have faith when they see each other by giving them treats when they face each other Now they've become so calm Going for a walk together Guys no more fighting! Let's get along well!
