Informant : Argh! Where have they gone! They were here.. Coming out from that pipe over there What's coming out from that pipe..? Baby! A baby from the pipe..? Come here!! A baby.. Retriever?! What's more surprising is.. "They're two dogs!" The two retriever dogs inside the ditch pipe.. Informant : About a month ago, while walking around the dam to enjoy the fall leaves I looked down at the ditch and was so surprised at the dogs coming out from it Since then.. The lady comes to feed dem every day
"Come on~ Let's eat up" But They're very wary of people No no no! I'll leave now Only after the lady leaves, the dog comes outside and barely takes a bite... Informant : They run away upon hearing any noise I called the dog shelter to report that there are stray dogs But couldn't catch them even after several attempts.. As they went inside the pipe After sensing people's gone The dogs finally come outside However.. Traces everywhere around the ditch explain how much they wanted to go out PD : Are they stuck inside? Informant : Yes~ They'd do anything to come out for survival Wouldn't have stayed inside until they die.. The ditch where the dogs are stuck ends at the cliff.. To find someone who'd know about the dogs, we asked around.. Local : I've seen no one who would raise such dogs in this village Local : I've never seen this dog The dogs are not from this village..? Search the missing reports.. PD : Don't think they're missing dogs.. Can't find retriever dogs in the list But...! Uh! I think it's this dog It happened this summer! The dogs were found in summer..? Witness : The dogs approached me when I just stood up still PD : Did the dogs allow you to pet their face..? / Yes~ Witness : Then I couldn't see them since then.. Thought their owner took them in The dogs have changed in a few months What happened... to the dogs? What made them hide inside this narrow ditch? To be continued in Part 2..
