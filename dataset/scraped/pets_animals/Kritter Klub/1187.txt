A restroom on the trail Found a white Pekingese Keeper : While looking around here (in the morning), found a dog Since it was a women's restroom, I couldn't just get inside I've often seen people who tie their dog in the restroom so I thought it was the same case A few hours later, she was left alone still Next to her, There are stuff she used the food she ate and a letter written in poor handwriting
*The dog's name is Hwindoong* Please take this dog with you I got cancer when I was about to become 90 years old So I'm trying to find her a new owner when I'm alive Sorry Staff of the district office : If everything in the letter is true, the owner's probably living nearby as one must be in a severe health condition But why did the owner has to leave her in such place like this Perhaps we could find What happened when we get to find her Found the church that handed out towels It was 20 years ago when towels were distributed it's a long time ago, over 10 years So the towel even was held in the late 80s But the owner was diagnosed with cancer recently Not enough clue to find the owner Perhaps we could find some clues in her body Vet : She's not microchipped Lemme see your ears Vet : Her ears were cleaned as there's no ear hairs in it Vet : Overall, her health and skin are in good condition Guess she'd been under the care somehow Traces of being cared dearly A nearby hospital, close to where she was found Visit the hospital (Looks familiar..) But then Vet : There's a Pekingese dog, Hwindoong, listed in the chart Might be the same dog. She's 5 years old as well A white Pekingese similar to the dog? Hello, are you Hwindoong's guardian? What happened to Hwindoong?
Stay tuned for part 2
