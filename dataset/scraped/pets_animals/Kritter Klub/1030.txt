A retriever..who came out from a ditch pipe..? "There're two of them" They are afraid to come out and doesn't come near humans They're extremely wary of people Must have some kind of trauma. That's why they're afraid of people. They think they're in a safe place What happened to them..? But..! One of them throws up...! The dog's must be in bad condition.. Rescue must be hurried First, block the passageway that they can run away through Place a bowl with food at the front and after equipping the ditch pipe's entrance Wait for them to come out... One of them appears...! Fortunately, the dog doesn't look to be very wary And the other dog appears.. Steps backward..? Woof woof!! Is even wary and starts barking... Woof!Woof!Woof! As if calling the other one who's outside Korean Animal Welfare Association 
One dog is not coming out right now and is barking at the other dog who's outside.. Decided to shoot water at the dog from the back.. And finally... The dog came out..! Because they fear people Let's go! Go inside here! While carefully persuading them Good! Oh good dog~ Succeeded in rescuing both of them They're more gentle than expected No more hardships. it's over now. Whew..I get teary when thinking about how much you endured through until now. I'm happy too...since you came out! (Hea-vy) The dogs who are pretty heavy are Vet : Based on the condition of their tartar buildup, I think they're 2~3 years old. There're no leads to check whose their guardian is... Due to the poor environment Vet : You can see an eye worm here, right The eye worms that have formed in the eyes are removed and their worrisome health condition is... Vet : I couldn't find any causes for vomitting according to the examination. No enteritis or parasites. Just a slight anemia there're no (abnormalities). Fortunately, they're healthy :) They're are a bit scared of people but they aren't aggressive. While living along well with people Hope you both become the most lovable angelic dogs :)
