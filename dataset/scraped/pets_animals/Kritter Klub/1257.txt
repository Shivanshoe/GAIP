The cat which can't walk properly Oh god~ I feel sorry for the cat No matter how hard I try... I'm trying to give the cat some food... But the cat is busy running away There's a place which the cat goes often So the crew members decide to go there with the man Over here... right here It comes and stays here because it's warm.. But it runs away whenever it sees me Is the cat even able to eat properly? Given some cat food.. The crew members installed a hidden camera After a long time the cat finally came It looks like it's been starving Looks so exhausted As the wind blows The cat falls down... The cat used to be so active and healthy.. Running around with its brother.. The cat's brother died from a car accident (I buried it) Ever since its brother died, it became just like that What has happened... To the poor cat... Its so sick that it can't even poop properly The cat is busy running away after a small sense of someone approaching However it looks like it really needs help.. the cat disappeared Over here! Inside that thing.. The crew member puts in the camera it's here! Crouching its body The crew members decide to rescue it It's here! I found it! I can see it! Did they catch it....? We got it! It's very small and young... It wasn't hard to catch the cat because it was too weak to run away it's ok Going to the animal clinic right away.. What does the test results show? Vet : The cat has a problem in its brain-nervous system due to an infection I think it's a miracle that the cat was able to live for 4 months with its physical condition I think we need to wait and see what happens in the long term by doing drug treatment and various treatments Hope you can recover soon..
