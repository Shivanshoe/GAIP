Ordinary mobile phones store There's someone living in the ceiling? Goes up to the ceiling to check, But they're gone already PD : There's a hole?
Staff : I guess they went through that small hole over there Guess they're hovering around the connected ceiling If the ceiling is connected Can we see the inside of the ceiling? But then, A cat sticks her head out Decide to look deeper inside Startled cats run away To count how many cats are here Place the food Without hesitating, The cats eat food The cats are six in total But the cats are left in such a poor environment PD : Have you ever fed them before? No I thought they were stuck at first, but now I'm not sure if they are I think they're eating something to survive since they grew They got bigger as well But then A big cat came into the ceiling Looks like she's their mother She finds the place to lie in the narrow ceiling to breastfeed her kittens After a while The mother cat leaves And her kittens follow behind her Where is that passage connected to? While looking around the passage Found the kittens in the next alley Since when did they hover around here? Soup place owner : The kittens come and eat at a certain time Their mother is a white cat and she has six kittens In the soup place next to the mobile phones store The cats have been fed After the kittens were born in this alley The whole family moved to the ceiling of the mobile phone store Since she has to feed her kittens, the mother can't eat at all As the day goes Cold wind blows in the alley As the mother cat goes into the ceiling first The rest of the family climbs the wires to follow her But.. Staff : A lot of electricity is consumed because there're so many lights on the ceiling so it might be dangerous if they touch them wrong by mistake Bad environment for the cats to live The kittens who are full of curiosity play with the electric wires For the kittens whose activity would increase The rescue is urgent! The vet from the animal rescue organization visits the site Place a trap cage in the ceiling and the alley Lure the cats with food The mother cat looks very hungry As soon as the cage is placed She goes inside and starts eating As the mother cat goes inside, the kittens also go in and eat The mother cat squeezes among the kittens Carefully close the kennel We got em! Perhaps they feel safe around their mom The kittens are caught without troubles Rescued so easily! The kittens who are left out don't run away The mother doesn't resist but is moved to the kennel The mother cat was eating in the cage even in this situation The mother cat looks different from other stray cats Vet :  Stray cats don't act like this when rescued Particularly the one who has kittens has an intense wariness Even though she could become sensitive in such situation she doesn't respond in that way, but takes people's touch so easily I doubt if they lived on the streets for long These sensitive cats stay calm when people are touching them Only two are left As their siblings and mother are gone The kittens hid in the corner Perhaps they're too scared to come out.. As soon as a trap cage is placed The kittens go inside the cage The door closes slowly All seven cats are rescued! Cute I only saw them in shadow, but they look cuter in person Cuter than expected All six kittens go back to their mom Their life in the ceiling is over It must have been tough for the mother cat to take care of the six kittens alone How's their health? Ear mites are bugs living in the ears It's treatable It shows that they were not in a clean environment Where they lived wasn't clean But their health looks fine Except for the germ infection caused by dirty surroundings, they're fine in all aspects But the mother cat is.. Vet : She looked fine but she has acute anemia according to the test She was highly likely to breastfeed her kittens more than she ate to raise her kittens well She has a poor nutritive condition as she's been feeding her kittens well Vet : When a cat gives birth to six kittens only two could survive in general But in her case, she raised all six kittens so well It was possible thanks to her devoted child rearing The mother cat nursed her kittens so well in such harsh streets Vet : As she allows people to touch and visited the hospital before, she must've been raised at home The mother cat wasn't a stray cat in the beginning But one day, the mother cat was left in the harsh street life What motivated her, who was afraid, to survive was these six kitten siblings
