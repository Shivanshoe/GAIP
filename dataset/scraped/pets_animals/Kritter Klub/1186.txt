I was left alone in the restroom on the trail People say, My grandmother's sick so she can't be with me anymore Then, where should I go now? While asking around.. A vet clinic nearby Found a dog who looks similar to Hwindoog Hello, is Hwindoong yours? I'm calling from the animal hospital Perhaps she's Whindoong Oh yeah, I got it Not her guardian I guess The caller seems young, and is fully aware of her dog's medical records Don't think she's talking about this dog Since then, from nowhere PD : Have you seen a grandma who walks a dog? Not a grandmother in late 80s Pekingese is pretty rare among dogs in here Couldn't find anyone who knows the dog She wouldn't have known about a dog shelter so the dog must have been abandoned like this For those who live alone, companion animals are the only family But For elderly pet owners, When faced with unexpected trouble They're left alone Expert : As the population's gradually aging and the family is formed in a small unit, It's highly likely that the elderly would be left alone That's why such issues will be increasing, not decreasing In overseas, there's a guide to prepare for such issues Expert : Hope there's a guide on how to deal with such issues for those who live alone with companion animals Local social workers make contact with the elderly who live alone, right? When they are somehow in a bad situation, Hope the people around them discuss how they're going to do with the animals Fortunately, I'm super bubbly! Expert : For her whole life, for 5 years Whindoong must have been cared for by people Perhaps she's created relations with people while growing up For the time being She'll be under temporary care at teacher Chanjong's training center! To such a bright dog like you, May new love comes Maybe that's.. what the grandmother truly wanted to deliver on the white paper
