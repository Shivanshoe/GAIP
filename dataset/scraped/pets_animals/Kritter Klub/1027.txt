When do they fly? I, squirrel, am sleeping zzz They sleep during the day and move during the night, that's why they just stay still even if you touch them during the day So we waited until the sunset hehe Those tenacious people I've had enough If you really want to see me fly.. They spread their patagium and after an amazing flight A nice landing You saw that? They can fly up to 75 cm Jump if they feel like they flew a bit checking twice They clean their patagium~ Enuff is enuff Flew enough for hoomans to shoot us Now we demand food Hang in there. An apple is on the way chop chop They like chestnuts most, and nuts as well These friends have a tendency to eat tree branches So we put pine needles or rose family trees and put them in Time to eat I'll be looking out Leggo!
