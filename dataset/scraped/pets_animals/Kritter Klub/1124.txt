Peekaboo Howls Not to be confused with puppies We're wolves! Not the kind you dance with tho Baby wolves may look like puppies But their paws are different Can you believe this guy will grow up into a big wolf? With proper care and nutrition Wolves grow up really fast (teenage wolves) I need my space (typical of those going through puberty) What are you doing by the wall? Grow up healthy and strong!
