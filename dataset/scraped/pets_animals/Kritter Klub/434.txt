Spring is coming But I guess I’ll be single again Sigh.. Been single for 5 years
Red panda ‘Lessi’ One who showed up in front of thirsty Lessi Striding Predestined love / Hi? Girl crush ‘Lemon’ (Quite a shy one) (Heart) (bouncing) Keeper : Lessi used to be quite timid But since Lemon came, he’s shown a lot of differences in behaviors 
(Guess he has a crush on meh..) Lemon / Lessi Love makes Lessi dance Ravin’ (Wut’s wrong with him) (Zero efs are given) (Lemon) (Lessi) : I've always been a step behind you Look at meh.. Annoying (Lemon) (Lessi) I'm confessing! (Lemon) (Lessi) / 
I like you.. Shoo! I hate you!! Embarrassing (Crew) Don’t shoot the dark side of meh! What a mess what a mess Lessi vents on the wrong one lol (Why are you doing dis do meh;;) Keeper : Since Lemon doesn’t show him an interest He’d come to me and take his anger out on me Giving up is for losers Lemon   Lessi Carefully The second confessing..? But! Snap! (Changes) (attitude) Quarrels Lessi who suddenly changed attacks Lemon Stahp! Embarrassed What’s going on.. Vet : I confirmed that hormone levels in his urination has been increasing day by day As we expected, him going into heat caused changes in his behaviors Lessi's in the mood for love Yet Since it didn’t work as he wanted He became more sensitive (Nah, that ain’t love..) Things will get better if we give him some time, little by little, rather than rushing Giving each one taking their own time enough is essential (Separate) (space) Entering Lessi, you.. look beautiful in a far distance, that's how you are That's how space for Lemon only is prepared! (Satisfied) I can do dis! Lessi never gave up And appealed his charms to Lemon (Oh my, daring you look stunning?) Hope they could go through such natural process as it is and start a good family, making their babies in the end Stickwitchu (I'll treat you better..) Let get it started again slowly and little by little Can't wait for the good news fellas..
