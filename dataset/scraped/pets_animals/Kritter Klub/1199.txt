There's an intruder in this house.. Oops Flees the scene of the crime Cuts through nooks and crannies The boiler room next to the balcony Is his hiding place? There you are! Comes and goes as it pleases My playground Woot It's so cozy here No it ain't Leaves when the owner comes Catch me if you can I feel bad for the cat so I feed him Watch me do my happy dance Wiggle wiggle Based on his size, he can't compete with the other cats So the boiler room is a perfect hideout But once he got here, he found no reason to leave It's too dangerous to live in the boiler room So we're gonna rescue you The cat used to always hide in dark places So I hope he lives out in the open with a good owner Thank you hoomans
