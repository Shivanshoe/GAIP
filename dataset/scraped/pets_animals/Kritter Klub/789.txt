A kitten crying inside the drain It was inside that drain for more than 10 days now I called for help and some firefighters came But they said there's no way to rescue the kitten A kitten is stuck inside the deep drain I should at least give it food everyday or else the kitten would starve to death The woman would put food inside the drain everyday The kitten eats it  right away Another cat in front of the drain Is it the mother cat ? The kitten responds to the cat outside crying The kitten tries hard to go to its mother The cat is staying right next to the drain Since the kitten is really light so it would be possible to take it out from the drain by pulling it with a net Using a small net to rescue the kitten They pull it slowly in case the kitten will get hurt It must have been so though for you little thing I'm so happy. I wasn't able to sleep for the last 10 days because I was too worried about this kitten It's surprising how this little kitten which is probably 2 months old stayed alive Everything is ok
