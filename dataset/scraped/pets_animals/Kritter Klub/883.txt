For 5 years, A thick pipe strangling the cat's neck But the cat is busy running away from help Uh, he went down Even if we are 5 meters away from him, he gets wary so it's hard to catch him Can't just watch him in a far distance as his condition is in distress The madam who's nursed him for 5 years : 
Wish I could remove the pipe on his neck and set him free That's all I can wish for. What else I can do Install a trap cage and wait What is this creature.. Animal Protection Organization : 
Guess he's not used to what he sees now since there's something new to him Soon after, because of hunger he lowers his guard Safely, rescued the cat! What was tightening the cat's neck? I got a report of a cat whose neck was stuck in a curved pipe As you can see, it's detached Once you put your head in here, this part falls off along with your head that you have to live with it on your neck Getting stuck in a pipe often occurs It's not humans but it's the cat who did on his own.. The cat was highly likely to get bumped into stuff while roaming around and got into an accident Nabi once you sleep soundly and get up the pain will be gone At the moment when the pipe that has strangled him for the past five years is removed Hope the terrible memories disappear along with it He has skin and muscle damages on his neck but, fortunately, they don't harm any vital systems such as airways or deep muscles of his neck Hope he gets peace in mind as well
