A dog carrying a backscratcher? Twirling a sangmo all of the sudden I'm the crazy dog of this area! It stood up...! With it's mouth wide open Brilliant foot skills LOL Someone make him stop Since when did the dog become like this? I was so shocked when he first started twirling a sangmo He started walking with only two legs like a human being So then I gave him a backscratcher and he started to use it as a cane. An energy which won't stop The owner tries to stop him Stop it It's going to make you tired Your legs are going to hurt I'm worried that his teeth and joints might get damaged because it's biting it all the time Taking him to an animal clinic He's totally fine. Very healthy. His thighs are so muscular and I guess it's because he walks around a lot Toto, the energizer which never stops Do whatever you want Toto~
