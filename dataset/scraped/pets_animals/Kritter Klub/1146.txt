They understood what the owner said Let's just tear this tissue :P OMG they went up there? Trouble maker LOL OMG no! So good at jumping Sneezing because the red pepper paste is spicy Look what you guys did! What is this red thing on your face? Wipes the red thing Acting like a father goat Me too~ What are these black goats doing at this restaurant? The owner first found them in the mountain Owner : I even looked around the boulder but I couldn't find the mother goat So then I was worried that they would die if I left them there The baby goats still had the umbilical cord around them when they were first found Are they healthy? How are they? You've raised them well. They are healthy It's good if you feed them colostrum which is full of antibodies Trying to feed them breast milk! Putting it near them But they run away Showing no reaction They don't know how a goat's nipple looks like The owner squeezes At last, they drink it Taking a bath with warm water Feels good~ So devoted A new house for the goats! It's so soft Grow up healthily guys!
