Lemmeow Meet Cats For you Hello, I'm a cat-lover, SBS animal PD This is the first time creating a video So I'm gonna take this opportunity to abuse my power From now on, I'm gonna get paid for touching a cat I have a cat just right on time And will film it nicely for those who don't have a cat to get a vicarious satisfaction out of this video Now I'm going to touch a cat for ya Sam(7) Running away right after stroking a belly is a point Fluffy and soft fur on chest~ A white fur is softer than the colored one Henlo, pinky jelly~ Cats are known to sleep 16 to 20 hours a day Will ya get up? Cuz I'm bored Awk... The easiest level - Touching back of the head But it's da cutest spot 7 years of fwendship easily allows me to touch his back Rub Just petted him lightly But why are you guys shedding so much? The cutest word ends with 'il' is a cat's ta'il' Take a look at his whiskers tho ;((( A kitty's ears which seem to pop at the touch of a fingertip~ Hammock + Cat  = Cuteness Overload Meowy punch~ Let him sleep now(cute tho *cries*) His tail doesn't fall asleep Heartbeat It's nighttime Mafia, please wake up Nose nose nose nose Marshmallow! He likes being scratched behind his ears Boypurriend pic.jyp Butler, why are you whining again Strawberry-flavored Haribo jelly Subscribers, How did you like my bragging about my cat disguised as a new segment of SBS animal?
