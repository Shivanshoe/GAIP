I almost passed out when I first saw him He really looked like a deer from the back But as soon as he turned his face, I figured he was a leopard A leopard appeared not in Africa but in a tranquil village? [Captured footage]
Informant : I thought he was a cheetah as soon as I saw him! His legs were pretty long and dark spots were very distinct A week ago He appeared He was this big with long legs His legs were long and had pricked ears Eyes were glaring Scary It's hard to find out who he is just by his appearance But what's certain is It was a day before yesterday, right? He entered all the way here, staring like this He hissed as if he was going to attack people It was terrifying when I first saw him I would've beaten him if he were small But I was scared, worrying he might attack me Gradually He has become a threat to villagers Additionally He entered the house down there a few days ago He was sitting near the rabbit hutch, watching rabbits to hunt them Informant : He went inside there Then I found him near this blue area He went into here with prey in his mouth Every animal in the village is prey for him who needs food Informant : Watch this [Captured footage]
He was in the video holding a cat in his mouth and disappearing to the bush Informant : He didn't just hold it in his mouth But the thing in his mouth was being dragged I'm sure that it wasn't a kitty The grass was shaking I assumed that he was eating it At the moment when looking around the place where he disappeared Anxious The crew : Don't come Suffocating confrontation Who are you..? Who are you..?
