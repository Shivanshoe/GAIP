I'm 'Yongarm' "I'm not a stray dog.." Even though the heavy, hardened fur tangled together weighs on me and it's uncomfortable to walk because I lost one leg The reason why I don't leave this place is.. The grandfather down there used to raise him but the grandfather passed away a while ago.. "Waiting for.. the grandfather" In an old house where the warmth's gone for long Only the traces of living together remain.. They were the only family to each other Without sharing last goodbyes the grandfather passed away because of the disease Since then the dog who was suddenly left alone Has been tracking down the traces of his grandfather until he winds up in a hideous look What's fortunate is "Yongarm!" The villagers who have worked hard to fill the absence of his grandfather Careful, careful Come here
Let me feed you meats~ "Come here~ Come here" Even if they want to help "He isn't coming after sensing the movement" "So pitiful!" The rescue is urgent In the spot where he often appears Install a trap net Wait for Yongarm to show up.. As time passes by The dog carefully approaches He's here! He's going in,
he's going in! Block the exit Under there, under there "We got him!" Finally face him in a closer look Flustered Yongarm "This is a farewell, okay?" I guess you're feeling sad? (Don't cry) (Something's in my eyes..) A long, wild life How's his health I conducted a test on each organ, to see if infection and anemia are developed The results from all tests were fine For heartworm disease, it's on class 1 or 2, which is treatable 'Yongarm' finally lets go of four years of long waiting (Clean) Are you Yongarm? "How does he look? So pretty, right?" "Aww pretty" Careful careful "Is this first time snuggling him?" "Yes.. He shivers.." "He must have struggled with missing leg.." Those times of pain he had to spend, waiting for his owner who passed away From now on, those times will be filled with warmth again because Yongarm's happiness is what the grandfather wants most
