An all-black rabbit! Huh? Unbelievable! Where did it hide its front legs? Owner: It had front legs when I first bought the rabbit But I looked carefully when I brought it home I thought the legs got injured or something Missing front legs...? Is this even possible? Trying to look for the person who sold the rabbit~ I wouldn't have sold it if I knew I really didn't know Did the wild animals attack it? So peaceful LOL Besides, there are no scars Owner: There are no wild animals near this area The rabbit is so healthy... Going to Seoul for a medical examination What is the result? Vet: It didn't have front legs from the first place What? Vet: It probably wants to move its shoulders but it doesn't have legs so it's using its pointy and thin shoulders which look like front legs Owner making a special house for the rabbit High-level house for the rabbit Owner: I feel sorry for the rabbit I'll try my best to take care of him Thank you, sir~
