The production crew arrives at a place after being informed of an injured dog. Production crew: Hi Informant: I've moved here recently and I felt so pitiful of the dog next door so... Informant: Follow me here At the place where they followed the lady... There was one white-furred dog... Quite a charming doggo Likes to be petted by people - Informant: Not our Hindoong.
- Crew: Oh, this one's not the one?
- Informant: No, it's not Informant: The dog I was talking about runs away at the sight of people. - And if a person is this far away, the dog comes close. 
The dog is probably looking at us right now.
- Oh, is that so? She says the dog that she reported us about should be watching us closely hidden somewhere... Installing observation cameras... And decided to watch from afar Informant: When looking from somewhere, the dog comes... At that moment! - Informant: At the chimney in the corner!
- Crew: Where, where? - Informant: Climbing up that mountain. Over there! Going up that mountain
- Crew: Oh, it's there! A white-furred dog resting on a hilltop far away As if he came to see Hindoong He comes closer a bit by bit.. At the appearance of strangers, he seems very wary as he doesn't come close Informant: Little one. Hindoong! That one! Seeing the white-furred dog up close, he seems to be in a critical state. White-furred dog with a collar severely tightening his neck He seems to be in a risky state...It's a pity to just look at him... Informant: The collar is so dark in color Even seeing from afar, it's dark in color and that part is bloated I really can't look at him 'cause he's choking. It's deepening more and more... Scracthing the wound that is itchy and painful... Informant: How can people look at that and do nothing? And the dog 'Hindoong' who stays by the white-dog's side and takes care of him Informant: From what we see, Hindoong takes care of him a lot I think she knows he's sick. How should I put it? Like mother and son or a couple? From what we see, they're getting along like that. Hindoong licks the white-furred dog's scars without forgetting to once She's a great comfort to the white-furred dog. Informant: Aw, Hindoong is so pretty.. So kind, come here. As the woman comes close, the white-furred dog is busy running away. Town resident: 911 came twice already, but the dog is so quick-witted For the white-furred dog who is very wary towards strangers, Informant: Heemang, come here! they even gave him a name and tried to call him over... But Heemang won't let down his guard even once. Crew: So you don't know where the dog came from? Informant: No clue. I don't know if he's just some dog from this town nor if he has an owner. - Crew: Oh, so he showed up out of the blue?
- Informant: Yes, we don't know anything. The crew decided to look around if there's anyone who might know anything about Heemang Crew: Hi there! - Town resident: No, haven't seen such a dog.
- Crew: Oh, is that so... - Town resident: No white-furred dog passes by here.
- Crew: Oh, really? After asking around for a long time! - Town residnet: There was a dog farm here.
- Crew: Oh, really? Town resident: Yes, since a few months ago... They found out that there had been a dog farm recently. - Town resident: There was one until early this year.
- Crew: Oh this year? Town resident: Yes, it was located here, but after awhile, they've demolished the place and must've released the dogs. Three or four dogs started to roam around the place with tangled fur... So the dog might be one of the dogs that have escaped... Could Heemang might have experienced such a dire situation too? That's how he might have met 'Hindoong' out of coincidence Then the two might've developed friendship since then... Informant: If he's cold, he keeps sleeping in Hindoong's house. And Hindoong ends up crawled up outside.. Even late at night, Hindoong can't sleep soundly... Being next to Heemang, she licks his wound and comforts him. They are a great comfort to one another... Informant: Brings me to think that... I'm in my 70s but if something happens to me, I can be worse off than the dogs like them... So I thought we must save those kind of dogs. Giving up her house for Heemang And for Heemang, Hindoong silently stays by his side Next day Informant: I thought she might eat if I cook some meat porridge. The delicious meat prepared by the lady Hindoong eats very well Informant: Her eyes hurt Seeing now, something's off with Hindoong's eye The eye looked fine yesterday, but now it's filled with eye boogers and is swollen. Hindoong was busy rubbing her eyes even last night :'( Resucing the two is urgent.. The vet and the rescue team arrives. First, he checks Hindoong's eyes. Cha Jin-Won, Vet: If only one eye is like that, what we can suspect it to be is just a light conjunctivitis. I need to get a closer examination and check the inside of the eye. Next is Heemang's turn. Cha Jin-Won, Vet: If the collar digs into the flesh, there might be severe inflmmation. Remove all the inflammation and need to suture it for the neck to heal. Preparations for rescue has begun And decided to get help from Hindoong Heemang drawing closer... Rescue team: He's coming, coming, coming! He goes toward Hindoong as usual, but Might be feeling suspicious of the unfamiliar capturing cage that he hesitates on entering ... Vet: There's nothing. Head in! Informant: Please, get in... Just when he lets down his guard and heads in... Closing the door quickly Rescue team: Done! The rescue is a success! Rescue team: It's okay, it's okay Comforting the dogs at the sudden change in situation Informant: He's gonna live now!! Luring wary Heemang inside the cage... Rescue team: That's it. Good boy. To check on Hindoong's eye condition They decided to transport them to the hospital together As he's very wary, Heemang starts to growl Vet: He's growling He's really sick right now and seems to be very wary towards people. Examining at this state might lead to hurting one another, so Let's let him calm down for a moment Examining Heemang closely after taking sedatives... His condition was much worse than they expected. When they removed the leash that was tightening his neck, a deep wound was found... Cha Jin-Won, Vet: This was tightened at the end. That small collar tightening his neck making it hard for him to breathe...How painful it must've been! Cha Jin-Won, Vet: He must've had it on when he was 3 or 4 months old. That would mean he has been wearing the collar for at least a year. Heemang had to live through the pain for more than 1 year... Cha Jin-Won, Vet: Area for the surgery to take place is quite wide, so I think it'll take around an hour and an half. And if sutured well, the dog won't have any major health problems. As long as the suture is done well, he says there won't be any major health problems Praying that the surgery goes well... Cha Jin-Won, Vet: The wound on the top half is minor, but the bottom half is too severe... So doing the surgery there took a long time. The inflammation keeps arising then sinking then arising again... That's why it was difficult to do surgery on that part. But the surgery went well. Fortunately, Heemang completed the difficult surgery well. How about Hindoong? Cha Jin-Won, Vet: It's conjunctivitis. Since she licked Heemang a lot. There's a high possibility that when licking, Heemang's wound touched her eyes, causing inflammation. Hindoong who was lonely, and Heemang with wounds in the inside and the outside...Their heartfelt friendship Now, we hope for Heemang and Hindoong to live healthily together! :) Hindoong: "Let's go home after being treated Heemang!"
(The lady adopted Heemang for Hindoong to have a friend by her side)
