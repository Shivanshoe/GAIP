Back then, We removed lumps from shark's fins and made prosthetic eye for an eyeless crocodile A Kritter Klub Original series Animal Hospital for Tiny Animals Do you remember Asoon from Ep.1 This is Asoon's housemate Crested gecko Shoodal, 1 year old Unlike Asoon Shoodal is very active Shoodal: I will go on my way And even Shoodal couldn’t dodge Guardian: The egg wouldn’t come out, it’s been overdue Suffering from Egg binding TwT *There are various causes of egg binding Shoodal: LET GO Shooldal's ultrasound scan Choi Young Min, Vet: It's way past the time to lay the egg Choi Young Min, Vet: The round thing~ you see it?> PD: I see it Doc, take my egg out please.. Shoodal goes in for a surgery Choi Young Min, Vet: One of the eggs is very firm and thick There are two more eggs like that We’re going to perform a surgery, taking out (three) eggs If you wake up from a nap You’ll feel much better (Guardian, close your eyes) This operation is different from Asoon's egg removal because they’re taking out three eggs! Takes out the egg carefully (Camera got scared) There’s more. Four. Woah there were more I feel relieved By stitching the incised part, finished! PD: Finished?  / Vet:Yes~ all finished But our expectation was wrong Thought there were three eggs, but it turned out to be four (Awks) Choi Young Min, Vet: Anyway, it (surgery) went well Breathes by itself Well done Shoodal TwT Afterward Shoodal eating food It's delishoos But I, Shoodal... Won't eat the medicine! Give up... (Fine, do what you want) Shoodal is feeling much better now :)
