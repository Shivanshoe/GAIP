Have you seen a hyena
(song lyrics) wandering around the foot of a mountain for prey
(song lyrics) Looking for rotten meat
(song lyrics) Hyena in the savanna
(song lyrics) Huh? What's wrong with that? Sigh.. I'm the biggest victim of Disney Wait, I'm getting choked on my tears.. Mufasa and a cub lion, Simba The beneficiaries of media.. Yawns- It's all about making up!  :p We, Hyenas, on our way, strive hard to survive among these grown-up kitties (crying..) The last in the ranking, a lioness Imma eat up here Yo, big kitty over there! Those uncultured fellas Cultured Look how cultured I am lolol (Got it) The more you share, the happier you get Our Hyenas act on it first^^ Wth Omg Look how upset they're They dunno about our highest aim.. (Oops, mistake) r u a comedian..? keke(Giggly) As long as survival rests on prey It's a law of nature to fight w/o considering rankings! Argh, that douche.. What did you just say? We hunt too in a group. Our target is the weakest creature *sniff* Or An injured fella Though it seems cold-hearted Keep on surviving is a natural way of our life What a beautiful Savannah in Kenya.. But to the wild animals.. this is also the land of the 'Survival of the fittest'
(Life is always tough..haha)
