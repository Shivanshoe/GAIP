here I spy Bible studios Matthew asking do big cats like lasers like my house cat maybe you've never tried teasing them with lasers so I'm not actually sure I suspect that that would be frowned upon in this industry that's Clark they have a darling from Florida welcome poison I don't know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly but welcome negan Edwards Hamilton Ontario Canada in sexy Casey's little son little Sunny Delight says hello to you not chalk Krueger sightings could be T hello Tina dev Ben hello hello from here from myself Gareth and in the vehicle with me is rest I'm just gonna assume art but you can just see the edge of rest as they say he's getting ready to and film the snippet of seeing the tree good morning good morning good afternoon and all the race to where we are in the world shop there thanks okay so yeah she comes she's gonna keep quiet while she's moving around Chacma asking do we have a name for the slippered we do indeed her name is then Coveney female and we were with her this morning and she is fast asleep but it looks like she's just starting to get active now he is born in 2012 and his daughter to the Mushaf a female and daughter to the Marquis male leopard in survival studio is just saying most big cats actually do not like lasers due to a science experiment that was conducted thanks for that for chiming in they're not aware of that experiment say good tonight I'm sure one asking what's the situation so the situation is that the top of that tree in the middle of the screen but to the top of the screen is a bit Impala hanging in the tree and that is it Impala that then could be any female courts we think early this morning she hasn't fed on much of the Impala it's quite a lot lifts and she's been resting up for the day and it seems like she's probably gonna climb that tree now and start feeding on it again broken wing asking do you guys come back or we've been there all this time no we did go back to camp we are right next to camp here so it's easy to pop in and out but by the looks of it she hasn't feared on that Impala whatsoever since you've been away so I think you made the right call to go back to camp and charge our batteries last Clarke Michigan they have a darling Florida spa the ceilings greetings from East Africa okay I think I've gone through a couple of days I Sammy Jane welcome back levena dear energy from Croatia got here from Dubai welcome back Pam Hudson Katy Bette Midler from the Motor City is that Detroit okay it says a few guesses as to what time this leopard is gonna see in the tree the drive saying 5:00 p.m. four minutes from now so that is at 5 th and it's not it's a 10 to 5 4 minutes from now sir that's wrasses estimate that's a cut a good call I'm gonna say 10 minutes from now 5 to 5 Friday saying 3 past 5:00 Bernie Lopez commenting on how old the tree is it is a very tall tree imagine how much power it takes to drag that Impala casket carcass up the tree and it's a knob thorn tree sassy Cassie asking winded the leopard kill the Impala we suspect early this morning Nadav asking about the hyenas and a dove we actually got a letter to the sleep and moving around by one of the heaters that saucer we're seeing being around all day and I think these hyenas are gonna go anyway just here to their full carcass up the tree I'm sure they're hoping that when she gets up there maybe makes a mistake and drops pieces down if not the whole thing she has a lipid in her prime so I think she knows how to handle the carcass in the tree and lucky for them star potatoes asking you would have fall from this height hurt the leopard I've seen lipids jump out of trees way higher than that and they were fine I guess if any cat if it lands in an awkward position it could get hit but it's very seldom that cats do land in awkward positions okay she's at the base of the tree not just to the right underneath that arching trunk five ones let it up that affects a rest is just busy filming I'm not going to disturb him right now but he was absolutely spot-on with what time that liquor is gonna climb the tree started climbing it Tim tea grass Superbikes welcome back she's just and if you saw that drop out of the treaty there was a bit of fear that she's flaking off there prepare to pull some of that fear off before they tear the skin open lot more fastidious at feeling than some of the other predators just gonna try and catch up with some of these comments yeah okay so how often do we go live sassy kasi here we go live whenever we have the opportunity to about 10% of our of our property has cellular section and when we are within that region we can go live and just tell me if this is zoomed in too much in a bit late for you but for the rest of the sightings what we do is we will film them and then put them on our YouTube channel Mada Mada game reserves YouTube channel then mr. wild UAE 87 was the G that asked this question let me just catch up they the inner heart dominant female lipid in malamar the game reserve right now they are a number of of territorial females at Mala Mala and so there isn't one male model is quite a large property say there is a number of female lipids that whole territories within the boundaries of Mala Mala and some of the territories overlap with our neighbours and that's the territories of lipids tend to be quite small in this area because there's a high concentration of game it's a very productive area so that I need to travel very far to find animals to hunt and kill and ultimately feed on Gianluca just commenting on that jumpier that initial jump was quite something right number mesh hi from Singapore a it's nice to see all people in the chat room right now welcome all and yes just covered in ting if she drops a tie he knows is gonna be pulling up that's for sure there's at least three hyenas in the immediate area ceci Cassie just asking what's the name of our YouTube channel so Marla if you just go to Marta Marla game reserves website or just search Marlo miler game reserve and on YouTube we have a series called ranges in isolation where we've been making quite a few videos okay so that's Russ let's just saying this am i heinous coming right at the base of this tree I'm just going to zoom out so he can maybe see it's currently in the shadow and okay I'll see it well there we go it's obviously heard think of any female feeding on the carcass up there he's decided to go and wait underneath the tree read much get some scraps yeah where every year I'm going to its effects we are currently with Raths he is filming a documentary here and we are going to just do whatever he needs to do to get his shots so some of you have asked why I screamed and I'm zoomed all the way out now so you can see how far we are Russell's got a serious lens day we're not gonna be able to get the shot that he does but you just got to wait until the documentary comes out but to see the close-ups get a trrs I'm happy to medieval studio saying it's raining in Parliament going to catch up on some of these comments while we drive oops just way too Elon tousled Robin welcome back then superbike saying people come into your SS filming a documentary question mark exclamation mark question mark yes indeed and then Superbikes saying yes is the documentary say in this case yes he is yeah so Kimberly is just asking is there a name of the document yet Kimberly it's all a big secret for now there's grass the drain that you don't get to see this morning so for those of you that missed out on this morning's live stream and we spent a bit of time and he spoke to us a little bit about wildlife filmmaking this has got a lot of experience in making films and recently made a film in India about black leopards in the Kabini forest so there's the leopard in the tree Beyond rustles hit there Kevin Stewart asking rich provinces Mala Mala we are in informal anger it's a given of you ever been to squeezer which is the main camp of the Kruger National Park the capital camp has a brain and Mala Mala is pretty much directly north of that you look at across the river from the camp and the restaurant we are pretty much and pretty much directly north of there yeah this is good so part of filmmaking is finding the right spots rest has got the angle in we've got our angle here tell me if I dreamed in too much and it becomes blurry wait for your comments snack a tech asking what's that on the hood it is a drone it's a DJI inspire 2 Kevin living in hazyview and Bob since it doesn't look too far away it's very close to Haiti Israel asking how all this is lipid as born in 2012 so pushing on eight years old nah not sure exactly when in 2012 but yeah teacher 1997 are you never afraid of any animal attacking and or jumping into the car and for the most part no I think that anything we've really got to worry about and is elephants when we in the vehicle may be a bullying masked or angry email elephant because they are big enough to do damage and for the most part our cats a very relaxed around these vehicles in a very least the way we behave around them still they're quite tolerant of our presence and having said that one of the Rangers nearly got stuck art for those of you that watch our youtube series Ginette the other Gareth Gareth metal Smith and he got stuck out in the bush of the Khumbu Laprade and he's lucky enough to FD sulfur and Becky Kemp and obviously if the battery dies the radio does you know he leaves all communication like this another guy there was busy driving away and he would have had to spend the night at their all twenty Lions actually 22 Lions with the car emails and yeah I wouldn't want to spend an entire night with those Lions and in close proximity in an open vehicle by myself Jesse Castillo asking all the drones very effective in tracking animals no yeah ok so rest has got the most experience and the drones yet so what do you can dress just because the monitor it's difficult see on the monitor or [Music] it's pretty easy but then if you're trying to find an animal in a second you'll and I stir the feedback isn't as crystal clear you know as I'm getting like directly from the camera everybody's commenting on the larger is good luck Kimberly Lopez cheering you on the arrests love the light go rest okay Lee Harold just commenting my specimen Krueger scene unfortunately that's not going to happen yeah you're welcome Lee we are very pleased and fortunate to be able to bring you these sightings by a live stream pepillo Howard I think totally you've been on here before welcome back and in London Lizzie say she is born in done Lizzie and I believe that is correct London Lizzie is not far away from us and in fact we and he really started seeing the slippered and regularly last year and before that she was almost exclusively on London lazy say and it's been a joy to watch a the side and yeah she's pretty much settled down here Marla mala Headley I'm pretty sure she still goes to London Lizzie and that she's very much at home around our main camp we often see her in camp in fact I think the rest has seen her hunt impalas in camp and but yeah so their territory is due to shift and she's decided to shift gears to Mala Mala main camp in semi J and Casper asking him convenient female spot pattern question mark so for those of you that want to know what she's what Sammy Jane is talking about is one of the easier ways to recognize a leopard not the only way that one of the tell-tale signs have a look above the top whisker line and above the top whisker line these lipids usually have a number of spots sometimes it's one sometimes it's two sometimes it's five and when you refer to the spot pattern if we looking at the leopards face and Coveney female is - - so she's got two spots above it right over top whisker line on the left hand side of her face or here right hand side of the face and then another two spots in the other side so in this particular female is - to you in fact just commenting on Xena his Anna doesn't come in this far south or east and someone saying that maybe inconvenience as an his girlfriend the last male leopards and Coveney female mated with and we're the maxims metal the cynical Bush male and the flat rock male the flat rock male is another leopard that we seeing more often lately and he is spending a lot of time in camp and he likes to mark st. mark on reception at Matamata main care san parks helicopter is flying by being their job for engine super box asking us you got any Cubs she had a cab until recently and and that cab hasn't been seen we suspect it's dead and here in the Piccadilly female actually had Dane sites within 500 meters of each other at once - good afternoon Christine pretty a scratch and this is then convey anything I'll welcome back and then giraffe girl asking head of any other cap survived yes and the plaque Rock female is her last cab to have survived and the plaque rock female assay is kind of following link of any female around and spend a lot of time around our camp and but she is recently independent and Sammy J and Casper just commenting on her mating with a max analysis in a bush male and the flat rock mill there is a reason for that and so here territory overlaps with those male leopards so she has to ensure that they all those males think that the Cubs belong to each one of those males and actually if she were to have three cubs is a possibility of each one of those cows belonging to each one of those nails which is quite amazing but if another male which that hadn't major de theory where to come across a Cubs he would certainly kill her Cubs so she's just covering her basis by mating with all of them in fact she caused the big catfight between the senior Bush between the flat rock male and the maxims male and another catfight so when she followed the single Bush male to mate with him and was mating with him with the resident female leopard in the city girl bush males territory the piccadilly female they all said a catfight so she did and caused a lot of issues giving steer just asking how long do you let his mate and well it can vary we've seen the Piccadilly female made to the cynical Bush male on an off for months and usually it's about a week where they met quite intensely and at the peak of it much match every few minutes and the actual actual active part of mating is is over within a few seconds and it's the female that initiates everything she's very promiscuous having a chuckle here and they survival studios trying some figures are there's all okay so no dubs just put a fight up there I'm wondering which one that is Nadav I know I know we did capture both fights on video so if it's two males fighting and then conveniently female breaks them up that's the maxims male and flat rock male fighting and then the other one is the inconvenient the piccadilly female fighting and the scene of course bush male breaks Matt giraffe girl asking yes you become mating again no rest you want to do that not just shortening you in this fact so we've got TV in you ain't gonna be able to a large team this for about another 15 minutes and so if you have questions please ask and thank you for joining us today see the large gang field quickie okay so the sighting that Nadal posted there was inconvenient flat truck in Maxim's mail hours at that sighting was really exciting and it was Dan Bailey that filmed that sighting Superbikes unfortunately we have to leave but yes it's been a real pleasure to see you back here again then the day of asking what other sightings are happening this afternoon Nadav is a little bit wise as to what happens on the property because he's here not so long ago so I think the Campbell a prior art and about out of cell phone range and then the campaign female was hunting campaign females lesser leopard she was hunting a head of kudos in the South she must Kevin steer to asking the different leopards take their kills into trees with the previously was a killer would do that always cheese new treats to hide the kills Kevin's good question they do like to use the same trees if they hunt in certain areas they definitely do you have favorite trees and we really drive around the Sun trees that we look in almost every single time we drive by just because it's it's amazing how often they like to take kills up into the same trees kimberly asking which male leopard do you prefer if possible the maxims male is a very exciting male leopard because he knew nothing about him and he's set up shop in a very productive area at Mala Mala and he's a very strong fighter and looks like he has pretty good genes and he's starting to relax around vehicles that we quite enjoying but in terms of relaxed male leopards I'd say my favorite is probably then 'wait email here we see a the saw hello thank you for that comment and we appreciate it and we enjoy bringing these live streams Russ Russ is commenting from the vehicle here during the off X I think we're gonna have to hit the road now say that it was a short and but yeah I really enjoyed this lash cream again with you all and we look forward to the next one yeah say yeah so yeah I mean we'll definitely be it like the dev says yeah just click that Bell icon and be reminded of these or notified when we did go alive and thanks to the dev for your help again and yeah follow all our social media outlets and enjoy the ranges and isolation series for more sightings and yeah just one last thing before we go I'll just say just to rest there hopefully we see a bit more of Russ during his stay a gentle the end of the month okay thanks a dad
