so i think we are alive all right folks welcome i see there's five of you welcome to the five of you to malamata game reserve uh we will be welcoming more as more folks join the chat we are live with a kambula pride if you want to let your friends know there's a whole bunch more folks um yeah if you want to let your friends know we are currently live with the cumberland there's a young male walking over there it's about all the action you've seen so far just arrived here mark found these lines this morning and they haven't moved far from where they were just going to keep the camera on this line walking for a moment and then introduce you a little bit more formally but for those of you guys have been missing mark kirkman is back just before he goes on leave welcome back and goodbye everyone yeah so there we go there's the rest of the pride right yet and then just so you can all see mark before he goes on leave there we go and then myself gareth all right so i'm going to get this set up please feel free to ask any questions excuse the wobbling for the start here i'll try and do this quickly so just to answer a couple of the quick questions that are coming through um so this is the kambula pride and the males the gauri males are just too as you can see anyway but to the right of us or out of the lions and we know them as agari males but they're also called the birmingham males but yeah they are here they're just lying under a bush in the shade so not easy to see them yeah we'll show you at some point and hello to giraffe girl and sammy jane uh quite a few of you and thank you so much to cynthia hill yeah thanks cynthia definitely appreciated hello from indonesia and i hello from california so we've this lion pride we'll see i'm hoping that they actually get up and about a little bit earlier today it's not not exactly cold here but it is a pretty cool day the lions you can see all lying out in the sun and they're just trying to warm up a little bit but we right at malamala's airstrip so if you look for malamala camp on google maps then we not even a kilometer south of the camp you'll see the the airstrip you might be able to make it out in the background here um but yeah the lions have been walking all over the place um i don't even know how many kilometers they've covered in the last two days but probably 20 kilometers and for those of you that follow our youtube channel we've got some pretty exciting episodes coming up with things that they have been chasing around uh but yeah it's i think the goal of the adults at the moment seems to be to show the cubs the whole territory every 24 hours welcome to adam from india turley x steve mcfarl alejandro sanchez san antonio tigerwomen484 asking are there any cubs well not quite yet but we do suspect that one of these kambula lionesses is pregnant i can't see [Music] no but one of the lionesses does have some ca well it's very heavily pregnant and she hasn't had cubs yet she's just about to within the next day or two if you go on our youtube channel you'll see one of our more recent videos with her where you can quite clearly see how heavily pregnant she is but way in the distance in the background you can see the crest of the hill there almost exactly opposite us is where we saw it yesterday with uh an impala kill and gareth and i were following wild dog tracks when we actually found her and we really suspect that the dogs had killed the impala and she stole it so she's not moving with the pride at the moment um so it's yeah that's why we think her birth is or birth is imminent in the high draft goal michael carolina leonie rian diaper robin welcome back cham it has been a while and we've been very busy this side and it's been good also so if you look sort of just underneath the tree that they're sleeping on more or less at the base of it and just see the youngest cub or one of the three youngest cubs moving around there and unfortunately these cubs are a little bit older now so they're in the the scruffy stage and not the cute little cuddly things at the moment um and shame they're gonna well hopefully when the other lioness gives birth they'll be the new cute kids and tom these these little cubs won't get all the attention that they're used to michael's just asking if we can show the guy emails michael we will and we're not going to do that right now there seems to be a bit more action here with these lines and at some point you will move over to them and give you a better look pam hudson welcome back kambula pride yes indeed and sticks and stones asking do you think the kambula pride will eventually split and form a breakaway pride um we'll have to see they've some of the lionesses have been moving around separately and the pasta used to be they're six lionesses um but there'd be four that would go and do their own thing and then two others that would move around separately now with the one presumably about to give birth she's been more or less on her own just exploring potential dan sites on that and if she does have cubs that might be in the interest to to stay a little bit separate from this big gang um but you know if anything they should have or we would have thought they'd might split with the lioness with the four youngest cubs um but that just that didn't happen um the thing is in most areas it would make sense for a big part of there's 20 of them to split up but yeah there's just so many animals that they they do seem to be able to find enough to eat and that i've never seen this prod looking skinny and scrawny and battling for food they always seem to be in pretty good shape and for those of you that are patient in a couple of days we'll put up a video of them eating an impala and you can watch from start to finish that impala disappears in 3 minutes and 30 seconds so they do make a lot of kills but unless you happen to be there watching it go down you know you just wouldn't even know um the one of the more recent videos you can see where they killed a big adult buffalo which is an 800 kilogram odd animal a bit less than that that's a three-quarter ton animal that they disappear in one night the next morning there's just some bones and a couple of hyenas around so you know they're certainly able to feed themselves so there's no need to split into smaller groups at the moment and just james milovitz asking how long will she be separate from the pride after giving birth and will there be completely no contact with the pride till she returns with cabs i think that's very dependent on what the pride's movements are and if they go past where she might be denning those cups she may join up with them temporarily and but she'll also you know if they walk too far away from the cubs then she won't join them because obviously she has to feed those cubs so she'll hunt close by to the den site and then um go back and forth to feed the cubs at a very young age and hello to superbikes and to johann du plessis uh he's asking do lies need to drink water every day so they don't necessarily need to and they will if they can and you know for these lines it's quite easy because the sand river runs right through the middle of their territory and there's a few water holes around so they will drink when there is water close by um but i know the lions in namibia and some of the other sort of desert areas do go a few days between drinks but they're not completely independent of water so that racket you can hear is a crowned pleather that's giving the lions a hard time it might have a nest here and you're having a little heart attack that the lions are coming past [Music] get them there you can see them [Music] you flying wonder why something as small as these birds would be worried about the lions because the lions are definitely not going to go and try and hunt them but the predator of those birds is the smaller cat so imagine seeing a giant version of something that gives you the creeps like a 10-foot spider you know all your alarm bells are gonna start going off especially when you see danger supersized and then a question here from mr wld wild uae 87 is that a kambula line is daughters of machingelani brothers um so as i understand that the daughters of the manuale yeah the manuletti males are sad to be corrected but the yeah i'm not sure if they were called something else on a different property and but yeah normally we'll name lions for the territories they live in here um rather than a sort of more whimsical name but yeah i'm not sure what the the manualetti males were called elsewhere i seem to remember it being the maginga lions but that sure i want to say that was five or six years ago now so it's been some time for my memory to become a bit hazy lots of different lines in between yeah because yeah as i remember correctly the manualetti males were sort of replaced in this area by the macho perry males who were the first males to mate with these lionesses and have cubs with them who in turn were replaced by the southern avoca males and who in turn were replaced by these scary males so there was quite a a lot of handover of this particular territory on the male side and then the lionesses this kambula prad is a break away from the monthly pride or break away from the breakaway monthly pride so they're kind of twice removed from the motherly pride night and they took over this territory from the ifield pride who now live in the south of malamala but it's more or less a pride of one because it's just the one adult lioness and her daughter at the moment and does he 1369 just commenting that this pride and krieger sightings are what started my streaming safaris in march that's uh nicely here does he 1369 and nice to see that you're still with us and enjoying these live streams we'll say enjoy all of your comments on our youtube channel [Music] so so dizzy 1369 saying conceive potential prey way down at the end of the airstrip i can see uh of all the best i don't know actually i can see i've heard of all the best it looks like they're grazing on tom actually yeah it really does and new moon phase and that so the nights will be particularly dark and if the lions were patient which they're not it would be a good idea for them just to really sit tight here in the grass and just wait for the the impala it would eventually filter out here but then johann du plessy asking is it possible to fly into case but i think uh there's a nightly rate here it just makes more sense in terms of our schedule of leaving very early in the morning for game drive and also driving until you know into the evening it just makes more sense that um the drives are kind of split by the night and you know if you're flying for the day you'd be driving at not the most ideal time of day and i think you know nowadays with the world turned upside down i think we could probably make a plan if need be um sorry ratimel i think i missed your question earlier up i see you referring to uh cooperation between the males and females who runs a pride question so the males they control kind of a super territory and then within that super territory are the individual prides of females that have their own territory so like a um a way of thinking of it is if you we're frying say four eggs in a pan the pan being the mail lines territory with the females being those four eggs so the the white of the the egg is more or less where the overlap of territory is and the yellow being the core really defended territories that is where they're going to be raising cubs and that but the other lions certainly do have a lot of overlap um in pride territories but within that super territory is all the males are controlling the super territory that have the prides within it so the gari males here they control this the kambula pride and the motherly pride they seem to have almost abandoned the inca huma pride to the northern avoca males but yeah it's not that you have a male lion with his pride um it's a little bit more complicated than that um you know for things like the lion king i saw someone else brought up um you know it's a nice story but it's not really the the case so i'm just seeing this lionesses just getting up and i don't know if she was just looking at her sisters or if she actually saw something and dizzy 1369 asking would that pride of to be welcomed into another pride so no not at all the lionesses will never accept another lioness from a sort of a foreign pride um into their group you can say this fight with the attack the while she's recovered she was actually seen this morning with her daughter not far from here and i was looking in the comments anybody commented uh sure sorry folks we're not entirely sure if we still live or not the stream seems to have been broken up uh that looks like we love you in there all right so folks i think okay there desi 1369 says we are live um so it was just our screens we'd all gone blank on this side so we weren't sure if we were live or not so you can see some of the lions are slowly getting up and filtering off to the left there um but the males are to the right of us it's just where they are it's not easy to see them and they're lying in quite deep shade so it'll it won't really come out too well on the screen and i'm hoping that once the lionesses are moving around that the males will come out to to show them thanks robin for letting us know we are still live as well so [Music] okay i'm not seeing the pregnant lioness here so i'm assuming she's somewhere down in the river and we really are hoping that she has her cabs somewhere here a lot of these cabs or the smallest ones anyway we're born right in front of uh rat race camp and then some of the other cubs were born in the river more or less opposite where we are the southern end of the malamala airstrip and there's some quite dense thickets along the river there so they'll have their cubs in those tickets and that it's plenty of food for the mother because she will be hunting on her own for a lot of the time um but it's also the core of the pride's territory so they do spend a lot of time in the general area um superbugs asking what is the most cubs they can give birth to at a time i might be wrong but i think four is the max i can't remember ever seeing more than four cabs [Music] but here almost have you ever seen more than four cars no so i think four cabs is kind of the limit i've never known them to have more they're cheater they're they're cats that seem to have the most cabs and you hear every now and then of like a cheetah with six cabs and so on and the with the cheetah hardly any of their cubs make it with the lions are a lot more successful this pride of the cubs that they have managed to raise past two months so once they kind of up and following they've only lost i think one cab now one of the these littlest ones um but before that they had lost quite a few litters of cabs mainly to other male lions when the pride's territory was getting handed over from one set of males to another unfortunately all the cubs that had with the previous males were killed off and that it wasn't through sort of any negligence on the the lionesses part it was just the males not being able to hold on to their territories i can assure you we are inside a vehicle how the animals don't mind us at all in the vehicle they've grown up with us around um but humans on foot seems like more waking up not just commenting on the the color and the light here and you can see so clearly now why lions are the colors they are because now in the winter they really need to blend in with this grass the grass is very sparse at the moment and not long at all so they can just kind of blend in with the grass in the background and it's very difficult for the animals to pick them out particularly after dark but they do hunt a lot in the day at this time of the year and then in the summer when the grass is long and lush and green and the vegetation is quite thick it almost doesn't matter what color the animals are if they're hiding behind [Music] bush and so on [Music] so it looks like they're studying with mobile now yeah it looks like they're all kind of waking up i think what we'll do is head over to the mails um quickly so just give us a moment to reposition the vehicle and then we'll try get a look at the males and see if they're gonna wake up and follow the the pride all right but also we will be off the comments for a while while we're moving the vehicle around so just give us a moment okay there we have it i hope it comes back and three all right so i see robin has messaged me that we've lost the signal there we'll just i think what we're gonna do if you can here rides on the move yeah okay there we go we're back in singapore like so it seems like we're live again we drove over to the um gary males which is literally 20 meters away from where we are parked and there was no signal there so it seems like we're live again we're gonna have to wait until the emails join us in the land of signal so the rest of the pride we're starting to starting to walk off into the distances one line is quite far ahead of the rest of the card yeah and it seems like the rest will follow suit which is nice to see some active lions thank you thanks but you can see it's wake up and bathroom break time um oh very lucky you don't have smell-o-vision but we're gonna i think what we'll do is try and keep up with the sort of youngsters trailing here at the back um and just see on the off chance if they actually do anything exciting and it's nice to actually see the lions up and moving now while there's still some daylight just went back there yeah that's a nice view of them mark just doing some directing there yeah they all come this is quite a lovely site is having a number of lines walking towards you from the safety of a vehicle mr karanth welcome back as well the hello from north carolina and the moroccan in paris fox if you have any friends that might want to see active lines as opposed to sleeping maybe now's the time to take a screenshot and pass it on and just never know what might happen this happened in the situation but it is lovely to see them moving just keep an eye on the lioness you can see uh all the cubs are greeting her as they come past she's just left now yeah so i think i don't know she's almost looking as if potentially have seen something you can see a lot of the youngsters are stopping and just watching what's going on up ahead when gareth and i were driving here we did pass some impala a small group of zebra and some giraffe so there are quite a lot of animals in this general area shhh and brand 131 they certainly can smell us and they can definitely see and hear us talking and that right here by them they just know that we're not a threat and we're not going to do anything to them so there's no need for them to get overly concerned by us or you can see they're completely disinterested in us in fact this is one of the pleasures of working here is that we have these animals that are disinterested in us and it allows them to view their behavior and as it would happen as though we weren't here which is exactly what you want to do and it's amazing to watch you know we've time after time you know they've surprised us especially the leopards they never cease to press to surprise us i read one thing about them and then the next they're doing the opposite and the dav has also just joined us so the dove to catch you and everyone else up that's just joining us this is the kambula pride they've just woken up um we actually didn't even get a chance to check what time it was but it is 20 past four i think when they started to wake up and more or less where that last cup is coming from is where the two gallery males are just still sleeping under a tree we're hoping that they're gonna get up and follow the rest of the pride but we're just going to try and keep up with the pride um there's a bit of a value they're going into hopefully the signal stays there it's been a bit spotty this afternoon but if not we'll wait up at the top here with the males um and hopefully the lionesses do something dramatic and something dramatic where there is cell phone signal yeah so that value that you're that they're headed towards i don't know if i mentioned it to mike or perhaps dan or pete and but if we had mentioned it you'd remember it we refer to it as the fridge because it gets really cold down there at night i think i might have brought it up with you all right so these are the last of the three younger lions [Music] just when the lions are hunting obviously we try and give them as much opportunity as we can we obviously want to see kills and so on and but the lionesses also leave the youngsters kind of at the back uh so that they can do their thing without too much interference show him he stepped on a thorn um but yeah so we'll hang around with the cubs and also not interfere and just see what happens uh and welcome back to mia ferreira you're gonna need to just get a little bit wide for this girl she looks like she might come close by someone asking if we've seen the torchwood mail so we saw him uh two days ago i think and the drought in the top corner of the reserve yeah the kruger park boundary so thanks just we will try and keep an eye on the signal obviously it's a bit tough as we are moving the chart might drop out for a second or two if that's the case we'll just try to get to the other side of the valley where the lions are going and wait for them to walk up towards it like i said on the way here more or less in the bottom of this valley there was a herd of zebra so a big crowd like this ideally wants to catch something big to feed this many lions and a zebra looking at a 200 250 kilogram animal so more than enough to feed all of them we'll give all of them a good feed mike just giving the line right away there walk through these thickets i can't actually see them but they would be pretty visible if they did sit up all right and again folks just to say we're gonna maybe struggle with the signal a little bit so just be a bit patient and i'm gonna try and stay on top of the hill and in the signal area as much as possible seems to be working for now looks like they found a spot to lie down there at least some of them here's something parlor's alarm calling yeah then paul is there so yeah the signal is good for now i don't know if any of you got audio of those impalas alarm calling in the distance they've obviously seen perhaps one of the lionesses near the front of this procession here yeah that is quite cool try and zoom in a bit and there that is that's good i'm actually good on your side as well there we have many lions they are going in we're going west right now which is not ideal for us let's see and for those of you that are on facebook and you hear us answering questions and we are answering the questions on the youtube channel and so if you're a little bit confused as to where or who is asking these questions and yeah and you want to ask a question maybe then maybe get onto later sightings youtube channel and that's where we will be answering these questions and responding to these questions so all right so the lines have gone into the bush a little bit and just see how far they are from the road if we can stay parallel to them um i'll keep that one up on the tree there oh wow that video on later sightings the other day but that was these same lions on a seesaw not all that far from here very similar scenario oh man let's see if someone else will take their turn playing king of the castle there we're all just climbing the tree for the sake of it now and so i almost don't know where to look we've got these cabs all messing around on the tree but it's so impressive watching the whole pride walking into the sun behind us see how the males are quite as good at timing it kicking myself for not having bought a proper camera with instead of just the sulfur so folks we haven't been able to follow the um the comments so much ds uh these lions have grown up with us around so you can see like we're standing here talking driving [Music] and they haven't even looked at us and obviously we don't go out of our way to do anything that would get their attention or irritate them in one way or the other but these lions you can see i can say they just don't care about us and also a lion is not something you want to take liberties with and provoke in the first place and so if we did do anything stupid the lions would institute corrective action pretty rapidly so uh but we obviously never wanted to get to that point you'll see we kind of keep us the same distance and you know just that consistent behavior they know what to expect from us and we in turn know what to expect from them but yeah none of us would be working here in the bush if we didn't like animals or have some sort of affinity for them so there's no you know we wouldn't want to do anything outrageous either so in mark's words we avoiding corrective act what corrective action oh man so i'm just gonna distract you from the lions for one minute if you look in this tree but look at the size of this snakeskin  you can only imagine the size of the snake that it came from okay there we go just hold on a second let's do this what do you say guys i'm still figuring out this gimbal but there you can see quite clearly what mike's talking about and this is in the tamborti tree and you want to explain what's going on here mark so no this snake is obviously not going to get out of the the car because the lions are just on the other side of it but this snakeskin it's quite a big snake so maybe even a mambo or worm slang perhaps one of our big tree snakes it's shaded skin so it's gone into the tree found a little thorn or twig got it in the corner of its mouth and actually crawled out of its own skin and so that whole skin peels off like you'd peel a sock off so that skin you're looking at is actually inside out uh it looks like it's been here for a while um but it's in two pieces now but that's that was a really big snake yeah so it's hard to obviously for you to see the scale but i want to say sort of five feet maybe even six at a stretch um but yeah i'm sure the snake is long gone you can see there's lots of pointy bits on this tree it's a young tomboti for it to hook its skin on there all right so the lines have wandered off while we're chatting i'm just gonna try and catch up with him so so there's i think there's one that's approaching campbell fabric campbell right now so you're asking what type of snake i'm really guessing mia but i think it was a uh either a worm slang or a black mamba just purely from the size of it we do get spitting cobras here but they don't get quite that big um and then there are a couple of the other grass snakes but they wouldn't really have been up in a tree so both of those snakes mike mentioned are quite venomous and the one is probably a little bit more dangerous than the other well it is a little bit more dangerous than the other the black mamba would be the one that's more dangerous than the brimstone that's like asking is it more dangerous to be hit by a truck or a bus yeah like both are not experiences you're gonna enjoy and the outcome is probably the same unfortunately where we are now is the boundary of malamala hopefully the lions don't cross it but if they do what we're going to do is then just drive back along the way we came and hopefully come across just gonna try to get quickly ahead of the lionesses you'll get some pretty spectacular shots it's and looks like it's working and giraffe girl yes we think they are going into london lazy into the sabbath sands uh muk i think the um switching over to mobile data now okay and superb ton track that's fully loaded um and the dove asking that the path and python we spotted recently shared in the end so nadav we went to go and have a look and farmed a big drag mark and a lot of honey badger tracks so we think the honey badger actually ate the python and dragged it back to his um well the tracks ended in a termite mound into a barrow but yeah we weren't going to go and poke around or poke our heads into that hole to see but yeah python came to a sticky end unfortunately i wish we had seen it and thanks for that ds okay you can see so sorry i forget someone asked the the lions are they still hunting so yes they've just moved a little bit now and where they are is on a little bit of a rise so they can see out across this whole valley um and they'll be looking for obviously any animals but say they saw um heard of zebra they might just watch it for a while see if there's a little cough or fall sorry in the herd or maybe one that's injured and limping or one that's perhaps just straight a little bit too far from the herd and so they'll be looking for sort of direct things like that as well as maybe listening out so if they heard a say an orphan wildebeer's calf bleating looking for its mom and that would also lead them to a meal or heard a leopard perhaps making a kill um so they do sit and just listen and that often for us if we don't know where any of the predators are we had a little bit of rain the other day so there's no tracks to follow or anything like that then it is often a good idea just to sit quietly listen for alarm calls and roaring and that sort of thing and find the lions and other predators like that so it is a very effective technique and for those of you that know mike would have noticed that he spoke about zebras first and that's because of all the kills how many kills do you think you've seen mark plenty yeah i might be pushing a hundred but as yet to see a zebra kill so it's obviously on his mind there are immortal animals how common is it for lions to wander off and get lust from the pride so it does happen and the lions are quite hard on one another actually if one does get separated for whatever reason it will roar and kind of be moving around looking for the rest of the pride and often they can hear it raw but they just don't respond and like it will be quite funny but the male lions were sleeping under a tree close to this pride when they all got up and now those males are not going to know where the lionesses are because they walked off down the road and then took a sort of hard lift so if the males they can't follow their scent to some extent but it does happen that the males sometimes lose the pride for days at a time and sometimes the cubs also get lost but fortunately these cubs they have all been lost a couple of times and have managed to to regroup uh brian as mike ever seen lions killer sable so i had that i haven't seen but that's a a pretty tough ask we do get sable here and i haven't seen these lions but the four ways pride i have seen eating sable and actually i watched one of these lionesses try and catch a sable at the bridge uh last year and she i don't know what she was thinking because it was bare open sand and the staple saw from like a hundred meters away but she still ran and went for it i got some of it on video [Music] but it was quite far off but you know that's able i think you might still be running nadav saying to ask about the lion zebra kill so i was actually with nadav in the sighting the other day if you go on to malama youtube channel and i'm sure nadev will share the link quickly and i was with him when we were filming or i filmed the two young male lions and a clan of hyena and it's quite impressive with these two young males actually managed to hold off a whole clan of hyena for two days but yeah it was quite nice to share that sighting with nadav also he had her you'll see his amazing spotlighting skills in that sighting that rock steady handsy and then the m this is the kambula pride that we're with so you can i think the whole pride is here now so it's well bar one of the lionesses so there's six lionesses and they're 14 cubs seven male 7 females and quite far behind maybe just shy of a mile now is the two gary males the fathers of all these cubs kind of hoping they'll come and join us but they don't seem to be in any hurry to wake up and sorry if i'm saying this wrong but mattiella it's a pleasure and i hope you and your sister are enjoying it or i know you are jonathan who would win female lion or fully grown male leopard uh i'm gonna go with a lioness um i don't know so a male leopard is about the same size as the youngster in the middle maybe i can ask gary to stick his finger in the camera there but this young male is probably about as big as the biggest leopard and then you can see the adult lioness next to him so there's a significant size difference [Music] and probably you know when we have seen these animals fighting uh the lionesses really lay into one another or into the leopards and that the leopards do normally survive and those fights are actually normally very quick things they get in handle each other and then let go before anyone is too seriously injured because a male leopard is an incredibly strong powerful animal so even though he might die he could so seriously injure that lioness she also doesn't survive in the long run i couldn't tell you the name of the video but i know on marla marley's youtube channel there's a video from years ago of uh male leopard i don't know what got into his head but he was trying to sneak a meal from us under the eye field prides and noses and those lionesses caught him and just malayed him but he did survive it in the end and but i couldn't tell you what the title of the video is to look it up and then mike says they malayed him he means that they took corrective action did he do it again uh mita asking are any of these lionesses pregnant and so me too none that are here but one of the lionesses the missing one uh is pregnant and we think she's for all we know she could be giving birth right now so when gareth and i saw yesterday um her teats were quite full um and she normally with the cats or a lot of animals they only give birth or sorry their milk only comes down when they just about to give birth a few days before so i've just seen one of the males in the back he just walked over and laid down but he's about 200 meters behind the pride and we won't be able to zoom in from here because you'll just see one darker pixel amongst the others but yeah hopefully they'll come over and join us in a minute um sorry mita so to get back to your question so she's just her teeth are quite full of milk she's not nursing yet and we saw her quite close to the river she had stolen an impala kill from some wild dogs and so we really hoping that we'll see some cubs soon normally when they have a den we don't go and view the cubs until they're sort of six weeks or so old and just to give them as much of a chance as possible we were quite fortunate with this pride the last time they had cubs that had them right in front of rattray's camp so you couldn't help but see the cabs that yeah we we didn't mow the lawn and that part of the camp for for a few weeks i can tell you that then uh paul um just welcome you're welcome it's good to have you guys all join us in this livestream viewing from canada uh carolina yeah i think i will when we get back to camp maybe well i'm going on leave so i'll hand it over to gareth but it might be a good idea to recycle some of our older footage that i don't think it's archived it's on youtube and if it's on the internet it's there forever so um we'll just try and find the the link perhaps um and just re-update it then mullerman asking with what the location is of the sighting we are currently on malamari game reserve which is next door to krieger national park how big is malamala so we 14 000 hectares i see pits just answered that one there ah pete do you work cathy [Laughter] hi pizzas are currently on leave but i see he's chiming in there thanks thirteen thousand hectares uh pete's also gotten to go and give birth he's just pregnant yeah he's he's denning but he's going to a top secret location uh and busy so we we really are in the process of setting up or trying to set up some sort of more permanent streaming and it's not easy uh obviously with the lockdown and that uh our whole uh world is collapsed so it's it's quite tough trying to get anything especially with a lot of the lockdown there's no international mailing so a lot of the electronic stuff and gear around it we we just can't really get access to at the moment then just uh sort of not top right corner altogether but if you see something moving where that cub is looking that's one of the guy emails that's headed our way i could just see he's moving there but not walking towards us i don't know if you'll come all the way here let's hope so yeah and you know obviously all of your comments and all of you joining us on these live streams and commenting on our youtube channel has helped us um in you know trying to make this a more permanent feature going forward so we really appreciate your support into focus now a bit better linda m how many males and female so there's seven male and seven female cubs and then six adult lionesses and then two males you can see the smell is just being a bit awkward and lying just out of sight really or decent site anyway um mr wilde sorry to answer your other question no we don't know about the doona pride it's not a pride that we're familiar with here um and the salalah lioness uh we saw her in her cub this morning and sort of i want to say three or four kilometers north of where we're sitting in the manuletti river so she's all fine at what age do females start having cabs jain noise so most animals don't go through menopause like humans do it's it's quite an unusual thing in fact and so they'll breed up until the day they die um if the opportunity is there and provided they sort of well fed enough and that to fall pregnant in the first place um it's a little bit complicated but the sort of body fat content and that actually needs to reach a certain threshold um and provided they can meet that then they'll still be able to breed um you know the lions have such a tough life anyway that it's really unusual that they get past 15 for the lionesses and though we did have one lioness here get to 19 years old but that was more the exception than anything but they'll also help to raise the cabs maybe not so much directly but they'll be participating in those hunts and that's just like any other lions in the pride so um you know they don't exactly share art equal portions that kills but they're making those kills in the first place and they've been a few questions today about the four ways pride we haven't seen them in a while now we just well we've seen tracks in that area which we suspect as them but um the kambula pride have been covering a lot of ground here in malawi lately and i don't know if they've just kind of been keeping them east so there was a question as well earlier about what these lines would do if they heard other lions roaring and these lions are actually particularly aggressive you know they got out of their way to chase the other lion prides out of the the area [Music] which sometimes can be a bit frustrating for us because we do have quite a number of lion prides around and then we also see some young lions that will come in that are dispersing from other areas but last week these lions came in they chased four dispersing lions from the camp plains prior to plains camp pride sorry and then chased them out then went over chased the four as pride out and then looped up to the north to chase the hummer pride back north and then came back to the center of malamala but all within 24 hours that turfed out a lot of other prides or groups of lions um but you can see with 20 of them even though a lot of our cubs there's just no way any sensible lion pride is going to try and face face off with them in mr wild uae 87 just talking about that video of the kampula lions killing the buffalo it was uh took them about four days to actually make that kill so we've started calling them the four days pride and but yeah eventually i think you know i'd sat to them for the two days just prior to the kill and nick had said to them for four days prior to the kill and i i've been sitting with him for the entire day that they decided to leave and literally half an hour after he left nick jumped to my vehicle and jeanette managed to wash that whole kill so good on him for staying but um yeah it did take them some time and goodbye kg glad you enjoyed it or hope you did uh meter asking what the situation with poachers during the lockdown and so fortunately it seems without any big international flights um a lot of the the rhino poaching seems to have slowed right down because you can't get your horn from here to asia so there's no market at the moment um and we are far enough into the rest of the parks that and reserves that meat poaching isn't a problem but i do believe uh meat poaching is a huge problem um in some areas particularly where they bat up against um sort of rural areas or you know where people are living in these rural areas and it is quite an important thing to understand is that the wildlife in south africa all over the world in fact is protected largely due to tourism so with no tourism there's no funding for any of the anti-poaching and protection of these areas whether it's wildlife or even just natural heritage sites so it's going to be really important to try support all of these things as much as possible in the future particularly once the travel restrictions on that are lifted um to to punt the south african game reserves a bit if you are going to be going on holiday and don't want to be in a crowd i'd suggest highly going to one of the private game reserves where you are going to be in a vehicle away from any big crowds and that is probably going to be the safest way to travel for quite some time and on top of that you get to spend your afternoons with lions and welcome back mrs lapwing lisa huffman do you feel like we're part of the pride and how do they acknowledge us so they don't acknowledge us at all but i also have a cat at home who also doesn't acknowledge me so you feel like part of the project so it's hard to tell um but yeah it is quite important to us that we don't feel like part of the pride because then you probably would become a bit uh maybe blase about them and that and it it really is incredible when we're sitting in the vehicles like this filming them chatting away here they they really don't mind us or care about us at all you can see they all fast asleep but if they were to catch us out on foot um you know particularly after dog very different different story and by giving them a pet name or something like that you also take away some of that wildness and that the same reason you know your nicknames are friends but not for your boss or you don't want him to hear you using a nickname uh chandra asking what happens when the last mail line and the pride dies do the adolescent males take over so no not re or no the males are normally actually replaced by incoming you male so in this pride in front of us there's seven young males seven brothers and and probably in the next year or so because they're all two years old now and a little bit more uh they'll be pushed out of the pride um sort of between two and three years old and and that'll be quite a strong coalition and though or the male lions move around in what we call coalitions and females move around in what we call prides so the coalitions will move around as a group and be nomadic and chased around by other males for some time and then eventually go and perhaps take over a territory from existing male lions and speak of the devil i can see the other males ambling over we'll see if he gets a bit closer and but yeah so then those males will go and take over the territory and prides that live in that territory from the existing males unfortunately they normally kill off all the previous males cubs to get the females ready to mate as soon as possible and then they'll try and stay and be dominant over that pride [Music] until they in turn are replaced if they're successful they can expect to be dominant over the territories or for sort of five or six years uh which is time enough to raise uh two perhaps three sets of cubs if they are lucky which is also why they kill the previous males cubs off because they don't want to waste their time raising someone else's cubs because it takes two to three years to raise their own cups and mr wildy asking next stream of run or wild dog so we're not going to do one on rano but with the wild dogs we did one a while back and they are amazing animals we actually started with the wild dogs one of the streams exactly where these lions were sleeping and then we did a second one where the dogs went running off and we really struggled to keep up with them but they're not something that lends itself to easy following i don't know if you were able to see that male lion just pass out and flop down there in the back dizzy 1369 saying the wild dog ride livestream was a wild ride yeah um beep on the track beeps beats uh what's a typical male lion lifestyle um so i want to say sort of 12 13 years sometimes i do get a bit older than that sadly the male lions do tend to die quite violent deaths so they they don't always get as old as the lionesses in the wild in zoos and that where these animals already looked after and there's vets and they're getting regular meals and not having to worry about outsiders then they can live to 20 25 is not that unusual but you know in the wild it is a very harsh environment so they don't live that long um and kimberly lopez asking did we see the mail so we saw them briefly but they're just lying in the grass now again and it's yeah they're not not wanting to be a movie star today mario gaming asking what lion is the best out of all of them definitely a hunting line yeah one that's awake and i don't know they come bulapride sometimes on my favorite lions and sometimes i could i don't know it can be very frustrating sometimes when they follow buffalos for four days and don't do anything um and then this you come and find them the next morning and they're all fat and happy and you know whatever happened was while you weren't there but my favorite pride i would say at the moment is the four ways pride even though we don't see them that often there really are proper wild lions that probably don't see people too much and but they're also kind of exclusively mala mala lions as well and you know so when we do see them we have no idea and it's just nice to know that there are still some truly wild places left on earth superbike saying the line that takes corrective action that would be your least favorite if you are being corrected um how long can a lion go without eating so the longest i've known some lions here was about two weeks between meals uh it was i feel pride and they actually even resorted to eating things like pangolins i saw them try with the porcupine at the time and so it can sometimes be well i'd say two weeks is probably about it but those lines were not in great shape um at the end of those two weeks um this product they always seem to have had something they they never really seem to be struggling for food so it's been a while since they've you know we had this huge drought here and they're just lots of weak prey animals so the lions have done incredibly well as you can see with this big pride so it's not something that we've been able to to measure fortunately in the last few years uh busani are all the females in the same pride related i think that's supposed to be in a meeting though huh um so the lionesses in the pride are always related females so they'll be sisters like these ones or mothers and adult daughters and aunts and nieces and so on they won't tolerate a foreign lioness joining the pride but then with the males normally the young males particularly if they're on their own when they do leave the pride or force out of the pride they might join up with other young males it's it's uncommon but it's not that unusual but certainly for these two resident adult males there's no way they would tolerate another male coming in and the other thing to bear in mind is those young males when they are chased out of the pride they are very young um and they're quite vulnerable if they are on their own in particular and on top of that they've grown up in these big very tight families so now to be out on their own is just scary and lonely so they just a little bit more predisposed to joining up with other young males when they're young but they wouldn't do it as an adult uh so mrs lapling asking about the the males yeah the b boys we call them the gary males but they're actually at the moment just to so if you can think of their territory sort of more centered on malamala to the north they've got the northern avoca males and to the south the southern of camales that are their sort of immediate neighbors and then the male lions the new male lions that have just taken over the four ways prior are to the east and the kruger and then i'm actually not sure too much on the west but then they've also got the young males from the torchwood pride the that's sort of three ish now and then there's two young males we're seeing in the south um the six inunkahuma males um and then there's the camp plains pride with two young males or dispersing youngsters anyway there and so there's quite a bit of pressure from these young male lions none of them are really big enough yet to be a serious danger to the to the youngsters but sorry to the gary males but i'll give them another year or so and it will be be quite an issue we waiting to see if there are any showdowns between these lions obviously from our point of view we wanting to to see that happen because we are trying to film and show a lot of the wildlife and the interactions that they do have sadly though that interaction will be quite a harsh one if they actually do come to blows so we'll just you know as much as you want to see it it might be quite hard to watch but yeah over the next year or so we're going to probably see more and more interaction between the the gary males and these new young males coming in most intelligent man do you get ticks walking in the savannah yes we get awful amount of ticks mrs lapwing asking has a sundowner situation in south africa been lifted yet so they did lift the alcohol ban for just more than a month i think and then they've reinstated it now but it was a pretty stark choice between either we can all have drinks on the weekend or keep those hospital beds open um so our government has this opted for the the right thing to do and keep the hospital beds open for those that need them not those that are accidentally there because they're drinking too much how long has the kruger national park been running for i want to say from 1898 yeah i think it it was officially uh 1926 but that doesn't became was it sabi game reserve then in 1926 yeah the sabi game reserve and the treaty yeah it had already been running for quite some time before that i think you alright i think it was maybe 98. the start to the creek national park was a bit um a bit stuttered with the wars that were going on here and politics at the time [Music] asking will the losers flee or be killed so normally they they run away uh if they can and it depends how that interaction took place and that but normally if they can see the big males coming they just get out of the way they really don't want to get into a fight if they can help it [Music] the i think nadav had a video on his channel or this channel sorry um just recently of some lions fighting um and you do actually see them come to blows there until a hippo comes and interrupts them james asking how often does a pride collapse um so it does happen from time to time obviously it's not a there's no way it's scheduled or anything but this pride in their own way have led to the collapse of one of our big prides the arfield pride that was dominant over malamala for decades they came in the they killed a lot of the lionesses um and pushed the ifield pride right down to the southern end of malamala so that part is more or less on the brink of collapse because it's one old lioness with that's raising one cup that's about a year old and then at the same time these lions also broke away from another bigger pride the mothly well they broke away from the breakaway marthny pride it's a it's quite a long story but one of the their relative prides if you will they've been attacking and killing and driving out so that pride is also down to one lioness and her daughter so it does happen the prides haven't quite collapsed yet but they are teetering on the edge and then the davos is put up that video of the lions uh having that fight mohawk asking have we seen the oldest cubs participating in the hands yet so yes they're actually quite involved all of them now one of our more recent videos um on malamar's youtube channel uh 22 lions attack buffalo that we put up a few days ago you'll see there we have um a video of the you'll actually see some of the cubs jumping onto this big buffalo bulls back so they they are starting to to participate a lot more and they still not particularly experienced but something like a buffalo with the males holding it still as well as a lionesses it's easier for the cubs to to get in there and and just learn how it's done and we also put another video on our channel the other day lion kills and you'll see there i filmed some younger cubs from the four-way sprite when they were learning how to hunt where they've pinned a big kudu bull down and one of the cubs gets kicked in the chest fortunately it's funny rather than horrendous it could have gone the other way though but i just need to learn which end of a kudu to approach from when it has been caught thanks so much for that dan rowley it's very much appreciated and they're dizzy saying it just came up in her recommended videos superbark saying the kuru took corrective action and then the davis just put that video up of these lines killing that buffalo um last week it's been a pretty spectacular week because we've seen them kill that buffalo and then in a couple of days we'll also be releasing another video with them and some buffalo and then just after that we have a second one i'm actually i was busy editing now before we came out to see these lines of these lines at another kill um so they've got some pretty dramatic videos coming up on our channel of these lions and their kills and you'll see sort of how involved or not involved the cubs are oh and then mohawk and barry just pointing out the yeah a lot of the prides are kind of battling and then we have prides like this that are are just being really successful some of it just comes down to pure luck um but yeah it's it's quite sad for us over time because we even though we are not part of the pride and we try to sort of stay detached in a way that we're not taking liberties with these animals and to give them the respect they deserve um but yeah it is tough to watch the sort of decline and fall of some of the prides thank you beep on the track beats much appreciates it yeah thanks very much for that and sorry that we can't say that tongue twister bp i'm not sure if it's beep on the tracks or bp on the track i said beats beep on the tracks beep upon the track beats i'm gonna agree with you but thank you very much for that and the dove that's crazy that waited for me to leave [Laughter] on the dive you'll just have to come back there right good job so pity these males are just not playing along and the lights not too great now but so i don't want to move around to there because they're still lying with flat in this long grass so it's just tough to see them and mr wild uae just letting the bird cool so a lot of the birds are pretty vocal now because they do get killed a lot in the evening so they just need to establish whose territory is where before it gets dark and then reestablish it first thing in the morning so they will be they need to be quite noisy good morning from the usa the lion's doing some yoga so it looks like they're all semi in the process of waking up i think what we'll do again like we did when they woke up the first time is to just wait and hopefully the males actually get up um and follow along and we'll get a closer look at them i'm a little bit hesitant to drive down the hill where they're going because then i think we are going to definitely lose signal so we'll stay with them and here we have signal for as long as we can john clark there are seven young male lions in this pride uh with luck they'll all be able to survive to a well sort of sub adulthood if you will and then leave the pride together as a really strong coalition of seven their fathers were actually part of a coalition of five their fathers was a coalition of five and and we're quite a powerful force when they took over this area they are just the two brothers left now um but yeah they're doing pretty well considering so yes just excuse us for a second while we put on our jackets you can see lots of yawning and stretching going on while they all wake up you can see adults kind of take the lead and then all these youngsters starting to to stretch and yawn presumably follow okay sorted thank you it's a pleasure jams oh it's also a lot easier for us when people do ask lots of questions because you know that interaction and engagement is is why we do these live safaris in the first place uh so cham asking if all seven male cubs form a coalition takeover territory well all of them mate or only the strongest um so it just depends on how much of a difference there is normally the brothers are actually very equal and it's hard to say who is dominant over who sometimes one might just be a little bit more dominant just a sort of stronger character but in general and they're all equal partners and when it comes to mating the male that realizes the females ready to mate first is the one that mates and but also without being too crude the mating is pretty exhausting for lions because it can take place over two or three days and on average every 20 minutes and particularly at night it can be sort of every seven to ten minutes so the males are so exhausted they actually often swap out and one of their brothers takes over so it is a it's sometimes shared quite equally and then other times the males are very aggressive defending the line estimating with um and barbara russell so i did answer it before but no we don't think the pride looks like they're going to split anytime soon and they have been pretty successful and they're still catching enough that it's not an issue that they there are so many of them and but we'll we'll see we would expect such a big pride to split at some point um and quite possibly when the lionesses all start to have their next sort of round of cubs um that would be the time we would think it's gonna happen so one of the lionesses has separated from the pride now presumably to go and give birth um so it might make sense for her to raise her cubs separately so the pride has all walked off and now the males at least are up and looking towards them we're just going to wait here and see if the males come towards us [Music] and hopefully you'll get a good view of them there's one male over there and then the other one's quite difficult to see so i'm just gonna try and move the vehicle a little bit so we can it looks like he's coming in perfect he has to go and stand behind the one bush um all right we'll just wait here i'm sure he'll come out in a second and john clark from scotland uh thanks very much for that that's big yawns yeah all right we're going to try and keep up with them uh but like i say we might lose signal here when they go down into this valley if the signal does cut out just give us a second i'll just start to the crest of the next hill where the front of the pride is still looking good you can see he's just busy scent marking as he goes here first prize in a perfect world is that he gives us a roar as well looks like the signal is still good for now all right so folks while we're moving it's quite difficult to drive and follow the comments [Music] that are just too so just to try to go through some of the questions quickly nora asking um when they're chasing all those other prides or any hurt not that we're aware of we didn't see the any fighting or didn't see it happen we just were trying to follow the lines tracks to figure out what they had done overnight and that covered a tremendous amount of ground and in the time they were chasing all these other lions around brenda palsa asking is that a growth on his left shoulder and i think it's just smelling something um i think it's just the blonde fur it's not really a growth until presumably one of the lionesses is urinated there that's what he was smelling and that's probably called a fleming grimace but basically he's exposing that urine to his pellet and smelling their if she's ready to mate or not and or how far away she is from being able to mate how healthy she is all that information he'll pick up there the camera can get if they it that hill against the skyline yeah let's see there's the rest of the pride up ahead there that's it's really starting to lose light air and so it's probably a bit better just to focus on this guy for now andre soros yes we are live just having a little break um and flash asking i wonder what would happen if someone dropped catnip there and it is an interesting question i don't know what would happen um i've actually never tried it but every now and then when we're following these lines they do find some thing that they just seems to drive them wild and they all go rolling around in it and love it and carry on very similar to when i've seen domestic cats rolling in catnip so maybe there is some sort of wild catnip equivalent out here but every time they've done that and i've tried to look for whatever little herb it was it's just been crushed into oblivion so you can't actually identify it you know especially when there's a big proud 20 like this all rolling around on one little bush here comes the second round so i'm just going to go back we'll see the second male is on his way too presumably wants to just catch up with his brother so we might see them greeting one another do you ever take rangers from other camps on draft yes we do so that they can see animals too and at the last the person i took on drive was actually in the dev uh it was a pleasure to take around and show all these animals too particularly pointing out where we've been doing all these live streams from over time one is impressive but when you see them standing side by side like that i guess it's twice as impressive so you see you gotta take your chances when you can so these lines have actually been doing us a huge favor by walking where they are it is right on our boundary but it's not often that you get to stick to the road and be able to follow the lines like this as we go luckily gareth has his new gimbal so that it's like shaking all over the place you don't get seasick while you're trying to watch it you can see this well it's just catching up now with the back end of the pride the rest of them are just cresting their resume so eve mccaffrey just asking how old they are so the two males one is born in december 2010 and the other one december 2011. according to our records so just over the crest of this hill there's a little water hole i suspect that's where the lions might be headed to we'll just see but what we might do is just try and loop around and wait for them to get to that water hole let's see one of the young males just sharpening his claws here goodbye to mia ferreira hope you enjoyed it in fact we are it's a time of night now where light is diminishing very quickly um so it won't be long before we say our goodbyes we will carry on following them for a while but uh when it gets to this time so nearly six o'clock and the sun is set over 20 minutes ago and yeah we're going to run out of life very soon now it seems like they are maybe skipping the waterfall mac yeah see they're actually walking down the road over there there's a nice sign uh those of you guys that have seen our wild dog video when you first caught a glimpse of that pack of the pups this is where we saw them until now that there's a little bit of a break in the traffic i'm just going to try and get onto this road i think the other male is still sleeping quite far behind us i'm just gonna skip the head we'll keep an eye behind us if he does decide to join i'm just gonna try and get to that water let's see if some of the others are maybe gonna go there but it looks like they might pass it's just one or two not the whole pride that on the background there you can see this large outcrop that's twice it's quite a nice picture for some of you there until they see in this almost dark condition is when the marabou stalks are at their most photogenic i don't see pizza baby hanging from there yeah i don't think you want this thing to bring your baby for the malavala rangers that are watching you'll actually recognize this particular marabou stalk it's the one with only one foot and you'll see if he lifts that leg up there you go it's the i don't know why it's not this particular bird we actually see in one of our very large ledwards on the other side of the river i don't know if you just move for a change of scenery or wow but it's kind of a similar shaped tree just much smaller all right let's see if we can get these lines at the waterhole and then i think we'll have to say goodbyes because it is getting quite dark now lying in the road in front of us there and it's the one here they are so it's obviously quite difficult to see them so nadav i think when you were here is when you were watching these lions at this very waterhole when they're all roaring and i was at the bottom of the hill with the wild dogs at their den you can see the reflections of these lions on the water easier than you can see the lions themselves at the moment until folks while you are watching the lions drinking i think gareth and i are going to say our goodbyes as well it's always a pleasure to have you with us on these safaris and on top of that you actually got to see lions moving about and active and that which makes a nice change because uh most of the live streams they're fast asleep and always spectacular to see yeah and always nice hearing from you so um yeah thank you for your support and please continue to support us and your comments always appreciate it on our youtube page and always look forward to these live streams with you and then um see if i can get it right this time that's not happening from mike and i oh there we go you gotta get up higher good evening quick change back there's a little battery all right back goodbye bye oh goodbye to robin sewell okay
