on to the question okay we going live the doves thank you Yeah right folks welcome to another live stream at Mala Mala and for those of you that were with us on Facebook this morning you would have seen a number of wild dogs which you can see center of screen they are quite camouflaged every now and then one just moves and that they were hunting this morning they managed to catch a dike here as well as a scrub here and they've been lying here all day and we've decided to follow up on this often follow up on them this afternoon and bring you the speed alive so welcome to Malta Malta Game Reserve and today we have yaku with us then we have mark Hickman handling all the comments in afternoon welcome and then myself Gareth right I'll be trying to hold the camera steady it's effects you can currently see two dogs that are in frame here there is a third that we cannot see lying about six or seven meters to their north and then there are a number of dogs behind us someone asking are we looking for the dogs we have found the dogs you can see you can see a canine quack holiday it's one of the defining features of this pack this is the alpha female center of frame Lawrence jr. if I remember correctly you're in the Kruger National Park opposite us such a quaniee so welcome back thank you for subscribing to our Mala Mala channel so fixed it's quite a warm day here it's there's a little bit of cloud cover you can see it's not too sunny right now but it is quite warm that's it's in the late 20s Celsius and see the one of the alpha females just live today there she looks quite a nollie with that k9 Shang she's actually pregnant you can see how the standard air Bailey is and welcome back around say oh I see dropped out for a second there yeah so welcome back to your head he loves wildlife Jay s Friday ham Hudson Jersey tears welcome back Dylan Morgan I'm sure seen before Russia is watching me that's comforting that suggests that one with the cane on sticking out she is we believe that alpha few or not we believe we confident is the alpha female of the pack it's hard to see from here but a belly is quite to standard because she is pregnant with these dogs it's only the alpha male and female that breed and all the rest support them hey Brad W and a hello from Brockton and welcome back to Stallings from Oklahoma and then say thank you to whoever mentioned about the chat Angela so I will try to just pay that in mind we can't quite see it on our screen that we filming on here but we will be aware of the way those chats are and thank you so much Jas and welcome to marco's from brazil giraffe girl welcome back and the hello MK from bradley comment of safari architects say MK is my cocoon he's busy reading the comments if you were wondering his one douglas FD i'm just going to point over to that side they have been doing this from time to time just getting up moving over lying down again until say there's a question a while back from Brian about seeing the pack on Jima so this well not just them and thank you so much Pam sorry folks I just lost my train of thought completely they this pack does get seen on Juma but I get seemed throughout the sabi sands they all not just them but all the dogs are very mobile animals so they have huge ranges the sophistic pack when they were studying them I believe it was 900 square kilometres was the size of the Ranger that they were using but yeah sorry just to go back a bit thank you so much to pam Hudson and then just a question on the video quality so folks if you could just bear in mind we filming on a cell phone and transmitting it to you live from Mala Mala Game Reserve near the Kruger National Park or next to the Kruger National Park Brendan Cole welcome and admire it may it sorry my Amira may it I'm hoping that got it right sorry my name is Hamza I should learn to read the question yeah how's that brendan call just a question on how long she's been pregnant for that's actually I'm not entirely sure my guess is she's maybe could possibly be two months pregnant so normally they give birth around late May June it's hard to to say I don't recall seeing this pack mating but yeah she's got a very fat belly so she's almost certainly getting closer to G than further welcome back miss sanam Andrus and then thank you so much to music man hello from Tanzania so what are those and also these are animals that ghandar a number of different names we often call them wild dogs another name is a painted wolf which is a really pretty name for them or a Cape hunting dog is sort of the more preferred term but you know we normally if we're just chatting about them refer to them as wild dogs so they definitely are not wild canines or wild pet dogs feral dogs the people commenting on the prayer quality just again we are filming off of the cell phone we weren't fortunate enough to go and buy a gear before lockdown so we just make him do what we have and it's getting us by for now so I just bear with us that you're off in the background there and thank you so much to Terri Golson and then God Vegeta the so that what happens if the wild dogs one pack meets another so normally the bigger pack obviously just wins and the smaller pack will ran away and sadly they will kill one another I have seen it myself once it was a pretty brutal sighting it wasn't something that I expected them to do so with the dogs are incredibly social loving animals like what happy-go-lucky animals if you will you know personality wise I don't come across as vicious killers at all but yeah when they did kill the member of another packet it was incredibly brutal to watch it's always sad with the Predators when they kill one another but with the dogs it was just seemed so out of character but yeah they do you kill one another sometimes but normally the pack steer clear from one another if they can hundred F the schools are opening in July hope that you are definitely studying hard in between as well as anyone else that's busy homeschooling at the moment glad you're enjoying our channel but don't forget to hit the books as well so just a question on what time it is here now it's just after 4 o'clock and then the question from Dillon Morgan how far we from the runway so where we saw that big pack the other day the pack of 17 and a straight line is maybe just more than 2 kilometres perhaps 3 at the outside I suppose depending which end of the runway you measuring but you are not particularly far away but we haven't seen that big pack for a while and then just the night from junk they lack the killing techniques like the big cat so that is true the cats tend to strangle their pet prey and throttle it so that animal it's a relatively bloodless death depending on what's being killed if it's certainly killed by lions or cheetah the Lions do sometimes is rip things apart but with the dogs they disembowel their prey like hyenas do so it is a lot more gory a lot flat yeah that it is also quicker so I'm pretty sure that dying is not pleasant however it happens but it's almost like you have the option slow strangulation or quick disembowelment sure they're the same just pet Shaffer they're saying thanks for the time the effort you're putting in this in to bring this T in durban Vil you welcome pet and it's our pleasure Robin Sewell welcome Robin lit I would play there guess who you are or where we are going but you have the inside track there so we'll see if any of the other engines can figure this one our tutorial puzzle and then real truth just saying the more carnivores and herbivores so that's unfortunately not that accurate we just show you the carnivores more frequently than we do the other animals on average it takes about 150 per animals to support one predator as a sort of a ballpark figure obviously depends on the species but yeah there's certainly a lot more prey than predators yeah Bruce missing charming Enya a large herd of Impala white cloth open area so piece creases the head Ranger and he's driving around doing head Ranger Rick and he's just alerting us to the fact that they are in parlors in the area wide open areas not far from here and but yeah it would still take them getting there to notice those in part is right now it doesn't look like they're going anyway and another big THANK YOU to Pam Hudson question on how fast they ran so they top speed I was once following them in the Land Rover who has a notoriously unreliable speedometer but it said it was sixty kilometres an hour and that was on a relatively straight road and there still were pulling away from me they're busy hunting a bush back at the time but that's as fast as I've seen them go and then note on solace thank you so much for that and there's a question on when will the Ranas get their turns if we had Ranas yeah we certainly wouldn't be putting them on TV and unfortunately there is still some Ron approaching happening or a lot of it we don't feature them at all or no one does for that matter no it's just helping us are they saying we near the Kruger Park we are sandwiched between the Kruger National Park and the sabi sands right next door to a learns is currently and thank you so much done luck giraffe go welcome back so a question from her did they catch anything earlier today all that gas to get that question because I'm quite jealous of him say giraffe kill we were following them hunting this morning we streamed it live on latest sightings Facebook channel we watched them running on numerous in parlors they missed then we caught up with them just after that court to scrub here and interestingly they all gave the bulk of the food to the pregnant alpha female which pits fan breakpoints art and and then later on they came into this very dense area where we are now and a hyena helped us regain visual of the pack we followed I in in it had obviously heard these the spec wall dogs make a kill and by the time we got here they were finishing off a darker now we're not sure if I Hina got the majority of the caucus and but they've been here ever since and thank you to holy cow that's a great pleasure doing the work that we do and all the Moser 21 we are definitely laugh it's not a video replay and yeah that's put three fingers in front of the thing for all the ones are 21 actually do it too and they know one there you go all the ones oh it's definitely live and yeah sorry it's just a question on where we are so we're on Mala Mala Game Reserve and we more or less on the center and the Western or left-hand side if you're looking at a map of Mala Mala and we sort of north of skukuza the capital if you will of the Kruger National Park and the the the airstrip Airport of that with 20 kilometers or from there 20 kilometers north when I seen a devastating in again as always and a tough thanks for your help and ways joining these chats and helping us out we appreciated the sir all the Monza and giraffe go where on earth are you that it's 3 a.m. in the morning terrible I'm the bad for solving wild dogs closer to lion or hyena I'd have to go with hyena sorry with lion hyenas have a tremendously powerful bite force I didn't even know what the bat force of the dogs are but it's probably no idea what a hyena can generate so Craig lever well can looks like you've been going to the gym Tingy Singh from Singapore welcome nice to have people from all over the globe just a curious curiosity this morning we had a lot of children online are there any children watching today sergej yes if you're looking at the Sand River before it goes into the Kruger National Park the length of a trans north-south for about 20 kilometers that is Mala Mala everything more less are the bank but the bulk of our property is on the eastern side so between the Sandra van and the Kruger National Park and Brook Stevenage how big as a pack I think they were a TIA this morning you know this pack is the investing breakaway pack one of the or the alpha female if she lifts her head you can see a1 Fang one can very clearly so it's easy to recognize her and the dove was indeed asleep this morning but it's a lot easier to do it in the evenings I'm a good morning from Alaska my ultimate bucket list place to go Clayton welcome to Eve McAfee from the UK John Locke create a story of a hyena biting through a cast-iron pot I've actually had quite a few stories along those lines I know about a cast-iron pot but I'm pretty sure any other pot they could could tangle with if you say Karsten as in a  pot yeah I've seen that happen before oh there you guys a gas has seen it with his own eyes so Brooke Stevenage yes I'm a child welcome Brooke me to Brooke and Lawrence jr. I'm a 13 and cushy agra if i pronounced that right i'm glad you could enjoy these an eighth-grader from India's ask me a bad smell from someone whose name I couldn't even pronounce if a trot let's try Mac well I gotta drop that - yeah COO apologies we definitely can't read what I'm gonna assume is Chinese or Japanese but yes they do you have a pretty bad smell not a bad smell I wanna say a distinctive smell and the often if we're driving along looking for these dogs we can smell wait I did cross the road but it is something you don't forget in a hurry and from our new UN school I just didn't know how old you a that yeah you definitely have a few more uhit's in school ahead of you enjoy them DJ vibes from Brooklyn also enjoying the wild dogs they are a treat and a good day from Australia you could tell us a little bit X into his character National African accent sod like Australia's everyone also the world Jay said alpha females cannot can be seen from the mean it is very prominent when she sits at this is a save it evolved on this one yes asking wall dogs mentally scavenged so I've actually written quite a few books that I do not scavenge and it was something that I'd accepted as gospel and then I've actually found them scavenging twice now once I watch him chase a lipid or fur Killman she just killed an Impala so it was a fairly fresh kill and then another time a large animal a judge and the wild dogs were feeding on that too so yes they will scavenge but I presume any for fresher meals how big the male dogs get so interestingly the dogs here probably average around thirty kilograms in East Africa there but latter maybe twenty to twenty five that in southern Africa the animals tend to get bigger for those of you that want to be scientific as a general guideline the further away an animal is from the equator the bigger it gets something known as Bergman's rule if I remember correctly which is why some of the animals on the Arctic and so on there got those huge Grizzlies they fear the south you get smaller bays in Africa as well the Lions get bigger the further away from the equator you are how big is the litter john locke's I think the record if remember our art was 22 dogs or 22 pups but that was born in Pretoria Zoo but yeah I've seen quite big packs of litters of puppies I wanna say perhaps 15 or so here and then we had one pack that actually had two different litters but the alpha female raised both so some of the litters of pups can be quite big but unfortunately not all of those litters will survive where the moon asking or out dogs the same family as dal in India so they are and they're both canines obviously but they that's the doll I've been my may be wrong I used to actually look after a whole pack of them and those are canines we you know true canines where these are like cohan so it's older family will do all this family of canids where the indian wild dogs are the whole dal are like the next run up on that branch on the evolutionary tree a bit of a lighter branch in these are the sound you're hearing in the background is a franklin it's not that dogs Clayton it's one of the smaller ground but it's kind of like a partridge or pheasant but the African version of it so I just going back so there's rapine do dogs and I you know sometimes really play with each other I actually have seen not with a big pack with a real small pack of three the dogs would almost trying to play with I ena but the I ena would have none of it but it's something up they are generally a playful social animal so big packs I've got others to play with these small packs where there's only two or three it's maybe just that they're lonely do they eat the prey love all the time so not ready all the time but they kill and start eating animals so quickly it's really hard to say define when it died as opposed to when I started eating John Locke enjoy Oh brah we shall be bright tomorrow the briars a barbecue for those of you that don't speak South African do you hyenas hunted dogs sir not really actively but i enas here certainly often follow the dogs around while they are hunting and they also follow often the leopards particularly male leopards hyenas trail along and as soon as the dogs have made a kill they'll run in and try to steal it you've seen a few times with the male leopards have run grabbed whatever they're about to kill and kind of pulled it up the nearest tree and finished killing it in the tree even to avoid the hyenas so I just want to make a special mention here to my nephew and my niece Ethan and Alex and and to there is the family they that are busy watching Ethan is watching religiously my sister says and it's nice to have you guys with us messing you all wishing you were here and then asking why they're so endangered it's a big pride of that has to do with them even though they are not domestic dogs or they're not feral dogs but they share a lot of the same diseases as domestic dogs to rabies and can understand how huge problems for wild dogs especially if they go off the reserves or port on areas where there are reserves so it's important that they get inoculated against these different diseases and that oh if ideally just avoid contact with domestic dogs completely and then also they need huge ranges so this pack part of the investigatory away from their basic pack their territory was in the region of 900 square kilometers so there's not many reserves that are that big that can sustain them so the Kruger Park is probably the biggest wild self-sustaining population certainly in South Africa there are populations and some of our other parks but they do have to keep an eye on things like in Reid that day and why they're so special well because they also Rey is why they are so special as what is their behavior they're the only animals that really truly look after one another a couple that are up and slowly mobile how they walk [Music] [Music] okay fxa yes I'm not sure a these dogs of God nah and I'm just trying to get some of these messages away from a screen so I can actually see what I'm filming yet and but these dogs if they get active now we may lose them it picture myself did struggle to keep up with them in this very thick bush this morning and we are gonna try and keep up with them if they get active like I said might take us some driving around to try and find in we certainly not gonna be able to move as fast as they can through this thick brush sorry folks we're trying to keep up with where the dogs are all moving to just missed out on some of the questions it you know try and circle back to them but dad it's pretty chaotic when they are getting ready to move and hopefully hunt thank you good for now hi Erica from Argentina it's nice to see all these new faces here as well so I just going back to the questions MC you shoot so they cannot make a wild dogs and domestic dogs are quite different species that's one of the reasons wild dog is not a really good name for them that's not accurate at all they're not wild domestic dogs are their own species kept hunting dog or painted wolf is more accurate and they do run and jump and that sort of thing but it's not a technique they use for hunting directly but I have seen them in long grass they do something called ballooning where they kind of bounce through the Glen grass so they can see where they're going it is as funny to watch as it sounds and Princess Jasmine so they dogs and wolves are actually more less the same species domestic dogs are descendants of wolves these painted wolves kept hunting dogs are a much older branch of that canine family tree Brenden call what is their position you tell us I'll give you a clue it's really hard to get care and it's like a thick jungle I'm gonna stand up and just actually I'm gonna stand up I'm just gonna put the camera up high just so you can get get an idea of maybe what their eyes it looks like which is really just the tops of the trees that we are in a thick block of land yeah how can you can you see them there you can see just so they are moving a little bit when they're do move from here we are going to try and keep up with them but for now they are in the immediate area so we're not going to go anywhere just yet today's just asking how far to the bush to be good so we go as far as the animals go really and as far as the vehicles are capable of taking us so yeah we actually a few hundred yards maybe 500 meters or more into the bush that it's an incredibly dense block of land so 500 meters doesn't sound that far until you're trying to drive through it if the dogs start moving like now they could quite possibly get going very soon then we really are gonna battle to keep up with them we'll do our best but it'll be a challenge for Yakub fortunately it's a very good driver [Music] great betcha battles between rival dogs Thanks common no not that common at all because there's so few dogs they're pretty diluted over a massive area every now and then we'll see some sort of interaction between packs but normally it just means a bigger pack chases a smaller pack off hello from Singapore that's at the very other end of the spectrum of developed to where we sitting out here on the bush it's just north of the drainage light and if you go onto our YouTube channel I've seen the Devas really posted a video there but you'll see a couple of other videos showing how close sometimes animals come to the vehicles they're not fazed by said all they're quite used to the vehicles around and provided we behave normally then they just kind of carry on with what they're doing I wonder if we must just stay here for now don't know what do you guys think what do you think happened you see it as good as it gets really and it's another one getting there Thanks we might have to leave seen just so we give ourselves enough time to try and loop her onto a road it looks like they're headed towards the road that we came in on at least for the fifth dog is going that right now I think we gonna take the chance and try and loop around and catch up to them again all right thanks but stay with us live yeah we you know be able to watch aku skills in action yeah likes and then just while we driving and now it's lovely to bring this transmission to you all at home and we understand that you are all under lockdown conditions there's a beautiful obey that's just playing off yeah yeah created kingfisher it just he every now and then beautiful and yeah so we are assigned lockdown conditions here at Mala Mala game reserve the whole country is and lockdown there are a number of ranges that have remained and there's a skeleton staff here that is taking care of the reserve and you just want to say thank you to all those nurses scientists and doctors that are working during this time trying to help those who have got the virus and helped to come up with new solutions to it I have a friend here in South Africa in Pretoria he works for the NiCd his name is Ahmed Shah that I doubt very much with he is watching this live because he's got quite an important job today in ICD is the National Institute for communicable diseases and he's a virologist and all those children out there there was a boy named modern a and his brother yebin who sent ahmed a a solution to the whole coronavirus debacle that we find ourselves in at the moment and their plan was to drop a soap bomb from a plane so that everybody can be washed all of the time but really took inspiration from this and has started a Facebook page called kids kick coronavirus so if you are there and you think you got a solution there are people that are listening and please go have a look at kids kick coronavirus page and have a look at and add your say you can add a little video and a picture and or just a solution to how you think this may be solved just know there are a lot of children cooped up inside and we are thinking about you and sure your parents are wishing that's they had many acres like we did so they could let you run wild like this pack of wild dogs you're following our but yeah if you do you think that you've got a good plan you go look at kids kicker in a Facebook page there are us on Twitter and Instagram I believe and yeah just our thanks to all of those that are on the coalface some of them putting their lives at risk thank you very much if there's an opportunity to bomb someone with Syfy I'd like to be very much involved in its in one hand given your plaid okay we just came to you back so you've just come back onto the road we explain all this opposite where the dogs were now and what we're hoping to see is them using the road to get a bot as opposed to running like crazy through the bush another indication might be we see a whole herd of Impala or one of the small antelope come running out is always a challenge trying to relocate these animals once they're on the move sorry flexo I'm just going through the questions again now I'll have the chance and so there was occasion the difference between the wild dogs and domestic dogs so there are very different species and a lot of that I think yeah right yeah well then yes yeah yeah coop talked about five meters wrong I'll train him up you get well then yeah sorry Emily to come back to a question I believe it's actually the foot structure that's one of the bigger differences well so if you look at this one now it's gonna zoom in a bit again just a little busy but you'll see those huge ears very distinctive for the dogs and then also the coat so each has got a very unique pattern cut that's how we can identify the individuals though with this pack the one with exposed cane on is very distinctive so it makes it quite easy for us [Applause] very good so for any of you that are watching and parents of children just a little disclaimer right here these dogs now that they're active looked like they're going to start hunting so this might turn into PG affair shortly and just to let you know it we there might be some sense to content if we're lucky enough but yeah get that one dogs climb the termite mound is using a bit of elevation to get a good look and see if there's any prey species in the area like we just mentioned it is very thick in here so he's using mr. Marty's advantage and saying see here it might be a she so this is where knowing the property well and becomes very handy and mike has been around Mala Mala for very long time so he knows these game trails and where we can drive and where we can't and some of the inaccessible areas and we're just gonna try and stick with these clay hunting dogs for not know so if like so if you do watch these dogs ed grass is getting a bit longer here but you might see them do this like almost like a rocking horse around where they kind of pop their heads up a little bit it's more less along the lines of that ballooning that I was talking about thanks and then I can say just apologies for not being able to get to everyone's questions right now we really do appreciate having the questions and being able to reply and just following the dogs and watching out for branches and holes is a challenge which is probably 90% of the reason you shouldn't text and drive oh this is this game this morning following the slope yeah almost at my crossroad is that any way to get okay so the foaming vehicle has come to help us out just it is you can see it is quite difficult to follow them they're just on the other side of this and completely front of me your food as it when there so so just a couple of missions about the these camp hunting dogs and their relation to domestic dogs and wolves so domestic dog and wolf more less the same thing I remember correctly while I'm bouncing through the bush domestic dog is Canis familiaris and the wolf is lupus I might be wrong there where these are like Coen pictus so if you're going back on that family tree this is the earliest branch so the dogs and the wolves get seperated there's a species much further back then say a domestic dog and the Fox or so these animals they are of all the types of care knobs are the most distantly related to wolves or domestic dogs certainly how many individuals in the pack I believe they are eight and a good morning from Texas Hardy [Music] that's another thing just to be aware of is we are going over a hill now a signal was good earlier but let's make it relatively quickly so if we do lose signal we just want to say thank you in advance for joining us today and we really enjoyed taking you all on drive with us and Jay is a remarkable coincidence actually happen to be watching the original Jurassic Park last night I'm gonna call being Sam Neill in this one Gareth you can be Jeff called a catenary they are it's I'm guessing that you're one say you're smarter than me but I'm cooler yeah good thanks very considerate of you so thanks it wolf you're correct is very good of these animals ever attacking someone in the wall the only record I've ever heard of them attacking someone happened in a zoo I think maybe Philadelphia and but that was three people being silly rather than the dogs and it just use the steam at Mon again to get a good view comparison size-wise for these two a domestic dog I would say like perhaps a skinnier Labrador or a Belgian Malinois for those of you that are maybe familiar with them very similar size tip but it's about a 50 kilogram animal they're not particularly big or powerful say like ie no that's a massively bull animal the dogs are built as marathon runners that's amazing stamina and it's how they Hans's bar wearing their prey out you can keep on this trajectory they're all going a little bit yeah ready you got me [Music] okay there in front of us hitting an executive same direction yeah okay back right back so just squeezing through the jungle okay yeah they were headed straight in this direction last time I saw they exactly taking photographs of me [Music] so this is the film crew that has been helping us arch and they are just pointing in the direction of the K panting dogs so as you can see it's very difficult to keep up with these animals so we have asked the racial strangers to help us our cheer today it's like they've got to share lying through their thank you and then I Xing s down there right that's why thanks Gary yeah they are jackaroo are you driving through the bush at a time thank you someone says my shoes and Bradley Thomas we can only hope that we do see a Bamba which is Ranger talk for seeing a kill but just to come back here it's what gas it earlier if I do hand you saw how hard it was to follow them just moving through the bush and everyone running but if they do hand will hopefully be able to catch up with them or maybe even see that if we are ridiculously lucky and but then just bear in mind that it is sometimes quite gruesome that we will deal with that when that happens and yes it is a lot of fun so effects I just want to go through some of the questions going back Kel's guarding lot so yes it's always possible to come across other animals and you know the Lions we actually have an idea where there are at the moment well the pride that lives in this area the cam boola pride and they was another pride we found for the South this morning and we're not but in this air the resident prod we haven't seen them today that well so this is an area of the lipid we know as the lookout female and she lives here with a cab so we could come across there more elephants or who knows what we kind of hoping we come across a tasty and healthy and fit antelope that haven't been practicing the Acharya are they going into and giraffe go we still waiting for you to get back to us on the way on earth you are that it's three o'clock in the morning she said in Michigan Michigan so much colder than here and I think it was an we are we they get hit it towards northern sac opinion eventually I think or act like so we are definitely going to try keep up with them you can see the bushes getting a lot pushy but also we are cresting the hill now so we might lose signal so just bear with us it might get a bit spotty at times [Music] and then giraffe go I actually haven't heard anything on the Boomer pride I assume they somewhere in the north of the Bobby Sands you're ranked and I hope I'm pronouncing that rent right yes they if they came across that lipid and a cab they probably wouldn't kill them but they would certainly just chase it almost let me just tree the lipids the covers about ten months old if I remember correctly and so more than capable of getting up one of these trees and away from the dogs but for them it would be more of a game to to chase the lipids and dizzy I'm hoping that everyone is learning but I'll also highly recommend just like anything on the internet corroborate what I'm saying good you get off the name Christine Chris cut welcome back [Music] all right flexor also in these types of thickets that we're going through unlikely to come across any Impala which is that name pray for these dogs we're more likely to find a small antelope called a duiker which is a relatively small creature or perhaps even a scrub here and just to further complicate Jackie's life we're going through an area where there's a whole lot of odd fog bearers which is like an African version of a an anteater so the vehicle might come to a very dramatic and sudden halt if we fall into one of those holes hole or a chair that Jackie's just quit start that's what you're trying to avoid and to Soweto asking harder they find their food so normally it's pretty much like this they ran through the bush and hope that they flash things aren't so sight is their main sense and then also these animals live here so bear in mind that they will be quite aware of the open areas and good areas to find Impala herds and so on and so they know know where to look [Music] good yeah [Music] so any other animals you can find out [Music] just what I feel like so we are just trying to find these animals again they've moved through some pretty dense Bush and if you think it looks wild on screen you should try being yes but just the Yak is doing a magnificent job of getting us we can still smell them I hid fiction with us yes soon side-effects off las 8 yeah we're just getting back to her I don't know if I get signaling I don't know if we are live again now that's like it matter reconnected did it yeah it's yes breaking the data says breaking facts so oxygen which is we're quite happy about I'm sure yeah ku is probably the happiest [Music] cool this is a nice place to be right now rocks maybe it's gonna go through just the other vehicle has them in the distance here but they're continuing south towards this drainage line we know we can't cross there very easily so we are going to loop around - oh right Yakub still navigating these mighty drains are far calls alright thanks thanks for sticking with us through that so what we're gonna try is the dogs have been taught by the filming team first this many we're gonna loop to the other bank of the valley and what we're hoping is that we'll also get a signal because we'll be on the fast load of this hill that's blocking us and it may drop out again but all right folks it looks like we back on again we just had to go through one of our bigger other systems or deeper river systems so you just [Music] I think we back now folks so sorry about that it's honestly one of the challenges of working out yet so I wish the animals would learn with the different areas with sulfur and signal [Music] [Music] today the Dove loud and clear it's he's even if they're just all on the road it goes around this don't get anywhere like so we that well dogs are currently with the second vehicle and they've lost them mucus is a plus Topsy's listening to the radio we are on the road we think they're headed towards so we're hoping that they pop out in front of us somewhere here so some nice scenery in the meantime can see is a big cumulonimbus cloud building me just while we're looking for that there's been a couple of questions about the Alliance so we saw one of the lip line prize this morning the Sand River Pratt down in the south of Mala Mala hopefully we'll put a little video of that on our youtube channel or Mala Mala youtube channel in the next couple of days the cam bullet pride the ones we are live streaming with the other day we're not entirely sure where they are and then the Inca Houma and Torchwood prides up in the north again we're not sure on their position but also we didn't look because we were with the other pride in the south and then these dogs in the morning so none really got the opportunity to look for the other prods but I think yeah coup you did here roaring up there Yahoo yes yeah you know there's some lines up in that northern part you're not sure here but there has been some roaring there my crotch yeah it's gonna say maybe just try to get on the bin and then we can look both ways this open here [Music] it's a signal surprisingly good day slowly recede or please just and there's a you know it's a hyena folks done it so let's use the hyena and see maybe if it follows or leads us to the dogs the tactic work this morning perhaps all work again it was all skill and yaku's party knew the hyenas gonna be here you're just stubborn they can paralyze wildlife this the I NFL's I'm leading us through the dogs maybe it will lead us to a leopard you never know it and yes of the JSI eNOS do you tend to move apart on their own they live in big clan so it's actually quite cool to have the two sort of opposite systems here so we've got the dogs which live in these big cooperative tax and they hunt together as a team with Irena they also live in big what we call clans and each member of the clan will forage separately so like this one will move off on its own and see what it can find if it finds a leopard with the kill particular young female or female leopard on her own like the lookout female then with the kill she'll die in avail to steal that kill on its own but if it was say a pride of lions we had needed four or five hyena to drive it off it would start whooping and calling and that and the track the rest of the members of its clan to come and hunt and maybe drive off that animal together that lion perhaps or if it came across a bull abyss with a broken leg or something again it would call the clan together to run that animal down they normally don't bother the healthy animals but hyenas are very very capable hunters it's pretty wild but when we had our big drought I actually saw hyenas even hunting Buffalo sadly they weren't successful while I was watching but I've got no doubt that they could do it if they wanted to welcome back to Stephanie yes and yes folks are hyenas do have a pretty bad reputation a lot of that is down to things like The Lion King and then also they tend to move around at night and they do eat dead things that Association isn't really that great but that said they're incredibly successful animals here we don't have the total comfort I ena but I'm can confidently tell you that they are far more hyena than any of the other predators and perhaps as many hi he knows all our lions and leopards together so we do see hyenas pretty regularly here and amazingly whenever there's a killed we just die eNOS pop out of the woodwork and they're they within seconds sometimes the question what animal is a most successful hunter so that is probably the wild dogs hyenas are probably honest well studied as wild dogs because we're the wild dogs Grandin huntin move in the daylight when I Hina's are hunting they're doing the same but in the dark so you saw what a challenge it was following the wild dogs in daylight through a thicket imagine trying to do that in the dark with hyenas moving at the same speed so the hyenas of not nearly as well studied and you don't see too many documentaries featuring hunting hyenas you tend to see them more when they're scavenging because that's when they're sitting still and then yeah just a comment on my you know walking on the road while we're driving in the bush yeah it's true but it's also a lot to do with respect for these animals he chose the road we'll let him have it and you can see the payoff is that he doesn't mind us at all moving around filming talking driving and animal knows that we're not gonna harm it to interfere with it in any way and Liang will say yes all of the world's carnivores are in danger and that's partly a space issue there's to sustain populations of carnivores you need a big population of prey animals and there's not many places that can sustain prey animals well big enough populations sadly as the world has become more and more developed we've run out of space for a lot of these animals to live in but that said the hyenas are very successful and they're able to live and a lot more urban areas perhaps and we would expect and like leopards they can live in these sort of urban environments I'd get us into something hit some yeah I think that I eanes may be on the right track to find us these dogs like so we did try and follow the hyena I say the dogs through this thicket that hyena is also running equally fast you're not gonna play that game you've watched that movie already sure maybe let's go back east where good signal anyway okay say can yeah we're deliberating on way to drive not I think the consensus is that we're going to go east where the signal is good and the dogs from Miami I think I need to be safe an effect in alone that's true they're also able to spread out and cover a lot more ground and find food by foraging separately and then hunting collectively and if you're going to mono Molly's YouTube channel there's a number of sightings there with hyenas working in a pack we put on one the other day pretty wild with the hyenas driving a young male lion or for fresh like you can check it out Joe flex and then again we're just looking for the Cape hunting dogs once more there was somewhere off to the left of the screen some big open ears that they couldn't use for Joey again we might drop out a signal we'll see how it goes you so J's strata he knows in South Africa no we get Brown hyena spotted hyena snapped I he met a smaller version and there any termites not really feeding on other animals yeah we unfortunately it's a signal thanks we get it of 17 there's a small pack of so you might be alive again the signal might get lost again unfortunately we haven't been able to relocate these animals so we are going to say goodbye to you all now just thank you very much - Mike who's been on the comments - yeah COO whose job are not in me today and then for myself Garrett it's been a real pleasure again having you join us on this game Drive yeah stay safe and thank you in the dev and to everybody that come into it please go and have a look at our YouTube channel it's Mala Mala game uses youtube channel to find more videos of animals that are out of sulfur and range thanks so much thanks hopefully we will be able to find some animals a little bit more sulfur and friendly area tomorrow ideally we can see you all at Ford you know happy birthday to my mama she's watching yeah happy birthday Denise
