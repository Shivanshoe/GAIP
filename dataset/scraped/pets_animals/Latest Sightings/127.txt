foreign you next so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] hello everybody let's just make sure everything we just yeah give us a couple minutes oh we're just gonna well not a couple we're just waiting this is awesome awesome awesome welcome guys welcome now if you don't know i'm brent and this is terry i can see myself in in all different places yeah i've got to get used to it in three different places i'm going to unmute you um there we go yes we can hear you welcome everyone this is very exciting the first ever live lecture yeah we've had it we've had it we've had a course but this is our first with so many people which is really exciting and the first live lecture with eco training painted dog tv and later starting so this is a first for all of us and we can see all your wonderful faces um which is really great um and yeah just to explain what's going to be going on um brent and i are going to be doing a sneak peek of the eco training online course so we're going to do a couple modules in proctor guiding mammals and animal behavior which then goes into a bit of tracking which is always fun we know that's nadev's favorite so we had to add that in there for him and we are going to yeah i'll show you what uh doing an eco training online course is all about and if you've got any questions or want to know more and we've got a whole bunch of people supporting us and putting links up for you to find out more so um yeah well quickly dizzy is wondering who are these people so busy basically if you decided to go on an eco training online course this you would be your class who would be sitting with you on zoom um and there'd be an eco training instructor and harry guiding you through the course so this is so you can interact with your other students and it's really really incredible and the people you can see on the screen um so all the other people that you can see around us they have tuned in via zoom and so that is who you are seeing and so if you've tuned in via zoom um you will be live with us on the lecture um but if you're watching on facebook or youtube you are also part of the lecture which is really really exciting we are watching for your comments on um have some bird signs here too um but yeah i just wanted to uh to just welcome everyone thank you thank everyone for joining i think we have quite a few hundred people watching us so i hope everyone's ready to learn um and i'll basically be relaying some of the questions from youtube and facebook and wherever they come in to to brent and taran uh for them to answer oh now i'm back to taran awesome oh your brother's watching oh my bro hi [Laughter] um so i think without further ado i'm going to share my screen so how this works and it's just basically a as we said an insight into our online course so it's exactly how it would be and i will be here to walk through the whole process with you and i'm gonna share my screen um and i'm gonna do that right now um so let me go ahead and do that um seconds and so you might have seen my dogs there might have seen my dogs there for a second but um if you do the online course you will definitely meet them they are lots of fun and um yeah i think shall we should we get going do you have anything else you want to say before we start um one i'm very excited as you said for the tracking uh it's my my favorite part of when i'm in the bush i always like looking for tracks so yeah i'm excited to learn a bit more about that and yeah just it's nice to see some of the regulars joining in especially on youtube and facebook um so yeah they they're gonna ask a lot of questions and uh yeah it's gonna be really fun and i'm here to learn just as much as as the next person so uh yeah no i mean i hear you're pretty sharp in the bush so yeah he spotted that those vapour tracks before anton and me the last time he was visiting yeah so thanks okay perfect are you saying so nadav's gonna have his answer with jackson yes i think so so i think let's begin with introduction to guiding so without um without this section and without this knowledge becoming a guide um is is really difficult um so having having this behind you understanding the ethics what a god is and to to be the best guide you can be is the best foot forward which obviously is great in doing this course so as a guide where do we fit in so on this amazing stage that we have brent where do we fit in well again this is i think this is one of the better questions and a lot of people who get into guiding oh i just want to be in the bush and i actually haven't quite thought about what it's actually like to be a guide to where do we fit in what is our role are we standing amongst the elephants or amongst the animals or are we at a distance or are we are we the show i believe we are in completely intricately involved with the ecosystem we are part of the ecosystem and as a guide it's our job to create love and share the information the knowledge but also just the experience and help bring people closer to nature 100 and to interpret what's going around you know what's going around like what's happening around us so you know these elephants are um kicking kicking roots out the ground and as a as a person who's ever been to the bush why are these elephants doing this so it's really important for us to be able to communicate what they can't speak you know they don't read books they don't know what's going on they can't have these conversations with us so to be able to sit as a as a knowledgeable informed person and speak to people about wildlife about elephants about animal behavior about all these different things and be able to communicate for the animals in a way that shows how passionate we are is a really important thing so i don't think we're standing on the stage and it's all about us we're not the big actor game ranger we are in the we are in the background explaining and going through this entire process with you know with these animals so we've all heard a game ranger we've all heard a nature guard or a safari guard they're very different so we can break that down a little bit for you so a nature guard as we said is the link yes the storyteller the storyteller the person and for all of you who don't know that is my husband down in the corner um it is it is a really imperative skill to have to be able to communicate with people and be that link with the animals and i think i mean my biggest attribute as a guide is empathy i would say being able to understand how people feel um how the animals feel as a god you are doing so many different things you're driving the vehicle you're managing the rifle you're managing guest executions you're managing the safety of the case you're managing the big vehicle you are trying to tell direction you're listening you're looking after things it is you should be having to study for 20 years to be a guard i would say but i mean you don't have to so that's lucky but it is a there is a a very integral part of becoming a guide so we don't need to read all this on the screen i mean you can all see that it's a link between nature culture and guests um and we are really lucky that we could take you on this amazing experience and it's actually a very funny story so when i was 17 years old i met brent in tanzania and he was this macho game ranger as we used to call them before before we knew what a safari guide was um he um i met him in the saloo in tanzania and he was um building camps out there and knew all about the bush and trekking and you know had the turn and would drink the beer and had the big raffle not at the same time and it was you know this amazing thing i had these wide eyes and i thought wow that's amazing like i want to do that one day um and you know all these years later we can actually sit and do this together which is absolutely absolutely amazing so in breaking this down then what is a game ranger so we can see here the term game ranger um we often refer to field guards as game rangers and and and you know this macho game ranger took me on on safari and i've got khaki fever we'll teach you all about khaki fever and at a game range is a person who is mainly concerned with conservation and you can see here the the main the maintaining of you know the security of the reserve the fences fences habitat management road management erosion yeah there's a whole list of different coaching but as a as a field guard you actually have to understand a bit of what they do as well because you do as a field guide go through this you do fire management you do habitat management you you do have to understand all these integral parts of this you know uh beautiful ecosystem we're in um and it's it's really wonderful that we can actually we're gonna show you a video here now where guards get and game or field guards and game ranges work together so before before i start do you anything you want to say no and i think just it's it's it's very important to know that one can't go without the other if there weren't those guys doing the hard work we wouldn't be able to take guests and people out to experience their amazing bushfires exactly um so yeah this is just it's a doctor pete rodgers is a vitia in hudsberg he's a wonderful man he works for or he has a practice here called pro vet and she looks after all of those looks after all of our dogs and as well we'll show we'll introduce brian's dog just now and i'm sure if you do if you do that gave me your first set of stitches yes my mother didn't trust the local doctor so she got vet to stitch me up if i i wouldn't if i was having to take if i was your mum i mean if i was the doctor and your mom had to come to me i would be so scared no no your mother your mother scares me it doesn't matter just do the switches um so yeah pete rogers is an amazing bet yeah and um he does a lot of this for us and this is a whole different conversation that maybe we should have a lecture just about this conservation based side of things but let's have a look let's have a look at this and in the past time just like this this was as an example there was a lot of rhino poaching so what we did was we did a system of ear notching and microchipping that didn't stop the animal from being killed the only really proactive thing to do at this stage and since we've started doing that program the poaching is zero zero zero nothing rhino horn is is it's like plastic it's got the the texture of perspex it's hard hard hard but people say you know that that rhino horn is the same as fingernails it's not the rhino one is it's got a cellular structure it's like tubules tightly compacted tubules and these tubules have a cellular structure made out of individual cells whereas in keratin and horn up like cowhord or nails you don't have that you're able to isolate dna part of the rhino contrary to any other [Music] species wow [Music] okay once the animal goes down um i actually take the time from when it goes down because they if you look at the way they lie they lie on their chest but with the one leg the back leg under the other one and the other one out and then they keep on in the wild in nature they keep on you know shifting from side to side in other words they're just maintaining that circulation in the hind legs so we've got like a rule of thumb we don't want them lying flat like lying you know on their chest on that one leg for more than about 20 minutes if it's still working on an animal at that time then we actually roll it over like it was underneath we take out and vice versa also when we get to the animal straight away we put a catheter into the ear um and then we'll partially wake it up with a butofanol and then we cover the eyes treat the eyes with the eye ointment because the eyes are open during anesthesia we don't want them to dry out insert the oxygen tube treat the dart wound take the diet out inject the antibiotics that's tightest ointment and then we from there we go once the animal is stabilized and then we can start working then we start doing the dehorning you want to get as much off as you can during that time we've got somebody shouting out the breathing rate [Music] all the time it's so important they were counting their breathing and shouting it out to dr carrie every minute or so because that's important if it goes down to less than about six or so then i want to give some more beethoven the breathing rate and then lying on that back leg for too long are the two main things and at the end of the procedure we just wake them up through the catheter without that intravenous naltrexone and then up [Music] so [Music] [Music] i say [Music] wow okay that's pretty amazing so as we said i mean we've got a couple questions coming through here about you know asking about um rhino d horning and why it happens and what the the reason behind it is again we could have an entire different conversation about this this specific thing i was going to take one the one question from post-reaching here quickly can you talk a bit about the efficiency of the horning i thought a lot of studies showed it's not as people who live and work daily in these areas it is by far the best deterrent and there have been almost zero incidences of the horned rhinos being approached within the apnr on the greater kruger so us on the ground will say it works and it worked well i agree and so with that obviously arana is a mammal yeah so now it's time to learn some stuff guys now it's time to learn some things so uh maybe we can have on on the chat if anyone wants to pop a comment here do you know where the word mammal comes from why are mammals called mammals and of course we have some implants or impala down there which are called which are quite an interesting mammal and have been in the exact same shape for 1.6 million years they are one of the oldest unchanged mammal species around so there are fossil records of impala exactly the same as they are now dating back 1.7 million years old yeah they're older than us they're older than elephants they're older than rhinos they're older than lions they're older than leopards and it's because they're such a successful species there we go sam i'm so proud of you so sam has commented because they have mammary glands and sam you better get that right because you are on our current course and if you didn't if you didn't get it right i would have been very upset so the name mammal comes from the term mammary gland so it is um it is obviously due to the mammary gland um so mammals can be classified and we only as we said this is a little sneak peek into the course so we're not going to go through delving into i mean this lecture is size of this actual lecture so i mean we could go really really deep into it but generally mammals are broken down um due to their foot structure which we will get into a little bit and that's where tracking the dove's favorite will come in um and mammals can then be divided into three major groups so we can have a look at it like this we've got plantar grade which is obviously where we fall under because you know we can we've also got the most primitive foot structure we do and humans apes monkeys bears and sexuals will fall under alpha structure we've then got digital grade which cats dogs monkeys and we have angular grade angular i never i can never say these things correctly um so those can then be further broken down into the three different um foot structures which will go into the angular so odd code even toad and mia angular which is um also super interesting to chat about so we can look at the plantar grade as we said the most primitive food structures and this would describe animals that stand and walk with the whole length and therefore so just if you all we're all humans we can all look at our hands and our feet and we can see that the entire structure goes flat um and just like monkeys baboons humans and porcupines and bears and bears yeah i always find it fascinating to bears a part of that it's completely from the time but porcupines are rodents the largest rodent in the world no no no in africa happy bar is the largest thing yes happy borah it sounds like a drink yes especially during prohibition in in south africa happy brother anything sounds like a drink um okay then we found it integrated that's all different topic um this is obviously more advanced foot structure and the heel and instep of the foot is raised so only the digits touch the ground so i'm sure all of you and the dev over here can then say how how in interesting a foot structure of a of a of a line and a leopard and when i was going to test myself okay what do you oh he's say oh he's muted okay but we have a question actually we were just on front grade so joshua lewis thank you for your question you are asking um why is plantar grade considered the most primitive food structure unless you answer that one i would actually have to go hit the books be honest um and that's a wonderful thing about doing these type of courses and stuff you learn something new every day um probably i'm trying to think now of a logical guess um but busking is not my fault and there you go terry's getting the books that's so funny so i always tell them to always tell the students on our um on our current course you know we have topics that we really like like as a guide so you always have you'll always have the topics that you really enjoy and then you're going to know those i wasn't even joking when i said that harry made me go do some homework i haven't thought about foot structure before i mean i've been guiding for 16 17 years yeah and i haven't thought about foot structure since the early 2000s i don't even know what i'm looking at yeah so the rate the reason why so if you think about it and you can and you can um put it in this way so if you look at it lions and hyena and um leopard they their foot structure is very intrical so they they are able to go so they're able to have um retractable claws and they're able to climb in certain ways it's very quiet you know so when we walk think about when we walk on a bunch of leaves it makes a lot of noise and we are very you know we are not able to be silent when walking in the bush so a leopard and a lion oh sorry so a leopard and a lion walking through the bush they are going on the element of surprise so they need to change quiet they need to have a type of foot structure that allows them for that element of surprise so when we say yeah disturb his weight evenly as quiet as silent as soft on the ground so when we say primitive it's it's the fact that we are the least it's the least advanced type of um foot structure so if we go into the evolution of why we have a least advanced foot structure it's probably good to do because in our evolution we put far more um into the development of our brain yeah and being bipedal yeah so it makes more sense we focused on on the brain and the bipedal elements and our ability of logical thought and our cerebellum and you know we if we if we did not as humans have the ability of logical thought we would not exist yes because we are able to exactly 100 percent if we just get eaten we have got the nails we've got thin skin our teeth are useless we are not fast so no um so i hope that answers your your question joshua um and then going into the the the digital grade so that's obviously as we speaking oh there we go allows silent movement between stalking so yes and then as we go on to the angular grade angular grade um you you've always noticed if you ungrade if you see a bushback or a walking their walk on they're like ballerinas they walk back to breakfast exactly and as it says they're the most advanced type of food structure and this is for fast running getting away uh you know walking up cliffs i mean if you look at the clip springer i mean it's absolutely amazing um and the ability to stand right up on their tippy toes um which is which is amazing and the tips of the elegant elongated limbs are equipped with enlarged nails or hooves and which obviously enables enables this point um okay we've got some questions where could i read more about empire fossil records um that's what you were chatting about yes um so smithers is a good one i don't know if people have smithers it's a massive i call it the mammal bible yeah it's so beautiful the mammal bible it's a massive book put up but he has got an e-book i think it's e-book but smithers is a good one other than that um you can find some stuff online not wikipedia no wikipedia so i've got a friend of mine strangely talking about wikipedia who um is the leading expert on west african crocodiles he has written all the scientific papers so he went and changed something on wikipedia that someone had put up of a paper he had written and at wikipedia they got back and said who are you to be changing i was like i'm the guy that quotes it they are wrong you see yeah so yeah there's obviously loads on um shaping kruber oh thanks david huffman well done dave hi dave dave is actually our head instructor for eco training so thanks dave you should probably be uh tuning in here when i make a mistake please um so let's move on so we've obviously spoken about the the different infrastructures and our angular super interesting so we could we could go a little bit deep into this so how crazy is this we've got a well in in south africa we call it a dussy but hyrax and we obviously have loads of different hierarchies i'm sure we knew in east africa the tree the three evil ones and it sounds like someone is being murdered i mean the first time i heard it in camp i ran down thinking one of the staff were being murdered i mean it's a crazy sound i'm not gonna make it now um and yes and in an elephant so how amazing is that animals who walk on their whole foot um and they have toenails so like our nails in a way um instead of instead of hooves so what a thought and elephants are absolutely amazing that foot structure so if you actually have to take a cut through an elephant's foot there's it that you can actually see they do have pose and stuff but they're completely encased in the skin and they've got this big almost like shock absorber of um cartilage that it enables them to take that massive massive weight incredible but i mean such a small animal and such a large animal neither i mean that's the closest relative to an elephant it is and also one of the only other animals well there's a few but also have their testes on the inside yes and also their teeth that's also one of the reasons that they are they are related in that way which is really interesting um another good book indeed sam is game ranger in the background which is awesome and then sam's also said um the odd to zebra a to z my mom actually got that for dave for his one birthday and it is a brilliant book i don't think they make it anymore i've never seen it so it i think it's been discontinued it's a fantastic book and i do it's a little a little bible for me but i think the discontinued which is quite sad yeah um and then so we've obviously classified their foot structure mammals so they're also classified by where they eat because obviously lions and zebra do not eat the same thing although i have been asked that well i mean you say wart dogs and lions don't eat the same thing but have you seen have you seen warchags eat meat exactly uh or or if that buffalo is going to hunt that bird while it's drinking water that happens it happens so we can further we can further break it down into what they eat so obviously grass we've got grazers and um you know as in the herbivores vegetation so we've got browsers like black rhino um we've got meat eaters the carnivores and we've got a mixture of omnivores so like a baboon for example um but obviously where do zebra fall under you can get this one yes they are they're indeed herbivores we've been reading your books well done well done um and from there we can obviously further break it down into different types of eating so this is a super interesting one yes a picture by madame mccurdy yes taylor as we all know it's a very good friend of both mine and friends and she's wonderful and she's taken this incredible picture in the massamara so can anyone tell us either what is going on here that's the first question the second question is what is it that the zebra i mean the zebra i'll tell you another story i'll tell you another story about that but anyway what the giraffe is actually have what it has in its mouth can anyone um let's have a look we'll give you a few times yeah we'll give you something and then while you're having that now going back to what all the animals eat and one of the reasons in parliament have come up a few times um is so successful and has been the same for so long is that they are at a herbivore but they're a generalist they are able to they graze as well as browse depending on what food source is most available that's another reason why they are so successful they're also the most numerous antelope south sahara but you know what makes me really sad i love them when people drive and they're like they are amazing and so beautiful baby that would be too soon i know i'm i don't know i'm gonna have to wait i hope not here we go wesley lots of people you're on the right track uh maricha there we go ostafeja on the right track but what is it sam you're not allowed to answer you've already seen this but it is quite quite fascinating now normally when you yeah you said baby giraffe no and it's not a baby don't worry don't worry however they probably would yeah if it was just it was just a baby giraffe um now normally when you see them feeding on bones it is normally much older burns and that that's what makes this picture by taylor so quite spectacular so that is actually a wildebeest yes and she's i don't know if you were there were you there i think i was sending myself on the beaches of kenya while taylor was working yeah yeah so and that they'd seen lions kill the day before and the next morning she'd come on game drive and then this giraffe had gone on this fresh bulldozer which is very unusual because as you can see in the picture on the right that's a really old bone and that giraffe has in its mouth so we can as we can say osteophysia we can break this down so feeding on bones and this is obtaining those nutrients calcium zinc as well that that's um that that bone would then give that animal you see it with a lot i mean i've seen it giraffe they've got porcupine there's loads loads of different animals that are good and and these feeding behaviors can be broken down even further so we have pop aphasia which sounds horrific and i think the students and i spoke about this for maybe half an hour um feeding on feces yes my dogs do it with zebra poo mine mine mine does as well and one of the interesting things is so that the one that i only learned about actually quite recently and that was from probably in the last couple years from watching it um was a leopard eating buffalo oh that's interesting because there's so much nutrients in buffalo i mean no it's it's it's really interesting so when we we started doing some research into it so lipids in particular quite often will feed and lick buffalo young like that flora they've got outside stomachs so if they've exactly tablets and things with all that type of nutrients in it anyway yeah so it's amazing so there's a a form of copper phage that is not quite common and not i mean you can see we haven't written that down here at all yeah yeah so there's a lot of interesting stuff and the hooded vultures ah they just yeah following around the wild dogs eating the poo so there's obviously different reasons different animals do it and different ways so i mean obviously some some animals eat other animals feces some animals eat their own species like maths and rats tears and rabbits eat their own feces and that's quite an interesting one the the my strats and hairs so if you think about impala or giraffe or any of the ruminants they get the most nutrients possible out of what their feet and so when they defecate it's done they don't need to eat it yeah so they're mice hairs and rabbits um and also they are at the bottom of the food chain so they would risk from all the predators therefore they have developed carbohydrates to try to get as much nutrients as possible moving around the ground exactly shame and then we've got geophasia which is um obviously feeding on soil which you see quite a lot quite regularly and and certain areas will have higher higher indications of geophagia than the higher soil the the higher nutrients in the soil as well and what types and also yeah so also it's all very dependent and one of the amazing things is that animal behavior like this can be very area specific rather than species specific so because elephants do it yeah doesn't mean that they'll do it somewhere else exactly exactly and then um again going back to bed about the bush on page 27 and 28 great information there if you haven't got the book go have a look um so what we're going to do now is just break down a few of the mammals um break them down a little bit further not all of them it's just a little sneak peek so the reason i've got this one up here is it's super interesting so you'll see um let me get my little highlighter out here i think i'm very fancy with my highlighter oh you are so you'll see here that i've popped in here that we've got oh no sorry it's really difficult with mouse so you'll see here that i've popped here three families so up until recently insectivores well now the order i can't even say that word if anyone can say it out loud let me know but i cannot charge photos yeah and so this was obviously the original i mean we'll as you as you learn more about this things are changing constantly not only their common names their latin names as well and their families and their orders and so forth and so on so what i thought was really interesting and why i've published in this lecture today is there were three families in this order they are now full which is super amazing so this family here scorcier day scores has now been broken down further into macro scalidi wow used to be part of the shu family yes and now it's part of its own family and you can see very clearly from those pictures that the true and the elephant true or now called the sengi look very different they're not the same so here's just to break it down a bit further that it's obviously four families now which is really really interesting and i've got the cutest video in the world coming up the taylor took so before i move on to that we've got any questions yes any questions anyone before we show you a very cute video obviously do you know anything about the new book book yes so alex vanderhoever is actually one of the directors of eco training i think there's a link to the book coming up it might be i think i think we're just shot for charles um and it is called uh changing in leopard spots and it's an amazing book and no it's not available online overseas here if it isn't south africa he is in the process of getting it overseas so that'll be great um and and folk warlock i don't know what that means maybe i'm not too sure um i get anything from your side no we're all good okay cool we have one here stephen dally is asking do each family eat different insects that's a very interesting question yes dude mostly just because of where they live like moles obviously um underground they eat quite a lot of insects and also um earthworms and things like that and they forage in different areas now hedgehogs are one of my favorite creatures in the whole world i have not seen an album oh my gosh oh they're so cute um the first uh that's the first place i saw a lot of their jokes was actually dario salam yeah in our workshop there we used to have them running around quite a bit um and also while we're in the mario during the migration the wildebeest used to unfortunately found a few that got sampled during the migration obviously the huge amount of insect to life around the migration and the hedgehogs were actually foraging around the edge of the migration um did you have in the garden head jogs just the tortoises we'll get on to tortoises so my mom's sitting in front of us so so she lived in darussalam that's obviously when i make brains so and then sengi's obviously shingles and shoes i would say it's similar similar stuff yeah and quite it's quite and a lot of the shoes are quite close to aquatic habitats and things like that yeah yeah but guys i mean i have to prepare you for this because it's just the cutest thing in the world and just everybody okay there's some obviously there's some information here sorry i've got i've got delayed there but um oh no i got ahead of myself not way late but we can just see here that obviously i'm very very fancy with my highlight so we've got small brain they're smaller animals narrow snouts so we can all see here they've all got little snouts obviously not this specifically this is a golden mole and he's you can't see him there with his little snout primitive teeth uh plantar grade foot structure so again plantar grade very primitive very primitive structure um and yeah so i just want to get my highlight off here i think that works yeah okay guys i mean is this not the cutest thing you've ever seen and we are going to play this little guy here just watch out for its tongue oh is it playing oh sorry i'm getting a little ball here it's thinking my computer's thinking oh did you okay no just crash i think it just crashed sorry guys now you go back to the dogs sorry um let's close that sorry about that we just bear with us we are in the middle of the bush a whole load of elephants behind us so these things these things do happen so please bear with us uh are we sitting in the greater kruger national park which is where we have one of our camps which is very cool so yeah let's watch the sengi off that noise every taylor took the video i think it was in zambia oh look at it okay so this is the closest she ever got to one i tried to draw i mean it's that's pretty good that is very good well these are all my drawings now so bear with me if it doesn't look like the actual animal sometimes hitchhikes have teeth they have yeah for me but but very very primitive to you yeah okay what just tell what to tell tail i mean his tongue i think i missed it sorry about the teeth but yeah that is um definitely the cutest thing ever um and then i've got another question coming up here guys so i want to see fastest the fastest on the on the top machine under what's on the keyboard type machine on the keyboard i'm very primitive as well clearly um so we've got a call coming up so nadav is not allowed to answer because he'll just get it right well i think so i think there's a lot of people i recognize here okay if you know the answer give people who don't know the answer a chance oh my brother's actually got a very interesting question how do bats and dolphins fall into the category of mammals mammary glands mammary glands but also one of the other there's actually a question that gets asked a lot like how do dolphins and whales how are they part of mammals obviously they are very different to land mammals but throughout some part of their life also mammals always have a small amount of hair on them yes yeah and obviously memory language which is very obvious but good question the whales and dolphins would have gone to earth and then back into that and re-evolved and i've got um that's flying above us now so i've got yeah how would you say that yep yeah do you want to you want to pop your question down in the chat box and then we can answer it for you but okay quickly we're going to go ahead here with the call so can you tell us what animals call it [Music] yes [Music] how fast is an elephant shoe they're pretty quick they're pretty quick yeah they're very very pretty quick probably not going to max out probably around they can probably have a high speed about 15 20 kilometers an hour but with able to make very sharp and quick turns yeah they are very very small they're very quick um so yes that was the lion so well done everyone who said lion um and very very interesting as we spoke about the insectivores we've obviously got different teeth structures here so um i'll go back to my highlighter here um all um carnivores have unnatural teeth so we can see how how would you say they're connected yeah and we can see here this is just a this is just a little drawing i did of the lower jaw obviously there's there's obviously an upper jaw as well that is mimics the lower time i ran out of time you know um so that just shows the con carnassial teeth over there um these teeth all fit together um and they provide that shearing surface so you can see when um you've i mean we've all been lucky well some of us are lucky to see that um you know lions killing something and actually sitting there and tearing and that's also gives us the ability as well like when you're eating like a really like i'll say in south african lack of chop on the bra um you know you need those teeth to pull that meat and they um they're able to cut through that skin and flesh which helps them helps them a lot so those um concealed teeth on the upper molar and the first lower molar so we can see there in the lower molar and um so this this is very broad so as as going for glass level one again guys this is very this is just the the tip of the iceberg i mean we could go so deep down and go and learn so much more but this is just i'm sure i see and nadav's been popping the link up there how you do it charles is going to start popping the link i hope he has me this time um so if you want to learn more in depth i mean how many of these modules without just taking like one or two tiny and we're taking one or two signing segments out of different modules yeah well not each of them three of them from three of them so if you do want to learn more and this is a great way to get real in-depth knowledge about what's exactly yeah happening out in the bush and how to you know next time you go to the kruger you can just show off at those items and say yeah that's pop the link up there okay we've got a few folks asking about um tracking are we going to do tracking yes we've got um which will be really cool and um yeah the king of the jungle so this can be broken down we've got into sub-orders so we've got dogs and cats basically so we could go in the actual mammals like that we go deeper into that which is really interesting um and then i have to just put the pangolin up here because they're just so beautiful and um it's really beautiful to to see them and the reason i put this up is we were very very lucky we've got a this is our one camp in the kruger we've actually got two camps in the grace of kruger national park the other one is up in makoleki which is in the northern kruger national park in the pefuri region in the makaleki concession on the limpopo which is beautiful beautiful and we saw our first pangolin there which is really cool so before we go into the video we can obviously see all of these incredible scales um and that is what covers the entire animal i mean and you've seen i'm sure you've seen lions rolling them around and that is so strong and so it's it's a suit of armor do you think the impenetrable suits i mean they the biggest streets in the bush is not lions and leopards and you know they biggest threat is us unfortunately and there's a massive there's a massive um illegal trade for these incredible creatures so it is definitely something to share i'm always making charles do double duty um so have you ever seen a pangolin well here we go guys if you haven't we're going to show you it's happened like we're gonna we're gonna have to go tracking to get a penguin on pridelands now i've never seen a penguin guys really i've searched no harry's mom is laughing at us i'm not sure we must look quite silly then but not as silly as a pangolin sneaky of course not just and look at how interesting oh he got nervous there they're quite often work walk on their back feet he's front feet the ground nails can you see that again so specially adapted for digging incredibly long sticky cut and a very interesting fact about tangling people don't know is that depending on their area 98 percent of pangolins diet is made up of one family of ants it's the pugnacious ants and and they're very very particular about which particulates you can't just take so let's say a pangolin is rescued and needs to be rehabilitated and then reintroduced into the wild you can't just take a pangolin and put it wherever it's not going to eat those termites it actually needs to eat a specific type of turmeric but that is what it specializes in eating so that is one of the biggest issues with pangolins is when they are poached or rescued or being poached and then rescued and have to be reintroduced and one of the really cool things is now they are able to with a little clip of sales sometimes they're able to trace back to what area they come from so so that's ignacious and so it's about 98 percent of pangolins diets is that one specific species demands and and they're now able to trace and put them back and we're quite lucky this area is rich in pugnacious ants so we they're quite a few pangolins around we're quite lucky to see them however you don't want to walk through their food as their name suggests they're absolutely horrible and they bite you efficiently they are very brave and that's why they've got that big armor and someone i saw someone said an armadillo yes they look very similar to armadillo with that and obviously which is behind us oh yeah there might be one heard a branch working broken breaking oh my goodness they're right well we had it but the breeding herd came through and we've got lots of ellie's around today i just see a whole lot of blue lines all over that point i'm not sure what's going on here you are going savage with your eyes we all want to come out to the big the big wild african bush and sea elephants i mean that's definitely one of the iconic species it's my mom's favorite day mum you love elephants so we can obviously see here that african and asian elephants are different and i've actually heard a few people i think you've you've never seen an uh an asian animal not in the wild not in the world but um people who have they always say that they expect to see this really small elephant but when you're there they're really large i think you can see here this is not a massive difference between in size i mean yes it is it is a little bit of a difference but it's not an incredible difference so um we can see here the foot structure and elephant switch structures between plantar grade and degrade which is really interesting and that's where they become linear angular as we can see here and elephants have pearl nails or not foods we spoke about that a little bit earlier we've got five toenails on the front foot and four on the back very interesting and you can actually see here the right foot i mean i tried to draw this as best as i could so i think i did a pretty good job very good job and you can see how the front foot is is quite a lot wider and bigger obviously having to carry that massive weight to the heads and in certain elephants their tasks as well big tasks oh luck is winning yes who was here today oh i'm so jealous i know there's amazing elephant scars here at pride dance and his teeth almost touch the ground yeah we'll put some i'll put up some pictures shortly it's so beautiful um and then if you want there we have a load of quizzes on our website and this is just one of them um www.ecotraining.com and you just type in elephants or elephant quiz and you will be able to do an elephant quiz which is really really cool sorry um no so art fox are less fussy they all eat different termite species they're not as fussy as angle and sorry i missed that one a bit early um and then adav was asking me i don't know if it was a question that had come through um from one of you guys that have been watching us so if you do our course is it for life so yes it is for life if you continue to pay your for garcia subscription unlike a few people we know level one two and three and then there's a whole lot of different types of special knowledge and skills that you could do um all of our guides are very very qualified so they've got loads of information um and they will mentor you throughout the whole process and what you need to do is you pay monthly or yearly early yearly yearly yearly subscription and that will then um allow you to be a guide and and guide whatever you need to which is really cool um i guide cameras now oh how's that um um was this so that's actually quite an interesting question so um he's asking is it true the corona came from england quite relevant at the moment it didn't it came from that however there were some people who um actually put that out into the media to try create a bit of panic so people would stop poaching penguins but however it is not true it came from bats um okay now xander is age 10 and he's asking does a lion die from other animals or do they die themselves i'm assuming nice to have you and always i i started learning at really young so i always love to have a young budding safari guide asking questions so lions will generally be killed by other lions that so when a male gets quite old uh new males will come in and chase morph and steal his family and that's how they will take over and then normally that male will wander around but normally they are killed by other lions very rarely they might be killed by hyena or one of the other predators even elephant sometimes i've i've actually seen an elephant or a cab so generally lions kill lions occasionally hyenas and some other animals as well they actually had an incredible situation that happened here in pardons last year september we've actually got a blog about it if you want to read more but there's a female lioness who was killed by two males here on pridelands yes and it happens happens quite often during during takeovers so that i mean a lot of you i know a lot of the birmingham boys uh did something similar so did the mapojo and they came in and killed and eight lionesses so generally what happens is those lionesses and with those young males coming in hormones or skyrocketing they literally don't know what's going on so they don't know whether to mate or fight or eat and and so when you get young males people between three and sort of five years old coming in to take over and there often is uh um they often do kill adult females and those adult females generally trying to protect cabs or sub-adults from the previous males so i've just got a question a comment come through here from dustin hall who says he bets the pangolin has bigger teeth so my husband my husband has smallish teeth i think we'll just say democrat he's got his business and then mom grant he says ask your mom about the pangolin on the zambezi valley there we go so my mom was like to see a pangolin so barbara would this material be finished beneficial to a lay person who doesn't want to be like guys it's just if you have a passion for knowledge and you want to learn more about the african mammals this is the best way apprentice field guard course so that's when you get a fugasa qualification and level one yes so it's called apprentice field gardener oh it's a chance yes so it's okay so that is when you will get your qualification you can then come and spend 35 days in the bush and do your practical and you will then be a fully fledged bird or if you don't feel like having that extra pressure and you just want to learn more we have a nature enthusiast course as well which actually starts on the 11th of august so that's soon soon and um our next source of course starts in the 10th as well so we've got two dates coming up and if you are keen on just learning and growing and knowing more about the bush there are loads of different options which is really really cool um and anything else terry how do some lions climb trees ah terry very confusing because everyone thinks my name is terry but i'm with an a well most lions can climb trees and even here where they don't do it often i've seen them uh clam chooses to steal leopard uh carcasses or leopards not is leopard kills um however with the sort of famous street climbing lines in east africa of lake manyara and queen elizabeth national park it's generally to get away from biting flies so they can get up into the wind there's a little bit of a breeze and they get a little bit of respite um from biting insects okay let's carry on yes as i say there's so many questions coming through here we can just speak about it forever so let's go on to the angular so we um can obviously break this down into even toad and odd toad angular so we can see over here we've got one two and here we've got one two three so we've got a black runner track and a warthog sometimes so i'm just going to get my handy little highlighter here in a wartog you can see these tiny little hoof marks here these are not usually visible no okay only in very soft muds after some rain so this is what you will usually see over here and we will when we get to tracks explain why this is a black runner back in the background but what we can see is we've got two hooves here like this that are separate and here we have three different types of hooves okay um so here we can have a look here that is a question for you definitely from roshni is there a difference between the eco-training course here and in kenya so yes and no so it depends what course you would like to do so we if you wanted to do our online course and then go for the 35 days in kenya it's the same thing okay but if you want to go and do a specific course in kenya that could be tailor-made for kenya yes there we go roshini all right um so here we can break these down a little further into the odd toad and even toad animals so we're not going to go in deep in depth about this because it is something if you really are interested you know we can always teach you more about it at a later stage so here we've got obviously buffalo and antelope um which fall under even toad so here we can with giraffe as well um here we go and we've also got so wart dogs and butch pigs and then odd toads is ones and three so we can see here we've got the rhino and we i mean rano and zebra so you can see here we've got one all right and who can tell us what these animals are as a group what are they called what are they called and if you're really smart you can tell us how they got that name oh yeah no you can do my quiz to find that out the big five well done guys really good this is the big five and again i have a quiz about this if you want to learn more ah click on the quiz click on the quiz if you want to learn more because they are difficult to hunt artists 200 they're the most dangerous too so uh traditionally they were the the five most dangerous animals to hunt on yeah yeah um and uh because i think personally if i should be in there i find hippo far more far more threatening than elephant rhino iron all effort yeah hippo and buffalo for me are the only two ones that oh buffalo are very scary but also black rhino i mean you can see i've popped a black rhino here not a white rhino so i love that song so we're going to move on to animal behavior here so in your mind you know you've obviously i've got a mind of i've got it in my mind about animal behavior you've got in your mind everybody has a different you know thought about animal behavior i don't know about all this juice differences bizarre um but we're going to break it down a little bit obviously again this this part this presentation this lecture is normally massive but it's just a small little breakdown and how everything falls together so we can have a look here and there are hierarchies that form different organizations within a group so here we can see them we've got the individual the population and the community and these levels affect the feeding and mating behavior so in nature all living elements can be grouped into hierarchies and organizations and then these include the individual the population and the community and um each different member of these groups possesses different statuses now before we go ahead carol says i'm very interested in online courses i'm 56 years old and we'd really like to do this course as we travel through africa quite a lot would it be beneficial for you yes and you can catch the naughty guys who are lying to you yeah super i like brain tube but yes carol it is definitely um it is such a wonderful way to learn and also because you are guiding yourself a lot of the time to be able to to notice these small little things that you wouldn't normally so it really is i mean i would i mean obviously i'm a bit biased but i would highly recommend it would you like something yes um okay i'm gonna get some water and then we're gonna go into the individual [Music] okay so the individual this is the lowest form of organization um in the organism itself it comes right comprises of a single organ organism of a particular species so here we can see a single bear bear or a bush bug so obviously this is just a breakdown of two specific things but obviously loads of different individuals that we could speak about we then go into the population so this is um a discrete group of organisms belonging to the same species okay and we can okay with my terrible core if anyone can argue that i'll be impressed so um like zebra for example so in a particular reserve or um park makes up the population so obviously we are here in pride lands and let's say ledward where you've got one of your cams there's zebra there okay so they are the same species but they are not they do not form the same population but if those zebra and these zebra here had to meet they could they could mate and have the same zebras so that is how that would work um so they have a common gene pool and they are part of the same genetic unit so obviously if we have the leopard coming over and the zebra they're not going to have babies they are definitely different and then we have the community so we can see the individuals we've got the population and there we've got our community okay so they all work together this is the circle of life exactly so population of zebra and the population of a parlor on a reserve together are known as the community so all these different things the marilla fruits fall from the maruia tree and are eaten by the impala on the floor the monkeys eat them in the top the elephant eats elephants then goes flying around and ants are eating it and it's moving around and it's just an incredible incredible situation so here we go ah the smiling lion feminine so when you see lines like this they're not about to sneeze they are not smiling at you and they are not growling either they are doing something called fleming grimace okay so this is an example of this facial expression so what you can see this young male line doing here so it has been known to be performed by females but it's not common females they do it but it's not it's mainly in males that it's a usual usual expression that males would make and it's performed by males in reaction to urine and females so we can see their urine and females so during this ritualized male interactions and when you've seen horses at home horses do it monkeys monkeys yeah and uh so if everyone's sitting there you can't you you don't have to don't have carrot but if you go a little hole on the top of your mouth now we have a remnant jacobson organ and uh so basically before our evolution took a path we used the feminine grooves so chimps gorillas still fleming grimace so it it's it's a nice signpost you can figure out females of mating age um if there's in and often you can pick up these weaknesses of a competitor in urine there's blood et cetera et cetera so as humans have evolved we have actually lost the ability to use our jacobson's organ um however in most mammals it is still a really really important thing it is very facial expressions and animals is it is very very important and these types of um sorry i i think it's a huge tree smells yeah yeah can you show people what a flaming a human food yeah it's very hard so we've actually lost the ability to pull back i can't even i can't even do that thing with your tongue where you like make your tongue yeah i can't even do that how am i going to do a fleming grimace i see someone got my go-away bird well done i'm very impressed um so all animals um and especially the order of or climax oh oh no yeah it is african-american that's what those go away birds are shocking sorry guys guys i wish you could see that's so cool good spotting brain that's the african-americans yeah there's two they're in a pair brilliant there's another one there okay guys if you could all just be they nest on in the center of pride so the greatest facial expressions would obviously be primex yeah we also make lots of faces but not the same ingredient um and then with animal communication sound communication is very very very very important so these include an array of different types of sounds so snorting champing rasping thumping rattling yeah one of my favorite somethings is not the elephant chickens on the bachelor's roots one of my most favorite experiences in my whole life and it echoes there could be kilometers and kilometers away and you hear this it sounds like someone's in there they're having a drum to it actually in and it's incredible because that communication will not say the fruit's good how much fruit is we're moving on because chimpanzees often live in much bigger communities where they're separate groups within the community so yeah little family yeah which is one of my favorite noises and the ripping of quills oh yeah we're going to watch a little video is my my dead dog's worst oh and no but it keeps um coming up towards the back of the fence and you we all know that porcupines do not shoot their calls just in case anybody was thinking that so they don't shoot their calls but they do back up so when you see a leopard or a lion and they're picking calls out their hands of their hearts out their paws and out their face and things like that because the pokemon is back they've reversed very fast pools have reversed into that animal so they don't shoot their calls very easy to make that mistake so they used to come right underneath my bedroom window at my old house and then she would be sleeping underneath the bed or underneath the blankets and then you hear that no she's just she crowded but she really didn't like the dogs also they bark and then they pine got out and we put this to slim and electric fence but i mean the porcupine goes straight up against it and i just think oh my gosh we can have a call to the face soon um i've got a question here do they have hooks on the end of the car yes so that's actually that's a really excellent question so they're actually micro barbed on the end of a porcupine coil so the only way you can see them is actually under a microscope you can sort of see them if you turn your binoculars around upside down but it's much nicer to see them on on a microsoft so they're micro micro bob so if you're any of you know fishing hook you've got a bob to ensure that the hook stays in and um there are thousands of little micro barbs on on a porcupine coil so that's is what happens when like lines and leopards and other things it gets stuck it gets stuck so you can't just pull it out and obviously that helps um what causes infection and all sorts of stuff so that's why it is such a good defense mechanism however certain leopards in that especially in in in harsh climates like the kalahari will actually specialize in hunting yeah and they managed to flip them very quickly yeah they're very they're very smart um so just to briefly go through these just snorting you've all seen i'm sure yeah i can't do it as well as brand can you so snorting uh champing so dumping your teeth rasping so um that's also horns on vegetation stamping on the ground so that we spoke about the chimpanzees elephant trees rabbits i mean obviously a rabbit's called semper i mean from bambi who doesn't know thumper and then the rattling of course so let's have a look at and strategizing sorry that's what's actually really important yeah so i'm in a grasshopper or locust when they're when you make that noise they're not making that with their mouth they're making it with their lips friction yes and amazing video this is actually one of nadav's latest sightings videos um and we can have a look at this interaction between the lipid and the porcupine is [Music] [Music] is side just showing the resilience of animals [Music] but it can be say yes that's the rattling of the tail coil in particular that sounds like a camera yeah it sounds like a very very nice camera i wish i had it can go that many frames per second oh wow but i think nadav has put another video out there where to watch that video if you want to watch the full video well i'm not sure what's going on here your highlighter i don't know um courtesy of wild earth which we also have a partnership with um eco training we've got our daily game drives on pride lands here as well which is really cool this is an amazing i think breen's done this as a human being i think yes wild earth fans there james henry and i did an anayala dance against each other on on a fireside chat many moons ago five six years ago now so this is this is an amazing um and they obviously do this to prevent like combat basically so this is this is a really nice way for them not to die because i mean i'm sure a lot of you have seen when um with one of the hands my favorite antelope it's just an especially one that is phyllo erecting which means that it is pulling up its hair to show another male how big it is and the other male's a little bit behind it and so i'm hoping that other one will start coming towards it so that they actually do a proper display he's not kind of fully displaying just yet his tail's still down when they pull their tail up that's when they're really displaying but you can see the slow methodical walk there we go you see the tail starting to rise a little bit you see that so it's a slow methodical walk and it's to try and intimidate the other males to try and make their body appear bigger and larger um so that the other male look look really cool and you see how they display that white as well of the tail so a lot of the time people don't know that nyada's have very bushy white tails and that's to show this other male listen i'm not scared of you i'm going to try and intimidate you and show you that i'm bigger than you are and this dance can take place over a space of a few minutes that they walk around each other or it can last for quite a long time into hours as they try and compete generally it's over females but sometimes if there's a male that they they don't know and they come together then they'll do it again the other male is going to come just to the left now of where this guy is it's a really cool thing to see there's such intriguing animals here we go yeah so really really important so visual forms now another will actually lock horns but yeah not very first prizes to try bigger than everyone else yeah it's just it's just a way of of of preventing that further damage i think it's a really nice way to to show how how big and strong you are without actually having to oh yeah i'm not sure why it keeps oh there we go okay so this these are wild dog we're just for brent um because you all know much how he loves a wild dog and we're going to go into some track identification you might have to unleash yourself um so we obviously part of the quarter would do sounds of nature and other sounds um which we're not going to go into now i'm just going to answer one thing quickly terry i didn't need to pick up my tail because i already knew i was more threatening than james henry and he was losing the fight oh very funny um nadav says he can't unmute hello i don't know how many to see if i can sorry guys i'm just gonna try and unmute the dough um i've got to find him first and mute lucky we had a group huh are you there are they okay wait there can you have you yay okay perfect no sorry i think you guys are the host so that's why i couldn't unmute it but yeah let's see if i can identify any of these tracks now so let's see who can beat the dads okay let's see let's start with the left the white one's over let's run on the left okay should i should i go ready or just give everyone a chance no you go it's up to you oh yeah okay well i mean first of all it's definitely a cat because i know cats have three like a w at the bottom like these three lobes so um and the size is pretty uh similar so i like it okay guys just in case anyone didn't know what tracks on the left for those who unsure not the ones on the right we're getting there okay cool so i would say the left is line the the whiter track and then uh the darker track is leopard um okay yeah perfect yeah hey well done so you can obviously see from your telltale signs tell telltale telltale telltale telltale tell lion tail sounds um so obviously as as i said i haven't put sizes to these it's just a it's just a brief explanation into into tracks um and one of the the tricky things with lion and leopard is you could have a really a small leopard or a really large lion depending on how i mean at night i mean a large leopard or a small lion oh my goodness gracious me um and it is really difficult but there are a few signs that you can look out for so as nadav said i'm just going to um do a little eraser here so you guys can see what i was talking about so you can see at the bottom here and you can see the bottom of the leopard pads and you can see the bottom wow word having a little go here and so you can see the bottom of the lion tracks and you can see the bottom of the lapel tracks how the pad differs a little bit you can also see in the top little pads at the top what do you call these little pads maybe you should take over these toes how close these ones are together and how close these ones are together so they obviously you maybe you should talk about tracks the one thing what i like to think is that i think personally and i find a leopard track a lot more sort of compact um and more i'm looking forward to are you also battling no i can't i find them a lot more complex i actually find them prettier in lion tracks much more beautiful i'm i'm more dainty and there's less sort of wobbly pose or funny shapes you can see all these gaps in between the toes here yeah so it's it's a lot more compact and um if you're looking around round if you think about it and if you take a big male lipid track for example it almost looks like if you took a tennis ball or something around and cut it in half it's a very round track where lines are quite elongated i mean this year you can see they're very very elongated okay nadab you're up let's go obviously we can all see the difference here is we've got claws yes okay cool so so definitely again kind of going on to what we just learned about the three lobes at the bottom um so the right is definitely a cat where the left is not because it doesn't have it uh so the right i'd say is a cheetah because cheetah is the only one that can't retract its claws um the left one the left one's a bit harder um i i like you know when you when you're in the park and you're always looking it's either like i'd say a wild dog with this um i find hyenas it's a lot more there we go yeah i must say when i went tracking uh with brent i it was fascinating just seeing this in real life i know on the screen it doesn't do it justice but uh yeah i know it's um it's it's crazy but this i would say the wild dog just because it's not as close to um the bottom pad you know it's a little bit further out often off at an angle almost at a sort of 50 60 degree angle they don't walk out you know just now but um yeah keegan got it right as well well done guys um okay oh obviously left and right let's start with the left answer the white one first joshua sorry youtube gets a bit slow a bit slower than the zoom so we'll give it yeah i think like 30 seconds for for youtube yeah yeah we've got some in uh everyone on the left um mickey poco loco am i saying that right uh elephant linda kun elephant yes yes yes um joshua um nicole and someone owner yeah all correct well done well done guys um so this is also we'll have a look at giraffe just now but it's it's a funny thing when you're in the bush and you and you're looking at something you you never know unfortunately very quickly but you also know when when you look at a giraffe when you look at a well then patty janine and buffalo um mauricia danny lots of people getting it right now okay so again left and right let's see but easier or is it is it i don't know i don't know all yours oh my gosh i even got the correct names now um so it's definitely a rhino [Laughter] now which is which i would say uh the left is white because it looks white um it's always tough like especially in real life but i know [Music] i know it's like the white rhinos is like a lot rounder at the bottom as you can see like you know where like the indent goes right in yeah for white so always remember with white rhino it's very a nice telltale sign tell telltale sign is you can always see the w it's a lot more um visible than in a black round and you can see here it's very shallow in comparison and then the front toes of the white rhino are much much closer to the size and also much wider um and we can lose it i know it keeps moving down i don't know what it is sorry guys there's a whole lot of like weird blue stuff but we can see here also the new names for these rhinos we've got a wide mouth rhino and a hook-flipped rhino and obviously due to what they eat and carol got that right as well yes well done yes i see a whole load of people put um some answers well done guys um marisa white trying to track also in the field is much larger much much larger obviously are much larger than that so but not as dangerous we know this okay so let's go next the dab you can't answer this one yeah okay yeah can't give it away let's see okay we got ireland coming through there's an answer good guess but no no good guess coming through hmm [Music] um and that is a giraffe so it's actually interesting i should have put it maybe put yellow and up here and you could have seen the difference but it is an interesting one as well but again with the hyena look at these kidney-shaped toes absolutely well done look at these toes and as grant was mentioning earlier look at the pads they're very like wobbly oblong and she's coming further downhill yeah i keep at the bottom now i'm over there no this is so weird it's breathing um okay so let's go next one okay this is a nice easy one so i actually saw one of these tracks challenge let's have a challenge to interrupt you but if you can tell us what type of ungulates each of these are okay so we've obviously got the left and the right track so you can tell us what these tracks are and then what angular they are and sorry nadav what are you saying no i'm just gonna say uh the one on the left i did a small hike this morning uh and we actually found some of these tracks so yeah fresh in my mind yeah yeah we went to rooncloth it's like yeah i'm not gonna give the animal away but josh they had these okay we've got some questions here and answers coming in i mean answers no not buffalo joanne but you've got the second part right indeed connie babe you've got it right a zebra is correct and a flower no it's not a cooker bob not too difficult um and hippo and this is remember one one and this will be four and four so we've got even and odd yes it's a very big well done okay and then here we had our we had this one a bit earlier but if you can get it right again then you we know you're paying attention so let's see who is can you get these ones you sure you should be able although it was quite funny so um i spent some time with some of my attracting friends okay and i've definitely lost a bit of the the the soft small skills on track yeah if you're not in the bush but i'm never tracking i'm never looking at yeah frog tracks and stuff like anymore it's fine yeah and wild dogs i'm following the predators so i was like sure um i got stumped and it took me ages to um which normally quite easy one when you're thinking about it was a swallow collecting mud to build a nest i was like i know this i'm terrible at tracking i'm absolutely shocking and my husband is a professional trails guy so he is amazing on foot and every time he asks me something or tries to teach me something it goes straight out of my brain i'm useless at it i really i mean there's some things that i'm good at that's not one of them we got some aunties yeah as well andre says um oh joshua you've got a question for nadav nadav have you walked in the river i think you're saying i haven't deborah [Music] well done everybody um okay and then we've got our last can you guess the tracks continued this is um i think our last of the tracking and then we actually almost finished wow yeah but okay let's go first track oh you can tell us this evil it's not fire it's not a sand painting mama it's hard the dab says it's hard let's see it's you know like the size actually does make a massive difference for me yeah so this is this is this would be a baby of blessing it would be a version so someone is saying joshua and keegan are saying pangolin um you're not allowed to answer we're the most wonderful man solomon used to work with us in tanzania he was the maintenance guy and now cam and this creature used to break i'm giving him words away here um used to break into the ayah yeah you used to break up the actual concrete to get into the bottom of the question good guess oh there we go i don't know how to say your name mickey we didn't know what this man was talking about and it was a honey badger but he called it a hubba dodger and so anyways i know forever we'll call it a habitat okay our last track that is a tough one if you have not seen it that is a very tough one people are getting it fast huh joshua nicole oh my gosh andre keegan you guys but you guys are really good at this because you've got all of them right you've been cheating yeah have you been cheating have you been oh well here we go well done guys yeah there's an ostrich awesome guys that is absolutely brilliant so for those of you who want to learn some more about tracks and tracking either first you take the course because it'll teach you way more but if you're just interested in some live reading cybertracker.org who's got some really nice free downloadable pdfs um that you might want to have a look at and that is yeah so anyone got any questions yeah i think i'm going to stop sharing so you can see us property now hi we went in the tiny little screen at the top so you could see the presentation but we are we are here now we're getting some wedge hi guys hi guys sweet uh look at you guys a very sweet day um i'm gonna go speak of you guys [Music] okay so have we got any questions that are coming through that we could answer i heard or someone said i'm a cop as well so while we're waiting so guys if you want to be a field guide if you just want to have a little bit more in-depth knowledge about what's happening out in the bush on your next safari whether you're taking yourself on a safari whether you're going on a safari with um a guide always the more information is better and you can never stop learning i don't stop learning and i've been guided every day i learn more exactly and it's amazing but it's we do we obviously have an array of different courses um but at the moment being the current climate of harvard there's a special bug on your screen oh hello we can't travel as much as we used to be able to and we can't do the things that we were able to do so we have got the option of online courses and we have um three at the moment that you can do so we have a biomimicry course which you can sign up right away on our on our website we have got our level one our apprentice field guard course that is starting on monday the 10th and we have a nature enthusiast course that is starting on tuesday the 11th um and you can inquire immediately now and sign up and become a field guard online i mean how cool is that and then mckenzie hey clark's wondering how old do you have to be to do this specific online course you can be however old you want to be how old you are if you want to be 21 and do it you can even if you're 29. i think it's also i mean it's asked again um how old do you have to be for the one year yeah so so you have to be it's a it's it's an interesting question so to become a guard in south africa you have to have something called the prp pdf i'm old it keeps changing pdrp which is a public driver's license permit okay and that is that is that will give you the ability to take base on a safari with that being said you don't have to be 21 to do a course you can be 18 years old out of school and come in and do it and someone else will drive the vehicle for you while you learn okay well you can drive the vehicle but you can't go and they always obviously do it you can be 18 years old and come on a course um i see a question coming through our first aid so on our level one course we do do a first aid course we also have a first aid course that you could do as well um and yeah only within provinces at the moment that's why the online course is really wonderful because you can do the course and then you can do the 35-day course at a later stage when board is open well provincial board is open exactly yeah so it's a good way to get a good start if you are wanting to become a field guide and there's no time limit on when you do it you can do the online course and then a year later you could do the practical course so there's no there's no time frame where it's like you have to do it immediately yeah you can do it whenever you want which is really exciting we also got another question about do you offer any like maybe intro to anti-poaching courses if you wanted to do that no we don't unfortunately and that is not something that we offer but it is being in the bush and becoming a guard is it's an amazing way you do learn so much about that it's a really good thing to do before you actually even do an approach a lot of the skills you you need to operate while approaching you need to know your animal behavior you need to know how to deal with energy dangerous game on foot elephants buffalo lion etc so if you can't do that you're not going to be much good stopping poachers when you get flat or eaten so it is really i mean we we do have a lot of people who come into this industry wanting to go anti-poaching route or the game ranger route and they do a field guide course and what's really nice is our one-year course is inclusive of a placement yes and if a placement of uh anti-poaching placement is something that you're really interested we will then work our best to get that type of placement for you which is a really nice inn in the industry so it is definitely very very exciting yeah anything else the dove that's coming through i'm looking also trying to see here yeah um so we know that a lot of the lodges that are looking for guides like their criteria is for gasa uh so if people do this course then obviously we'll like go towards that as well and like they'll get a ferguso like certification of some sort yes okay so when you do the online course you will get your favorite obviously you have to pass the exam so the exam is online so it's an eight-week program you will do your fagosa level one theory for god's apprentice sorry it was called evil one for 20 years get confused uh for gaza apprentice field guard theoretical that's the practical and you'll get a forgotten certificate as well if you look on the website there's all the information there that you will walk away with you will then come into the bush and do a practical with us and then after you've done the theoretical part online and the 35-day practical side you will then be able to guard perry whipped you in shape yeah i'll whip you into shape three times a week but for your man um yeah so that is i hope answering your question that is um you can go work at a lodge after you've completed these two two parts when is the kruger series coming back on dstv we have no idea we are we are it is on the weather channel there isn't a season two but we have done our own latest sightings kind of tv show that we recently filmed the mallamala which will hopefully be out uh next month so if anyone is interested uh channel 180 on dstv but another thing um just it's it's amazing um to see the feedback on on like um youtube and facebook or how people have really found this informative and like inspiring so it's really cool oh good i was so glad guys i mean i was a little nervous i mean obviously i've got 70 students three times a week who i love so if all of you are watching you know how much i love all of you so um i i'm used to speaking to them but i've you know i was a bit nervous i didn't know how many people were going to be absolutely but brent made it very easy for me so i feel that feel a lot better and i'm so it's getting darker as you can see in here actually it's actually yeah whenever we do the the live streams on our youtube channel like whenever they say it's getting dark it's like it's like the end of the live stream um but there was something there was another question in terms of like the structure of the course like how many people join how does like the course work okay so and i also see here someone's asked if you can do it if you're in the states so so how the course works okay so let's say for example if you sign up i'm gonna let terry hang this i'm just going to go okay so if you um sign up and you start the course on the 10th of august with me and our very very capable instructors you will have course three times a week mondays wednesdays and fridays it starts at 6 00 p.m south african time and we've we've done it at that time because it worked really well for um internationals as well so it will fall under your under your time frame i guess and you then we'll do the course the lectures we have theory reviews which are like little tests after each lecture that you will then be quizzed on in your own time and we have workbook assist with myself and a lecturer before each lecture and you will then be able to answer and ask and have all your questions answered you will fill in your forbasa workbook that you will get and um all your philosophies and everything is included into that into that payment into your initial payment there's only one payment sorry not initial payment and everything will be put in there in together sorry i'm using my words here everything is paid for once you will get all your workbooks you will get all your information you then do the course online you write an exam online that we facilitate and make sure it's really smooth and easy for you you will then once passing your exam become a um a theory qualified for uh apprentice field guide so that part of your fugasa qualification will be done you can then apply to come on a practical with us for 35 days and do your practical part of the the course and we've got a doggie here oh my gosh you come to sacramento she likes to say hi to everyone is that the one on your background yeah no no that's just no this is my dog look at this little thing oh she's so cute um so i hope that answers the question um we are with you every single step of the way so it's very seamless we have got a blog um that was written by lee bel ware who is one of our current students and she wrote a blog about her experience and what it's all about there's also another blog that i wrote recently this last week going through everything as well so there's lots of information on our website if you want to read more um currently we have three students who are in australia and we have a lot of people who are there we go we've got a lot of a lot of people in australia so um and we also have a lot of people who can't make the lectures it is recorded and sent to you immediately the next day and you do feel i mean i know um i don't know if mandy's on here or megan they feel like they are part of the league because even if they're not there on the actual day thanks so much grant and there is no age attraction so you can be 10 and come and join me for a lecture like sunday um yeah exactly so um um just one more question do you have a basic sorry i see there's some questions uh do you have a basic nature guide course different to field guard or safari guard um not yet no it's coming yeah yeah yeah yeah it is we're gonna have hopefully we do have actual just courses on the ground we've got seven day or fourteen day courses that you could come and learn it's just a really condensed version of the the apprentice field guide course so it's 7 or 14 days that you can learn in the bush and be with us in our camps with our instructors instructors in learning so just have a look at our website we have loads of different courses we have wildlife programs and accredited courses so we've got lots and lots of different options birding and the flashing photography courses tracking courses um as we said the nature enthusiast programs we've got loads of different options for you very exciting yeah and um i mean it's just an incredible and on the longer courses and other courses you get to travel to different countries when you're allowed to you know
