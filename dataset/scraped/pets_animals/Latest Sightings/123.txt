you can see she's uh been looking out in that direction for some time now superbug saying mike's got a very corrective wave nice to see you pay attention superbikes she's moving about a little bit now and for those of you that follow us on malamar's youtube channel you might be familiar with oh there goes the head that's the head that just plopped down there okay so i'm just gonna see if she's gonna come down the tree and maybe fetch that head so she did make a funny little chatting sound it's not impossible that she has seen another leopard uh we'll just see what she does see she's spraying urine there as well which is i don't know if you all will be able to hear it but she's making this like chat things on i'm sure she's seen another leopard we mentioned on the facebook page earlier that um her daughter you can just see i think there's a head i can see in the grass there okay i'm not gonna go there he's gonna keep an eye on the head i'll keep an eye on this lip see she is quite nervous she looks quite reluctant to leave the kill but um she's obviously quite afraid of whatever's lurking in the grass here so there's an old male leopard that's just come into the area i think he's a bit nervous of us but you can oh there you can see his head popped up there you can see his head just popped over the grass there and um yeah he's probably not going to come here while we are here because he is a little bit nervous of the vehicles but i'm just going to go back to the ink of any female i can see her watching him from a distance so we'll just see what happens with this other leopard so there it could be one that we know as the maxim's male he's a little bit shy of us and then it also could potentially be an old male leopard who's very nervous of the vehicle so we're not going to move around just yet we'll just see how things play out here next we're gonna keep quiet now let this leopard come a bit closer to us if he does come close he's going to sit very still and what gareth and i are going to do is just back up a little bit just to give him a bit more access to the tree i think he does want to come over but he just feels quite exposed because it is relatively open here and also he is nervous because there's another leopard around here it's just a little complicated um limitations he's probably going to want to move that carcass together move it away from us i'm so amazed that he's letting us always come this class in fact this is a big surprise for us i think and that's a huge privilege to have a lipid that's being quite nervous around the vehicles just uh behave in such a relaxed manner around us today uh they chased the second cheeto into our neighbors so i don't know if you heard that on the radio but a pack of wild dogs chased one of the cheese up a tree and then chased the other cheater off of our property so i think that cancels their plan for now but there still might be a little bit of action left in the sighting yeah i think as you can see this is he just got a little bit nervous so you can see this is um obviously i'm just pointing the camera back at the feet on the ground here see that's more typical of the behavior that we've experienced with him but it was um very good for us to just have those few minutes with him where he was relaxed in the tree that's more than he's given us um at all so yeah we're very fortunate to have that and uh have a nice close-up view of him
