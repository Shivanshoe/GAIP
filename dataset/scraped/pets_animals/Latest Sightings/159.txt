I think we're gonna wait hippies let's see what she does she might just be doing a little circle okay okay let us know you're live folks are we waiting for your comments do you have your phone set up with comments extra battery okay let's see alright no W just let us know any life pits are still getting set up for these with the comments yet folks if we are live welcome to Molly Molly it's good to be back live again and we are currently looking at a tree and there is a lipid just out of frame right now but you're gonna wait until there's some people in the chat room and all of that to show her to you it's the piccadilly female and she currently has two kills in this Eppley tree there's one over here where I'm pointing and there's another one don't if you can see it from there but it's hanging up there okay lovely pitch oh yes we are laughs ex I don't know how many of you there are this is just happened very just decided to go live and spur-of-the-moment here and welcome tomorrow male I'm with Pitts who I'll introduce in a moment we are with sitting with the Piccadilly female right opposite Kemp in an area called Reiner pins you might have had me talking about Reiner pins in previous live streams and we are sitting at the base of an apple leaf tree and in the tree I'm just gonna point it out there's an Impala that Impala did not climb that tree that Impala was hoisted up the tree by the Piccadilly female so she obviously hunted that Impala and then decided to hang it up in the tree just for safekeeping so other predators like hyenas or lions don't come and steal it from him I like to waste them in leafy trees just so that there is a bit of cover from the Sun first of all and you can see that carcass is currently in the Sun so the female may come and move it but also from vultures and in the tree is actually a second kill we can't see at all that clearly right now but it's a water back cough and it's quite amazing that she's made two kills and wasted them both in the same tree it does happen from time to time yeah and let us know what you think welcome everyone I don't know what you see there in the comments Pete yeah people from Botswana northern islands as me from India welcome everyone to the eastern parts of South Africa yeah as gary said we here with the piccadilly female when we left camp this morning we found tracks within five minutes of leaving camp and the tracks were headed west from this general area and we follow the tracks about three or four well maybe three kilometers woods from here and then we found her coming back the other way along the same set of tracks so what she's done is she'd killed these two animals had stashed them industry and she had then gone to suckle her cubs she's recently given birth we're not sure where the den is yet but we have a rather rough idea now it's a way where those tracks leaving tp'ed we think that the inside may be in the money lazy river west of spice traffic exit so the cap of the MC Queenie female the three three spot pattern cab of the MC Queenie female has been hanging around that area we got some video footage of him just two days ago with Peters talking about I don't think the Piccadilly female will appreciate his presence in that area and just quickly Charlotte's name on and will she come back to her kill she is here at the moment she's just lying on some long grass she was at the base of the tree when we started live-streaming we were hoping that she would ascend the tree but she's done the opposite and she's yeah just gone stationary for now but if she when she does leave the kill she will come back after she's done suckling her cubs Mohammed we could zoom in but there's not really much to zoom in at the moment we could maybe try go for the Impala okay go for the Impala caucus just hold on for second wallah so while Gary's readjusting their wild UAE asking how all the female leopard is was only fourteen thousand thirteen I've got my lipid idea yeah give or take a month but she was born at the end of December 2013 not too far from where we are now actually so you can see pretty much center of screen maybe in the top half of the screen is the Impala that's hanging over the branch of this Apple leaf tree or Rain Tree and I'm gonna try and zoom in on the waterbag carcass it is behind the branch currently let's just see if we can get it in frames I think we might be able to get a leg lucky central screen I'm just gonna point it out say there's there you can see a little bit of red I can't tell you exactly what that it is a bit of flesh from the inside of a skin it looks like but you can see the legs hanging over the branch there that is a water back off so the piccadilly female currently has two kills waisted industry the tiger woman asking how many Cubs she's given birth to we can only guess at the moment but typically leopards will give birth to between one and three cubs so if we - four you gave birth a few weeks ago and if I had to hazard a guess I'd say probably - judging by the amount of soccer marks on her I saw this morning Gareth mom it says thanks for the zoom in you're welcome Mohamed where do we have people from around yeah from Germany Jimmy let's just do from Germany Ali from Kenya welcome Ali tcmitch again asking if we're going to see any elephants so we're going to focus on this female leopard but we are close to the Sand River at the moment there's a good chance the elephants will come down to have a drink it is quite a warm day oh it's shaping up to be a warm day there's a good chance that they'll pop down to the river another I leave from Iraq welcome Gabriel from Canada Tiger Woman's from New Jersey few South Africans welcome to all the South Africans now there are quite a few locals that join us for our live streams and I say locals that's people from the lower faults in White River and North Bridge area others asking is a usual fun effort to make to kill success together or is it due to nursing babies well the fact that she does have Cubs means she does there is more pressure on her to eat and to have a good milk flow but yeah it's not more often than not you'll just see them with one kill but it is not uncommon it's not it's very far from being unheard of just seeing them have two kills in the same tree I think there's some record on Mala Mala Gareth you know what it was for the impala lambs it was close to double digits of the number of impala lambs taking up one female leopard I didn't have it again but it doesn't surprise me it was near the window xa in screen there was a black editorial that was feeding on a hairy caterpillar and it's just flying off now and the piccadilly female is coming in to screen our bottom left and if you can see her there I'm gonna zoom in on here [ __ ] she does have a hit app it's part of me while I wake with this I am forming off of a cell phone so it's a it is difficult to keep it still first of all II from jo'burg welcome it's just taken over the camera work for the time being I'm better at camera working Gareth's better comments say erase from Singapore Dillon Morgan welcome back Israel Matias I from Namibia and I'm from England TCC Michigan Paris I 2n and Yun in Cape Town as well I know you chin did not enough you've if you have come into the air but I just want to say hello to you Gabby saying hello NAT dad from your old teacher was Nadav a diligent student and before he started later sightings at the age of 15 curious to know Gabby let us know I'm from New York it's a morning from Vancouver does he 1369 welcome back awesome student Gabby says all done in the dev not any egg exit businessman but it sounds like here good student as well good morning from Germany like so that for those of you that are just joining us now we are currently sitting in an area known as Reiner pins which is opposite Mala Mala main camp I pan across [ __ ] no kids is gonna give us a view of the camp never then this is Gareth hi folks no dad say he doesn't know his teachers face names so Mala Mala is situated between the sabi sands Game Reserve and the Kruger National Park we are wage between those two reserves and we are currently just outside of camp the river is in between ourselves and Kemp and we are in the hearts of the piccadilly females territory just over the hill out of screen to the right is Piccadilly triangle we have driven through there before with then the guy email and the one Campbell Alanis and that's where she gets her name from so we are very close to the centre of her teaching now wait saying it's a bit early Nevada we have decided to livestream a bit earlier just because we see that there is an opportunity within cellphone range and we've taken that opportunity its effects for those of you that haven't joined us before we aren't very on a very large reserve yeah that largest privately owned Big Five reserve bordering krieger and our sulfa and reception and it covers about ten percent of the property so we go live when and care as and when we can rather and yeah so we just it's on an ad-hoc basis if you do want to know when we go live click the bell icon on latest sightings YouTube channel and they will let you know when you'll get a notification if we do go live for a lot of the sightings that we aren't able to stream live we are filming and putting on our youtube channel just get to Mala Mala game reserves YouTube channel and you can see some of the other sightings there some people asking about the lockdown we are currently under lockdown conditions here and we don't have guests at the moment it's just the skeleton staff that are here at mono multi make sure that the property is maintained and just to have feet on the ground so Josh Pawnee asking I assume she's aware of our presence she is very much aware of our presence and she's not too concerned about us she's just lying in the shade taking erased and their senses are far more cuter now so she would have been aware of our presence even before we were aware of hers driving in here and a lot of these animals like if you imagine you a cat if you have a cat back home if it's unhappy it is will go flat or smaller too these animals if they are if they're uncomfortable to your presence they won't leave it up to your imagination to guess whether or not they are so they'll let you know in no uncertain terms so Terry my sister asking where is she I'm assuming it's just gonna zoom in there hi Terry I don't have to race to the family is they the tire - Chris and Alex and Ethan and any of my other family that might be watching I also just say hi to Pete's family if they're watching from the signals are that good in Zambia he's not sure when they'll be able to get this so you can't really see her now firm but she's lying down in the patch of grass over there yeah she's pretty much same to the screen it's just on the fender looks like a black lamp we don't again disturb here right now and I think we got ourselves nicely set up here Pete's the kill sorry killers the one killers up here as a young Impala fully born every year ago and then there's a water buck cough hanging over they can just see it's legs under June trunk I'm a-saying thanks guys doing a great job thank you Andrew we appreciate that just do your asking if we can speak Jim and I certainly can't nine-nine so pizza panting in English spoken in Jewish unfortunately neither of us can I think Pete can speak a bit of Turkish so no you guys can meet in the middle somewhere i anit welcome back for those of you that might be watching on your televisions you'll notice that I am speaking to people it's not that we have tourists on the vehicle we do have the speed on YouTube and you can't comment on the sightings so if you go on your phone and I'm guessing on a computer as well you'll see all the Comets comments that people are making and we are just responding to those comments but we are saying thank you so much this is the Kriya eases the Krueger cravings thanks to Twitter and then one Rosina Dutta one Muhammad and is asking when are they going to feast on the kills we are waiting for that she has fed on both of these carcasses and there's not all that much left and how long do you reckon these carcasses of benefit it gets maybe two days yeah so it's saying two days and we shaggy a Leah it's right across from Kent we can see this tree from the place that we eat our meals from the dining room so just goes to show you that things can happen right in front of you and you might not be aware of it and this lipid massive beam happened down the street past two days without us noticing and then beats and briefs finally found him this morning yeah Joshua Murray asking have the number of Rana perching been released during lockdown Joshua it's very difficult to tell and we don't get the numbers features and all that readily so yeah I wouldn't be able to answer that maybe after lockdown a report will come out I'm not sure I'll be mayor asking where the lipid is their feet are zooming in central screen she's shutting up now he's looking towards the kill and then as we arrived yep it was mentioning that she might go up there because those kills are in the Sun about trying to move the hills into the shade we're hoping that that happens fasal asking any Irina came sniffing the other side we haven't seen any yet but I I would imagine that there have been a few hyena around yeah they've got an incredible sense of smell and they're here very well and they said knee-high heel isn't Kemp every single not just across the way there so I'd imagine they would have picked up on the scent and possibly heard the piccadilly female chewing through bones and would have come an investigator tiger woman asking do we think we'll see the Cubs or are they going to stay hidden after nursing so we typically only view Cubs after six weeks we know that a leopard or a lion has given birth to Cubs give them about six weeks before we start investigating don't know how long it's been now it must be close to six weeks oh we're not sure here we say maybe around the month at I guess born free asking do we know of any good books about the history of the sabi sands say there are two books I don't know if the one is still published and it's called to everything its season I doubt whether it is still being published and that there is another book where they have used a lot of the data that is being collected here at Mala Mala it's called shaking Kruger and that's an excellent book in terms of the history of the ecology of the Kruger National Park and because a lot of the data came from Mala Mala and that's pretty fair to say that you know we were once a part of the sabi sands we now boarded the sabi sands and the Kruger National Park it's fair to say that'll give you a good idea on the history of the ecology of the sabi sands as well and in terms of history the and the interesting stories in that and I think yeah to everything its season would be a good start but I'm not sure if that's being published still Maleng 86 asking what is the name of the leopard and how old is she the name of the leopard is the Piccadilly female and she was born it just corrected me in December 2013 right yeah yeah so she is now just over six years old what animals are in the area around us currently there's a lot of small animals lots of butterflies birds we can't see any larger mammals this tree antelope lying dead in the tree there was the unfortunate mother of that what about cough was hanging around here and then a squirrel it's getting crazy behind us so Gabi asking where the lip it is and I'm gonna try and it's gonna try and zoom in on it again I wonder if it's worthwhile getting it yeah yeah factor we are gonna get a little bit closer to her she does have a hit at every she doesn't move and between just pardon us while we just slowly make our way closer to her we have said up here because we're hoping that she climbs a tree and but I think let's go and show you the leopard we might come back at to this area in a moment I think maybe even if you so reside welcome back okay effects are just gonna move now I'm so lazy that is your TV and zoom in you're gonna drive a bit closer it's quite typical of wildlife once we decided to come test two should probably get up and move to the tree thanks I don't know if you can see this lipid now and maybe if you can get a little bit to the right the comments I think come down the left hand side of screen there with him okay there we go it looks like people are seeing it now greetings from California Richard welcome Paul Danielle how long do they live for in female leopards were often live longer than males same with lions actually there's a good chance that she could live up to as old as seventeen male leopards have to do a lot more fighting with regards to maintaining a territory so quite often when they start getting a bit older over the hill and younger stronger males will come in and evict them but for the most yeah there's a kind of general average female lipids in this area at least to about 17 years be a good knock so her mother this this leopards mother was known as the kick a lazy female almost considered almost because the queen of Mala Mala royal bloodline even she lived to be very close to 17 and she was probably one of the most successful mothers you've ever had on the reserve she was like the southern Avoca males two male lions and the Piccadilly theme female and screen has since taken over her mother's territory someone just asking what their name is there and that it's just said it but she is called the Piccadilly female high pet Schaefer from Cape Town not quite sure where the leopard cubs are kids so to answer in a plane's question there as well and asking doesn't she have calves we think she does she's got suckle marks and peach found their checks going back and forth from this tree this morning and he's got an idea of where he thinks the day inside Mackay which is basically and further behind this lipid probably by three or four kilometers in a river known as the Mannion lady river someone just making the comment that it doesn't look like Krieger and Ernest Khan the landscape doesn't look like the KP Innes the Kruger National Park is absolutely massive and certainly in this area just north of Skukuza the landscape is quite similar to this but the architects they are parts of the Fuji National Park that look completely different they've got all sorts of different and ecosystems in the Kruger Park because of its size because of all the different latitudes lines of last year the covers from north to south and there's a lot of altitude and all difference they are parts of Kruger that looked very different sits like quite a lot of difference and with a geology then and that has a big impact on ecosystems that's thrive and survive above the soil so you're correct there are places in Kruger that look very different - you don't know what she's just seen me they really find the vaults asking where'd we get the names and what will we name the cabs do you want to answer that one yes when let's take her Cubs for example that she gave birth to recently in the beginning we will refer to them as the cub or Cubs of and then the mother's name so she is called the piccadilly female so those Cubs will be called the Cubs of the piccadilly female as I get older and we can tell the sexes maybe the male cub and the female cub of the piccadilly female once those Cubs reach independence and the mother pushes them away we will then refer to them as either the son or the daughter of the piccadilly female that's mainly because she will it won't be too long before she gives birth again and she'll have more Cubs which will be called Cubs of the piccadilly female so therefore the original litter they will be referred to as the son or the daughter of the piccadilly female until they start becoming territorial so yeah that's how we name our predators when they start establishing a charity they'll start scent marking they'll start roaring and the areas where they start doing that is where we will name them according to that area so quite close to here as an old area called Piccadilly triangle and this is where this leopard started to become territorial and she's called the Piccadilly female we find that this way of naming predators helps us to build a more of a story around them and understanding their movements other than giving them a name like like Dimond or something to that effect yeah you know their territories may shift and over time so it does help to know where their initial territory was to see how their shifts take place this is in my opinion one of the prettier female lipids on the property as someone asking and and I guess it ties in a bit with what Peters been saying where do you get the nervous that's not the question how do you keep track of them and know which which is which so we will identify different leopards through their spot patterns and well firstly it's these animals look although they might look the same they're all leopards look the same to it you know to us at the first lawns if you spend enough time with them you will see that they they all they all look different so for example when we found this leopard this morning without even having to look at her spots I could see that it was this female she just that just that she looks different they have and they're not all carbon copies of each other but when in doubt you referred to this we refer to the spot patterns so the the spots on either side of her nerves above the whisker line the number of spots on each side and people also make up patterns join the dots with the spots on their foreheads so that's how we can identify different leopards so if you go to our YouTube channel Marla Malik game reserves YouTube channel if you go and look up the lot they've been a few videos now on lipids if you see any lipids in the thumbnails click on them and you may be made the last four or five videos we've produced and you'll see there are cue cards or leopard ID cards which will if you pause on it you'll see you know there's the jersey the mother is who the father is Tommy lets's I've had and what they spot pattern is and that spot pattern is very handy in helping us identify them and we may start putting that on line at some point for those of you that wish to get to know our cats just let us know what you think about that idea and then stone --is-- saying I guess this is prerecorded Daanish it is not we are watching we are streaming live right now Aaron Tyson opinionated South Africa has just responded to iearn the Kruger Park is the size of Israel a little smaller than Belgium okay Jameer three great to see you haven't lost your leopard finding challenge trying to come back soon greetings from Australia rosemarie resume please do come visit the tiger woman saying I surprise you remember the father with how many males will breed the female it's a good point Tiger woman we are not with some of the leopards we are not 100% sure who the father is because you are correct if a female territory overlaps with a number of male lipids she'll try and mate with all of those leopards and then it is tricky to know who the father is Panthera which is a research project that's been ongoing in the sabi sands for some while now has been doing work and they have managed to genetically could collect dang samples or scat samples and to figure out some of the lipids at least who the fathers are in most cases will be if we're unsure of who the father is will probably be they'll probably be two on hardly ever more than three different options of males yeah it's not like domestic cats on the street where it could be you know 1020 other males this is mostly two males if we're unsure do you explain why they make this different Mouse no so just to build on to that question you might wonder why would a female mate with different male leopards so the the biggest killer of leopard cubs is other leopards and normally male leopards who aren't the fathers of the Cubs if they happen to stroll into the territory and come across a female with Cubs and the Cubs aren't his he will then try and kill the Cubs and that will also help to bring the female into East race and then he can mate with her so what the females will do is they will say for example sheath the slipper in front of us does have Cubs now and the male leopard you is the father we believe is a well the one we believe is to be the father's rather nervous male so we don't see too much of him but if another male leopard so for example was a male called the flat rock male who holds territory not too far from here even though she has Cubs now she will try and mate with him if she comes across him but it won't really be mating she'll be pseudo mating will be fake mating an attempt to try and convince him should he come across the Cubs in a couple months time that they are his say okay just commenting that lipids don't roll we we D say roll though we do know that it's rasp and I think just old habits maybe diehard they vocalize they vocalize here we go and then also asking do we know the leopard Hosanna I've heard of him I know that he's somewhere in the sabi sands town north but I can't say I know him very well we've got plenty of katia to keep us busy so we focus the ones that are kind of on our property so if pizza is correct or if the den site is close to where Pitt followed the tracks to this morning what's interesting is when I saw the Piccadilly female mating with that nervous male leopard he was quite close to where Peters describing the two of them were mating there and that's you know we were hoping that if she is mating with us nervous male leopard if we gave them enough space that that male leopard that is a little bit skittish might see that the Piccadilly female is completely relaxed her on the vehicles and he too would I say start relaxing around the vehicles and we've had two opportunities I think your own Ravenhill watched them mate on one occasion and I watched the mate on the second occasion and but this he certainly did not relax we gave the male leopard plenty of room and we kept it to one vehicle sighting because he is a nervously leopard but yeah he said me did not relax our guess is that he is maybe a Kruger leopard and generally the blocks of land in Kruger National Park are way bigger than the blocks of land here in the sabi sands when I talk about a block of land I'm talking about an area in between roads so there's quite a dense road network and the sabi sands and yeah in the Kruger National Park you cannot offer edge either say the sabi sands a lot of these leopards have around the actual and I completely shudder in promise TV saying lipid row is called sewing and let's see 10 points forever can tell us which tree is in the back here pretty much the tree that most people think about when they think of Africa just in the mean time Brian elma asking is the skittish male the maxims male he is a little bit skittish but he has started to relax around the vehicles the mechs and smell he's a beautiful leopard but it is not him and he actually relaxes as the Sun sets he becomes an incredibly relaxed leopard and some lipids are like that we also believe that he's maybe from the Kruger National Park but yeah it's not the Nexen snail this lipid currently doesn't have a name we just call it the nervous smell in motley and Gabriel is a Peter Katia's yeah acacia acacia but that's a very good so it's a good start start but there are many many many different types of the Katia's does he 1369 coconut tree no this is Camille during no unfortunately no Camille during's yeah camel thorns just a type of vacation comes the piccadilly female I do that Donna yeah I think they'd stay here for but it's how do you think I picked Ramadi Boersma and welcome back it is an occasion one-day tour tell us Brian elm ah here we go okay [ __ ] or Tillis that's the way ten points ten prints and then desi 1369 asking safety sorry does he I didn't mean to poopoo that question about the coconut tree they are not coconuts in the immediate vicinity but should he travel maybe 150 kilometers east of us you'll find coconut trees along the beaches of Mozambique so you're not far off apologies just regarding your question but there's yeah the coconuts grow basically closer to the Asian an opinionated DNA saying umbrella to one that's correct sexist a particularly female is just lying down again and it's just gonna take over the comments again for now we thought she was gonna go straight to the tree in time at MIT you're just gonna get a little bit closer to her again it's gonna go Dec just so you give it a some plenty of room later on it comes did tell me how many shots get ready to homes next year ready to save this and share it with your friends it looks like she might climb up the tree nah she was lying in that exact position when you first arrived yeah Terrence Gibbs saying is a true lipids can hold twice their weight up a tree they can set me all very large items up a tree and trying to think about the other scene when Holt actually twice its weight can you think you know but the book say they can yeah so I think you'd read that that in the literature but I think with all these animals and you know they're very just like humans you know each person is very different from the next and you get large strong females you get weaker smaller females also depends on how much they've eaten lately you know if they haven't technically yeah they certainly can haul extremely heavy prey species up trees and they can hunt very large prey species what is the I know we found the island female on three occasions on two or three occasions last year with in a man that adult could've bulls oh yeah it was the worst three times I think in two months yeah three times in two months the island female and she's a particularly large female leopard and unfortunately we didn't see her killers but we could any assume that she took those kitties down you know I had a lion or a bald a bit uh Mahina taken down that adult Kitty they wouldn't let her feed on it we found it she fit on almost the entire caucus and one of them could if it was just one then you might have died naturally but for three of them to die naturally in a short space of time not like it's a [ __ ] screen has just gone off and I'm looking through all these personal messages here asking Brooke Stevenage asking are they any part in parlors around I can't see any at the moment but I wouldn't be surprised I can see one image but I wouldn't be surprised if it starts making me way down to the other to drink it's starting to warm up now it's a TV asking obviously not Thomas Annie butcher lazy is a range a year but it's currently at home for TV Matthew Tubbs to be just asking a question on vehicles why aren't you driving electric cars so TB and for few reasons and we drive a fleet of the land Revis County and we have been driving land drivers since we started game viewing yeah and that has been very important in getting the animals to become tolerant of our present presence and the reason is that we have a strict driving protocols and we all approach these cats in the same gear and in the same manner in the same vehicle so they get used to the the sound of that specific engine and they do become tolerant of the vehicles knowing that you're going to behave in a specific way it's become habit for the Rangers to drive in that way and these cats know exactly when how and where we will drive so they don't feel threatened by our presence at all should we all of a sudden just change to a different vehicle altogether it's gonna take the cat some getting used to you now we are not 100% sure of how electric vehicles Mart work Artie I think from a guiding perspective it'll be really nice not to have the noise of the engine and and be able to listen out for alarm calls and that literally help in that regard but it'll still take the animals quite a while to get used to it so any comparison you could make now as if you if you had to if we had to stop on the top of the hill here and drive down towards this female leopard she wouldn't really react you if she was sleeping she probably won't even lift a head but if we drove to the top there if we switched off the car and free-willed down here she almost definitely reacted it [Music] crystalline and Ruben speech went you know how many spots approximately on Olympic I have no idea no not a clue many one to three million RMB saying the tree looks easy enough to climb for a lion to steal its kill definitely yeah definitely and actually not far from here the last one of the about a month ago at least a big what is that a martial Eagle yeah it's in that tree that the piccadilly female was in there and that jacobi so there's a tree behind us jackal berry and one of the last time I saw the pic of any female in this area she was in that jackal be bait or she got chased up that jackal berry tree by a lioness and that tree is a lot more difficult to climb than this one that we can currently see the peak in early female went very high and looked like she was sitting on top of the leaves at one point and the lioness couldn't get all the way up there bet yeah this tree a lion could give me climb and there's some ones made the comment if I could climb this hill pairs are notoriously hard after the epic eight climate there are lots more nimble than you would think I think a hippo try to climb it that's why I painted an angle like this so opinionated saying I looked it up average is 800 to 1200 spots on the lipid thanks opinionated again Ruben asks if back their favorite prey say and in this area lipids kill mostly in parlors which is the type of antelope and they also kill a lot of bush back particularly along the river banks yeah Bush back as their name implies like to live in quite thick bush we talk about thick bush it's thick sort of vegetation which generally grows where there's lots of water along riverbanks and that's perfect stalking and area for a lipid the way I leopard hunts its prey its de stalker right up custard and then to pounce on it when it gets quite close no antelope that live in those kinds of areas would be maybe not favored but more easy for the leopard to catch and if you I recommended a book earlier called Shaitan Krieger and they have all sorts of stats on what leopards catch and feed on and most of those stats actually come here from our data capture here at Mala Mala I'd recommend reading that book appear interested in this kind of stuff Margaret's thinking that I Heena if was really angry would be able to climb that tree with a running jump I'd love to see that I think that I Hina might get to the first fork and then not quite know what to do from there then Erica asking does leopard urine smell like popcorn that's small quite similar tea buttered popcorn no shame here's the / mother water back and let's be hanging around yet obviously the mother of the calf that's hanging in the tree now I think an FPGA it's just behind the tree oh yeah she's behind the tree yeah but she hasn't left this area then 4x Goldy hyenas and wild dogs ever battle ever pray and such you don't hear about it compared to you lion I in a conflict they do indeed it is the water back and I'm just trying to think of the name of the video where a hyena steal the carcass from two wild dogs Jim in the name of the video yeah I think morning good sigh he no skills kill from dogs [Laughter] no YouTube I know YouTube channel is a video that you put up and called hyena steals kill from wild dogs very empty title it's in the ranges and isolation K list yeah ranges in isolation under Mala Mala Game Reserve you teach other channel I can go and have a look there and see some wild ugh I mean injection and functional Nokia asking the name of the Krieger book it's called shaping Kruger and that's Riordan by Mitch Riordan and that photograph on the front cover was taken here at Mala Mala by Gerald hind its interception that exact same so Margaret saying she still hasn't seen the leopard they are incredibly camouflaged and she is lying at the base of the tree and to the left of the trunk she's just got a vector snob and thanks Nadav on it as always he's posted our video there hyena steals kill is the title thank you dare you ask him to show you the lip it is I think it's just done that and busy sketching first yeah Luca Marrero we're trying to show you here to you now she's top-left corner of screen the base the tree there is another animal way in the background that's the watermark so that is the water back say there are two caucuses in the stree and the one is an Impala caucus which is quite easy to see we shredded a Lea and the other is a water back cough caucus and we suspect that this water back that's hanging around this area is the mother of that cough welcome to on the tip from the US of A Idaho then a few Christians here asking how all the lipid can get a female leopard who typically live longer than the male leopard and the reasons for that is with males is a lot of competition for territory and as incumbent males kind of get old with all the past their prime young up-and-coming males will vie for their territory and males can die as a result of those territorial fights or from injuries sustained by them generally males will live to about 1314 years be a most max that females can live up to about 17 she the leopard you're looking at now is my Master's terrible but two thousand thirty six years old so statistics yeah yeah I mean on the tape saying thanks bro love the line vids you are welcome yeah we'll keep them coming then just saying most of my cougar leopard sightings are like this we just see the head yeah you got I think I'm going up in the low Falcon - kruger national park my lifetime and the first real sighting I had a related was here at Mala Mala they are very secretive animals and you don't get to see them all that much and we are renowned here for having relaxed leopards so it's very very grateful to be able to watch the natural behavior on a daily basis which not many people get the opportunity to do and I know out of the ranging team lipids or rank right up there for most of the ranges and you know you do you have to be quite patient watching them but when they do you do things they are incredible especially when they start climbing around trees and yeah credible animals and you never you know you can read as much as you want about lipids in books and they never cease to amaze you to bend or break the rules that you've read about in books so someone was asking earlier if there any animals around here and if you can you can see giraffe and the giraffe in the center of screen they're quite far away from where we are now then wild UAE 37 asking do we see Angela disabled aunt Olivia we are very fortunate that we did get to see sable Internet we see them nicely in winter time we are currently in autumn we haven't seen some since the end of any since the end of last year that we will nice likely see in a few months time they generally walked in from Kruger National Park and come and drink in the Sand River right in front of Rhett Ray's camp actually last year we recorded 39 sightings of sable 4 during the course of 2019 which is a remarkably high number for this area Catherine saying goodbye thanks for watching Catherine getting back to sleep now not sure where you are but thanks for joining us and for staying up to watch the speed does the 1369 asking will the leopard go after the giraffe I think that giraffe is yeah I don't think so drop is a lot bigger than the leopard so there have been cases of male leopards catching young very young giraffes but yes but too much for a female and is it for water back under the torture list it's a busy 1369 asking about cough so pitas just answered that question grab some male lipid Gary's saying lipids are fast but have a much shorter sprint distance than cheetah yes this is true they prefer to stalk and then running on their prey but they they do deathday hunting style I have seen leopards running three heads of impala lambs just very well in Le and very randomly without even bothering to stalk just running up and down I guess hoping one trip support decides not to run and then it wasn't successful and headshot was interesting to watch so the dad saying I wonder if she gets too close what the leopard would do I don't know if she'll risk getting cheapness you know if this if these carcasses have been up here for the last day or two and you know maybe if the calf is still alive she might come and try and chase the leap at all but I'm pretty certain she knows that that cough is dead by now what are bucks can also be quite stubborn creatures have I've seen lions think twice about going off to war back I've actually seen one on one water back chasing away aligned to an adult female water back will probably be stepped bridge too far in John Gilfillan are they Brown hyena in the area no not that we are aware of John there has been one reported sighting many moons ago and it could not be confirmed or verified so no official records in recent history adds but if you go to our YouTube channel and you go and look up the great camera surprised I think it's called the great camera trap surprise or the camera traps surprise and you will see another very rare animal which we didn't did not think we got you nice making some coffee yeah sorry folks if you hear some weird noises coming from behind the camera it's uh it's coffee time out here in the bush and then the fun feelings asking please answer how do you know how old it is so we have data or records of these particularly the lipids and the liens that goes back for more than 40 years now and after every single game drive here at Mala Mala there is a ranger that is on duty and has to fill in the game report book so anything that was seen out in the field gets filled out with all the details and it's an incredible data set that we have and because these cats are say used to the vehicles you know specially when a female leopard has Cubs we see them almost on it almost on a daily basis once they are used to the vehicles just because we know where to look for them because they don't move too far from the again sites and yeah we you know we know these lipids weren't enough to know like for instance this female was found we know when she last mated and then we can't the days it's about three months that a lipid is pregnant for and then we start looking for signs when you see her after three months of whether she is lactating first of all and then where the she has cycle marks and there is video of the first suckle marks that was discovered on this particular lipid the [ __ ] female and for the love of me I can't remember that videos and name yeah I can't remember oh yeah so basically what happens is we'll be seeing a female leopard for awhile we'll see her mate normally if that mating is successful then it's it's almost about three months until she gives birth but so during that time if the mating was successful well slowly especially towards the end of the pregnancy you already start to see her well become more obvious that she is pregnant and then there'll be a distinct difference to seeing her after she's given birth because there'll be lots of suckle marks around her teats and so will then know it's okay we saw her on Monday and she had didn't have suckle marks and we saw her again on Saturday and she didn't have suck amok so somewhere between and she's given birth so in our records we don't have they don't have birthdays but rather birth month so for example this female leopard with worth now we know that she was born in December just towards end of December but we don't give an exact day it's highly unlikely that you'll you'll know the exact day you see this female water buck is starting to come a bit closer here this is a little bit sad actually okay just asking that question how do you control animals from being killed off by other animals well it's quite important for certain animals that other animals be killed now this lipid is far from vegetarian and actually needs to kill other animals to survive so we don't interfere either she goes hungry and her leopard cubs go hungry or they don't but she has to kill in order for them to get nutrients and then just curious are there any children watching this Oh is nice to hear from the chicken the kids are they welcome Christian here when did she catch the baby water pack and the Impala we guessing maybe maybe two days ago and then Gary asking yes he says you understand that but is overkill a problem and if so how do you replenish the breeds so we live in a relatively open system and we live in the greater Kruger National Park which is the size of Belgium so the animals here do kind of the ecosystems maintain their balance just naturally and maybe none in there are natural cycles that do you kill off animals that are becoming overpopulated like we just came out of a drought and very large hippo populations got reduced in number as well as buffalo populations here we go say I'm just going to see there's lots of children here okay mouths and shadow locks just crystalline and ribbon I'm not sure if we're gonna be pronouncing these problem properly yeah van any fan feelin Luca Maria and Christine and Rubens piece and then someone year saying one one line line nine one one one one say I'm three years old ten three today happy birthday I hope that sturdy typing if it is that's pretty incredible and did someone saying they old in happy birthday living Lawrence jr. hello Gareth asleeping the time he started to livestream so he learns and if you're awake now not much has happened yet since then and then 11 saying did you really believe me obviously I did I can't fake it using so you rely on you to be honest aren't we all children I agree does he are to all children that's perfect it's Hendra photography yes thank you and if any of you do you have children and you want to keep busy there's a great initiative okay it's just busy pouring the coffee there for us Pete there's a great initiative by the NiCd which is the National Institute for communicable disease in South Africa and a friend of mine who works there one of the scientists and doctors he is a biologist has started a Facebook page for all the children out there he wants to hear how you think we can kick coronavirus so if you are bored a term and want to make a video or draw a picture or send your idea in please do that you can send it to kids kick coronavirus it's a Facebook page and all the scientists here in South Africa that are doing a brilliant job and are working very hard at the moment are taking inspiration from the youngsters no Mornay and yebin brothers sent Ahmed a email with a picture of a big military jet flying over a town and dropping soap bombs which is a brilliant idea that inspired aqua do you start this Facebook page say if you do have any children if you watch keep them busy maybe that's a suggestion there in our CD is listening to your suggestions Thank You crystalline and Rubens piece for putting up that address Ranger Nick now saying Aussie Aussie G in treat I'll be back Nickelback say ah see G just to get all of you guys in the leaf yeah is it stands for Rams Cricket Ground head Rams is one of the old Rangers houses back in camp and he's obviously looking for some other Rangers to play some courtyard cricket with might endless livestream shortly yeah it's just asking where's the lipid so Lawrence if you see the tree okay I think it's going to do something there that's the tree that is at an angle just to the left of the base of the tree you can just see here ears and a bit of spots we've got the camera at wide angle because if she does move there's a possibility she's gonna climb that tree and we would like to get that in the frame for you or there's a swarm of bees flying overhead then TB saying can you please explain in a simple language what's an opportunistic hunters thanks I think the best way to if we use this as an example so this female leopard has got two kills up in a tree and she's lying down sleeping at the base of it it's quite a warm day so yeah you the last thing you'd expect her to do now is to hunt and she probably won't go out of her way to hunt but if a say for example an Impala was an Impala Ram was being chased by another Impala Ram because they're about to enter or they're entering the rattling seas now there's something is happening at the moment so two impalas chase each other and the one happens to run right past her or close to her she's not gonna let it run past because she's got two kills in the tree and she's got enough food she will use that opportunity and she will kill or she'll try to catch it at least I think and I guess could you explain it say she wasn't so Gareth often doesn't listen to what I say I'm starting to wonder in this business for a long time it's probably seen more leopard behavior and most people on the planet so whatever you say they're just tight agem Javed from Iran sorry peach and then someone asking you Amy Alexandra from Zimbabwe I don't know if you're talking about peach or myself it's a peaches from Zambia and I am South African I'm pretty local I grew up in this area in the low fault but I guess it was an accent related question yeah or maybe a mumbling and then the funny feelings asking when will we have the next live show I'm assuming you're talking about these live streams and unfortunately we can't give you an exact time or date because this is a very large Park and because only ten percent of it has cell phone reception we are filming the scope of the cell phone we have to find animals of in that ten percent arrange to bring you these live streams and we can't predict when where or how you'll find these animals say if you click the bell notification on latest sightings on their YouTube channel you'll get notifications from them or subscribe to any of their social media platforms as well as malam allas social media platforms it's gonna be your best bit if you want to know when we go live and Amy saying okay yes your accent sounded Zimbabwean still not sure he's there yeah how many come on I guess it's mine hey Jacques crusts Proust I think process sounds right hi he JP says one of the x-range Rangers during its motto motto Rangers joining us yeah which parts of the parkour he broadcasting from and Paul we are just outside of the Kruger National Park we are broadcasting from Mala Mala Game Reserve so if he's sitting at skukuza camp if you then will meet skukuza and you're sitting on the dick having lunch looking over the river if you look across the river and there's the skukuza airport and basically north of that is where Mada Mada is so yeah we're not far from squeeza at all luka just asking whether mother water back is she's disappeared we don't know where she is right now that you went before no she's be she's made several appearances during the course of the morning so I'm sure she's gonna come back again soon then Ellison McDonald also asking us can you tell us where in Kruger we are we aren't actually in Krieger we are in the greater Kruger National Park we bought a Kruger National Park we don't have any fences between us and then and they are to our east the sabi sands Game Reserve is to our west and we are wedged between the two and you want to know Road names the closest road to us currently is called Rhino pins and it is one of the areas where white rhinos were reintroduced into the Kruger National Park many years ago it's a born free saying on my last trip to mala mala I enjoyed the in y'all around the main camp it seems there are scarce everywhere else any ideas of numbers in Kruger so I if I'd first like to just go back to being that question that we also depending on what time of year you were at the various camps because so firstly knowledge do like to be around riverine thickets on the edge of rivers mostly but you'll see them a lot more in camp during the drier months so for example now there you will still see one or two Nuala's walking about camp if you had to come here in September you'd probably see about $13 walking through camp I think it also depend on what time of year you at the various camps but also if the other camps you were at were along a river what shocks a CLK cleaver welcome Luca saying you seen a leopard from skukuza dick do you think it's here I darted Luca and it could be one of the lipids from our area but we are quite far north from skukuza right here these lipids have less than a 5 square well 5 by 5 square kilometer and the females are even less than found my father I'd say that's about a male lipid starey size yet which is 25 square kilometers more release but the females are even smaller than that and we are quite far extremely about 20 kilometers upstream from skukuza upstream I'm saying upstream along the sand river Jacques Pross saying wow pizzas working hard to Nancy eighties words he's taking a good job Jacques Jacques I'm just gonna make you jealous here if you this will come into focus yeah enjoy your coffee and kept smiling join mine with the Piccadilly female so Jacques you're hoping that this continues and just don't eat your birthday we're hoping that this continues to the radio so that you can hear what it's saying when you find this and then I'm just trying to see we are missing questions here because they are coming thick and fast and to the Speas family please please answer see breslin's question now I'm just going to try and find where that question is there we go crystalline we'd like to know how many cabs are in a letter and harmony grow up to be adults so in a leopard leopard letter there's usually between one and three caps and I don't know they're the kind of stats on it but very few of those cats actually survived to adulthood I'm just gonna keep a little bit quiet I'll pick an early female it's starting to look a little bit active so actually does start coming up that you're just gonna keep quiet and enjoy it but I don't know if you have a ballpark figure in the meantime of how many lipid Cubs make it to adults it I've caught from the exact percentage of squids it's quite a relatively high mortality rate and this is earlier the one of the the biggest killers of other of leopard cubs is male leopards I mean any thank you for joining us bye-bye we'll see you next time so everyone just asking where we be giving notifications ahead of our next live stream or the extreme ad hoc if you see something interesting born when we can we do try and send our notifications a little bit earlier and okay she's I'm gonna keep quiet for a second okay so she keeps some mock charging us as a mock Charlie she's not like charging at all but it looks like she's wanting to climb the treaty but she's taking her time about it so I'm gonna speak until she looks like yeah he is about to and [Music] does he 1369 asking if there any elephants around they certainly are we can't see any now they're actually much need to start driving scene and in which case I might have to you just put the comments down for a moment or T is Eugene stray dog saying hi peep water only water for Mike so now if you have AC genus net in the Apple blood in fir'aun's you can see there's an Impala caucus in screen now and then if I just pan over difficult to see it from this angle but the water buck is basically back there maybe you might get a better angle a little bit later so you're gonna stay put for not doesn't look like she's getting too far Joshua Paige saying how's it guys we're in the Cougar are you we are at Mala Mala Game Reserve which is pretty much directly north of skukuza Ken outside of cougar but bordering the Kruger National Park and Gabriel Afonso asking can a male leopard take a female lion on it's very unlikely that that would happen a female lion it's still almost twice the size of a male leopard Laurens asking a garret have you seen the white lion in the timber party I'd love to see it I don't know if it's the Wyatt line that you are talking about but I have been lucky enough to see a white lioness and the timber body truly incredible Mike Hickman Mike Eggman's taken the day off usually is our chair streaming with us saying morning everyone mark we've got some coffee ready here it's just a short walk from temp if you can see this lipid is not climbing dead branch yeah absolutely beautiful brandy saying did we say well wow I hope you guys saw that it's really beautiful here he's gonna let us it all down there for a while and then you'll decide whether we want to get a little bit closer or not truly spectacular that's cool yeah Maxie's got coffee in his room thanks for asking then my name is if c'n greetings from turkey matter wife can be niden nozzle sing so that is a Zambian speaking Turkish in the background you can get some monkeys chattering and those are one of the alarm calls that we listen art for see Gary Hills asking for proper updates here baby you only give them a proper official Matamata update as though we were did on the radio well gay okay so sorry folks it's not going to make sense for most of you watching this but bear with us stations there's a female in way and the central parts of rhino pens and she was currently stationary and uh fallen over branch of an apple leaf tree there are beg your pardon there is visual of two kills an Impala the young Impala Rams well there's a young water bike both treed leopard is stationary okay thanks the DA says ingredient fazil welcome and 20 years ago hi enjoying breakfast here in some way Island cheese and coffee perfect rocks asking you the space for a third Jacques to bummers in the tree she's not going to be hunting anytime soon do a loop in Suffern saying please I say keep doing them and do you pretty nice fat before getting that wouldn't want to miss this soft one use of we are trying to go live as often as possible but we are at the net mercy of nature so it's when we find animals within sulfur and range we are filming this off of our cell phone Derek Oxley which caucus is starter and main course I think they're the nade what's a packraft looks to be a little bit smaller than the impalas I'd assume that that's that's the starter should we stay here okay it's tough one so a little bit indecisive as to whether we should get closer to here or remain here and it's because she might climb down that branch as you start moving in climb this tree well that's what I'm thinking I don't know you thinking the same thing Peter and I said if we do go and view there she does decide to climb this tree we are not gonna be in a good position to view it so to explain to you folks the dilemma we have here so I'm just to translate the dilemma we have yes the best view of her now would be if we drove around this tree and parked over there we get a nice head-on shot yeah probably a better light on her but the problem is if we do park there and she decides it's time to come down the tree and then go up this tree where the kill is we won't have enough time to reposition back here where we have the best view of her going up so the question asked we stay here wait for it to come down and climb up this tree or do we go park around there and get a nice close up shot of her from the front but risk losing the shot of her going up the tree okay Hill asking Pete did you check if there are any DN DS before entering right gay unfortunately the whole campus all period of lockdown and there's a few people that are vetting we stay then a few people saying closer we are democracy sir and so you say maybe we can just zoom in on here but I think that phone can handle it okay so you're gonna just try and zoom in on here but it does look like she might move again okay there we go see she is looking she's not looking completely settled and so Peter Marie Boltzmann saying whatever is the best and safest for her that is a good way to make these decisions Pedro but in the same breath neither position would affect her in the slightest I don't know if any of you got here climbing that tree but if you want to take a screenshot and pass it on to your friends share to their friends and let them know that we are live I know you've had our trouble with sending out notifications in advance maybe you guys can help us any reason I'll run to me racnoss because he's sitting in the direct Sun not the Eugene asking when was the kill made by Harry not and represent sure was found this morning but but it's guesstimation and I tend to agree then just because he's been doing this for a lot longer is that it's maybe been a these carcasses or maybe you need been in the street for about two days so normally I mean both these caucuses are rather young animals but bear in mind that this leopard would have spent maybe half the normal amount of time feeding off the carcass then another leopard would have because she has Cubs so she would have had to leave here walk you know a few kilometers away to where her deniz suckle her cubs spend some time with them and then come back again so try take a little bit longer to consume a carcass that would you know in the normal food was just her without Cubs in smog millionaire saying hello from one jungle to another man maybe a concrete jungle London UK but the sun is shining stay safe we'll make sure to share with my friends thank you and we are thinking of all of you that are maybe cooped up in indoors at this point and they everybody that's here currently loves being outdoors and we are thinking everybody that doesn't have the outdoors that we are currently enjoying and we hope that when the lockdown does end you can spend some quality time out there might be as boulders to make a suggestion guys be bald if we didn't actually talk this is the next option I'm thinking instead of us parking here if we went and parked on the other side behind her and watch it from this from that side if she did get down we would still see her go up we might be looking through that log but we definitely still see her go up the tree being the same and we'd be in the shade Pakistan and I think you know folks an idea that is the view of our Mala Mala camp one of three camps on Mulla Mulla Game Reserve beautiful setting overlooking the Sand River and that beautiful acacia toward Tillis that's a beautiful sight right there actually can you sorry cuz we take a photo yeah sorry yeah vex said I mean this is quite cool I'm gonna zoom in a little bit uh near here he just wants to get the shot and the comments are we're not attending to them right now because I'm driving in Peters photographing yeah we will attain to those in a minute what a beautiful cat I'm gonna try and get these comments back here again people come in to yawn ha she's lying sometimes the line positions that doesn't look very comfortable at somehow they always managed to mold the branch they're lying on okay Lu Quebec the view of the Piccadilly female has changed somewhat I'm sure you'll be peace tonight she's out of the grass and lying in a tree teri kasam thank you very much that's that's appreciated so when Spitz done getting his award-winning photographs and I've got a question for Peter but we'll wait a little bit I tell you I'm sorry Teddy's private messaging you there [ __ ] I won't tell you what he said not on live TV at least okay do you get he's gonna take care of it just I got a little bit more when she comes up a little bit further for me that's okay that's it Christians for not jerry asking how many Letson says he had and any success of getting them to depend independence and she's this will be her third litter and unfortunately she has lost the first two in stark contrast to her sister her sisters called the subway a female board in the same litter and she set up her territory further to the north of our position now and she has successfully raised one latin is busy doing so with a second so hopefully will be third time lucky for this female so a few people saying that the quality of the phone is incredible that's good news we can't really see how good the quality is but we do we have had that comment in the past and we glad for your sex in the other in there and then what fern are using yeah it's a huawei I think it's the p20 mate or pro or something like that then an adult giving Pete some advice saying pili must share this on Instagram Nadav unfortunately I'm I've commandeered Pete's phone yay so I'm seeing all these private messages pop up while I'm reading these comments it's quite entertaining and but I'm too scared to multitask on a friend that I'm not familiar with and yeah say maybe we'll upload them later today yeah we'll make a plan so no job has been helping us through this whole process thanks Nadav he's obviously been well he hasn't obviously been agency has been doing this since he was 15 years old he started later citing zinnias 15 and that's an incredible an incredible platform if you want to watch animal behavior I would say that that's probably one of the platforms you should go to first because he's got so many videos of animals up there that people have posted it's cool it's just showing me some of the photos he's taken if I get her one yeah maybe folks can see my Silhouette shot then rien de Apple whenever I'm pronouncing that correctly saying supriya is one beautiful cat cat I've seen her physically in the sands a few times we do you see the Sabrina female quite often she resides on there she comes I'm just gonna get ready to move if need be she's gonna go a little bit higher I think I don't know if she's remembered to do with comfort to a sunlight that she's moving around there she is starting to paint a bit it is starting to get warm so she might just trying to be getting up into the branches where there's a bit of a breeze and perhaps some nice shade and to get away from all the itchy grass yeah and then just to answer your question yeah about to be a female this lipid in screen is the sister of the subway a female and they were both there born into the same litter the kick and lazy females litter he was a very successful leopard here at Mala Mala and we talked about a successful lipid and the keke lazy female raised many leopard cubs to adulthood so she did very well in here Tania wait thanks just maybe we need your commentary see cuz I'm looking on the screen you and Peter's compares this beautifully but can you see the leopard in the tree and I'm not sure of the comments are streaming over that leopard maybe you can just let me know if you can see the leopard if you can't then we'll make it more sensible to the right frame t be asking Thank You TV for that it's very much appreciated that's all asking at the same time what lion pride is dominating the sabi sands and our days I would say the largest pride in the sabi sands is they become bulla pride he spends most of its time here on Mala Mala Game Reserve and they do cross our boundary from time to time and go into the sabi sands from yeah that's from Portugal MSB can go there but hai even Brazil again then Luca saying the comments on the way so we are going to reposition this Peters compares the beautifully as that it's a photograph but we will get the leopard back into screen yeah so the comments got on the left-hand side of the screen Peter it's just working on that and then someone else saying yes can see thanks I think the people that don't have the comments much more and then while you AE 87 saying supriya's father is the airstrip Nell yeah but I believe I believe you're correct yes but this lipids both of them that obviously Mr Blair female and the piccoli female fathered by the airstrip male so maybe you can help your pit off and does he have to feed her cubs we'll get back to you in a moment pizzas just winning some photographic competitions okay trying to always come second yes we do you see the include humans from time to time we've been seeing them more and more often in the last five or six months and they come in from the north of matamata and they spend some of their time around the middle whitey are they that runs all the way into Sand River Rock from our northern boundary all the way into the Sand River here in front of Kemp perhaps yeah I've come as far as this before they say it's saying I don't know if you saw where camp boys camp is just behind us so there's a question asking do these animals come close to camp yes they do you in fact they go right into camp and we have if you look on our Instagram page you'll see lions chasing impalas to camp just the other night and which was caught on the security camera we are going to reposition again so just bear with me for a second we are going to neglect these comments for a bit and then just a question you keep it busy while I move how old does a strip mill when he died if I'm not mistaken he was 10 years old when he died and he was killed by members of the mathy pride I think sub-adults of the Massey pride who were in the process of becoming independence he was always quite brazen in the face of danger and eventually caught up with him but definitely one of the most kind of admired leopards in recent memory are Mala Mala Game Reserve and we are going to get us tastic view just now yeah that's good so folks we're using one of our phones for the comments it's also the fern that my wife with our one-year-old son messages me on so this is quickly going to make sure that I don't have any messages from here edgy one saying goodbye it's just cage you want thanks for training us again okay so shook Ronnie asking please give details on this live stream where is it in the Mara we are not in the Mara we quite far from tomorrow you are bordering the Kruger National Park a game reserve called Mala Mala Game Reserve in South Africa please and like and subscribe to all latest sightings platforms and if you kick their Bell icon on the YouTube channel they'll notify you when you go live it's a tiny Schindler saying I seriously think you guys need me there in the vehicle to save drinks and snacks that's a brilliant idea yeah Gareth Gareth school levels have been found wanting so could happily use a yeah it's coffees a little bit weak [Laughter] I'm coming welcome back saying hi from resting big in a shock saying Taipei I know Mada Mada Mada is quite similar tomorrow they're asking the time yeah it's currently five minutes to 12 it's nearly lunchtime so that snacks are starting to sound like a good plan Sheila's Africa hi auntie Sheila saying thanks for sharing but ruining a great friendships a jealous unless Sheila we are very fortunate to be out here and yeah we're just going to try and bring you guys as much as we can your friendship your friends asking if I've got friends I need family people I don't know if I'm Ryan D Apple I'm not sure for pronouncing your name right did you not see the sticks pride as well the sticks pride have a very long history here at Mara Mara in recent years they've become more nomadic we used to see them it's about a 40 year history yeah 40 year history so it sticks crushing and sticks rocks the area they're named after is pretty much central central fluff field but the center of the whole game reserve amaur amaur central national yeah tiny shouldn't know thanks for draining us leaving now Nicky Marsh saying she'd love to be here stuck in Johannesburg I think when you guys get the chance when this lockdown is over it would be nice for all of you to come and visit all of these game reserves in an around Kruger National Park and elsewhere throughout Africa these users rely very very heavily on tourism to protect these animals why are you sitting at home cooped up indoors maybe you should be looking on the internet and planning your next trip to some of these conservation areas leave it something along the lines of patience pays off gasps yeah he's been here for my clothes on two hours all let's talk about sneaking yes she's actually bringing the caucus Don will be interesting series music really in a good spot a caucus was lying in the Sun and predict predict that she might want to move it Luke are we gonna say goodbye again because UFT going on say finally but I'm sure you'll see you back here again so until then turn you from London you did indeed turn up just in time looks like she's taking it to you nothing ideal area for s just wait yeah for a little while longer and just see what she does for those of you who may be joining us now and seeing her take that kill down the reason Gareth has suggested that we stay here a little bit longer is because that's not the only kill she has in that tree there's also a very young what about calf so we will see now if she comes back for that one as well however don't think that one was being or was in direct sunlight the Impala was and that's why she's moved it then Lawrence junior asking if we've seen mrs. lapping I haven't seen her this morning mrs. lapping is one of our regulars I think Lawrence he said yeah based at Shing wait see it's a beautiful part of the world in pre National Park itself anishka fighters enjoying that and ride a he's missing out sure he's gonna be disappointed then Ryan asking an opinion on lion prides do you think it's nature's way to make space for new pride or pride splits since Marty is down to one she moon way to half and southern pride but Campbell is it's a traumatic split question marking and also beginning that question again just our opinion on lion prides do you think it's nature's way to make space for new prides talking about pride splits not necessarily what happens most the time is when you hear the stories of these mega prides they aren't often make uprights for very long and because of the that insatiable appetites imagine so many adult lives together and Nietzsche consistently killed very big animals too and sustain the pride so the math leap ride that's Ross was down to one now but that was more just what does affect these things sometimes is the power shifts between male coalitions and if the existing Cubs in the pride are old enough to run away and escape then they will even the females will do sir and that will result in a breakaway but that's not kind of out of choice by the lines was more out of necessity and the Khumbu loop rider actually a double breakaway they are a so the the mangani pride so basically it all started with a master pride and what we call the math we pride our neighbors called eat Salalah pride members of that pride split away and formed what we call the mastery break where pride and what they call the mangani pride are the computer pride also known as the unsavoury pride or break away from that break away and with so many lions in this computer pride now the question has been raised will they will the young especially the young females who are growing up now on this in out of the 14 Cubs will they also break away from the pride when they get older I doubt it for now but we time will tell and the demise of a pride of pride is dying up like southern Motley down to one line is I feel pride is acid onto one lioness and they actually used to be a very large pride that held the same territory about ten years ago exactly where the cameras can pull up right areas so I think inadvertently that would help you know ensuring that one pride doesn't remain in an area forever will if the continues if there's a continuous changeover of prides that so there's also you know there's new genes coming into the pool but that also happens I mean we we haven't really had a problem with inbreeding or anything because of the male coalition's coming in every couple of years they bring the new genes with them and if I want to that question probably yeah sounds good the justifier Anna did you get the gist of that then sticks and stones saying hopefully the marquee lioness pride can do it the black damn pride did a few years ago they were down to one line this and other thriving we hope sir the Marquis pride well they become bullet pride on mission very closely related to the Maquis pride and where the Maquis product one pointer and they must've got a long history here on Mala Mala so we do hope so if anybody wants to see the Marquis pride line is in her cap you did post a video just I think it's two videos ago on our youtube channel the mata Mata game is a YouTube channel videos called a spectacular Safari yeah then David McKenzie beat the heat other Charleston male still around McCann they not I actually believed they were they'd rather unfortunately were killed by I think they were electrocuted by a full and over power line if I'm not mistaken I I'm pretty sure they are dead and they had moved further south of off of Mala Mala and I might get the details on how they died wrong but and I know at least one of them is dead and I believe it had something to do with electrocution so her pinion AIDS it a thank you for this he's just filling all the new people in the chat room putting them in on what's happening yes a he says things you missed if you just joined leopards have between 800 and 1000 journey thanks to someone that looked us and looked it up I think it was opinionated that looked at it and they are on rhino Kings Road in Mala Mala that borders the Kruger National Park and they are forming on a huawei phone so that seems those questions seen the most important to have been answered thank you opinionated for that that and we were watching a female leopard you spend most of the first part of the transmission in the grass but the sighting then we came very Escondido and she climbed up this fall another dead branch and then up the tree behind it retrieved an Impala kill brought it down and the sins taken into them thicker scrub back there we were waiting here to see if she would re-emerge because there's a second killer industry to see if she'd get that but it now would appear as though she has settled down inside those shrubs behind the trees here and she's probably feeding off their one caucus and enjoying some of the shade so so David just I see I get a private message from t-nuts back at camp obviously watching hi Yuji net and just charming India as well as David saying it was the - - of the marquee males that were killed by a fallen power lines thank you got the two confused yeah yeah Dave McConnell no that was David Justice David it's quite nice when you use a like a normal name if you can say anything against the opinion in Jacques saying when Charleston male was found at the broken back in Krieger and then went through euthanasia the other one disappeared thanks shocked Jacques was that the one with the hanging canine or was that the other one that was found with the broken back yeah yeah got a look pretty locks come in to be able to answer you that I only wanna do with the phone I'm talking to jockeys put a doc in mid-water saying are we looking at a tree we are indeed and the reason we are looking at this tree and maybe you is because there was a lipid in this tree not so long ago she had stashed two kills in this tree one Impala kill and or caucus and another water back off caucus she has since climb the tree retrieved the Impala carcass that was lying in the Sun and has moved it down into the river or along you've lost view of a Nasser not sure exactly where she went but she climbed on the river bank and we are still parking here because they stole one carcass in the tree and we are hoping she comes back too much sunlight asking where the Lepidus is a few people we are not a hundred percent sure right now the last time we shot we saw her she was walking down the riverbank and behind these trees that are in frame she walked into those two green tickets that you see behind the tree we are staying put here because she might come back and retrieve the second caucus having said that she might not so at some point you might just go and have a look for here and if we don't find her we might just return back to camp and come and have a look for her later this afternoon bye-bye a niche thank you for joining us again so Chris Wilson saying hardly get good enough internet to stream in the middle of a national park in Africa one of our biggest challenges with live streaming currently is the poor coverage we get on the particular property and only about 10% of the property is covered where we can actually live stream and thus we do it on an ad hoc basis so we can't let you know when exactly we will go live the best way is to subscribe to our social media platforms as well as that of latest sightings krieger and click on the bell icons on YouTube to get notified when you go alive yeah so we're gonna be going to go and see if we can get another look of the look at the Piccadilly female and if nothing we're gonna return to camp we will say our proper goodbyes if you do not find it it looks like if she can go down this way I might be able to zoom up zoom into that water back if that's a force funding tiny opening it a little second it's not very clear because of shooting up into the sky but some remains of a young water back up there which she will probably well she will come back for at some stage so Lauren's asking if the mother the water back has lived no she's back here no she is here again keeping an eye on proceedings shame it looks like a very young water back calm so it is obviously very sad but we have to remember that to truly appreciate nature it's best to observe it without any human emotion it's a lot easier said than done okay we're gonna go and have a look see if we can spot then you female again again for those in mr. Dahlia across the river there is our Mala Mala camp to the rights and the sable camp or Mala Mala sable camp to the left you can see these shrubs in front of us here it's quite thick and the Sun is also behind us and we're on the edge of the Sand River so should have gone into the shade of these shrubs which will be also along the bank and which makes it my impossible for us to get an angle on her so I think we're gonna have to end it there okay yeah thanks for joining us again facts it's been terrific having you on board and we are thinking of all of your time and please tune in for our next live stream and please go and have a look at our YouTube channel Thanks yeah I Mala Mala game reserves his name of the YouTube channel same as all other social media platforms I mean we are forming a series called Rangers in isolation which is basically what we're doing now just when there isn't any cellphone signal or mobile network coverage and those we load up as episodes on to that series so please like and subscribe and tell your friends I hope you enjoyed this livestream and until the next song so the next one yeah and the deaf thanks for your help again just makes a skewed see you awake this time
