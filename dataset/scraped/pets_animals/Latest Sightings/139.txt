FEX welcome to Malta Malta game reserve we are here with the female cheetah and a cab Center up screen yeah but we can be there right Tanya bread and welcome Idris nazarov welcome Emma Diedrichs everyday welcome so we are in the eastern parts of Malta Malta Game Reserve today and we got reports of this female cheetah and her cab we think the cab is somewhere between maybe three and five months old we saw this come for the first time but a week ago if you listen carefully you can actually hear female purring like a house cat so just welcome to julienne Yves let's Alberto food ninja 96 mister punishes 77 leonidas Cynthia he'll match yellow and blue lake Oh an itch welcome I believe this is the first time you've had a cheetah on our live streams and that's a good day when it's a cheetah and cab welcome to Jude's Jay Chris BG Rob Snowden in it Lane Mohammed kemiya tophi Betty on it thanks relay the fan does work well welcome to pillow Howard who Mara welcome back you're under Percy does he 1369 welcome guys these does he 1369 just asking do these kitties have names and no they don't have names cheetah generally passed through Mala Mala as opposed to stay on it for any permanent amount of time they're not as territorial as lipids or lions and their home ranges are way way bigger than the lipids or Alliance territory would be so we see them from time to time we saw this cheetah in the northern part of the reserve just a few days ago maybe a week ago now and there are nah on the central part of the reserve they went east into Kruger and they've just come back waste from Korea sod em our hands welcome I bet I can so I'm just gonna zoom in a little bit so you can see that cab nursing how's that looking [ __ ] so Cynthia asking how many simply asking how many Cubs since if it's just one cup here there would have been more earlier on cheetahs can give birth to up to eight Cubs in certain areas so she probably guessing probably had between three and five as an average it's quite a high mortality rate in this area the biggest killer of cheetahs is lions if she might have lost a couple to lions yeah we've been seeing these two over the last three four days and we've only seen the mother with this one so mr. Punisher 77 how did I get through the fences or do the game parks not have fences between each other there are no fences on any of our boundaries here at Matamata Game Reserve to our East is the Kruger National Park and to our West is the sabi sands Game Reserve and the Saudi Game Reserve but quite interestingly in areas where there are fences cheetahs leopards and wild dogs in particular seem to find it quite easy to get through a fence so although yeah she probably has hasn't been encountered the fence here if she were to encounter one she won't be able to navigate her way through it and actually prefer spending time outside of the expenses because things like lions wouldn't be able to come and catch them outside of the fences spend I guess less time out of the these conservation areas then cheetahs and wild dogs or later stiphu kidney in fact I think South Africa's healthiest cheetah population is along our northern boundary with lots of a farming area where there are lots of fences and it doesn't seem to restrain them too much it's a pillar how it asking sadly lions eat them they kill them more than eat them yes it would be the difference between would be predation and competitions or predation is when an animal kills not the animal to eat it and competition is when they're killing it to eliminate it as a competitor for their food source so lions and cheat or both go after the same food in terms of impala and smaller antelope and well a coalition of male cheetahs can actually take down bigger prey like wildebeest zebra ostrich but yeah so they go after the same food source of lions will kill them to eliminate competition they weren't they weren't eat them they might take a bite or two but they won't kill them for sustenance Tonya Braden asking are we going to keep doing live streams after the lockdown ends Tanya we guarantee we'll have to wait and see and it'll be a little bit more difficult to do live streams and there are guests driving around yeah but perhaps you will will try and iron out those details when the time comes but it won't be anytime soon mara my it's asking are there any lions around or near them right now we don't know about two three days ago we did see the 4-ways pride a few kilometres north of here but that pride could move very far off in a couple of days or even closer we don't know that's about two days ago they come Buddha pride weren't far from here but she has placed us off in the middle of this big open area and you can't see it on screen now but it'll be where she is now it'll be quite easy for her to see if something tried to sneak up on her Cindy Thomas hello from Alberta Canada I'm enjoying the live streaming and uploaded videos thank you Thank You Cindy we appreciate your support and then just at some point we will show you he's in the vehicle and everyday you're asking is there pit's is commenting as well as myself Gareth and then Dan is the Becker he's being quiet that's father if you have a camera clicking that's Dan busy taking photos and we will make a nip set on this cheetah in cab as well for our Mala Mala youtube channel said asking if cheetahs can climb trees for safety like like leopards rather that's not really their so wear a leopard can fully retract its claws like your domestic house cap and the cheetah could only semi retractors close so they they can't climb up trees although you might steal photos of them standing on trees which have kind of fallen over slightly so if it's at an angle they can scamper up it but they they can't ascend that they can't ascend up a tree that's kind of going straight out of the ground Jacques Priest welcome asking where are they yes Jacques you have to guess and then also gonna come in for Dan there and Andrews stinking son yes Andrew we are alive I think that comment will talk to that mr. Jonas yes we saw the marquee lioness and her cub also knows it's a Lala right we saw them day before yesterday near Campbell copies we'll be posting a video of that soon on Mala Mala game reserves youtube channel you know our ranges and isolation series into pillow Howard strength to these live streaming we really wish and hope that it grows from here forth likewise to Pillar thank you for your support and shame eluate that's a pretty good sixth sense you have there to work out for you today and Rhyno this is not a leopard this is a female cheetah with her cub the main differences if you look there is that the cheetah you can see he's got those two black stripes running down from both eyes and she has spots as opposed to the rosettes that the leopard has also leopard cubs don't have that what's called the mantle that kind of longer hair running down the back well running down the spine of it well from the top of the head to the on the back of that cub and the theory is that that kind of longer whiter hair makes it almost look like a honey badger and honey badgers are quite formidable creatures out here and they've brother kind of quite deserved reputation of being ferocious and a leopard or a lion would think twice about attacking a honey badger so if the cheetah cub resembles the honey badger that the theory is that it might deter predators also if they do get up and move soon you'll see that cheetah walking through this dead grass it blends in very well with that highlights so some of the questions are about how all the cheetahs some of the Rangers have said 3 months and some others have said five months so maybe you should settle on four months but we don't know the exact edge so you can see there the cub is still drinking milk from its mother so cheetahs will typically wean their youngsters between four to six months so it's definitely still younger than six months yeah well we're guessing at about four five cerflan mom chronicles welcome from South Florida okay so just gonna keep quiet and if you can hear that I'm pairing they're just like a house cat word it's the only one of the large cats that actually Pitt is like that sharp price you can see if I'll be out of model model for quite a while but if those guesses are wrong keep trying I suppose it's not really fair without a bigger will zoom out in a bit to give you an idea of the terrain that we're in then PST the six the cat this morning just a question they work on whether it's male or female yeah we I can say I think with about eighty to ninety percent certainty that it looks like a female Jacque saying gray horrible calling must be Eastern flackville cheating scheme that matters to say that is Easter Easter flock healed shame milord saying Clarendon that's way this cheetah and Cup were first found but we are indeed in eastern flock filled some of the ranges yeah we just waiting for more some accurate guess as to where we are but we are in eastern flock field which is quite a lot further south than canon then Andrew sing consider asking where are we thank you meaning the greatest scheme of things we are at Mala Mala Game Reserve which borders the Kruger National Park we are waged between the sabi sands Game Reserve and the Kruger National Park if you've ever been to Kruger or know anything about Kruger you would know skukuza camp which is the main camp in Kruger National Park and we are pretty much directly north of squeeza camp that's the southern parts of Mala Mala you can see a little bit about leopard is this a lipid earlier see there's black chair marks on the front of the face lipids do not have that and it's cheetahs tend to hunt during the day not only during the day but hunting during the day also helps them avoid some of the other predators that raised up gene the heat to the day so there's black tear marks help take the glare off of this very white cross you can see in the black background some sportsmen I say use those black marks that they put under the eyes seen cricketers do it as well as football players so John a short hello back so if I was John I was short is just commented their donor support of myself are the only known ranges in the recent history of Mala Mala to witness to cheetah mating I've been cleared an open area remember that joiner it's a nice side profile I can see how small her head is and particularly the muzzle and the jaws really slim the cat not close to his powerful as a lipid or lion that she stands about as tall as a leopard she's a lot more fragile not as stuck Leo powerfully-built Jeffrey one of the important things we important uses of a tail the young can learn by play get the coordination skills good and see the youngster playing with mom's tail there you had two skills I'm shame asking at what age will these will that cub lose its mantle I think it varies a bit Chaim but I think anytime now I think so he's starting to get a bit shorter than what it was about a month ago but say around four and a half months Jacque asking what was the temperature yesterday and fair not gonna give that tedious I think there's about nine nice today but this morning was this about seven degrees actually yesterday early in the morning there was some guys are out on an anti-poaching Patrol and there was frost on these seats covering these seats while they're up there so it's very cool oops asking what's the cheetahs name pups we dint give cheetahs names yeah because they don't stay on the property long enough for the press to name them I've got a very large home range and in parts of the Serengeti we it's a bit more open in there my fun in the migration that home range can be up to 800 square kilometres shorts but smaller here but it's a little way bigger than you know so you have their boundaries within the modern model of Game Reserve and contrary to most of the other big cats teachers the females will tend to occupy much larger territories than the males and they also they also live more of a solitary lifestyle Annie okay let's try this again okay so it looks like you're back live again sorry about that gets it back to some of these questions in just a moment this is a very good quality being here right now it's pretty amazing interaction there between the mother and cub bound to carry on just now and the quantity in frame is behind us is Ranger Dan filming with quite a quite a nice lens so this footage that you're seeing now we're actually going to make an episode out of and put it on our YouTube channel so be on the lookout for that with some high-definition close-up video of that mother and cub playing there and that's the Mala Mala Game Reserve YouTube channel so bunny Cornish Bowden ask him what will the cheetah do with her cub when she hunts so bunny they at the age now where this cheetah sure will follow her mom when she walks around if the mother does come across pray that she intends to hunt she will tell the cub owner or she'll tell the cub to stay is probably in the some long grass or in a little thicket and it will kind of watch from a distance the mother will hunt and she kills it she'll call the cabinet will come out here and then just high tea grace and Sophie always enjoy knowing that we have some children watching if she's having a look around but she was lying on this team at man that you see in the foreground slightly elevated and out of the grass but the edge the the shade is moving as the Sun moves and the edge of the shade has just reached at Tim at Martin Astor than air she's just having a look around for prey or if it's the shade that's moving that's made to get up it's very alert Mike Hickman okay okay just get you like say if we move with these cheaters now I can get a better idea for the landscape when recording in quite an open plain it's er that cab disappears in the long grass there's also a good chance that our signal might be affected so bear with us if it does start buffering we will keep on following them and hopefully get into better signal areas yeah that's I think that's it as kind of getting yes so you will try and follow them but yeah please bear with us if we do drop signal you have deep bula are saying why do these animals ignore Safari vehicles sometimes these cheetahs aren't as relaxed with the Safari vehicles at least in this area as the leopards are just because you don't see them as often as the leopard and so it's lovely to have such a relaxed mother and a cub you guys come right up to them but generally in this area the animals are very used to the vehicles yes sir we might not answer comments as we drive that's just because in each concentrate on where these animals are try and keep them in frame for you it looks like they found another shady spot yeah so you're just gonna loop around here quick it's gonna give you a quick idea of the landscape yet and then get a sitter I'm struggling [Music] [Music] alright jr. you know welcome back break isn't feedin we also broadcasting on our YouTube channel and that's we are reading the comments from yeah hey Russ saying you mrs. s miss you too you're missing out yeah a little bit need to get back here soon see these guys Gerald Windham saying it's 5:00 a.m. where i am no grits that's good larnice genius anger but into the krueger gate the cause here a lot I'd imagine after this lockdown paid now that the gates are open from Australia Mary welcome to this Facebook page those of you joining us now we are currently with a female cheetah and her cub we guest us around for months all the female commonly in the and eastern parts of the central stretch of mother mother Game Reserve or during the Kruger National Park then hi to Bruce sitting with the rest does saying he's gonna put this on the background because he has to study a bit good luck the dev right to Mammoth a two-hour exam on Friday through the twin twelve we're saying please keep them there for another day Bree said fair I think that's the third time we view these cups twice in Canon or the saddle she turned cab and then non Eastern flock feel happy they'll hang around to get back Adam URI clucks welcome back I've been pronouncing your name correctly pretty certain I'm not Sam site from Uganda welcome and in Maria fan Vake or fundin bad so sorry not be able to visit South Africa the summer greetings from the Netherlands the other London nice accent there Thank You Simon hack making the comment too bad the cab doesn't have any siblings to play with this is true but at the same time it's probably a bit easier for mum to raise one cab than it might be three or four week old meter hello from New Zealand welcome so on our Facebook page Stephanie from Germany Michelle from Portugal welcome to our feet waxed and talked with is he asking if there any cheaters other cheaters test by and not that we know of but there may possibly be but we we haven't seen any close to these two this morning about week ago we watched three young cheated move through this exact same area pretty much following the exact same path that this email on her cupboard walked this morning so why do you think they would evoke that same part very because this connection of open areas that runs from the kruger national park through Mala Mala towards the Sand River yeah and Lawrence in the park face animal Caesars Impala send one in part of the spider yeah chase them this way all right so I think you need to find some cheetah of your own of you in the park now so some in just the male siblings will often stick with each other and form coalition's afterwards when they do to get become independent and they mother's chasing away often brothers and sisters will stay together for an extended period of time but eventually they will part ways and Becky yes they can have up to 8 but in this area I think the average is between 3 to 5 welcomes Stuart Henry from a very cold Albertan I imagine it's very cold up in the high felt there it's even cold here in the low fall too it should be warm in Murray F and vague asking Krueger is now open for residents of the province the park is in that's correct and I need for day trips and truck eddie asking if this is first letter of she's had others we're not quite sure trucker but I'd guess that she's had others before she's not a very young female and then someone writing here in Arabic sir I can't read Arabic but just to answer your question it's not a silly question how can I make the strip arrangements say an a and yeah if you'd giggle mala mala game reserve you can I think even on later sightings you can maybe book through them but there's numerous agents that you can book through most agents doing there that's deal with South Africa do you know I've met Malta Molly cameras it or you can book directly with the Malta Malta three they website at mal Malcolm and Ozma said we're using a cell phone so yeah very low-tech but it's does the job here and the zet no it's five to five to eight cups in a litter so at one time and the pedo Howard saying she looks hungry it's better so with cheetah I mean she probably she's not starving she's also not full but remember cheetahs are built to be more streamlined built for speed so they do often appear to be you might think she looks quite skinny but that's just the deadbolt that's a she's kind of normal at the moment she's not particularly hungry but she's also not well-fed when I do kill something because they eat so quickly in the fear that might get stolen by another predator it was quite funny to see how quickly their tummies bulge out because they really do gorge themselves and they look awkward like a funny ball [Music] and shine we do not know but we'd assume so and we'd guess that I think it's pretty safe guess that she did have more and then that they did not make it I've got very high mortality rates very few cheetah cubs actually survive to adulthood [Music] this is not in the game thank you very much the boundaries for humans and these animals move freely between them she doesn't know that she's on the model and the krieger in tracker ID of all of the big cats D cheetahs have the highest capital t reg would think so yes then what is the weather the temperature and this morning was very cold was 7 degrees Celsius it's probably cold air when it was dark settle right now it's nice in the Sun but and its toll I'd say maybe around 20 degree mark there and they're about Celsius isn't this thing I don't know how to change that super jet amount so yeah anything will do thank you very much if you want to make it listen we don't know you gonna make it more than either way we just no sir thank you in capella just converting that for us seven degrees is forty four point six degrees Fahrenheit stock boost then Robin he was out early this morning saying it was definitely colder than seven degrees so not sure I said water for them to drink would be not actually too far from where we are for the real body of water we have a few quite a few tributaries that run into the Sand River and little drainage systems that go into those cherry trees so not too far from where we are there will be some water in one of these dry riverbeds that still has seeped up from the ground the Sand River would be the closest body of water of any significance and that is sort of a couple of kilometers from where we are now so does that asking at what age the mom will introduce a cup to meet so there's that generally the cup will be weaned between four and six months and at the same time the cup will start getting introduced to me it's actually quite funny to see the first caucus a cup goes up too because it'll normally it'll be scared it'll run away from it and only after a bit of coaxing from the mother will eventually kind of get the courage to get closer to this alien thing Laurens asking how long are we going to live between today Larry it's not sure we're just gonna play it back yeah and if you can hear a nice but windy but you might hear that cheetah is pairing now is the cab yeah I sort of capital often / while they are cycling from their mother I think the Cubs enjoying it a lot more than the mother yeah you think about that Ben as you can see in screen the top half of the mother is in the Sun as the Sun climbs higher into the sky the shade that she's in dodge and get less and this is a good chance you'll get up and move again soon [Music] absolutely folks some facts about cheetahs so they are classified as vulnerable and the endangered species list and they are found in 23 African countries as well as one Asian country when everyone can guess which Asian country cheetahs can be found in in that country there are fewer than 50 individuals whereas in Africa just over 7,000 cheetahs left in the wild welcome to Arjuna in just saying hi Gareth and Peter the fact that you're alive streaming means that the cheetahs have come close to man camp because they don't are not normally in Clarendon here in the northeastern Matamata we we are actually good yes it is a good case and but it's funny this little piece in the eastern part of my mother probably about the same kind of line of let's see maybe a bit soft of Maine Kemp has some signal although it is quite patchy so we are quite far from Kemp we are on the eastern boundary with a Kruger National Park but we found ourselves a pocket of signal here cheetah looks actually Mouse notice something Shaima what's saying Israel is it Israel Iran India Iran yes correct it's Becky and RMB so all those who guessed India it's a pretty good guess so in India so India has all the big five they've got lion leopard rider Buffalo and elephants cheetah used to be in India they went extinct extinct in India another I think there's a program now to try and reintroduce cheetah into India the only wild cheetahs outside of Africa or in Iran to the best of my knowledge sheriff at sir McCarthy saying that as well anticipated I see she's Abner more than Peter teachers often mentioned earlier because they're quite low on the predator hierarchy they're often on the lookout for danger but she also hunts during the day so she also want to look out food so any so I'm not sure if she noticed a threat or potential food but whatever she had thought she'd seen I think she think was maybe a false alarm collect would feel saying what bit is that can it's a little bit difficult for us to tell we do get asked this question quite frequently that's the time that it takes while we are forming well while we streaming this and is about a 30 or 40 second lag would delay for us to see these comments and for you to see the pictures and we're not quite sure when people asked us which bid it was that was calling at the time quite a few birds calling at any one time but if you referring to the one that's making like a tech tech tech tech tech tech tech that is a southern yellow-billed hornball she just lying deeper in the shed a day then keep local asking is there any prayer not that we can see that doesn't mean that there is no pray around here she's gonna reposition quick and there's quite a few drainage lines basically see these trees the lowest sort of belly like areas in this area and they might be prey species in there it's difficult to see in there from here Sydney napur a species out in the open and then actually just really started to get quite warm now a little bit sudden so I think a lot of the animals will be finding but looking directly into Sonya unfortunately the way that shade with Shelly long thing it's very dry here with that and yesterday we have just entered winter there's also our dry season typically the rains will stop in about April and we start again in November winter that was typically only lasts for two months between June and July and August that starts getting warmer again but the temperature was very cold this morning but it's very pleasant now it's gonna be about very about 20 degrees now Celsius yeah feels but warm in the Sun keep local asking how far away are they and we approach on foot to keep local we are currently about five meters away from them the thing with the walking safaris and approaching animals on foot is that ideally you want to approach them view them and leave without the animals knowing that you even there so we don't on walking safaris you wouldn't get very close to them for that reason a lot of these animals are very afraid of humans on foot and really enjoy us being around one foot all that much they have gotten used to the vehicles being around them however welcome kg1 hey so mr. Jonah saying if you're on foot they would not be there and for centuries seeing this upright figure walks around on two things the human form as public enemy number one they would tend to run away which is why on a water Safari you try to use them without them knowing that you were there that's what good reason that's cheese have changed very much in the last towards animals in the last 50 years it wants a lot of these predators just about all of them were treated as vermin and now many of them are protected that's bring a [ __ ] over there I'm be asking is she using the shade to keep cool or Kenneth's camouflage probably more to keep cool and just forgive us I see we are battering a bit yeah and the signal is changed from very strong to be prayer in a matter of 50 or so meters g5t you asking anyway Don has then at the lipid don't think I then it comes on top property unfortunately no and just but windy not a nephew had picked a and so I'm just gonna repeat what he said there so we are along the companion of a class it's in the kruger national park boundary and north of the window thank say unfortunately our signal is dropping and I think we are going to call it a day for now and just want to thank you all for joining us this morning we're very happy that we can bring you this live stream of a cheater and Cabot special to be here at any rate and it's extra special that we are able to share this with you all right so just in saying goodbye like to show you he's on the vehicle shakes so the Cap'n revoir Gina is where that tree line is and then yes people thank you for watching folks nice day and then Dan who's been filming in the background other folks and then from myself Gareth thank you so much for joining us and we look forward to bringing a live stream again shortly yeah that that's wrong
