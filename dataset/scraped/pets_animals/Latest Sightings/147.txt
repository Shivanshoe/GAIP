yeah okay afternoon folks welcome to Mala Mala Game Reserve we are streaming the cam boola pride live from Al Motta Game Reserve you guys see there's a lot of you guys that are joining the chat room welcome back from us me my Gabriel is sick glass dream and I from Singapore young before see so we're gonna get the camera steady in just a moment I just want to show you the position as well as he's with us today and in frame are probably the majority of the Campbell approach there are some more to lift over here and just to give you some perspective we are in the Sand River very close by to the Sand River which is behind us here to our West and with us today driving tab ihsani wa too lazy otherwise known as Tubbs and then Mike's already on the comments as per usual afternoon welcome everyone again I'm gonna hand over the phone to Mike so you can get it nice and stable for us Yanam Bhangra this is mob this Saturday afternoon without alcohol I'm glad we're a solid substitute day fiddling with the camera some hellos from Zambia Bradford in the UK never from England hello giraffe girl and miss Lapwing welcome back and Tanzania safaris as well welcome back and hello from Devon misses Lapwing so in South Africa during the lockdown is no alcohol at all allowed so we've been a dry country now for eight weeks eight weeks we're all very impressed with ourselves and a little bit disappointed at the same time from San Diego welcome Eve McCaffrey welcome back all right like so for everyone that is just joining us so we with the Khumbu Laprade the bulk of the youngsters are the Prada what you can see in the shot there then the adult some of them are just lying in the deep shade behind them and then some of the other adults and one of the gari males is off to the left of screen and it's again hard to see them they're lying in the shade of a little bush but are we were on the bank of the Sand River here so we found them today not too far from the river and then through the day they walked down one of our film crews followed them down to the river and they spent the day here after having a drink so we hoping that they get up and do something exciting otherwise something comes down to drink just with where they're lying on the riverbank anything approaching or were to actually can't see them so they would be quite lucky if some and Paulo as their bridge or off perhaps came walking down but we are vehicle is parked we actually right on the water's edge if Gareth were to lean back a little bit I'd probably get wet this ESPE Hansel saying cute in their sleep glad you think so because they might be sleeping for a while Myra asking which is the biggest Pradhan Mala Mala so this is probably it has 20 of them then after them is probably the coma project I think so yeah no I'm not yeah Howard 7ko Homer Pradas may be the next biggest then probably the Torchwood pride I think there's 14 of them and then the next biggest pride after that they're become cooler who whom Torchwood no it's always a stick spread you know maybe the four is pride if they around and then the sticks prod would be my guess mrs. lapping asking do we see where the northern Africa from the other day wind and he pretty much walked northwards along the Milwaukee River and we didn't see him crossing our boundary but when we left him he was literally on the actual boundary itself just after the feed ended when we were leaving he was kind of moving around he rode once more and then just went back to sleep but we didn't see any sign of him the next day in that area this be Hansel so there are quite a lot of elephants it's quite possible we'll actually see some way we ours one of the more popular river crossings for the animals and on our way here we did pass a head of elephants that's five six hundred meters away from us and so they might come wandering through at some point yes and mrs. lapping Zhang pourcel Allah surrounded by two enormous prides yeah she's not really in the greatest position and we still haven't seen her they think you on the feed with us when we the cab was found but this evening well Peters currently busy uploading the our YouTube video of what exactly happened they win this product Kampala prod attacked her on the riverbank but yeah we've seen some tracks in the general area and we've seen the cab in that area it's just her that we've not seen yet but I'm guessing she's just lying up in the shed somewhere trying to heal up tied our manatee asking do the older Lions get shade because they are the seniors that's probably a factor but also I think they also just a little bit wiser and just as we arrived just before we started the stream one of the lionesses was lying out in the open sort of halfway between us and the Cubs is kind of why we stopped where we are but she did get up and move into the Sun but I'm inside into the shade I'm surprised at how exposed there are where they are lying the it's little fairly hot yeah Neri asking how can you tell one part from the other so for me with the lionesses in particular it's actually very difficult if we just come across a lioness on the road to know which lion which pride she belongs to can be very tough unless I'm very obvious scarring or something like that but one of the bigger clues is just where they are you know each of these lines is fairly well defined territories and they don't often stray out of the their territories and oh they'll just be on the edges if anything and then with the male lions it's a lot easier the Mane's and a lot of these scars are much more distinctive the these Kampala lionesses they are particularly big lions so you can almost just tell from looking at them that it's a gamble a lioness so they're all about seven years old now we've got a very good idea of what they look like a seven year old line as opposed to a 15 year old line so we had kind of know as well just the general edge Jerrica asking about the Hmong gained pride we don't really see them here I can't think the last time I actually saw them I want to say it might have been three four maybe more years ago and this isn't really they how old are the oldest of adults on the cam bullet prod just past two years perhaps Thank You Neary it's much appreciated and good morning as well to our afternoon Verona if that's how you said apologies if it's wrong so the favorite food of these lions I would say in the past was Buffalo but we don't get that many Buffalo here mainly because the Lions ate them all but things like probably on the top of their menu or the most consumed anyway is Impala but I've we're with Impala and zebra and woolly bear some that they kind of get up and just start moving and hunt whatever they come across we're with Buffalo they seem to actually go out of their way if they hear or smell Buffalo in the general area they'll get up and kind of dedicate and hit their way with the other antelope but just that happen to come across them I did read ages ago an interesting study they did in East Africa where they put out a big leg or haunch of a zebra and a haunch of the Livius meat side by side for a number of the lion prides to see which one they preferred between zebra and wildebeest and it seems there went for the volu beers first not sure it was a most scientific study it's a fix I just want to point this out cookies wobbling around a bit but here's a monitor lizard he was walking in the direction of those lions he's decided to turn around just to show you something that's a little bit more weight than the lines currently back to the sleeping lines okay so this well I've got the camera off of the bar I'll just show you the other lines are there's some lying in the reeds over there and then back to the pile we've been looking at and there's one he's hit up over there and chihiro was asking about elephants there's an elephant behind us to their right and then a giraffe sure can I see that you're often here um let me try and zoom in a bit you can just see that your ass here there it's quite light against the dark background it's walking through the reeds there so just to give you some perspective on where we are there's a film crew there and that is I say beam on Mala Mala recently filming and they're just watching the elephant right now okay so from one alright so actually just off the comments here for a second starlings welcome back as well and so how old the oldest comes to you and they have their first litter so usually it's probably five or just a little less than five and so they a lot of these animals and you're reading up about them you'll see figure that's is sort of sexually mature versus when they're so they're it's actually a lot of their behavior so just like dogs and cats at home and that they will be able and capable of mating and reproducing at a young age but in the wild it's normally at about five years old that they truly capable of looking after themselves so you see it's a similar thing with the leopards at the moment we have the clock Rock female and the Capon female lipids who are around on Mala Mala at the moment and are sort of establishing territories but we don't expect them to have Cubs anytime soon or probably any closer to five so for the campaign female that might be sometime next year or towards the end of next year that we have expected to have a first litter and the plot rock female was two years old so so a while for her but we are interested with this prod they can bulla prod they're quite a big Pradhan it's not really a sustainable product because there's so many so what might happen is I split into smaller groups so dizzy 1369 welcome back I don't think it is the same elephants this some younger elephant bulls it was a big herd that was with these lions other day but yeah we actually have a lot of elephants around no the one year when we are doing the helicopter counts we counted 500 elephants on the property and the year before that I think it was 650 but that was unusually high numbers because of the drop but there's a substantial amount of of elephants around giraffe go so a giraffe do lions attack Rana is awesome Megan Lockhart I have known not here but when I worked in Zealand one of the lion prides they did attack the Ranas Cubs you worked at Panda did the Lions catch on is there when you were there yeah when I worked there they caught three but yeah so it's they capable of it it's just not part of their normal prey the same as elephants or so few people asking about the Lions hunting elephants it's really not something that they are used to hunting the Lions are cut capable of it if needs be but I think these elephants are quite safe they vary a little bit outside of the size range of what the Lions could realistically catch 80s gem that's quite an interesting question what happens if I split into smaller groups so they're still friendly to each other will become rivals so what can happen with some of the very big prods is that they almost they live in the same pride territory so you're just gonna move the camera one of the lionesses is moving about with one of the males and they're a little bit too close for us to zoom out so effects I'm just gonna track there we go so you can actually see now just how close the Lions are to us and I think she saw this nice shady patch and where she's looking is down towards that other vehicle and you can see just over the top perhaps of the vehicle close to the elephants is the giraffe's head sticking out there's two little white pixels there so that's not impossible can just see the giraffe moving across there from from right to left in place and Claire asking how the youngest cats doing and I haven't seen them today Mikey did you see the media I actually don't remember seeing them this morning I'm assuming that you're asking that because you might have watched a YouTube video didn't struggle to get much of a kill but I'm pretty sure they're okay and then someone asking Mack they seem that there's a young runners and adult rhinos that there's lions are killing so one had actually been was an adult but it had been injured in a fact with another honor then others the one was about five years old and then the one Rana actually the Lions had killed a Valle de beast we didn't see it happen but the Lions had killed a Valle de beers and it looks like the Rana just blended right into them so I forgive the camera being a little shaky I just want to show you that you're off now that it's out in the open you can see kind of where the Lions are looking and the giraffe is just coming into view down there do you see the giraffe now all safety walking this way so there you can see the giraffe rod and the sort of top corner of the screen one of the youngsters and one other youngsters taking note of it so unfortunately just with where these lions are they're right in the open I don't think they'll be able to sneak up on the giraffe so there's a question here from feeder dream alley have you ever seen line killer leap okay we're just gonna let these two do their thing it's gonna kill two birds with one stone here someone asking who the smell is it's one of the gauri males and he's currently or you was part of a coalition of five male lands he had four brothers and it's currently him and his brother that are the remaining male lions in this territory the other three died but when they're dead come and claim this territory they did kill just about all the territorial leopards were some of the territorial lipids along this section of river then everything the southern america and then they try to stop the sovereign alright okay did anybody see that someone's asking has anybody seen a lion killer lipid we didn't see it happen but we when we found it or found the dead leopards there were Lion tracks all over it all over the place around it as well with the one leopard that tree how small it was really brutal because you could see where he had tried to climb up a tree and the male lions had actually grabbed him and pulled him down and you could see in the bark of the tree way the claws of the leopard had ripped through the bark as he was being pulled out so you could see this huge gouges going down the tree but it was quite a difficult thing to see the next day because it's also the traps now was a big favorite for a lot of the Rangers here welcome back Mia Ferrara's saying you missed the last live feed glad to see you in this one I'll even waive and rain Raven yell afternoon so I'm just gonna talk the camera around again so the giraffe is kind of right behind all the Lions there just walking up the road and then someone's asking your account that you're off Saints the Lions nearby it is quite a warm day so it's unlikely that vector off can smell the Lions that I never had seen the Lions at time don't think it's noticed them lying in the open but because it's such a warm day the smell is probably floating quite high up into the air relatively quickly and not drifting down twits towards where that giraffe was I was hoping for a bit more exciting assignment with the Lions and they're off there Jonathan asking the Lions kill lipids to eat them it's not so much to eat them but more because they a lipid I felt it should a lipid come across lion cubs it'll certainly kill the lion caps and should a lion come across leopard cubs or certainly kill the leopard cubs and and they do compete for the same resources so it's not so much that they want to actually eat the leopard but rather that they're taking out the competition just a wittle an awesome driver welcome inside Juna in hi - Gareth and Mack from Canberra Australia hi Gina there was an aircraft there yeah Nick is behind us in the vehicle be honest with external film crew and he is telling us that you were a ranger yourself or Gina in Sri Lanka I believe and that she studied leopards so it's always a pleasure to have you with us I'm sure you find this stuff very interesting in starlings asking the giraffes have bad eyesight on the contrary the eyesight is pretty good and usually when they see predators they stop and stare and we noticed that you're off stop and stare at any point at these lines and you may have listed all together for those of you watching at home and you're so welcome to take some screenshots and like and share them and so we also again there's one of the little guys has just poked his head up kind of in the middle of that pile of lions and he looking smartly it's just standing up now place and care to answer your question yes one of the youngsters looking a little bit skinny but they always have they have to compete against these sub adults who are twice their age and I reckon should these youngsters make it to adulthood they're gonna be pretty tough Camile Tirana the Lions have good Asajj they do indeed so with a lot of the animals things like the ice out of the lion it's more keyed for lack so that allows them to see really well in the dark and it's also particularly sharp vision which is what allows them to see movement where with humans our eyes are more keyed for color so you'll often hear people say animals are colorblind it's not really that accurate in a way it's they can only see two colors to begin with so with humans it means that you can't see one of the colors that everyone else can see with the Lions they wouldn't consider it color blonde because I can only see in two colors but the night vision is very very good so they've got a lot more cells on the eye that can pick up light but then also that to beat them you see them at the back of the eye that mirror which makes the eyes seem to shine back at you also helps to kind of double the light that they seeing so it's you know the amazingly capable hunters at night because of that things like primates and birds eat fruit it's more important to have television to see where the fruits are right or not and to more easily identify fruits and trees so for Carnival it's not all that important to see color hmm and fall out always right someone asking you is the Sam cool Italian or just more comfy I think you know the lying in the Sun and that sounds pretty warm in the Sun I'd imagine maybe I'm just gonna keep quiet for City not today I'd imagine if you died just a few centimeters down into the sand it would be a lot cooler but I don't see any of those lines doing it so I'd imagine they're just lying in the sand yeah because it's more comfortable and because they're close to the river I'd imagine they came for a drink earlier and to walk all the way back up the hill it's just a waste of energy I'm just going to try and catch up on some of these so Jennifer Russo asking would they ever go into the water to cool off Mike actually you posted that video on later sightings oh yeah I'm actually not sure some of you might be familiar with the Charleston lioness so a lot of you will have heard of the Charleston males the one that had that tooth hanging down like a saber-toothed lion and so him what was his aunt and the supposed nephews and that killed a buffalo in the Sand River quite far downstream from where we are now almost 20 kilometers downstream from you at the other end of Mala Mala and it was just a very hot day and afterwards think with all that exertion and that they went and got into the river and we're lying kind of just with their heads are to the the males as well as the lionesses and then the Cubs which were quite small they're not I can't quite remember but I want to say seven eight months old we're just running around and playing in the water - something you'd almost expect any dogs to do but for them they had a ball just running up and down but if you go to that kruger later sightings and just search Lions Beach day you'll see that video of them all lying in the river this one I think is just going off to join the others lying in the shade there then twist away Tyrell and Austin driver asking when was the last time they successfully hunted it's very difficult to tell you can see the male's bailey's but bigger than the others he might have caught something really to be small that he commandeered but it's very difficult to tell when they lost it when they lost killed something so this morning myself and Tubbs and some of the other angels spent quite a bit of time tracking these Lions down but in that whole time that we were following their tracks there was no indication that that actually made a kill and so I don't think they caught anything last night but the last thing we know they killed was the warthog that's our latest video to go on Mala Mala as YouTube channel but that was a few days ago and no in there enough to sustain a big prod like this I'm sure they've caught something between now and then that was last Saturday I think then feed the dream Ally asking how the Lions smell I'm assuming you mean how well did I smell I've got a very keen sense of smell and most of these animals have much better senses than we do and Lions certainly do have a very keen sense of smell and just a little bye point which is quite interesting there was a study done with humans where they sent a number of humans to the gym and then there was one human that they took swabs of that those people sweet and there was one person who got into an MRI scanner and they let her smell and all this these different peoples sweet and they just had a look at the brain activity weird litter and then they sent that same crowd of people skydiving and took the same lady put her in an MRI scanner and let her smell the switch and it was the medulla oblongata that lets up the fight-or-flight region of the brain which didn't light up when she's smelling there when they're doing jamming say we've also got a very keen sense of smell but maybe relied on it more often than we do nowadays back in the day when you're running around the savannah having to avoid predators and use our sense of smell more now but these animals certainly do have a great sense of smell the elephant's coming a bit closer from the South yet so maybe people really can smell fear yeah yeah I think that was sort of the conclusion they came to you I'm just gonna say the elephant has just walked behind the other filming vehicle you can just see em coming out now interesting to see if he decides to give the Lions a hard time or not I think he's just gonna walk past in the same route that giraffe took see how the rest of the prod reacts if at all mirror here asking how long does a female line care comes before giving birth the gestation period is about 110 days okay bond James Bond saying best way to spend a rainy Saturday morning catching some live streaming at Matamata Game Reserve very hot chest difficulty imagine cold rainy morning right now that glad that you enjoying it and starlings asking our lines immune to snakebites or could that kill them so with this male lion here the Gary Mel I don't know if his brother is here or not he was with him this morning but they rather so there were five of them originally and one of the male's was actually killed by a snake so I don't know what type of snake it was we it didn't happen on Malta Mall and happen north of us so it is second-hand information but apparently he was bitten by a snake or some species and died as a result so that elephant is all the second elephant is just wandering up there now you can see him just on the far right of the screen some say used to being on the comments and you filming that I keep talking to the wrong phone peter ferrara asking is there a link to donate separately from the super Chat link Peter I know in the dev has a and he started a yeah I think it's called go fund me just check on latest sightings Facebook page and a lot of guides are currently out of work because of the coronavirus we fortunate enough still to be on site and I look down here and but there is I know the dev has set something up for anyone to donate to it's a fund for guides that have all lost their jobs in recent times 80s J masking grid the biggest male line you've seen the in recent years for me it would be the Claridon male lions just know that perhaps physically all the lines that we see a tend to be quite big males but the Claridon males had particularly big mains I create lash well going man's and I always seem to be a quite good condition as well as some some Lions actually look quite scruffy talking to the wrong sign again and that these Gary males also are pretty big lions I'd say on Mala Mala certainly they're the biggest at the moment and then we are talking about it the other day but the new male lions that are with the 4-ways pride also pretty impressive Lions like I think if you want to see their Clara 10 males you can going full male lion if you go on to Kruger later sightings and just search Buffalo stops three lions fighting you'll see the winners they are there Claridon mounts and then if you got Mala Mala is YouTube channel and just look up for ways pride for new males with the four is pride you'll see that male who like a sour thing might be a touch bigger than the gari mouse then see Andrew Saunders arts have just subscribed thank you Andrew can you live stream Rihanna's here currently we aren't live-streaming runners and we are currently not posting any videos of line of runners on our YouTube page at the moment but that may change in the future but currently not CNN the dive is on top of it there Peter to answer your question as you always is it's called Becca bodied Sierra today laughter then just for everyone that is joining us now we just rocked on the bank of the Sand River with the kombu Laprade and two of the Gauri mouths we can only see one at the moment but I'm sure the other is here somewhere and we're on Mala Mala Game Reserve if you're going to be or just Google Mala Mala yeah even if you go into Google Maps and you'll see we are about 500 meters downstream on the sand river or in the sand river from Mala Mala main camp actually hoping that they get up and do something exciting or something comes to them we've had two elephants and a giraffe walk pass on the game trail that leads to and from the river here we a lot of animals come and drink and they are so far they watch the giraffe with some interest but didn't really do anything about it and the elephants were just out of the league I think Mia Ferreira asking what kinds of snakes to be seen normally well I don't know if there's such thing as seeing one snake more often than the other I think this yeah probably seen spotted Bush snakes the most but we get all sorts of snakes yeah I think the most recent snake seen by one of us is a black mamba in the RET raised camp I Sammy Jane welcome tanzir safaris how many prides of lions are they also wonderheart close are they hemorrhage from one prior to the other say Mala Mala is thirteen thousand three hundred hectares big and in the last couple of months we have filmed think seven prides of lions and we know of another prior to blinds that we haven't filmed yet that we just haven't made it to you at the eye field pride and yeah this pride that we're looking at in screen has most of its territory on Mala Mala and dominates most of my the other prides on the edges of this prides territory if you got to Mahlum Allah's YouTube channel and look at some of the videos of the the lions that we've put up you'll actually see where we've mapped off the territory so you can get a an idea of which lions live in which territories the other lion pride that we do sometimes see here the sticks prod we actually haven't seen for quite some time I think they've moved quite far west of us but they might well thought to spend more time along the river going into winter nas all the water all start drying up in Patrick Raymond know what me asking on YouTube is Kreuger sightings the same as malamar a no and a dove of Kruger sightings as kindly let us use is platform and to livestream from and we can only live stream on about 10 percent of the property here at Marlowe model because didn't have all that much sulfur and range but malam Allah's YouTube channel is separate to that of latest sightings you want to have a look at ours just go to Marlo miler Game Reserve and you'll see a lot of other animals there that then make it into the live streams just because they're out of cell phone range and if you want to find out more about the different prides of lions here you can also go to our website and have a look under the wildlife tab there are game reports which tells you all about the different lipids and lions and predators that we get on the reserve in Memphis v may J and asking any Crocs in the river at the moment there's some very big Crocs in the river none that I can see immediately here yeah and actually realize this is a pool of water off of the river really it's just a question here should you subscribe to ours and I don't know easy mean but I'd recommend that you subscribe to both later sightings and Mala Mala game is easy to channels and any other social media updates and it dove has some amazing sightings on his channel and we've also got some pretty good ones and then also don't forget to press that little bell i can like Gareth is saying we don't always have animals in the same places that we have sulfur and signal so our classrooms are pretty much ad-hoc depending on where the animals were even if we find them in the morning they might not necessarily be there in the afternoon so it's quite short notice so press that little bell icon and it will hopefully pop up on your phone and let you know when we are going to go live and very often we ourselves don't know until we actually get to the animals and then quickly try and burn each other from the sighting video call to see if it will even work in the Kofun fearin saying who gets rid of the snakes that get into camp but see if is unlucky enough to be closest to the phone at the time don't think many Rangers enjoy collecting snakes but tubs is one of them he's in frontier he often gets called upon just not frogs he says it's quite interesting watch-tabs do the high jump probably I mean pretty jump the length of a Land Rover when a frog landed just in front of him but he's happy with spitting cobras and black numbers as you can see all these lines just passed out at the moment then placing clear asking is the other gari boy here as well Mikey see him this morning I saw him this morning I just can't see him now I think he's to the right of us in the shed sorry to the left of screen anyway and and he hasn't really popped his head up just yet then someone asking have you met coyote Peterson I saw one of the videos in South Africa with the Lions and I think I heard one of you that certainly wasn't me no not one of us then Oliver Matthew MKV is the new coalition to the 4-ways pride no any background or just from the KNP just from the KNP as much as classes we know they're not big fans of the vehicle so it was two males the one allowed us to kind of see him but kind of growled at us and warned us off and then the other one we couldn't see him but he also just growled at us and so he yeah we didn't want to press with them just in case but you know are you hoping over Tom because the four ice rods themselves are very relaxed and their calves as well so hoping in Tamas other mouths get more and more relaxed and I'll really be interesting going into winter enough the Lions will start to congregate along the river if they're perhaps let's see what happens the gentle approach weeks like to you're asking me for asking when will you guys give us a night livestream yeah it's very difficult to film at night with a spotlight like yeah it's just very difficult to Connelly see clearly on the camera and we need to certainly think about different gear if we were to try that yeah but yeah it won't be anytime seen a few folks keep asking about perhaps zooming in and so on and because of the lockdown we haven't actually been able to get any equipment for Mala Mala to do these live streams Gareth and I using our cell phones Gareth unfortunately has a an amazing camera on it but yeah we haven't got any high-end super technical equipment just two cell phones and a substantial amount of airtime in a chimp asking how often do they mate and so these Lions it kind of depends they will cycle every month like most animals and so she will be available say to mate but then should she fall pregnant she's pregnant for about 110 days and then it takes her perhaps two years so bit more in fact to raise those Cubs to adulthood so like say these two were to mate now and she did conceive and so on realistically it would be perhaps three years from today that she would maybe be available to mate again but what would have what can happen is if the Cubs are killed or and either killed by something or just done make it they don't survive she'll be available to mate almost immediately again and so very often when Lions take over a new pride and kill off all the previous males Cubs those lionesses will be mating sometimes within the week with those new males but they're not sure how it works but they do you seem to be able to control somehow whether they can conceive or not so with the new males they'll be mating quite frequently and maybe after six months do they conceive and that almost bonds those new males to them it forces the new males who spend time with a pride stay with them and it also lets the lionesses know that you know these males are gonna stick around and it wasn't just a once-off and that they came through the area chased out the male's mated and then wandered off because the function of a male lion is to protect the prides territory and keep other males out of the territory the function of the lioness is to kind of raise and feed their cubs more directly so they just have kind of two different jobs but the goal at the end of the day for both is successfully raising Cubs then 1369 it is a huawei I'm asking about the phone then just for some of you and that are asking about Marla Marla's location we are wedged between the sabi sands Game Reserve which is a conglomeration of private game reserves and lodges and between the kruger national parks are western and northern border is the sabi sands Game Reserve now southern and eastern border is the Kruger National Park and we don't have a fence on our property and we have the sand river that runs the length of the property we're very fortunate with our location we've got incredibly good game being here I bet from Captain say we flicking to and I see there's a lot of messages yeah I'm just trying to flick through them we will try and get to em all of them Linda from California welcome back and then nod of just mentioning that we are looking in see getting a signal booster so maybe we can show you a few more animals I'm not sure how well it will work and we used a very old signal booster that plugs into the wall and we're hoping that the newer ones are stronger than well at least that one that I was using but it seems like from all the reviews they are pretty good maybe one of you out there uses one and can tell us a bit about them and then it's quite hard to see but on the far bank of the river behind the Lions and you might just see a little bit of movement it's as elephants are feeding on the river bank just behind them every now and then you might just see the movement from the ear flap but the Lions don't seem too bothered about it in while it's just asking about poaching do you have many problems with approaching consenting animals in the park so what are the ways you combat it so M Wallace just interesting we've been in contact with wardens from our neighboring reserves and the like I think wherever you are in Africa and wherever there's wildlife there's a poaching issue and I don't think it's a you know problem that's only localized in Africa I think poaching is a problem all over the world where there is wildlife but what's interesting since lockdown is the more organized poaching things like rhinos and lions has decreased so much and but bushmeat poaching is on the rise and now there's a lot of poverty in Africa and a lot of people you know we've been under lockdown for eight weeks now so there's a lot of people that are coming to the end of their savings and there's a lot of hungry people out there in any case so kind of be to be expected that smaller antelope would be caught and to feed families the edges of these reserves mullet we're pretty lucky yeah just in a sense that we are quite far from any of the borders and we've got the whole of Kruger National Park tar east and we've got the whole of the sabi sands to our West but I think wherever there is wildlife there is poaching and the ways to combat it is to have anti poaching units people that patrol on the ground and on a daily basis I think just to add to what Gareth Assange so obviously as a business we'd love you all to be able to come here but as conservationists I'd highly recommend or encourage you all to trotty visit all these natural areas and game reserves as soon as possible because a lot of the funding for anti poaching and that comes or was generated through ecotourism so there's no tourism of any type in the world at the moment but ecotourism relies for these animals the fact that they even here and not cabbages or maize or cows is that they kind of earn more via tourism if tourism isn't an option then a lot of these natural areas will disappear to whatever's the most economically viable in that area whether it's farming chickens or taking photos of lions is kind of up to you whether you come and visit or not then good morning Christine Hobbs asking does this pride hunt at the same time each day I wouldn't say I wish yeah that would make life a lot easier for us no and they're opportunistic and I'll say hunch during the cooler periods but we have seen this pride and Sinbad day on some pretty hot days as well and then someone just asking you and I like to talk about these lions number pocos say the mapuku is just asking didn't they live around our area in fact they were born on Mala Mala to the our field pride and they the I feel pride were kicked out of this territory by the Campo de prata Marat they used to the different used to hold the stage shadow nothing any prides in between the kick the magma so the Koch was born into the I feel pride they became nomadic and then when they claimed the territory they came in from the north again and from the Milwaukee area and we called them lot emails here on Mala Mala and yeah we very much in what was the territory back then I think that elephant behind him is a lot more getting easier to see just as he's moving along the bank you can just see his ears flapping and that sort of the white of his tusks in the background there you can see the Lions are just not interested it's not not a threat and that I'm CMS food so that already care original classics 1980 saying looks to be the male line looks quite slim missus okay he's actually a little bit fuller than some of the other lines around yeah but these Lions vary in weight almost on the daily basis some some days I look then and some days it looks so effect they're gonna pop and yeah so they're looking in relatively healthy condition it doesn't look too bad and in kazusa sex pata aka so the I feel prod is also known as the sparta pride if any of you have watched I think the film's name is brothers in blood I always get this wrong other brothers and bladder black brothers because sees are saying they held almost all of the sabi sands that is correct and I think during their prime not went to quite a few of their sightings or spent quite a bit of time of them they're certainly quite central to Marta Marta sorry about the shaking effect so just adjusting the camera stand I to Maggie and Gordon Higginbottom my my eight asking have we seen the pokomoko yes and that's been quite a lot of time with him I poked holes I think Mike and myself both good previous stunt show at Mala Mala we both left and returned and very nice to be back so I never saw them up or mails when they were met well big when I saw them they were from when they're kind of Cubs say from a few months old through until not eighteen months old we are about 18 months old perhaps with the older brother who was just coming into adulthood at the time and but other I feel pride at that stage was 22 if I remember correctly and so the you know they're always going to be a big big pride but that said this fraud the Khumbu Laprade is also 20 of them so it's quite possible that we'll see another big coalition of males come out of this pride then you're for air saying we are Brian and I'm sitting with the lead to charge my phone this is how dedicated I am thank you yeah I bought a piece of Buddha Walsh could do with a snack right now even me so Brian is just so that content for barbecue do you dare to either would not gasps yeah ee you see now the male around so lefty Doug saying elephants hate all the large predators lovely Doug's go and have a look at Mala Mala game reserves YouTube channel the latest video that we've released is quite interesting interaction between this pride and elephants a little bit more interesting than the current interaction we're watching but I'd certainly recommend it you're gonna watch that video so be sure to turn up the sound until when we first got yeah there was some signs of life with these lions the lionesses were up and moving about a bit and now I see that one Yanks is just waking up but I think he's gonna go back to sleep in a second okay the Cumberland pride thanks for answering everybody this is the cam bullet proudly looking at four ways pride still here and I don't know if anybody's got a nod to that region of the reserve lately but I'm no building up to seeing the actual four ways pride they were tracks they on the boundary at least almost almost on a daily basis and so we're not sure if they're that could be on the property I don't think anyone's gone off there recently we are in quite a large property and there are only a few of us out here and you know once you find something we kind of stick with it and we don't explore other parts of the property as much as we would when we do have guests just because they're far fewer vehicles operating at the moment so we've got a number of vehicles that are dedicated to anti-poaching but only two that are dedicated to filming so the property is a hundred and thirty square kilometres to cover so it's a just a massive tract of land and we're very fortunate these Lions the Khumbu Laprade at last big proud of land so there are easy to follow their tracks and then they also stick around in this area by the river - so just had the camera early on the one of the younger Cubs you saw one get up and move about earlier this is the second one it's actually looking a lot better than they were a few weeks ago and also scrawny high meter current meter came on me I came on spy with me last year that's good to have you back with us and that's not a baby elephant in the background that's a large bull elephant it probably just looks very small because it's on my cell phone camera so that's two of the younger Cubs accounted for and the other one is just on the right edge of the screen now that is completely passed out as well then Krissi's are asking have we been able to identify those large male lions over the 4-ways fraud unfortunately not Oh Ali Riza where is this place it's Mala Mala game reserve we border the kruger national park you look at the kruger national park on a map you'll see there's a camp called skukuza and we are pretty much directly north of Skukuza afternoon Bradley Thomas from Safari architects also a regular guest at Matamata that a Freudian slip the wrath and good afternoon chaos Peter just enjoying the audio of our latest episode original classics 1980 I'm just saying this acequia and clothes really fascinating jobs doing daddy enjoying it a little sneeze you might have heard was actually the cab over there I'm just gonna keep the camera on him for a second he's awake at the moment just see if he I'm gonna get up and move around then M Wallace just asking can you describe a visit to the park as my family is thinking of okay Sam I think he's gonna cough up a little furball perhaps in what it's all your dick there it is folks I'm guessing none of you thought your afternoon was gonna end watching a lion come cough up a fur ball so m1 is just to answer your question they're saying can you describe a visit to the park as my family is thinking of visiting after lockdown so I'm just gonna let this cab move around a bit and then I'll get back to your question have you does something interesting again and I'd invite anybody that has been to Mala Mala Game Reserve to chime in here and but as far as the schedule goes and there are two game drives a day it's generally a morning game drive and an afternoon game drive and the game drives earlier in the summer time for the morning game Drive and gotten a game driving you come back for breakfast and then you can lounge at the pool that overlooks a river or read a book or whatever you'd like to do use the gym and then there's lunch and then you'd meet on the deck for tea time and the deck overlooks the river as well where you'll meet you with your guide again and then go on your afternoon game drive which is a little bit later in summer and just because it's quite hot at that point and as you can see animals predators and don't really like to move around too much when it's hot and some things do move around things like elephants might come and find water and animals that rely very much on water might move around more so than other animals in the winter time you would wake up in at breakfast and go for game Drive after breakfast and you will see in the coming months are these lion prides become more active later on in the morning not become more active but are remain active later on in the morning so we generally go out a little bit later and sleep in a bit more and then come back a little bit later and then an afternoon game drives we leave a little bit earlier but I would definitely say that the experience of being here and we really hope you enjoying the spirit of this large streaming experience but it is very different with all of the smells and the noises and and it's a lot more personal in the lines or walking right by you and replies never forget the Flyers nice selling point delicious but I don't know no Bradley's been here many times I don't know if you could recommend that they do maybe it's a little bit Safari architects does come here with many guests but there are some other folks I'm just trying to see meter definitely spin yeah and a Gina then if anybody else has been yeah let us know my giraffe go often goes to our neighbors so David D asking why is the other pride called the 4-ways pride did they cause all the fights but no say yeah they called the 4-ways pride after an area called there's a crossing and or an open area called four ways open area and there's also crossing called four ways crossing and they're named after that area of the property in Meghan Gordon and Higginbottom do we do any walks do do do walks and it's a little bit more pleasant in the wintertime in his less grass for these animals to hide in and it's a little bit cooler that we do do walks Rachel O'Connor highly recommended I've been fortunate enough to be three times the last two times with my children based game being in the world we had amazing guides Thank You Rachel and yeah we appreciate that good feedback and we also think this is some of the best game being in the world Linda Musa yeah my husband visited Mala Mala over ten years ago and to this day he tells everyone close the base lodge ever excellent feedback thanks guys we appreciate that Mita had described the most fantastic experience brilliant little Kasich's real thing Meggy and Gordon once experienced never forgot since Dixit we came to live near the Kruger National Park Maggie and Gordon came to live in my home Tom and Darryl ten we were there 18 months ago enjoying the game draws from him very glad that you're joining us Darryl they're not Gina quality of wildlife eating in Guatemala is probably based in Africa thank you know we things like - yeah Nick is smiling in the vehicle behind us glad you Tommy chiming in there as well thanks Freddy and if we knew of you that have not been yet left we need to join us and manner that is our live stream and of course you'd love you to come visit us here but we also just want to say if you want to come and visit any of the other lodges and any of these parks any visits will help us along and nursing that applies globally not just for Africa but the more he cut tourism there is them safe that all these animals will be mrs. lapping saying we need to go where's the alcohol ban is lifted and honors are an integral part of the game drama at the morning coffee stops are will real win in the winter as well in a weary Suliman I think I'm pronouncing your name right I'm asking hard how does a Krieger fit into South Africa he's asking from Milan to Eastern Cape question mark actually no it's the southern part of the park is the borders next to Milan or just north of Milan and then it extends north all the way to Zimbabwe and I say Eastern to Mozambique and your commode I think that's I say name how cold can it get there in winter in Fahrenheit please okay I think someone's gonna have to help us there with giggle but whatever it gets to freezing which i think is pity - okay that doesn't happen often yeah so just a touch about freezing and is like yeah I've been here when there's been frost yeah it is frozen it's not but that would be the nighttime temperature otherwise the daytime temperatures they Pleasant and I'm not sure what it would be in Fahrenheit but it's very mild in Celsius imagine it's rebounded by yourself I definitely need to google that but when you're using a live stream on daytime is very fair here by about nine o'clock in the morning 9:30 started taking the layers off and you can wear shorts and a t-shirt up until about sunset and then the temperature drops very rapidly you'd have to layer up again Bradley Tom at 45 degrees Fahrenheit thanks ready day time like 70 thanks muta luck warmer than where you are in Shan Wang asking what month is best to visit and well it depends on what you coming for you know that's every season has something special about it the winter months are very dry we get summer rainfall yes everything dries up in the winter and because of that all the animals are forced to come and drink at the river which stretches stretches the length of Mala Mala the Sand River and because everything comes down to drink at the river the Predators line wait in the river and there's a lot of interaction along our river frontage there's less grass fewer leaves on the trees it's probably a bit easier to find animals because they're down at the river and also because there's this cross for them to hide in having said that the colors in summer when it is which are brilliant they're about 50 species more in summer with all the migrants that return some of which read here and they are plenty of babies in the summertime and a lot of people come to view the babies and there's far more frogs and snakes and insects there's a lot more in terms of the smaller animals it's a lot more color in summer it's a lot hotter so a lot more rain in summer and so it really depends I've had guests that prefer the summertime like to see the babies and birds and some of the smaller things and then I've had guests who prefer the interaction and particular to the large predators you tend to view more kills in the winter or late winter time kills and fights it's just because there's a lot of congregation in a smaller area on the river miss annum Andres asking of the Cabrillo girls bigger than the older and kuma girls we've never seen them side-by-side but I would think a kampala lionesses are a little bit bigger than the inclu Homa lionesses just also more solid like they're just a little bit stuck yeah another of the youngsters just waking up I'm not sure if anyone else wants to see another line cough up a fur border and prison I think that's how you pronounce your name thank you for joining us and goodbye Superbikes asking what was your best live experience I'm assuming you mean what is our best experience when we're streaming laughs did a few good ones let's say that zoom in the cheek gar emails a little tougher females that was like I wasn't on it but also in the lines I handle this pride of lions I was hunting my giraffe as well does the tension ratcheting up there no Gina in asking any idea the other Gauri male is I think they both here we just can't see the one currently I can't see them now but when we are driving in I think so I'm just gonna try the old finger rule that's way too much somewhere over here is where the other male is I think but I'm not a hundred percent sure but yeah this morning when we first found the Prada both males were definitely there and then the film crew actually spent a lot of the day with him followed them down to the river where they came to drink and then I'm not sure actually if the other male join but our suspects I'd be surprised if he stayed behind in mr. zero David zero L was in 1995 to be my nature conservation ecology the whole areas whole life fault area is pretty spectacular and we one of the major towns yeah is mouths great and if you travel 150 odd kilometers in an easterly direction you end up in on the Mozambican coastline which is a tropical coastline you had north and east from the end up in this area push fault if you head west from there just by about fifty kilometers north in race from the end up in the Drakensberg mountains where there's a lot of trout streams and lots of very different environments in this area lots of different ecosystems it's very stunning area highly recommend coming for visit yeah you wanna do yanks is quite comfortable one is back there relaxed asking which periods would you say has the highest hunting success rate lines wild dogs dogs but along mahajan so with the Lions I want to say maybe five percent of their hunts are successful with the wild dogs it's here anyway it's probably closer to fifty percent are successful a lot of textbooks will tell you how God works anyway I tell you them wild dogs is eighty and even ninety percent depending which one you're reading but I think that's in a different area a different study group to here here I'd be surprised if it's as much as fifty percent but that's why you're not far off just watch what happens yeah she's been denying the mail it's a bit of an awkward place for them to get to or for us to get to so so you can see we've got the Lions on this side of us and then in front of us as well as a couple in the Grasse and then we have the river all around on the other side with the clearly good-looking sunset a little bit stuck for now but we'll just see once they're done moving around if we can't get to it as other two are if they're gonna do anything interesting it's quite possible the race of the prod will get up and follow the filming crew you're just gonna have a look around the corner there and they will update us then picture Mari Posen saying would be awesome when they wake up start to roll like I did the other day there was also a nice moment on livestream and yeah we say this is asking green now how many male calves they are you know at least six there now how many I think at a point of the whole youngest at their female not sure how many meter asking any sign of the lioness that was attacked by the gambler pride and Gary's so that was the marquee lioness muscle known as that Salalah line is she was attacked and those of you that don't know on Mala Mala just the other day and we saw was it yesterday or the day before that we had that large stream the day before so two days ago - oh yeah with I think allows you to the northern of uh Camille Gareth or Gina to the other Garrett and called in the cub of the lioness we have seen her tracks in that area at least we think it's fair tracks but we haven't seen her yet Rose me prey I've been fortunate enough to have had eight Safari weeks yeah a lot every minute was to have been this week you must base money and based on my husband thanks razz me we look forward to your next visit and meter the facts that we which I was just talking about probably today anomaly game is a YouTube channel stuff anybody wants to see what happened they just keep an eye out on the bottom out of gamers is YouTube channel you really want to see can subscribe and click on the little bell icon and as soon as we have finished uploading it a little pop up on your screen this is pretty dramatic footage AMA say even having seen quite a few all things that was quite exciting as me bracing Vasari booked and coming back with lots of guests that would be great looking forward to because Steven Chris Scott um RDR Land Rovers do in all of that sand do we ever get stuck they're actually brilliant vehicles in the sand but yes we do get stuck I'm just gonna show you quickly how we got here we can see how close we had to drive to the water to squeeze past alliance I have very interesting concerns about tubs ability to get us out of here later but we'll see other lionesses so it does seem that they're all kind of waking up and getting into gear now with the Lions unfortunately that can be a very slow process Megan Gordon saying bit it's getting a bit chilly especially here in the riverbed call it gets called very very fast goodbye thank you for joining us how many wild dog packs are in in Mala Mala area now this while dogs have a large home range and then weave unto the property or the property very quicky and at some point about three sometimes four packs on the property and in some points and then yeah I don't know if they are currently any wild dogs on the property but generally when there are a lot of lions about and they tend to be pure wild dogs in the area and the last few Manson had plenty of lions bar someone I think I think I just saw a flash of a message Mike I'm not reading your messages on purpose but I think Pete just message to say that he's just uploaded that cam Buller Pride Fighting the marquee line is so you can go and have a watch well Pete if you could maybe put the link enforcement Brahe just saying getting stuck in the sand or water we're having a flat tire can be the best part of the ride right Bruce yeah he's definitely not gonna get away with this thank you if you remember last year you made me catch a be off of your table I was quite concerned for my own safety as well it's these last year you can see you came in the summer Aaron is which coalition are the Campbell apart and it's the GAR email coalition is only two that remain of the fire Andrew come oh I'd love to drive for you guys it is a lot of fun driving you can see this lioness she is quite alert and just looking around it's an odd sunset is also often when a lot of the animals start calling because the air gets a little bit cooler and that it's denser those calls carry further and that's also everything starts to wake up now that the heat of the day has passed even if she doesn't I think she's just listening out to his sister that went around the corner with a male there but yeah so even if they don't actually react to any other animals that they might hear in the distance I'll at least notice maybe other lions roaring they can just help to space themselves are to that avoid conflict if need be if they're lucky they might hear a leopard or cheetah make a kill and I can go and steal that or if they're really lucky they hear it a buffalo in the distance and can go and mission either they're diseased 1369 City just roared maybe they're listening to hear someone's just asking aren't there any Impala around not that we can see and then don't think any would be coming down to drink at this point maybe a few would come down but they tend to drink more during the heat of the day and they prefer not to come under the cover of darkness yeah down to the river so they will they're probably mostly hitting to the higher ground right not too open areas to bed down for the night though this - is the King Cod actually just looking around right now there's definitely a lot more activity now you see all the sisters waking up so what they're doing now and properly known as ello grooming but it's really social bonding that's happening now so being at salons are more than capable of cleaning themselves but they will want to reaffirm all those family ties now and that after a day sleeping I think this little girl wants again drink it is alternatively gonna climb into the back of the vehicle that we'll see and now we'll all find out together if there's crocodiles in this pool of water they'll say is right at the back of the vehicle you can just see the tailgate and the frame they're mere furrier asking what bid was that we there's a bit of a lag between us filming this and actually receiving these comments and between the picture that you see that there was a black guy calling just a moment ago and sorry for the camera shake I was just moving that beanbag around it's got something looking at all those concentric ripples going out from ways drinking's you try get the artistic shot here but a lot of people often comment on these cat seeming to be so thirsty when they drink because they drink for such a long time but if you look closer you'll see so he's lapping up water when ass and a lot of animals drink we suck water half so we actually taken quite a lot at a time but this lapping all those little hooks that are on a cat's tongue each all the water drops get stuck in there and then got into his mouths he's drinking like a tea spoon full of water at a time instead of sucking up a say a glass at a time like we would so imagine drinking a glass of water one teaspoon at a time and you'll get an idea of why it seems to take so long for the Lions to drink it's not thirsty it's just a kind of inefficient way of drinking but at the same time it's a that Tang is much better suited for getting meat off of bones and for grooming himself like he is now then superbark saying how do you react the line clans into the vehicle has it happened it does not happen these lines are pretty eesti vehicles and we're just a fly on the wall here we would react quite badly but yeah definitely hunter not scared of anything but frogs yeah then Jonathan asking do Krux live in this water they do indeed and he just walked straight over the water with us you know very often these animals take a little bit of time and scope the water out before they go and drink and you wouldn't go and sit where he's sitting right now some of the Crocs around yeah John is having a full boss yeah and a few people asking about the cellphone again I think we should start asking for and advertising out of the company but it's a while way does he 1369 Tubbs saying hey frogs can kill you too Ava's been telling us that for years it's gonna go back to the lioness as you can see they're all in a big pile just grooming one another they're watching the summer this river rises the water level rises and resides very very rapidly so there are heavy thunderstorms and and maybe a number of days of rain we would certainly not be sitting where we are this rabbit can flow from bank to bank it's gonna keep quiet for a second super box laughing it knots get of lines but bring a frog in this night it is very much the case of tubs things that scare particle frogs I think the other day jumped onto the vehicle while it was still going I'll see what they're gonna do but you can see all of them are kind of waking up and grooming themselves at the moment so one of the good indications that these animals are actually going to move as opposed to just wake up and groom is they do all go to the bathroom so it's all that line is now going to the bathroom the other one and the reeds also like was having a quick toilet break and that's a very good indication that they are gonna get up and get going will be interesting to see where they go from here and they're all kind of looking to the north as if they're gonna walk up the river they cross the river last night to get to this Bank and then kind of came back down to the river to drink and spend the day but if they go north from here they'll be going into an area where we've been seeing the Torchwood pride and they were seen maybe just over a kilometer so less than a mile to the north of us and was a tortured pride hunting around for some zebra yesterday so it'll be interesting to see if the Campbell apart and react and do that and just 1369 asking are the carnivorous plants around not that I know of I don't let you guys know the kind of plants here I think mammals I've got that market cornered yeah so carnivorous plants are actually often in areas where the soil isn't particularly good and which is why those plants become carnivores so the soil isn't great here but it's not that bad so it seems like they're all getting up and getting going Russell McLaughlin saying I want to be hey why don't you come out wrestle camp wrestle is doing some filming here as well not sure way is right now fight ikuo asking any flooding in that area during the rainy season and the river does flood from time to time and it would amaze you to see this river in flood if you've any been here in the wintertime and it looks like just a trickle but it does actually fled the banks all that water come down I mean busy 1369 asking are they any in Africa they're talking about carnivorous plants kin I would imagine that they must be somewhere with all those jungles in central Africa I think there's a lot of plants that maybe you haven't even been identified yet but I couldn't tell you offended enough you can mark I know it's kind of dry no no no like swampy time there's like leeches I think I'll know in the Americas there's quite a few and I think get the sundews in Europe I remember I was reading something the biggest mass kill ever seen or recorded scientifically anyway was a field of sandee's capturing a whole swarm of back to fly but it was something like on it is crazy estimates of within a square mile million butterflies got killed or something insane like that but it's the largest one-off kill of a species by another species recorded Superbikes asking what's more critical I know a lipid session your lipid they are credible credible farmers of trees and there are Sydney way more at lytic tent Alliance collective lock the camera so Mike still confused as to which cameras forming and which cameras got the comments on facts in a second we're gonna start to follow yeah let's see if we can follow them all right like so we are in the Sand River bid and the Lions are moving kind of up the riverbed I'm hoping that the signal will stay it might just get a bit choppy because we kind of in the valley here but we'll see if we can stick with the Lions and see what they do looks like they just moved to another space to lie bar Andrew I'm hey thanks for training us that's not from ma New England see you next time someone says yeah we should start cracking to see how you react yeah we go mr. zero David zero saying genera old Ravana in northern bots any carnivorous plant on in Africa so I don't know does it grow in the Okavango Delta okay look it up it's not something I've ever really thought about too much so these are all the youngsters here and then in the back you can see one of the Geary males with that Kampala lioness he was trying to mate and then you can't quite see it's hard with this camera but one of the lioness is just lying a little bit past them into the right maybe ten feet further on far too cool asking is the female near the adult male in heat she must be for him to be following her on like that he has been trying to mate with a throughout this afternoon's livestream unsuccessfully yeah Ellie thank you for joining us and you're welcome we are really grateful to be here and we enjoy sharing this with you in Shilla mere love Mala Mala I have to get back soon we've really enjoying the ranges in isolation and Kruger sightings thanks from Amelia Island Florida USA Thank You Sheila we appreciate that comment perhaps what I'm getting going I think I just listening out at the moment they're not exactly going back to sleep or the youngsters or going back to sleep but the adults are Leafs way and I think for those of you that are regular viewers so it was 17 20 or so 20 plus 5 that they started to move about you can maybe remember that for next time we're trying to guess when these things are gonna wake up but it was almost within 10 minutes of the sunset here or the Sun going down behind the mountains Russell McLaughlin asking have you called bamba' stations on the livestream yet Marty not yet we hoping for that but Russell watched this pride and a ballet last year after we told them that they don't hunt Buffalo so we we had watched them hunt Buffalo on numerous occasions and successfully your hands exactly yeah so they just ended up chasing these lions away time after time and eventually they did catch one and Russell was there to witness it and he was actually there to witness it very close to a that lion fight happened just a few days ago between the cam boola pride and the Marquee pride well Marty lioness then he formed up to you and you managed to film that is all more than asking Wayne last at their hunt who can't be short Dylan and I think Gareth and Nuttall Smith or Gina to watch them kill a warthog about a week ago but I'm pretty sure that killed quite a few animals since then they then look very well-fed but you know an Impala or T doesn't go a long way in a pride this size until think that Lions actually can having a little bit of an easier time catching the Impala Rams at the moment because it's the Impala right at the now so they all those Impala Rams are busy fighting one another and quite distracted and then on top of that they're also often breaking legs and poking each other's eyes out in these fights and that's a lot easier to catch because they're not paying attention and because they probably injured in those fights Rosalind McConnell asking which pride I think you're referring to the fight this is a few questions here about the fat Jonathan asking have you got video of the two prides clashing I think katella's just uploaded it to YouTube now so if you go on to our YouTube channel Marla Malik game reserves YouTube channel you should be able to see it up there if it's not up there yet it should be at the FA shortly and it was the Kampala pride who fought to the marthy pride marquee proud any consists of the one line is and her cap currently and that happened a few days there okay so Pete says he uploaded it now while we were busy with the last stream so maybe a couple of you could pop onto the Mala Mala channel quick and see if it is there we can't because we're using our fans for this part of YouTube when I had to cut off one just to double-check on Pete's homework back Roger is asking what I'm saying what a great sighting thank you guys from the u.s. in San Diego you welcome back and then bill how many male lions per pride what happens to male comes with a girl up and are more lionesses born than male Cubs so the number of male lions in a pride and I'm assuming you mean adult male lions can vary greatly and it depends on how many other Lions in the area it depends on a number of factors but in this area with is my density of predators they tends to be a coalition of male lands that well call the territory and very often that territory has a number of prides of lions territories before within that man that coalition of male lions territory and when we talk about a pride we're talking about adult lionesses and their cubs and cap is being male and female when the male calves get to the age of about two three sometimes but a little bit older depending on the pressures around them again they will leave the pride and become nomadic until they get to a point where they're strong fit and confidence enough to hold their own territory and when it gets the point to that point they will then try and push another male out of its territory and effectively take over the prides of in that males territory and the way they do that is by killing well first of all chasing the male lion out of his territory and then killing all the Cubs in an existing pride and they do that and it brings the females back into II stress and then they can mate with the females and pass on their own genes so I hope that answers your question and then there's the second part of that question are more lionesses born than male Cubs I wouldn't say that but I think male Cubs birth lipids and lions and maybe it's likely more interest in the females and maybe get themselves into trouble but more often than the females so for all animals that soy is gonna be 50/50 males to females partly that's just hard when those that egg and sperm cell meet it depends how those chromosomes kind of land but it will always be a 50/50 chance of being XX or XY in dizzy 1369 setting it is that popped into the notifications is this you're welcome to have a look at it then any more updates in the marquee lioness and a cub the last livestream we had two days ago with a northern of akka male Ginette found the cub in marthy one of their farms on Mala Mala so we know for certain that the cab is okay and we think we've seen tracks of the lioness in that area but they haven't been seen since and Mita Courant asking are there no males at the marthy pride meter one of these males actually mated with a lioness from the Marti pride so that cat belongs to one of these gari males so you might hear some sounds like shots in the background it's the doings of just nicest these lions they actually live in those trees over there and they leave the camera on the trees for a second you might actually see some movement in the trees but that's all the baboons going to sleep I reached in those trees every night and I'm not going to be too thrilled that the Lions have decided that this is where they cannot spend the heyday I can just see the one Vivian jumping around in make fun Wow is their mating season for lions not really and it's not like in parlors with some of the other and multi karate air that have very that give birth at very specific times of the year Oh mate it's specific times of the year not flex oh you can see that camera is also starting to get a little bit grainy because it's getting quite dark again it seems a lot bright on screen than it is actually in real life then range boy a hashtag hate hunting worked for FK I'm live and wild at Mala Mala in 2001 and very complimentary about our game being here yeah thank you range boy we lucky without game being here and then preach sunny asking is the color of the sand naturally pink it does have a bit of a pink tinge to it and that's because of the feldspar in the in the sand effectively the sand that we're looking at is granite that is weighted down into and the sand and there's a lot of feldspar in ganache as well as quartz and other minerals and feldspar has a pinkish tinge but at the moment is a bit of a sunset that is making the sand look more pink than it usually does you can see the sunset in Jonathan asking our son Lions related to other lines from rival prides so that markley night this pride issue this is part of the break way Marty pride right yeah so it depends on how you want to look at it but there's certainly family the Khumbu Laprade in the math leap right but the Matheny pride got very big at one point and broke away into two groups so we referred to them as the motley fraud and the breakaway Matthew pride and then the konbu Laprade break away from the breakaway moth leap right so that's the breakaway breakaway pride so we thought they're gonna rule for a second there and so it's you know rather than call them the breakaway or from the breakaway prod we just stuck to who renamed that they come pool abroad to get a little bit vocal not if they do start roaring you're certainly you keep quiet and then just Ranger boys saying that Kim wanted to the Easter did a lot of forming on Marlins very quiet lacing lately I think he's based up in Zimbabwe currently and he's quite active on Instagram can go and have a look at him there focus I think it's just because it's getting dark non-fact so the quality is getting a bit Prerna just because there's not much light around anymore so we probably will be ending this livestream pretty soon and I just like to say thank you to all of you that joined us today and please join us again it's always fun chatting with you
