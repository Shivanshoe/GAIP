x welcome to game reserve it's been a while and you are with gareth van ran for those of you who do not recognize my voice welcome i'm just going to get onto the comments here quickly but just in the meantime while i do that we are currently looking at a female leopard and she's standing over an in that knob thorne tree and her name is the encovering female she's about seven years old [Music] number one okay so just bear with me for a second while i get the comments set up so so uh whoops okay there we go right welcome folks i see you're coming say linda from california welcome asking is there a kill in the tree yes there is joseph z i still want to see hippo and let's see who else is here whoops turn that down right folks so with me today is also another special guest and um i'm just going to zoom out a bit so you can see who it is it's uh rus mclaughlin rest you are now on live how's it going youtube channel and russ is going to be commentating with me and you can see he's got some serious equipment in the back there i'm just gonna zoom in a little bit on that camera so you can see what he's focused on so it's on the leopard and he is here at malamata capturing some footage for wildlife documentaries so back to the leopard [Applause] so russ is gonna film while i chat and so it's quite interesting she's uh pulled this carcass at a knob thorne tree there's very sharp little thorns on that tree i can't imagine it's the most comfortable tree to climb up and around it's just interesting because it's quite bare-leafed and she doesn't have much cover there leopards tend to prefer to haul their kills up trees that have plenty of leaves as you can see this one's quite bare so she must have had to dirt in a hurry there are a couple of ahinas around and maybe that's the reason she's chosen to do so in this particular tree let's zoom in a bit more that's right so you can see just to the left of center of the screen a major fork in the tree if you go up the fork you can just see the leg of the impala hanging down and that's the carcass that she's been feeding off she's still got quite a bit to go okay love from india welcome p2h fun welcome broken wing mr wilde yay e 87. then just ask him do you have any information about that female leopard i mean when she was born do you know her name father mother that kind of stuff she is so let me just follow her while she whoops let's go the other way rather okay so she's just climbed on the tree and she is mobile towards the river the river is in the direction that she's walking in now she's probably just going to go for a drink of water and what we're going to do is i think the rest is you must just operate however you want to operate okay so we're gonna follow here basically um we're just going to be along for the ride yeah i just got my before we go apologies for the specs i'll show you around the vehicle in a bit but it is a vehicle before filming it's quite an interesting so this is so if you don't mind grabbing that coffee coffee yeah bare essentials no no okay so we're just going to carry on trying to find uh think of any female that ahina is just going to wait around but her mother is the mashable female she's about seven years old and um she had a cup not so long ago she had mated with three leopards one was the maximum smell that some of you may know from either our youtube channel or from these live broadcasts the other mail that you mated with was the flat truck mail and the other mail that she matched with was the senegal bushmail so we're not sure who the cap the area against t right now we just so when we found her this life's a kill close by and we did find that out in the open but oh yeah she is that position and then get there maybe get on to get on the other side see so who else has made the call here and since it's your call you can change your tire i'll stand guard at the camera luckily right by cam yeah you can see hyena in the background as well there's two heights yep if we get three yeah it will actually be quite a nice position this is a nice clear view of the carcass in the tree and that leopard is currently just watching those two hyenas which are pretty much center of screen now they're just behind the bush there there she is on the left okay have a look at it in just a second there you go that's great thanks russ actually can't see her she's so well camouflaged okay so i'm just going to zoom in a bit on here got this new gimbal that some of you may appreciate and but i'm still don't need to use it so if i go up instead of down or left instead of right forgive me but there she has center of screen and could be any female and she'll probably just lay here for we we found her she was lying in the top of the tree it was very cold this morning so she's obviously just getting a bit of sun and enjoying warming up a bit and but no she's obviously gotten a bit too warm okay back to the comments friday long time welcome back hi to dave i say hi dev cynthia hill from ohio hello and you try and see some of these contents or some of these comments okay so now dove saying you actually had an awesome sighting of a croc snapping at a hippo at malamala so they definitely are around i don't know what the lead up to that comment was in the dove but that's pretty cool then hi to ethan and alex and terry and chris some family at home and there we go my mother game reserve she's an inconvenient female born august 2012 father marthaly male mother michelle female thanks that's pete's sitting back at camp and busy editing some of our videos for the youtube channel hopefully you know better be working in a dusty cave we call our editing suite yeah i better be working pizza is working here thanks for that um then nadav saying this is think of any females who walk past my room at camp every day she loves malamata camp so nadav was here not so long ago if you haven't picked up on that yet and then igor arigal say hello to brazil hello brazil slytherin guy hello there how do they go up there well they climb up there they're incredibly incredible and incredibly athletic and uh excellent climbers where are the hyenas i'm going to show you where the ikea's oops there you go there's one are you know there i think there's three hyenas so yeah this is russ commenting in the in the background russ mclaughlin he's a wildlife documentary filmmaker and he's filmed documentaries all over the world i'm going to talk a bit about that during this livestream so if you have any questions for love full of love for us you can call me love i'm see obviously reading a comment saying love from india but if you have any comments for love then go ahead um okay i think we've caught up with most of these comments okay johann duplessy welcome back hello from illinois samantha flynn okay let's go back to the leopard show she's um just lying in the shade now i don't know if she appreciates our commentary as much as you guys do but uh she is currently center of screen there friday asking did i miss anything cool not so much friday i hope you've been keeping up with our youtube videos and there's a lot of cool stuff happening there and we've got quite a cool video coming out about the kambula pride pretty soon we spent how many days rest i've just come back from leaves i only spent two days with them but i believe you guys spent a few days with them beforehand and yeah we've been spending a lot a lot of our time with a kambula pride and finally they did something awesome so that'll appear or not that'll appear on our youtube channel soon so stay tuned for those of you who don't know about our youtube channel we've been filming a series called ranges in isolation and we basically just filmed a lot of the sightings that happen here outside of cell phone coverage when you do have software and coverage you do try and um have these live streams through latest sightings platforms thanks to the dove for that kevin stuart hello what's the temperature i don't know what the temperature is right now but it was icy cold this morning it's been about one degree i think yesterday morning it was one degree celsius very cold jaco morning from all silver in pretoria welcome cynthia hill ahmed basri love from mars that's a lie lawrence jr welcome back it's been a while arjuna n been missing the live streams likewise you know we've also been missing and chatting to you all where's the slippery camera same spot tess camel are you natasha i know that name yeah so russ grew up in the same town yeah into the same school yeah lean lotte then uh linda asking what lens does russ use i'm gonna let it rest answer this right now i'm just gonna point at the currently ends this on this 50 to 1000 millimeter lens yeah that's proper yeah so when the rest is trying to look at the mites on this leopard he uses that lens okay there we go so russ if you see uh there's uh someone close to you as well there russ shannon wild morning shannon hello and then arjuna says hi gareth and hi love christina i'm not quite sure how to pronounce your surname mcnanio from italy welcome and cynthia's saying that's not cold for us low folders one degree is very cold brian elmar warning what has happened to inconvenient female cubs we're not sure brian and it was just the one cub and we haven't seen it in a in a while now we assume that it's being killed we're not quite sure russ um has a theory and eras spent a lot of time with a cavendi female and cub and wiley spent all that time with her uh yes i saw or watched a martial eagle scoping her art or scoping the cub out at least and yeah i think a marshall eagle took it yeah so we're not 100 sure we are speculating but um soviet jose nielda silva from brazil ray carter morning from meridian mississippi usa welcome so for those of you that have just joined us i'm just going to show you um why we are here or obviously there's a leopard in frame if those couldn't see the leopard in the grass but she has a kill center of screen there hanging in that tree is an impala carcass which she hasn't fed on much yet and so she will be up and down the tree feeding on that carcass for the next day and a half about and we look forward to filming here doing that then brian asking does piccadilly still have a cab brian we haven't seen piccadilly female or her cub in a while not 100 sure do you know who else i think she does okay so russell's saying he thinks she does i've just come back from leave so russ is more in the loop than i am here and then any news on the wild dog then no news the dove um so friday also asking about the painted wolf sightings uh we had a wild dog dane that was here for a short while and they have since moved and we haven't heard any news from the neighbors recently so we're not sure where they are exactly uh obviously if you just stay tuned to our youtube channel if they do come back you'll certainly see them there and then you're under saying being a while being busy fighting some wildfires in the loaf good to be back there i saw some of those fires you hun i saw one particularly large one in near schumann's cliff and yeah hats off to you that's some serious work so just to maybe while we're sitting here and watching the inconvenient or badly ceiling convenient you see a few spots there and maybe we'll just chat to us a bit [Laughter] so i will take you on a little tour of this vehicle it's basically set at four filming and but yeah it's been quite an interesting experience for us here at malamala that are doing our own filming and you know we're not used to this kind of thing harasses professional been doing it for many years now and um it's been interesting to watch from the sidelines um so maybe yes like how do you go about finding a site or how do you go about you know starting with the documentary uh we we're different with star tour with the right characters um like think of any female we've been following her for quite some time uh quite sad that she lost a cub but we've got a very you know long long period of uh filming so hopefully um there's another little one on the horizon um but yeah it's just many hours of the day following individual animals um uh long hours obviously um and uh yeah just like this uh it definitely tests your patience when they're sleeping not doing much but uh definitely very rewarding uh when you see the final product so um yeah insanely exciting but uh yeah i can say um you know talking about some of the the last films i did like the last film i did was on a black leopard in india um which was quite amazing um but yeah i did miss south africa and being on this side of the world a lot so i'm quite content where i am right now so for those of you that um maybe on instagram there's the black leopard that appears on instagram from time to time and that's probably the one you're filming yeah that's the guy does that leopard have a name uh we call him sire okay yeah and um i mean it's quite special i know i've always dreamed of seeing a black leather and i know you've said the same and it's quite incredible that you got to spend how long what did you spend with that leopard uh just under two years yes it's a good amount of time and in a vastly different environment to what we are currently in we're in savannah woodland here and uh which park was that in where that leopard was uh kabini national park say yes forest yeah okay so here's namaste from india we're talking about your part of the world um and then friday asking which documentaries did love do uh well we've just spoken about that one yeah has that's been released yet yeah uh that's it's not released in the states yet but it's you know most most other places in the world you will see it on national geographic um i would say lately like the last one i worked on would be on disney plus uh called elephant and then there's a a film of us making the film called in the footsteps of elephants um so you'll be able to see how we made the film which is quite interesting a lot of fun as well so if you're ever around uh and you ever got time to watch disney plus uh keep an eye out for those two so disney plus uh no i've been spending a bit of time with the rest here and um just fold me in on some of the sort of gear that you attached to your drone for that you're using quite specialized gear and that's documentary yeah very very specialized um but also you know it was a five year long project okay so just in in you know on that note you know five years is that an excessive amount of time for a documentary or is it you know yeah that's on the longest long spectrum of documentaries in the yellow glass from derbs welcome okay so that's friday i hope i've answered your question there asking how long does it take to make a documentary so here we are making a documentary address and you can see it's not all forming all the time so like i said earlier you got to be pretty patient and sit at art until something happens and very often something doesn't happen um maggie and gordon higginbotham hi guys especially gareth thanks maggie uh long time no see it has been a while and then just saying won't be in south africa later this month yeah unfortunately unfortunately travel's still a little bit restricted robin sewell one of the rangers here welcome robin okay see you guys back in the live stream it's been good robin it's nice to be back in the live stream sarah from england any news on the lila female and cub please so we do know that it's a lot of females monthly lioness and haircut or the motherly pride and yes there's some news they are both well and yaku which you may recognize one of the rangers here who you might recognize from my youtube series watched her in the cub um hunting nyada i think it couldn't have been more than two days i've lost track of time already i've only been here for two or three days but either yesterday or the day before um yeah so they're in good condition then friday asking has there been a time in the animal charged i think both of us have probably experienced charged charges we walked into the leopard yesterday yeah so so friday if you look on my instagram account i don't know if it's still app but um yeah we did uh have a little leopard joined us for breakfast uh didn't charge us very relaxed people but yeah very close though yeah i think russ nearly stepped on it it's lovely being so close to such big cats there's a nice big male lipid as well in your tiny male hi annie welcome yeah you can either look on russ's instagram account i think you're at rest wildlife right yes under underscore well there's something like that and then oh 66 gbr and if you look at my story you'll see that there but it was unfortunately no well fortunately for us and earlier but charging but it was nice to it was very close that was very close then the dove asking which breakfast spot was that uh it wasn't actually one of the more formal breakfast spots in the dove we do have more formal ones which is maybe a wooden bench um under a tree but this one we were actually sitting with a kambula pride and and they were very fat and lazy in the reeds and we decided to have a cup of coffee nearby and about midway sort of our western boundary midway along north to south and um yeah the monkeys are chattering and we thought they were maybe chattering at the lions but they were not touching at the lions they were chattering at the lipid that was walking up to us okay so here's brian emma saying who did i look up to when younger in terms of filmmakers you bad question mark i i'll definitely say the the jabez i really enjoyed their work that they did some of their films were just still are some of the best i've seen out there especially eternal enemies um it's a it's a documentary i do find myself watching over over in you know film many many years ago but it's definitely one of those is that the lines in our universe yeah that's that's it's quite a it's quite an amazing film that introduced yeah yeah that's that's that's it so they definitely are um incredible filmmakers and they've done some amazing work over the years and they're still making amazing films um but yeah now that they the the films that are coming out these days are just you know absolutely amazing so uh congo wrong there and friday saying his pit doing pete maybe you want to answer if you're listening he is supposed to be working on another video so hopefully he's not listening but he's doing well um saying because he's posting so much tell him thanks uh you're welcome ready on br on behalf of pitt and so where do you see wildlife documentaries going i mean technology is changing so quickly and you know it's speaking about that documentary that's very old how is it different from today's documentaries i think obviously you know moving things from uh film to digital is a huge step uh but also utilizing technology for filmmaking especially you know when you you're working on stabilized platforms this is very basic system that we're working with now with tripod and camera but uh with the 3x well six axis stabilization gyro stabilizations that the guys are working with is definitely bringing a whole new um format of filmmaking especially and as well as aerial filmmaking it definitely factors in uh with uh um you know with today's uh you know quality um and uh style um that we're seeing out there it's it's changed a lot and you know a lot especially when i look at the last 10 years that i've been filming it definitely has changed a lot but it definitely has changed because of technology okay so someone just saying i don't know if that's a question i am watching animal and there is indeed an animal i'm going to just try and get to your center of screen again yeah i'm reading comments while i'm doing this so sometimes via awful but so i'm using one of these little stabilizers that uh that russ is talking about i know some of you guys might have been a bit irritated with my shaky camerawork in the past and this is a lot more stable i am i think this freehand now it's an amazing little stabilizer basically center of screen you might see some spots you won't yeah move every now and then that's a leopard lying down there then coveny female just walk out there and shut up and then ref de hombre saying today's documentaries are great using trends as well and yeah drones make a big difference so i'm just gonna go back to the and killing the tree for those of you that might have missed it okay so you can see just around the central street screen is uh impala caucus hanging in the tree yeah the eternal sleep friday saying you like the shaking made me feel like i was there i can do away with the stabilizer if you like friday take it back to shaky old live streams then sarah's saying rasp can you post a link for the black leopard please um yeah i can try and find a link i will just add it to this that would be great and i don't know do you have any stuff on your instagram account on the platform uh i think i've got just some photographs and possibly a trailer um of it so now the way we find lipids here and either tracking can be one way which is probably the most difficult ways to find their footprints on the ground and then follow their footprints um but tracking is not only about following footprints in the case of this morning we saw a couple of hyenas just lying around which gave us a clue that there may be another predator kill in the area and we had a good look around and saw this impala carcass in the tree and very often we hear animals alarm calls which gives predators away and the interesting rus maybe you want to talk a little bit about how it was tracking that black leopard in or finding that black leopard in india because it was very different to here yeah i was completely sound based um instead of you know with with the way people track here in africa um because it was such a dense forest you would stop um you know every half an hour you know 20 minutes and just listen and listen and listen until the forest talks to you um it would be an indication of various alarm calls from you know birds monkeys uh deer uh and definitely that would indicate you know what's what's moving around and you kind of after spending quite a lot of time there you kind of distinguish where there was a tiger or leopard walking through the forest and uh eventually you know we would know where our black leopard was coming out and almost intercept him uh when he would uh come out and reveal himself from the forest so what was the reason for intercepting him as opposed to just going to look for him like we do here you know just it was so dense so we had to yeah because there's like this myriad of pathways in the in the forest um a network of pathways and uh he would uh just pop out wherever you never really knew but like once you started you know understanding that forest a little bit more you you'll start figuring out his patterns and his movements and uh it was quite exciting it's definitely not the easiest of subjects but uh uh definitely uh rewarding and challenging at the same time um but uh incredible animal to document as far as i know it's the first time a black nap has ever been documented wow she shits incredible yeah kids cynthia hill thank you so much for that we appreciate that um yeah and and i know you said when they saw the black leopard there would uh animals would get absolutely blackwell just nuts with the especially alarm calling it yeah the the monkeys when they when they saw him the longers and the macaques they would just they would just go crazy it's very cool so i'd imagine that um genetically you know you'd probably find more black leopards in a forested area than you know open savannah plains just because that dark coat is probably better suited to you yeah then annie saying gareth you have an awesome voice is that a private school accent thank you annie i went to lots of different schools public and private so that's what i owed to is a good mixture of both schools um brian's saying why do you think she is not feeding and party looks untouched really she's faded on it a little bit and she'll certainly feed on it at some points again today i don't know why she's not feeding on it right now you know she may just trying to see her barely she she doesn't look all that skinny so maybe she's just full from her last nail or it's difficult to tell at this at this point um you and kaplan asking can we zoom any further now i'll zoom in a little bit more i don't know i clear it gets what it is when i do that just bear in mind i am filming off of a it's not that thousand mil lens that the rest is using it's my cell phone and but yeah that's the impala up in the tree i'm just gonna zoom out but it's blurry big frank cleveland ohio when usa the leopard make the kill from ahmed ahmed i would say maybe early this morning last night sometime you know if it was last night probably have been fed on a bit more so i'd say early this morning and i don't know what route we were the last art this morning of all the vehicles i don't know what the other guys took but if this is one of the major routes out of the camp yeah i think we nearly drove straight bastard to be fair as well yeah i don't know how we like coming down that road how we didn't see it like it was straight in the open yeah actually we looked at the tree for a while and still didn't see hey we saw the kill and then it took us a while to see it yeah i think he actually called it in that there's an impala carcass in the tree and no sign of any leopard meanwhile the lip is lying right next to the carcass ref to hombre today's technology is amazing the fact that i'm in the blue mountains new south wales australia and i'm watching this live in africa it is amazing friday i say had his experience with the leopard when he thought the leopard was the badoon and then madumecha sebe i don't know if i'm pronouncing your name right forgive me if i'm not uh where is this park by the way we are currently in mala mala game reserve which is situated in south africa and we are wedged between the kruger national park which is probably our most famous national park and the sabi sands game reserve and um we have great sightings yeah giraffes saying lots of koala here and kangaroo but no leopards and brian asking is a black label still panthera partis yes brian that's correct yeah richard hurts is that a leopard in the tree it is indeed i know sorry is that a sleeping impala and just locked on is that it's a leopard kill in the tree yes also not quite sure how to pronounce your name um so how's the weather there usually well it's currently winter in the southern hemisphere and right now um it's quite pleasant i've taken my jacket all for us has not been wearing a jacket since this morning pretty crazy and but i was layered up with the beanie and scarf and gloves and yesterday morning was one degree celsius and near freezing um so it's cold in the mornings but by sort of nine o'clock ten o'clock it's very pleasant you know shorts and t-shirts where they're in the sun um and then in summer it gets quite hot it'll get up to 40 degrees celsius plus very often so we tend to go on game drives a bit earlier in summer where's in winter we can spend the whole day out and actually watch animals hunt at the midday which is quite exciting peck air force hello welcome then your hundred plus e asking looks like a sizeable impala uh do you perhaps know what the lipid power to weight ratio would be in other words how large your prey will be able to drag up a tree a kill like that um johanna can't give you an exact answer to that but what i can tell you is that they can haul kills up trees and their size or larger sometimes even and it also depends on the leopard and the age of the lipid if it's very old obviously it's a bit weaker and but in their prime they can incredibly powerful and given enough adrenaline maybe aina trying to steal a kill from them whatever they'll quite easily take a kill up a tree their own weight but um we have found one of our leopards here one of the bigger female leopards here the island female who and i had a cab recently and lost her car recently last year we watched the island female feed on in the space of two months three adult bull could use which is quite incredible i mean adult bull kudu is way larger than a female leopard and we although we didn't see her make the kill we can only sort of we can only think that she made the kill you know she's not stealing an impala i mean it could kill off of a lion that's for sure and i can't imagine cheaters had made the kill you know she might steal a kill from a cheater and i can't imagine her having stolen silent from hyenas even so we can only assume that she made those three kudu bull kills which is quite incredible for female dipper leon kaplan asking about the stabilizer it's a dji stabilizer and i just ordered it online impala is lying pretty similar to our lipids tend to sleep on trees with legs hanging richard hurts saying the leopards ever target smaller crocs like the jaguars hunt cayman in south america and leopards out of all the cats are probably the most adaptable species and i think given the opportunity they might do that and i think that leopards in different areas specialize very much to what prey species are available yeah they wouldn't need to attack crux and it's probably an unnecessary danger but i'd imagine if that's the sort of the only prey going around and that they may well do that i've seen leopards catch catfish here before or barbel so they they are incredibly adaptable and you find them in just about all different kinds of habitats from beaches three you know two highest peaks of mountains savannah woodland jungles and cities even okay syria russ what has been your best sighting you caught on film oh that's a tough one so just to just to make make sure that you know how tough this question really is um when dress films he spends every waking hour with these animals and he's been doing so for over 10 years that's a very tough one i i think i think it would probably be like the first time i've seen things like like the first time i saw polar bear um and capturing that on film or first time i saw black leopard um i don't know i i definitely say it's the first time i've done things not really uh moments but just being out there um and and witnessing some of the species for the first time uh that's that to me is really special so i mean black leopard is quite way out there there's very few of those around uh what other sort of rare species bay you've just mentioned yeah um i i thoroughly enjoy working in madagascar there's just something about it uh just because you know it's like going back in time and like these animals out there just totally used to humans like they're not they're not afraid so you can work pretty close with them but also at the same time i'd say um yeah it's i like tigers tigers were definitely high up on the list um there's just something about them uh i did i must have i definitely missed working in africa and lions to be honest and luckily i've been uh you know over the last couple years i've been making quite a few films on lions again so i'm quite happy with that we're busy making a i'm not sure if you guys are aware of the white lines and the kruger there's uh currently three of them in the wild only three free roaming white lines in the wild uh we're busy making a film on them um and yeah that's pretty exciting um so yeah i'd say of late uh just when it comes to rarities i'd say it would be the genetic variations that would be um quite something so like we went from black leopard to white lines um and uh yeah the white lines uh especially the one that we're following is i would say even harder than the black leopard why is that just because he's nomadic at the moment and they haven't established territories yeah well i guess so just to try and find him he's a young male in a coalition of five males and so if any of you see that young male white lion out there let us know so the dress can check him down later sightings has been really helpful with it so um you know he's often seen like around the s100 and something uh stuff like that but at the moment due to the pandemic we don't really know what's going on in the kruger but i had a team out there recently and they they were with them the first time he's been seen since march if i recall so just to give you an idea how difficult some of these animals are he's not easy then arjuna asking russ have you done any filming of snow leopards in the himalayas there are amazing animals here to see one no that's my number one bucket list of all to see and film just i just want to see one like like whether i film it or not i just have to see one and i think that is i mean it's a quite a taxing animal to go and view just you know i don't think it's you don't just pitch up one day and see it i think it's very cold and you do a lot of tracking it's on my bucket list in france asking hi how long do we stream for france you don't actually have a time limit on this i'm just gonna 24 hours 24 hours you know until the battery life dies yeah russell's got some serious battery banks so you can't make use of those but there is a leopard lying in the grass there believe it or not you can just see a few spots and it's think of any female she's lying right next to us and my universe are lying in the tall grass so you can't see them all that clearly right now and friday asking am i wearing my mushroom hat friday only after that live stream did i hear that you're chirping me the entire live stream and all my close family are very offended but no i'm not reading my mushroom yet um yeah so yeah we in a vehicle um which i think i might just give you a quick tour of satish kumar just hello there and then just before i give you a quick tour of the vehicle joseph zee asking russ what's your favorite animal oh my favorite animal snow leopard okay yeah okay so i'm just going to zoom out a bit and then and take you around this vehicle there are some bare essentials in here really done their trash trying to start lacquer eddie so right in front of me is this plate which is really getting in the way of my legs and what what is that used for uh we usually have a tripod head mounted on here with a crane that comes off the vehicle okay and that's just good i know you filmed quite a cool sighting here not so long ago and you used that crane and yeah we got blinds hunting buffalo yeah some very cool footage i don't know when that's what's hiding underneath there as well as a camera which is on the mount i saw on a mount there yeah ordinary camera no no no that uh goes from 50 millimeters to a thousand meters so and obviously the big lanes like that has to be well stabilized yeah and need a pretty solid tripod as well but this this whole system over here is uh sustained with power uh so batteries are usually a number of batteries and that camera is connected to those batteries right yeah there's a whole inverter based system inside there okay and there's also a fridge here for you for the long days and then some very necessary tabasco and msg there's an aramet on the roof there's uh something else on the roof yeah there's a there's a roof over us which is quite nice you're not eating that would be a disaster and yeah this is a seriously rigged art vehicle yeah she's got her head up i don't know if she's head head something there i'm sorry guys still leaning this okay so there you can see a leopard finally so back to the comments um i don't know how to pronounce that name correctly but hi from brazil satish kumar singh welcome joseph zee thank you very much asking all this help sia hippo joseph at the moment um there are hippos about could you hear them this morning you could hear them this morning but um they're actually quite difficult to access i guess she's moving a bit she blends in so well why don't you i don't know she's gonna go find a more shady spot yeah she's just gotten around the corner there right close to the road yeah joseph i think to see a hippo at this point uh would be quite difficult is not a lot of water in the sand river although we do hear them there's a little bit more tricky to find because you gotta really do a bit of off-roading to get to the correct pools and um right now this is a great vehicle uh i don't think we'd be able to get to some of those pools all that easily in this vehicle so we're not going to go and try just yet but maybe should she get onto the road she's just next to the road there give us some space and then we'll follow yeah we'll just let it settle down and then we'll see if she get a bit closer then richard hits saying have you guys ever seen elephants stomping a croc there's like five or six videos of elephants getting their trunks bitten by a crocs but never a video of them stomping a  or any other or any animal as a means of defense i've never seen an elephant stomping a crock that would be quite something to see i know a lot of people that have been killed by elephants have been stomped by elephants um i don't know is the volume better now guys see this is getting a bit shaky i don't know if it's just again that's a bit better when my mum charming in there no worries friday even mushrooms have mama fungi that love them thanks mom michael still morning from pe i'm guessing that you are related to robinsool i don't know all that many souls can you still see her she's still lying down there she's like directly behind the scary butcher just next door just some deep shade there sarah asking rasa in mala mala 4 not long enough i'll be here until the end of the month and then back again next month but um i think it's nice to spend as much time not many people get to spend as much time as you are spending here yeah and it's not a bad place to spend time at and then dive as i say after all this time uh you know chatting over live streams and on cell phones and the like that dave finally came for a visit here it's also nice to have nadav over seems like he has some lovely sightings as well yeah i think yes i nearly stepped on a few sightings yeah yeah the pathetic one yeah i heard about that and uh with a leopard staring at him or she was having a nap yeah swimming pool linda from california asking russ who are you filming for linda unfortunately at this point top secret it's top secret jar so you're just gonna have to stay tuned to rasa's instagram page to malama social media platforms and um later sighting as well and michael saying you robin's dad nice to meet you okay and then margaret mika how about a quick look at your guys faces no problem um it's i usually do this by accident now when i'm trying to do it i'm not quite sure how to but let's give it a go there you it's go and i so i'm gareth and there's rest okay back to the kill in the tree morning from maria and family from the netherlands would have been in south africa now had it not been for kerber 19 hopefully he'll be here soon enough yeah come to malamala okay so ron 707 slim just asking where the leopard is the leopard has just moved into some deeper shade just behind this bush here we're just going to give it a bit of time to settle down before we start driving around here again um so one of the things that allow us to view these animals at such close proximity is that we have very strict driving procedures around them and for many years we've used the very same vehicles and we approach the animals in the same gear obviously the engine raves at the same you know we idle into the sightings so the sound of the vehicle is the same we approach them at an angle always the same so they get very used to our behavior and this vehicle is completely different vehicle and so these animals are starting to get used to this vehicle i know and covany female is because russia spends a lot of time with it and but off the bat they won't necessarily be as re-elected on this vehicle as they are around our own vehicles so we also just take our time in moving about so we don't feel like we're a threat to them or at least she doesn't feel like we're threatened we take it slowly yeah so we will move at some point but animals come first yeah can you see the other hyenas okay so i'm just gonna there is one eye here i'm gonna have to zoom in where is it i can see it there and there it is so central screen is a hyena that's hit up just behind that stick there just a plane's real into truth will set you free from okay dory dory from portugal beverly williams do you have an idea on the left but it is the inconvenience oh where am i pointing this camera now it's the encore venue female um and she has been spending a lot of time around malamata main camp she had a cub recently whose densat was just to the west of our main camp and yeah she actually spends a lot of time in camp as well did you you saw a hunting camp did you not oh yeah walking past all the rooms checking in the windows satish kumar singh asking about anybody from canada asking are we to see a lot of rest over the next month well has business that he needs to complete so we can't steal him for these live streams all the time and but yeah thanks for joining us today i think if it's a little bit quiet in terms of you know animal sleeping he doesn't have to capture anything amazing then you might join us then tash saying russell you haven't changed a bit since primary school did you have that beard in primary school it's nice to see you on the live stream here as well tesh leonard bretta do you smell popcorn that's a negative no friday bye for now glad to have you back again yeah so at some point i think um we may have to call it a day here okay some margaret yeah maybe we'll go around and just have another quick look at the leopard margaret saying what was in that coffee ad this morning camera floating all over the place margaret my coffee is only coffee and the reason this camera is flirting all over the place because i'm reading your comments i'm not looking at where i'm pointing the camera so forgive me for that yeah i'll show you how gareth is doing it so yeah this is me reading comments the cameraman will probably be able to handle that better than i can and then asking what time is it currently here and ten o'clock two to ten yeah so yeah yeah the comments are um so forgive me i have to look down at the comments every now and then and then i'll lose track with animals though that handsome man over there okay it's time to meet her thank you love is getting quite intimate let's go and see if we can get that leopard for you guys okay she's just around there okay cecilia's saying no hope to see more of russ yeah likewise whoops something's happening let's just turn around over here there she is okay so just zoom in a little bit on it you know gina just saying the dove has been doing a great job with fundraising to help guides of kruger here on the dev um that is very kind of you and if you want to find out more about that i think you can see or read up all about it on the dev site website pam hudson welcome back in fact i think what we're going to do is um we will maybe just end this live stream shortly and should the leopard climb the tree and do something a little bit more exciting like feed on that carcass or anything else then maybe start again but uh if that's the case i am very much piggybacking of whatever russ needs to do here because he needs to get what he needs to get for his documentary that he's making and we'll be very much in the background of the live stream and so if you guys are happy with that and if you want to maybe join us for a live stream at a later point be sure to click the bell icon on latest sightings youtube channel and that will notify you as to when we go live again i'm just in the div putting the link there for becca buddy that's it does that sound good for you if we go live when something a little bit more exciting happens okay and then just a lot of thanks there cynthia hill you're welcome aisha murgy welcome beverly williams thanks beverly and it's nice to be back and to chat to all of you we've missed you and we appreciate all of your support and then just from russ and i'm going to try and do this turn around view thing on my camera again there you go have a great day cheers
