aneesa's the scam boola lioness has been mating with one of the guard males there's not a frame right now a long time since we streamed live and we are busy on our end and myself and let us know if we are live Sanford Drive coming north don't come from Sanford costing something anyone there okay the dove thank you saying that we are live folks welcome we are currently sitting with one of the Campbell lionesses at Mala Mala Game Reserve hey we can't see him at all hopefully at some point he'll stand up for some point we will see him we are on the wasting bank of the Sand River here and joining you this afternoon Mike about the name everyone and myself Gareth say it's been a long time since we are alive lost so please feel free to ask us in equations let's see Mike is just Friday's back good morning from the US pair Madson saying good morning guys love your videos from the ESA thanks Pam we appreciate it so in terms referring to is our YouTube channel we have been making videos in areas where we don't have cell phone signal say coverage is limited yeah but 10% of the property gets strong enough coverage for us to bring you these live feeds myself and Mike we're with the Campbell approach about 20 minutes ago and we did taste ran with Nadav find it of just to see if we could bring you the Campbell pride alive unfortunately we are just out of cell phone range so these two lines are quite close to camp and we are well within cell phone range here so a couple folks is asking about where we on what time it is so the time here is 20 minutes past 4:00 and afternoon maybe yeah at Mala Mala Game Reserve next to the Kruger National Park towards the southern parts of the Kruger National Park someone asking the exact GPS degrees minutes and seconds that I have no idea yeah we'll see if we can can find that out for you but if you look for skukuza in the kruger national park we just immediately north of that the effects of these three lions are there some alleys just work a nap so they have been so they were mating this morning and normally when the Lions are mating it's perhaps what averages maybe once every 20 minutes but on the hot day it's close to 30 degrees here and a hot day like this it's maybe 45 minutes to an hour but it is cooling off the sun's going behind some clouds so hopefully it all will see some action seen and I've just got these coordinates we are 24 degrees south or 24 degrees 48 minutes 56 seconds south 31 degrees 32 minutes and 82 seconds east so a question from Alex are these lines seeing you yes they definitely can see us I just don't care about us so we don't interfere or harm in any way these lines so they don't interfere harm us in return so respect that goes both ways a question from Daniel grant do you see sideswipe jack oh yes we do sometimes we actually see them more often than not around our a strip and then also in the north of our reserve in fancy cheetah welcome back so we this lion pride is that come with a lioness anyway as the konbu Laprade and then the the gari male and and the Khumbu Laprade in total there's 20 of them so she's got five sisters and then there's all their cubs and then the male's there's two brothers the - Gary males yes Pete is a guy that is in charge of our Instagram account from Tom some other guys will help if you've watched any of our videos on Mala Mala youtube channel you will recognize Pete from there and is newly shaven head pizza bar to join us in a second they are going to try and find some other game to livestream on Facebook so I'll get to have a look at him with these new haircuts you you Julian Huntley asking how far away are we from the Lions so I'm just gonna ask Gareth to tilt is fine over so that you can see more or less the distance of that vehicle edge and there's the line is so this is about as close as we are comfortably to these animals they sometimes will come much closer to us where the male's fall asleep again he made a video and he's hit is cold the temperature is starting to drop here but we are in autumn just idea asking do lions eat humans so yes they certainly have a long long history of eating we've dropped off the menu for the unfortunately for the last Wow but if they had the opportunity I'm sure they would fancy cheats are asking are there any Buffalo in your bar so they might be one or two old buffalo bulls in the area but well yeah there's very few Buffalo around and there's almost no herds of Buffalo we've got one head of Buffalo of about a hundred and another about 20 or so that we've seen this morning and but none of the big herds of Buffalo we usually see call that we're aware of anyway and of coming up with another five o'clock they'll get a prediction I think it would be more interesting to set your stop watches by that average 20 minute interval that the Lions have from one mating to the next that you'll see as a lioness moves maybe it'll attract the attention of that male Macchi asking with the Lions be concerned so yes and this male lion is one of the Geary males John to someone else's question he one of their brothers was actually killed by a snake it could quite possibly have been a black mamba though we're not sure we don't know and your handle is C welcome back to you and your family so Peter is just joining us now he's just come to pick up a battery bank so that his phone doesn't die should they find something to stream they can be driving around not to see if we can stream a second sighting live just arrived there you got it is Liam it beats getting ready for the catch from quite some way out the pitch I don't know if I trust you the statue back today but bet real try a second okay there we go thanks just to give you some context where we are and there's the Sand River here you're lying on the baked of the Sand River that's and the lines are getting up now I'm just going to just gonna follow that male lion I think he's showing a lot more interest anyways so the nice thing about their new sputters that we get to sit in the shade and then welcome back to mrs. Lapwing and everyone else just checking in with us so here we have one of the Gauri male lions and then the lioness is one of the lionesses from the cam boola pride that the rest of the Khumbu Laprade is much much further down the river I want to say perhaps six seven kilometers with the Heather Gary well as well but where they are unfortunately there's no softened signal so we did try we were hoping to to do the live stream with the whole pride but you are they just sent a valley so there's just no signal there I mean mrs. lapping coveting no way they have too many already so that is indeed the case so they've got the sixteen cubs in that prod sorry not sixteen fourteen it's just way too too many for normal pride to to feed but they have been doing very well with raising them so far but I'm sure any more little mouths to feed will be quite a strain on the lionesses there's a few questions here asking why the Lions aren't attacking us and these lines are very used to the vehicles around them they tolerate us most these Lions since they were Cubs have had vehicles around them and we drive in a very strict manner on them and they're completely used our prisons Jericho getting a little bit jealous of mrs. lapping they are see fancy cheetah we not sure when they lost mated I lost all the mating this morning at about 10 o'clock and I'm sure there's been shenanigans since then but you can see she's grieving herself and she's not fast asleep like the male is he might also be a little bit tired out now it's also like you can see it on your phone but it's pretty hot yet it has been a very hot day as well like so there's a lot of familiar names here welcome to you all and and I know a lot of you comment on our YouTube channel the ranges in isolation series welcome and thank you for all your comments we are very busy the side and if we haven't answered any of your comments yet we will get her on to it at some point and it's been a while since we lost live-streamed we have been very busy the side but thank you all for your support and a couple people asking can we feed them so that's kind of the last thing we want to do is to get these lines to associate us with food you know as much as we don't chase or harm or interfere with them in any way we also don't want them to you know we don't help them by giving them meals or chasing animals towards them or anything like that mainly that's actually just from a purely ethical point of view it wouldn't be fair on to the other animals to be chasing them or feeding them to the Lions all the time but then also we don't want the Lions to learn that we mean food because then what would happen is sooner or later that's not coming in to look for more more of that food the Friday yes you did make me laugh a with your pouring and urban comment so for those of you that are following our YouTube channel you'll see that I'm not a huge fan of rainy days and then I do flashback videos with that train coming here I'm planning on doing a couple more flashbacks to Ramana asking does she have caps no she doesn't she's the only member of her pride that doesn't have cabs all the others have got Cubs and they're all pretty much had three each and then one had four but there have been more less successful and raising all those Cubs and the question do we we've had this question a few times we ever carry weapons so if we're going out with tourists and we we will take a rifle with but as we are Gareth on are a pretty comfortable and confident with these animals that are not going to be an issue more dangerous in any way and also that aren't just attack they'll give us plenty of warning they'll show that they're very unhappy like now you can see she's just grooming herself he's fast asleep and doesn't care they were to get agitated should be whipping a tail around should also be facing us head down growling and there'd be a lot of very obvious signs that they are getting angry what is the feeling seeing a lion hunt well I think Maxine a lot more lion hunts than I have he's been around the block but longer than I have from my experience I can tell you it's an adrenaline rush what about you back is a huge adrenaline rush it is something to bear in mind seeing it lava seeing it on TV is an entirely different experience if you are watching it on National Geographic se or any of the documentaries that it's edited out the sound and a lot of the smells and the more graphic parts seeing it in real life is often harrowing as a term that could definitely be used but at the same time it is an amazing thing to see that venture man asking a can't see mating where is it that day I feel like the Internet is the right place to look for that type of thing but the Lions normally the interval is between all around every 20 minutes but I'm guessing now while it's quite hot - there might be as much as 40 minutes but this line is I've been grooming herself is definitely showing signs that she's getting ready to perhaps become active i mean christine prescott since lockdown you have anything different behaviour and the animals not really that is a lot less tourists around and you know just people in general the animals they've been carrying on doing their things for millions of years Mala Mala has been open and running from 1964 as one of the or we are the all this private photographic safari camp and in the kruger for about a hundred years now and you know but in the sort of span of time that these animals gather we just a little blip i think nature will definitely continue with or without us just a question about the male lion so don't if you can't see him if you look very carefully on the edge you can just see his backside in the grass so i'll see if i can get my finger he's just there the lioness the we just trying to keep her center of the frame because all your comments will be blocking the view for a lot of folks and so you adjust that you can still see her the no mana asking do liens really hunt in the evening so generally yes these ones were now because they mating they not really going to be actively hunting and that male line is going to be kind of lurking or immediately behind that line is the whole term so she won't be able to hand properly with him hovering around there so just to go back to Alex's question about wine T as many lines as Valle de beers because nothing is preying on the Lions so Alex a lot of the time those young lion cubs don't all survive because they just don't get enough to eat and in this pride there's 14 cabs competing with the with one another as well as the six lionesses and the two male lions so they there's not always enough food to go around and so some of the Cubs unfortunately do starve disease as a factor and then they do get preyed on as little Cubs bar things like pythons and crocodiles crossing the river hyenas and leopards if they find them and then also the lions are the biggest danger to one another so a lot of lions kill other lions and new male lions coming in will kill the previous males cubs so even though yes they are born into litters of three or four and there's lots of them not all of those will survive and the Lions themselves only have a pretty short life Marilyn is lucky if he gets to 15 and that's right at the outside normally it's 12 13 and the lionesses it's maybe 15 16 years old the oldest line is honor of here was 19 let's see what happens let's begin just careful laughing over the beanbag is sticking you just tell me if the nail stands up we just slack off without him so on this and Amanda's just commenting on how big that lioness is so the compiler prod is a prod of bigger lionesses the aunt was lioness we knew as Marcy Linus that was a huge lioness sure you've seen a couple of videos of a particularly big lioness with ox a tail that was quite capable of catching a buffalo bull on it and then Tyler Lee asking what is she looking at we don't know I think she's actually just enjoying the view oh but closer there in a second but I think she's she's just enjoying the view yourself to a hot day here and just taking in a bit of a breeze along the river I'm gonna move back there now and then Gareth will maybe be able to show you the awesome elephants drinking in the river a little bit further upstream miss an awareness of the mathy lioness it's not really the Salalah den lioness that's left nah it was the other one that died just more than a year ago but yes the same pride of lions that's affix I just hang on a second I'm gonna move back hopefully the mail will come in join her Arta not open there I think he's actually having a proper catnap so he has a notice that she's walked off yet I glanced over to the hedge we get we good just gets it up again quickie go to be fancy cheese to awesome a number of camera traps and one of the more productive cheetah area and the reserve we're hoping to catch some on there and then what we will do is perhaps put that on a video but if we can also just see which cheat are using that area will maybe go and try to to see them if we don't get to film them laugh unfortunately that area there's no cell phone signal and that will certainly put it on to Mala Mala youtube channel for you to have a look at in fact this river in front of this Campbell Elias is the Sand River if any of you were wondering just see the tops of them I'm gonna zoom in on the elephants a bit they are just gonna point as my finger they're right over there transy is flapping in the distance a any of you see that it seemed back out onto the lion Mohawk just helping us out there so that is correct Mala Mala we actually in between the sabi sands and the kruger national park towards the southern end of the kruger national park so just north of skukuza and for those of you that know the park really well so we stretch from suku sir okay so the male line of quani sorry Mike so the male line is just snuck up on us behind us here it's good show you quickly there he is we'll take him in for a little bit because we haven't seen much of him yet this is one of the gari males and so there was a question of these from the sand river mouth there is a sand river pride we see sometimes in the far south of the reserve but these males are actually from quite far to the north of us from the timber Vaati game reserve that are I believe and Friday saying Gareth do the hyenas eat the Lions or do you all take the body do we take the buddy I don't quite a lie on the quality if it does hey and no we don't take the body and occasionally younger lions might get killed by hyenas or if lions are numbered by mini hyenas but it is quite unusual for a clan of hyenas just to run in and kill a lion randomly it's usually a situational thing and Cubs will get killed more readily than adults but yeah we don't take the body that was the question right so that's true of all the animals that die here and just animals themselves in general if there are whatever happens to them is a natural thing then we just sell our nature to tell school and take its course anytime we interfere as if that problem is somehow caused by humans whether it's us or poachers or little that's washed down the river if it's somehow humans fault then we will do something about it but if it's something that happened in the course of nature then we just let nature take its course and then you handed Plessy asking about the rainfall so we've certainly we just recovering from that well a big drought that lasted perhaps four five years depending how you want to look at it this is the base the rivers flowed for quite some time it's also to go back to someone else's question why are we not seeing any buffalos because these Lions ate all the Buffalo that drought when there's no grass for the Buffalo to eat they're quite weak and the Lions just had a field day as far as the influence on the park we'll just have to wait and see this river you can see in the background the Sand River is one of the major tributaries feeding water into the Kruger Park you know without its water a lot of the animals really battle but often in droughts it's not so much surface water that's a problem it's food because there's no grass growing so nothing for the animals to eat but it is part of the natural cycle the to what extent climate change is rocking that cycle to its extremes we'll have to see in the future but we certainly are seeing an impact here and then forgive me for pronounces wrong beta L cos Maui asking if they're from the timber Vaati what could they be carrying the white line gene so yes that certainly is possible and we'll have to see over time perhaps we'll have a white lion born here when the sabi sands perhaps the male lions from this part of the world for whatever reason tend to all come in from the north or the bulk of them the gari males the Claridon male certainly the vocals the Avoca males that we see on the north as well so it's not impossible and they will have passed that gene on even though it's perhaps not expressed in any of the lionesses yet they are the daughters of those males and times you never know it's not not impossible that it is fairly unlikely sorry Friday so we misunderstood your question so the hyenas do also eat the the lioness is moving a part of it the lioness is just scratching now I'm not gonna put the camera on there just yet if she moves a bit more than she is currently then I may do you say but you just gotta hit up and scratching your cheek much like a dog would do yeah it seems like she is moving watch how the male is watching her see I left at he's hid there he's not gonna let her go very far okay so max just gonna give the smell line a little bit of room because he's gonna want to walk past us in a second just to follow this female so I'm gonna just get here in frame okay we had both in frame there but she's decided to move now savvy picturesque area this this road that we are on is called Sanford Drive there's beautiful views of the river from here so affects us while we were moving they are to put my phone down so I wasn't able to see your questions five just asking how much poaching takes place and unfortunately there is a small amount of poaching but we have many Rangers and wardens that are on the IATA that let's exit just forgive us are we driving along trying to film and answer questions so let's skip a few questions from time to time yes so we currently usually we have three people in the vehicle when checking mics usually on the comments there I'm usually on the camera and we usually have someone driving but tonight most the team have decided to go sleep out for the evening just to take a little break we have been working very hard yeah and say mostly Ranger if in the front there you told me I can call in Friday and Sammy J and we should still happening I never took my okay that gun okay effect so he just had a little glitch in signal there we are right next to the river so the signal might be a little bit player in this area so it's gonna happen they walk in front of Kent not saying put connection it's gonna check my how's it looking it shows is that we are live from my side but that's a quick connection okay signal isn't great but the video still game for most part thanks Robin so we got one of the ranges chiming in there saying that and the signals prayer but it's just Mike that can't read your comments currently because he's fine is struggling for signal so you can't actually see your comments right now so apologies if we're not answering questions right now it's just because we are struggling with a signal from our end the Dove just go live through his YouTube channel which we are currently doing and the Dove is the owner of latest sightings and started latest sightings in his 15 years old in 2011 it's quite a feat and yeah in the dogs been of great help to us all here we're not the most technically minded of people we are ranges for a reason yeah I've ever seen okay so that lioness is wearing the distance in front of the male and he'll just follow her wherever she goes yes sir mike is going to the default option of restarting his phone next step will be to put it in some rice yeah restart doesn't really rise in fact these lions are probably about just a few hundred meters south of sable camp and Mala Mala main camp maybe gay Paree connection is gone it looks like we sorry effects it looks like we doing better on the sack says interest today when she gets to the next crossing we'll just have to wait and see you can see the males Isis in marking while he's walking along unfortunately I'll have to take a while to go back to any questions or comments if you're welcome to repost them for that little five minute gap they're just where we are now like I said we're approaching the main camp which is in the Sand River Valley overlooking the river unfortunately because it's an evaluate also means the cellphone signal is not great but we're actually getting close enough to the camp now we actually might be able to just switch over to the camp - char from there the signal okay there it's seaspar from time to time but it's still okay is that's not our decision at all as much as we'd love to see all of you commenting and it might be easier for us to visit you than vice versa and then just a question on the remaining Tallulah lioness so she was seen I think three or four days ago learn about a camp that yashi from where we are now after then say yes some of the Rangers are sleeping out in the bush it's something that we try to do regularly obviously very privileged that we have a place like this to do that hopefully this lion and orey's rather than come and pay a visit but last City father had a lipid wandering around if you're watching any of our videos on ma Tomales youtube channel some of you may be familiar with Mel that she was busy washing her hands and that leopard was with with the water was dripping you know Wallace underneath her hands as she getting at it wait while she's washing her hands without noticing pleat break but if you keep an eye on our YouTube channel there might be an episode coming out and we're you know if they have filmed this night art it'll certainly show up on our ranges in isolation series on madammadam and camp where they are sleeping is an absolutely beautiful copy it's one big granite rock called mr. scorpy's and that rock will hold a lot of heat say they'll be warm for the first half of the night but the nights are starting to get a bit chilly I don't have will retain that heat throughout the night last time it's it and he did retain the heat throughout the night but the mornings at the moment are quite chilly okay which way is he going not not going to camp I decided to say we're they to continue down that road over there that would be right in front of camp Camp is where those trees are there in the distance and looks like the line is has decided to go towards the eastern bank of the Sand River so she's using the causeway to cross her events that I'm having to sum across crocodile-infested Sandra it was the Cub of the flock field female is a small lipid but a lipid nonetheless I think he is more curious than anything else you wouldn't let us alone so we did end up calling the sleep part off we did have a nice Bry for any of you South Africans would be familiar with the term Bry or barbecue while you're there and but yeah he just paired us a little bit too much attention so he decided to call it off for that evening I'll catch up so the rest of the prod is actually opposite to the direction these lines have been walking I think it's about five or six maybe more kilometers down the river I do all these lines on the honeymoon they don't really want to be around the rest of the pride for those of you that we're watching the live feed the other day you saw the two brothers had a little bit of a scrapper the lionesses as well although this particular line is in fact you may be wondering why we are always live streaming the cam boola pride it's because AHA signal our cell phone signal range falls within their territory so unfortunately unless they're in Karuma prior to its come far south all the tortured pride another play tortured and yeah these are probably there any lines that you can large stream for now that gas was talking about so he lives you look at a map of Mala Mala the sort of bottom right hand corner so I don't think any of you that follow the leopards and lions of the sabi sands area would actually be familiar with him because he we don't even see him all that much for those of you maybe that bit more aware of where rana walking safaris is I think he spends a bit of time there with his mom but it's not a leopard we see often okay so he's decided to try and catch up with the females right at the end of the course are there welcome back to starlings yes a lot of people I'm sure would love to sleep out in the bush it is something that we are all among so many things that we are privileged with that is right up there live from South Africa Ajay Singh and just a question about him limping so like I was saying earlier Hindman is brother did have a bit of a scratch the other day and but it's not unusual to see melons or any lions for that matter limping remember the size of the animals that they're catching things like buffalo zebra giraffe and that these are all big animals so as they catch him and they're wrestling around and banging into trees and the ground and so on or getting a kick it's not unusual that they will get a sort of a sports injury but where we take weeks to heal these animals take just a few days and I can almost certain that in the next couple of minutes if he does keep walking you're kind of walk off this limp there's been sleeping all day and stiffened up a little bit so you'll walk it off and be back to normal soon and welcome from Brazil you to be safe Florence question from Clive do you ever have to be with doctors when they're sick or injured I'll let Gareth onto that he knows our vet that we use often very well to say if it's an endangered species we might otherwise only if it is the injury is human induced so let's say you know an animal comes in and it has maybe an elephant as a snare on his trunk or something like that then we'll call in a vet the vet that operates mostly in this area or the company is wildlife it's and it is Ben Maller and Joel Elvis I know Joel's been here probably more than been and they do great work in this region not only in Mala Mala but in most of these game reserves at border Kruger National Park do I are interested in that I'd recommend following their Instagram accounts I think it's at Benton and Joel Elvis I think is at the conservation rate I think there's a couple of underscores in between the conservation and heel is a yeah so there was a comment on one of our YouTube videos and there was a line that had just one of the younger Cubs that had a piece of skin missing and a little piece of flesh was exposed and someone said why don't we help the first thing well we'd probably do you know more harm trying to help but then just letting it heal they heal very quickly and say that Lions probably you know that's little open wound is probably healed up already and you know to dart a lion and then to go and you know it's sort our two twins and would be quite stressful for the animal and it would only be under the very special circumstances that you'd do that all right so then there's a question I think for mrs. snapping how long have they been mating so it's probably since you saw them in that live feed the other day which was I want to say four days ago follow-on question miss Ana mandus is this a lioness that can't get pregnant and yes it is she hasn't had calves that we are aware of yet so there might well be some sort of problem but there's no way for us to know we did have another line is the I field lioness that couldn't get pregnant and that we only found out on autopsy she had a cyst on ovary so if X is the lioness in screen there and then marks just going to position us in icy air but on in the background on the other side of the river there is Mala Mala main camp and Rost at the swimming pool let's see if we can zoom in on us there having a good time they're obviously not watching us and then here's the male line thank you so much starlings and again forgive my pronunciation but may mean a shocking who decides where they will have the territories so he's got an enormous territory it's easily a hundred square kilometers but some male lines I think the average for the Kruger National Park is 200 square kilometres and then in other parts of Africa it can be even 10 times perhaps specially areas that are very dry like the Kalahari where there's not a lot of food yeah there's lots of food for the Lions plenty to eat so that I need particularly big territories but yeah so he'll be mocking all over the place wherever he is is his territory and as you can see they are actually quite close to the center of their territory now which is right close by to main camp there we see these lines and yeah these lines on a very regular basis actually watch them hunt from time to time from the deck having dinner with guests it's quite special okay let's get comfortable yet so the line is is continuing at the rates probably about a hundred meters north of him nah he's just keeping an eye on it for now and Amanda's asking about the cynical Bush male and did he ever smile at us I think you smell that every ranger that he's ever come across yeah we haven't seen him in a long while there I think he got beaten up a few times he certainly had an altercation with the maxims mill who was a new kid on the block last year the lioness is kind of leaving this male far behind I'm actually gonna just overtake him a little bit and see if we can keep up with this but you can see there's a great marketing shot of Mala Mala in the background with these lions walking past so that's maula maula main camp the oldest photographic safari camp in South Africa certainly probably the world.the there are other camps like the Kruger National Park that have been around much longer but with all this private self both fully catered garden camp get specially for photographers you can see why even on a sulfur and it looks great and one of the one of the reasons because you've been around the longest you can see I relaxed these animals are on the vehicles they'll just say you star presence which makes photography that much easier thanks and then just again if you can forgive us for not answering your questions as quick as we normally do just needing to always use my cell phone and drive which isn't advisable at the best of times but now with him walking along the ride and we having to offer it makes to him it's even more of a challenge there's some impalas that have been spotted these lines and are just busy snorting it then you can hear them alarm calling there she don't have visual of the lioness currently actually she might be in the groceries that Impala looking dishes this line is has got an Impala either side of a shouting it so this line is you can see she's not even attempting to hide she's not interested in hunting at all she might be wanting to fund her sister's we know where they offered she probably doesn't also a few of you'll be wondering why this Impala is not just running away as fast as it can't on the lion and the thing is lions stalk and then pounce on their kills as long as they can see her they're actually safe from her that's also provided they don't forget that maybe don't realize is also big hairline creeping up on them while they're looking the wrong way but I think he's got eyes on her more than on the Impala at the moment yeah this year's again so she's heading towards an area known as Piccadilly triangle and the area we've just driven through is known as Rhino pins those of you that have watched these streams in the past have heard about how white rhinos were quarantined here on this open field behind us in what's known as Rhino pens and were released when the White Rhino populations were very small after shish Louie net reserve had a very successful breeding program that came in quarantine the Rhinos yen released them from malamar a just opposite main camp I'm handsome that's a very good idea to get a hold of for my cell phone yeah push needle holders sleeping a mr. Scorpius nut yeah traditional sulfa and holders not prison there's a plan to be live-streaming Lions patrolling their territory three weeks ago certainly not fallen game drop and also I'm a good citizen and I would never use my phone while I'm in the car especially if our mom is listening to this lucky we're not driving on any roads much so there's laws I need count on the roads so Mike called it there and saying that she's looking for the wrist alliance can ya hear contact calling me or roaring hoping for a reply from any Lions and fortunately I think they are but far to hear that still a bit warm say the sound is not going to travel as far as it would it not I'm afraid the cam boola pride probably would not have heard that from where they are what do you think mark do you think they might have had their yeah she's pretty far from there so they Ross can travel quite some distance but I think she's worried think I just outside that range all right sorry Friday we mean battling earlier with the signal so you're asking if you could come here so effect so it's not the mail that's roaring I know some of you are saying a chats on the way so it's not him they're drawing it to the lionesses roar just as loud and we're gonna go try keep up with her so that you can see that drawing for yourselves and then sorry Friday we've answered what you started answering you so many times but if you want to come step by tomorrow you can get all of our reservations office otherwise if you are in the Kruger National Park its user and let Gareth and I know we will definitely try and come visit you for you coming here we can't guarantee that I'm afraid even that love it fax it you'll notice every now and then we just keep quiet and that is when the line is starts roaring so we're not going to answer questions whilst she's roaring ready rather let you hear her roar and and yeah we will get back to your questions if you if we did just stop mid-sentence it's because you need to listen carefully she might be roaring so niche the Mahna Mahna is in the southern parts of the kruger national park we are not next to or just to the west of the kruger national park just north of skukuza friday yes I'm sure you can message Pete on the Instagram account Estelle Sochi I think by choice left her sisters to make reverse mail his enthusiasm is obviously diminished a little bit I was expecting him to come following her behind there but obviously not so she's going to be wandering now to rejoin with her sisters there perhaps at their the end of their mating normally it's every 20 minutes for about three days on average and I suppose we are at the end of that three-day period now so she wants to get back to her sisters and it's probably gonna take her some time to get there maybe if they row and she continues in their territory unfortunately she's foolish in the northern end of her territory and they're all in the southern end I think she's seen something ahead a little bit quieter perhaps the area that they're coming up to is a bit of a big open area and there's normally lots of Impala and zebra that go and spend the night there so she's gonna be okay you hear the Impala this you know look at her tail flicking me she's quite excited and hello to Dolphin vac a dull and sweet t23 saying watch your back that's actually a good idea because I'm sure that is busy watching us Thanks unfortunately it's gonna be difficult for her to hunt right now especially this big clumsy male acacia guys like say there's nothing as saying a little bit earlier I don't think they're gonna have any luck hunting with here making contact calling she's leading advertising your presence for all to know might have heard the impart of snorting all around us yeah and obviously with us male trailing behind us but big and clumsy and quite conspicuous I don't think they're gonna be very successful at hunting now but she is actively calling this you're trying to find the race the pride and here we are approaching Piccadilly triangle we are currently on second turning Piccadilly and yeah you can look at that big head of impalas they will just standing by watching Lions will past say my kids in the way but David yeah no hey Mac you got it Thank You Marty no worries we were definitely sitting while the lion lion campus so Eddie loves wildlife saying laughing that name piccadilly so this area there's a hole and she's wearing it so they it's called Piccadilly triangle because it's like Piccadilly Circus and London it's just where all these words come together and meet and there's yeah there's a lot of game in this area saying hunting with the deep motor so as much as the liens and that are used to the vehicles so of the Impala and the zebra and all the other animals so whether we care or not yet they all completely used to the vehicles you'll notice the impala aren't running away because we here either they're certainly not running away from reliance all right and then for those of you that were wondering where the rest of the pride is I can say they're about six seven kilometres away on the far south of the territory more less in the middle of modern water if you're looking on a map and we are opposite our main camp but what could happen is as they go up this hill you can see there's a rocky outcrop up ahead she gets a little bit of height it's also cooling down now so that sound will travel further in the colder denser air and also now that she's up above all the surrounding bush she'll maybe get a bit more range on her rules and also be able to care the sisters roaring back from a much greater range so the cam Buller pride is named after these copies that Mark was talking about the way we name our animals is after a prominent feature in the center of their first established territories and the Cambodia pride are named after Campbell copies which is center of screen there and then Campbell as just is named after Campbell copies say we have one of the gari males and he's named the GAR email after gari farm you said the gari boundary turned north where his first established territory was him and his four brothers the cam bulla prides first established area central Mala Mala campbell copies so we're right in the heart of the Campbell prize territory not and then David that's right so the Kampala and civil fraud it's the same product on montemagno we call in the Khumbu Laprade whether these Campu copies is where they had their first Cubs as well when they settled on Malta Malta which is why we named them and they had those Cubs with another coalition of males the vocal males which are now referred to as the southern Avoca males so there are two sets of Avoca males - in the north as well as the southern one southern Avoca males that mark is just referred to you so the gari males territory is wedged between the two different states of america males asking how many are so I want to say maybe seven or eight if not more you go into Matamoros website you'll see we have our monthly game reports where we'll have a list of all the lions and leopards that we see how their ages there's an indication or where on the property we see them then Mohawk asking did the spots of fraud you said this territory sir yes they did and they were actually asked it from this territory by the Campbell alliances so like I say we call them come fuller because it's named after the couple of copies like sirs I never call them then civil fraud because there are six of them and six and Shang ganas and civil that those six took on and hosted the Computer Fraud and have taken over the attention completely sorry the are field crowd was parts of fry so the spots of pride that was the eye field pride right on Mala Mala yeah so if you're looking for reference to the Sparta pride on Mala Mala that would have been the I feel pride and this used to be their territory and then I know a lot of you out there will know them Apple cause they were born into the our field pride we used to refer to the map ojos as the milliwatt emails to get all of those game reports and then a question on how is the spots of fraud so they down to one lioness now sadly be hoping that they'll make a comeback but it's always hard to predict what will happen with these animals in time and you know 1011 years ago the our field pride was just about the same size as the Khumbu the pride actually and that's ahead around 20 lines that's a very large pride and their movements are very similar to what they come Bullough prides movements are now say in winter time they spend almost all of their time in the river where we've just come from wears in summer they they move around a lot more they cover a lot more distance a lot more range in winter they just waited near the river and wait for the animals to come and drink and hunt them from the reeds then not sure what the actual fishin is but a couple folks wanting to know about the price and that you can look at malam Allah's website and you'll see our reservations page there otherwise you can get hold of the dev I'm not sure if he is able to do any of the bookings through his site I know he does for the Kruger Park but I'm not sure about the private visit or otherwise Bradley taunted to come in to Ilya he has a company called Safari architects they also might be able to help you out so there's a number of ways to arrange travel but just where step one is just looking at my love mama and if you want to go to the web site and find those game reports just go to www.meliar.com/mpanel.htm so yeah right next to Campbell cookies now right in the heart of the Campbell a prides territory central Mala Mala Mala Mala is made up of five farms the northernmost farm is called I field and then there's mark Lee which is particularly beautiful if you have a look at one of our videos on our YouTube channel called a scenic drive with Pete you drive through Matthew lots of granite boulders then is Mala Mala which is a palm we're currently on and then this actually might notice that the feed is getting a bit grainy it's because it is getting quite dark yeah yeah although snorts around us it has all these in parlors she was stalking these team parlors over there but they are very aware of her presence they're looking directly at her and snorts snorting Eddy so the lioness is kinda lying just behind that tall grass there and the male doesn't seem to be helping matters thing they know I think what happened is the two male and Pato are busy having a bit of a fact between themselves and we're so distracted that they don't notice her until she was quite close and we also didn't notice him and no cuz you're with the male she's arranged quite far ahead and she's lying just in front of him a few yards hidden behind that little bush and the Impala I think are still looking at the male but he's only lying a couple yards from her so she can't move without him noticing and then Barbara's I think that definitely would be amazing to see a kill on one of the last streams it's bound to happen one day but closer there I think that was certainly the closest we've been so far we did watch the breakaway tortured pride hunter offs on one of our first feeds and the friendly I will definitely be calling bomba stations on this one yeah just like to give a shout-out to the Frankel family that's watching it's nice to have you all here joining aspects and we are in a very fortunate position here to view all of this live and we hope you're enjoying it just a quick question on where the Piccadilly female is from jaunty so she was seen two days ago and yet Polly where next to splice we suspect to be fairly certain she's got Cubs hidden away somewhere there hopefully we'll be able to show you them soon Gabriel says hi hi Gabriel Stewart arts high from the UK hello and then you know jaunty just saying if we saw bombas ranger talk for when we see a kill Oh Robin Sewell saying signal is spotty again yeah see it says per connection here folks if this connection drops you're in a prayer area I just want to say thank you to all of you for joining us again it's really a lot of fun to catch up with you in these chats and we are gonna try and live stream more often and it's been a while since we did last our last feed and we are being kept busy with all sorts of other things but if you do miss these large streams all you do want some more sightings you can go to our YouTube channel and have a look at tomorrow model gamers YouTube channel and you can see some more sightings there we have been filming in areas out of signal range so you can see and some of the sightings we've been to and thank you all for your support so far it's been it's been brilliant calling again if that's welcome trough girl thank you I know you comment on a lot of our feeds Eckstein here always in the chat room nasty nice to have you there's the lioness again in front of their line jazzy tears again starlings some familiar faces yeah I think folks we're gonna try for one last look at the lioness but if Gareth pans a little bit you'll see she's gonna go behind this big rocky outcrop and block the signal and she's roaring a last time for you it looks like she's done calling for now and then just again to Nadav he's been very helpful and has helped us all the way through this process and Nadav again thank you for all of your help behind the scenes and yaw we're gonna try and get more live streams going so stay tuned everyone laughter then thank you from myself as well at least just put the camera on like it thank you folks are can reading all your chats here there's a million of them and I'm sorry I didn't get to answer all the questions but yeah hopefully I covered most of it if I don't answer your question arts at someone else's perhaps it was quite similar but there is a lot of fun doing these things for your jfx I think that we're gonna call it a Nash thank you all and cheers from myself Gareth I look forward to our next live stream
