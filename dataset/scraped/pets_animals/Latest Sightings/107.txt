[Applause] how big is an anteater yeah it's probably the size of a uh talk but as i said it's difficult sometimes he's especially looking up from this far but probably like a medium-sized dog in science um so you'll actually find he's looking for too much so usually when you look around the african bush filter you'll see um these holes and stuff inside of turmoil around next to termites um so basically you'll find that they've actually dug those holes and tried to get those termites into those turmoils it's busy foraging just stay here you can see it's picking up some space so it's gone yeah so it looks like it's one note to the old fork but it looks like the bananas yep but wow look at this foreign
