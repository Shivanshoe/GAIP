right facts welcome back to Matamata very happy to bring you another live feed just a day after our last one we are currently sitting with a piccadilly female leopard and she has killed an Impala and has just started feeding on it says she must have killed this quite recently I'm going to show you these with us today in at some point but I think let's keep the keep the camera on the lipid for now but with us is Mike Hickman on the comments and then Nick Nell he's offered to help drive today and then myself Gareth for those of you that might have missed yesterday we were streaming a peck of Kay panting dogs or painted wolves and we had a great Drive and it's nice to be able to show you a leopard that's not lying in the grass that you can barely see [Music] [Music] and Richard and bond James Bond see welcome to Z 1369 yeah it's one of those so we're not sure when she killed it but we think it's probably with certainly within the hour and maybe even within the last half hour one of the guys is lucky enough to see the the tracks of her way she pulled this Impala across the road the drag marks and followed her in here but we just opposite Mala Mala main camp maybe 500 meters east of the camp it's gonna reposition a little bit and so if angel asking is Impala pregnant or just bloated so then parlor or give birth in November so she is just getting bloated now all the gases and so on that are in her stomach are gonna be building up and making a swell up like that it's not that she's pregnant and then someone asking and the telic clouds of any hyena in your bar not yet you know she made the skill we think sort of within the hour but it's so relatively warm it's just after 4 o'clock here or it's around 4 o'clock I think and so that hyenas aren't quite working up yet I think this Impala wasn't expecting a leopard right now as well she probably just had a good opportunity and took it but there are a lot of hyenas that live in this area so it wouldn't surprise me if high he no turns at and then this morning we're actually following a young female leopard in a very similar area and so it's not impossible that that other young leopard turns up but the Piccadilly female beat she catches her Mia Ferreira asking how old is the female leopard and she is born in December 2013 so it's just over 6 years old this is the Piccadilly female for those of you that might be familiar with the Savoia female this is her sister from the same litter normal corpse and some of things [Music] and then James and the asking which country this is so we in South Africa in particular we on Mala Mala Game Reserve in South Africa next to the Kruger National Park or part of the greater Kruger National Park but yeah if you google Mala Mala main camp will go on Google Maps and we just within 500 meters to the east of the main camp so easy to find Michael sOooo saying greetings from CV port Port Elizabeth Michael your daughter did not want to drive I think she's camera shy and you need to speak to her dizzi 13-6 not asking anymore son of the wild dogs I did spend some time with some of the other angels in that general area trying to see if we could find them but we actually got distracted when we came across the other female leopard we found this morning and a head of Buffalo as well so we didn't quite get time in the other vehicle in the same general area we're following wyan tracks and so we didn't really know we weren't really able to commit to finding those dogs not sure sanchez saying the impala is a paid actor well i'm hoping for the impalas sake it's being paid very well greetings from argentina Abel started asking what sort of range you leopards have so it really varies here I would say the average territory is about 20 square kilometers but if you go outside of this area that I like to the cape and some of the desert areas can be as much as 200 square kilometres but the leopard territories here are some of the smallest in the world we known for having one of the highest Leopard densities in Africa and arguably in the world depending on how you want to measure it and then just so for those of you just joining us we had Mala Mala Game Reserve with the Piccadilly female she's just caught an Impala about an hour ago and it's busy just starting to open up and feed on the carcass and you'll see she keeps plucking all the fur off so just like all cats at home and she wants to get the fur off because she can't digest it and if she were to eat too much of it should have to cough up a big fur ball and so she's trying to get rid of that first best possible before she starts eating and then so there you can see of plucking that off and then he will see she kind of uses the side of her mouth there and what she's doing is actually using her carnassial teeth so we molars on humans they don't have murders that have carnassial's and those carnassial's are what makes a carnivore a carnivore so for instance a crocodile is not a carnivore it's a predator yes but it doesn't have carnassial teeth so that's also why panda bears even though they only eat bamboo are still considered carnivores they've got the same carnassial teeth but she's gonna try to get to the liver and kidneys and that sort of thing all that soft juicy meat that's easy to eat and because she doesn't know when a hyena leopards lions something is gonna come and steal this kill from her you can see how she keeps looking around as well a few folks she hadn't where it is now can see she's kind of under some shrubs and hidden away from the vultures and that so she's pretty tired and now she's gonna try and wolf down as much as she can before she probably will put it up a tree or we hoping she will put it up a tree and then with lecture we for a few days but we look forward to seeing you next year Jonathan asking of any male leopard so not really in this area we in what used to be the territory of the Senegal Bush mouth but he seems to have moved his territory more to the west so this is almost like a bit of a blank area for male leopards but the her two nephews the sons of them somewhere a female have started to move into this area and we really hoping they're settled ah yeah so effects I'm gonna wiggle this around a bit I just want to get it a little bit more central so you can zoom in necessary gonna try that again while I'm trying this I'm just gonna show you the rest of the guys in the vehicle since I'm gonna shake it about anyway so there's my cane and Nick and then myself Gareth try and just get a more central in the screen here so that I can zoom in more sorry just pointing out this wouldn't be if it wasn't for hit or gonna dog so yeah the dog is the other member of the team here is actually a lot of to use his channel to bring you these sightings from Mala Mala and he's also extremely quick with putting on the we're going about this really backwards wave up what it's just you will get this okay this is a much better way to do this apologies for that like so hopefully that's getting me and turned it around nicely for us you can zoom in nice today but he loves wildlife you're right so the Impala Act has just simple in pregnant you can see all those intestines and everything that's kind of bulging out now that's because all the gas isn't in a stomach oh well those gases are building up in the stomach it's a stomachs welling and it's pushing everything out so remember with these animals with their four stomachs they produce quite a fair amount of Maryna clear return masking can we hold the camera steady we're definitely trying we're just trying to get a better image for you and there's a bit of a lag there and the camera is steady now we obviously watching it on Mike's phone and so I'm just actually refreshing my phone to catch up yeah yeah I think that's a lot better now is he saying she'll get popped it actually might well pop but very often the cats are fairly careful taking the stomach and all that art so she can't eat the chlorophyll and plants it's actually toxic to the cats that's why your house cat at home eats grass when it does want to cough up a fur ball and it's an emetic it makes him sick and just easier for them to cough up that fur ball so she does take the stomach arch she's gonna be as careful as possible not to get the stomach contents all over her meat so she will be fairly careful and also just a smell of that will probably attract hyenas a little bit quicker than she'd like them to get here Megan hot lockhardt hyena could definitely take leopard on one and one so I've been lucky enough to watch this leopard since she was a cub and she's actually a little bit braver with hyenas and moist lipids or seen her actually go out of her way to kind of almost pick a fight with them but a hyena after that kill is going to be so determined and that there's no way she'll be able to fight it off and she can't risk an injury so she'll have to kind of give up and while UAE so I'm actually not sure the father of these Cubs we think is a cynical Bushman and sure if I remember correctly it's a Senegal Bushmen that we haven't seen him around for quite some time I talking about the father of favorite angel crabs yeah yeah say I think the lost well she is matching with telepathy estimating the sin of a bush male and then his current nervous male in mathy that she is seen mating with as well thank you for that start eyes and the omma asking when will she next eat so assuming that she does have a good feed and is able to move this kill and put it up a tree without it getting stolen by something else and she might be here for another two or three days and before she's eaten this and then we'll look to to feed again where we are not actually rot on the riverbank and that is a got a big density of Impala here so it's actually not impossible that even while she's eating this one another one will kind of blend it into her on one of the sort of main game trails leading down to the river so she might catch something quite soon and that yeah that's I would say probably in the next two to three days we're expected to try to make another kill or go put an effort into making another kill but again because this is such a high traffic area it's actually quite likely that other predators will come through here and probably steal this kill from so Sammy Jane asking where's the nearest hoisting tree there's quite a few south of her so on the screen what would be sort of behind and to the left of her the one closest to us it's a bit iffy but she could use it I suppose and but about a hundred yards further south is quite a lot I've actually seen her with kills and some of these trees south of us and as luck would have it I'm in the process of editing a video of her new mom when she was still a dependent cub her mom caught an Impala about a hundred metres from where we are so if you gone to Mala Mala as YouTube channel it'll probably be up in the day after tomorrow and you can have a look not that she contributed much a mum caught it and then she just ran in and started eating before there bothered dot but interesting video nonetheless it read CATIA asking which park is this is Mala Mala Game Reserve and we are part of the greater Kruger National Park so we boarded the Kruger National Park as well as the sabi sands usually when I do this it flips around yeah so that's it's quite hard to actually round right now that yeah we in a sort of relatively what properly called low felt Bush felt so there's just trees all our answer there's no big views of savannas but you're also closer to the river bank of and River so this quite a few big trees around Philly buddy you some of you pointing out that you can hear actually this tearing sound you can actually see she's also lapping up the blood coming out of that Impala now and Renick asking in the return if you ever got a flat tire whose job would it be to change it so as with all things it's a shotgun rule the last one to shot shotgun not is the one responsible for changing the tire it's a very mature approach that we take to these things Sammy Jane asking what spot patterns for her it's 3-3 and interestingly the sister that Camila PES as Kimberly life as is referred to has a to to spot patterns they're both little mates and it's a three three spot pattern for the Piccadilly female is just a two two spot pattern with with guess maybe tend to be more successful leopard so the more symmetrical their faces are the more successful they are we're not sure if that's just coincidence that it's worked out like that better otherwise there might be something to that can we look and Kimberly Lopez is just in the north of the property along the moitie River and dizzy sang my unions got a smell it but now it is quite possible just test on there she's squeezing out all the pellets there those of you curious about what and impalas colon looks like she just swallowed it there Sammy J I'm asking how many Cubs has she had so she's had a couple but none successful unfortunately we suspect she has Cubs now but we we just don't know the area that she has a scabs in or suspected to have them in is this very very rocky area there's no roads or any real access in there the last time she did have Cubs there we only saw that cabin is about four ish months old and it's just too too difficulty to get in there Mark Jones asking water lipids eaten Roman packs so lions do and that's it's just a different lifestyle that these different animals have they're kind of they are hunting predators here like the lions hyenas and the Cape hunting dogs and then you've got the solitary animals like the leopard and the cheetah just after different things different lifestyles then Xiao asking leopards don't need organs so they do eat organs and the organs are actually very important to eat because that's where she'll get all of the vitamins and minerals from today asking there's a blood act like water so I'm assuming y'all meaning can she drink it in place of water so she certainly can drink it and I think if we were to drink it a lot of those salts and that would make us pretty thirsty at the liver and kidneys and the cat seemed to handle that water loss and absorption a lot better so she can drink it in place of water for a few days I think the lipids and some of the desert areas might only drink once a week or even longer than that we we would die in the same situation would wild dogs give a feeding lipid problems as disease so yes actually were you not starting Nick when she got to kill stolen by the dogs I forget exactly how long ago but I want to say five six months ago she had a kill that was pretty fresh like this one stolen by a pack of wild dogs first lady sharks can can a leopard eater rotted caucus yes they can and I can eat an extremely rotted carcass at that that would make even though Ines blush James Richard asking have where any recent sightings of the older sister the EMSA Queenie female so Nick who is our driver actually found them so Queenie female this morning and what was she doing Nicholas she was also feeding off oh she had an Impala Ram killed stashed up in a tree a lot of hyenas hanging around yeah so the same thing but 24 hours ahead but hopefully that on a nick got a quite a lot of video of that so you'll put it on to malta Molly's YouTube channel and again in the next couple of days and you can have a look there if you want to be notified just like and subscribe and press the little Bell button the same is with these live streams that we're doing so we can't really live stream every day unfortunately we have to help the animals or somewhere where this signal is because Gareth on are using our phones to do these live streams luckily his foeman has an excellent camera much better than mine but if you do want to be notified at the last moment when these last streams are happening and just like and subscribe and just press the bell icon to get the notifications of when the the last streams are happening but generally we try to do them in the afternoons so between 4 & 6 South African time : yeah asking can she eat the whole thing if she wanted to in one sitting I don't think so : maybe maybe a much smaller I don't even know if she could eat an entire Impala lamb in one sitting but they're definitely not son of rain do you think she will eventually hoist the skill I think if she wants to hang on to it she may have to waste it at some point and yeah if she leaves it on the ground yeah especially when it starts to get dark and the temperature cools a bit and the smell carries a bit fare there it's very likely that I he know any other predator might come and steal it I can't see any vultures actually at the moment and you can just see from the shadow she's in she's actually underneath quite a dense patch of Bush so I don't think the vultures would even be able to see unless they're very lucky a few people have asked when this Impala was killed there's probably killed but I think within the last two hours about two hours ago one of the ranges here the other Gareth G nut found drag marks crossing the road and followed them and found the Piccadilly female you there yes we we we do Filmore for scenery and quite long-distance shots of animals we try not to be too intrusive with the drones and some of the animals like the leopards we actually we haven't tried but it's also we suspect that they wouldn't really appreciate it some of the other animals where the Impala just ignore the drones completely they don't seem to have a problem with it giraffe the same buffalo don't really care about it Lions don't doesn't bother them so it does seem some animals just don't take note of it I think if it's like they're not used to being hunted or threatened by things in the a birds it's not a feature for them to worry about welcome Maggie and Gordon and then Blackman link is saying I love the Nick when you cook it tastes beautiful and father does taste quite good Forex gold so asking cannot defend itself from a solitary hyena so not really so that high you know we just ran in grab hold and almost just completely ignore her while it's stealing her kill even if she were to swatted once or twice I've seen ah he knows just shrug that off as if nothing has happened just trying to drag it somewhere okay take this let's gonna see what she's up to here I think she's just trying to bury it deeper into this thicket as opposed to taking it to put it up a tree you can see how very camouflaged she is in there first lady shot asking half a deleted record teeth while eating the hard part of the meat suppose I start impossible but it's not something I've actually notice we see sometimes lions missing teeth watch how she's covering up some of that blood day she's very conscious of the smell that it gives off but you know something like a lion that montt get kicked in the teeth by giraffe or a zebra or something is far more likely to lose a tooth she can't remember off the top of my head seeing a leopard missing one of its canines sometimes as they get old they just get worn down it's gonna reposition this again it doesn't look like she's going anyway national park next to the Kruger National Park she killed some part of will just be myself a little bit and then presumably other moves they killed at the tree or possibly bury it where it is if she still feels it's a bit too heavy to fit up the tree and then it's not impossible this lipid we think has got some cab so she might want to go back to those Cubs to give them a feed and then return if she feels that her killers safe the Cubs themselves we don't we haven't seen them yet but we don't think that particularly old and they're not yet at an age where they're gonna be eating meat so she's unlikely to bring them here but would just be way too risky anyway you'll say we'll just see if any other predators turn it really wouldn't surprise me if any hyenas came through it's a relatively cool day here so the and the caucus is fresh that's not really smelling but hyenas have incredibly sensitive noses so that blood that is out and exposed now you could certainly attract them and Heather Lily just asking who is the father of the Cubs presumed to be so we think it's a single Bush male but we we may be wrong we actually did a project while back with the organization called Panthera where we were collecting leopard scat to get DNA samples to see which leopards are related to who and so on and the leopards that we had listed as the mothers and fathers purely through observation we were about sort of just past 90% accurate with who the father was the Senegal Bush male is a pretty good guess that there's a small chance it might be another more nervous lipid we sometimes see and her territory who we don't I don't think we even have an ID photo of them because it keeps running away we haven't really named them as a result the angel asking what's the smell of a leopard and they don't have too much of a smell you can see how she's grooming there they are very clean and it's really important that they're do groom and keep themselves very clean fiercely for hunting they are solitary hunters I expect a little bit about the predators that hunt in packs leopard hunts by itself and that's why it's so camouflage and when it's stalks it has to be really careful that it doesn't get snagged on the grasses or any plants so it's quite important to have that nice silky smooth keen coach they're not quite as smelly as the pack of wild dogs we saw yesterday first lady asking who gives the names of the leopard cubs so we don't name the leopard cubs until they are fully independent and have their own territories so her cubs we will just refer to as the Cubs of the piccadilly female and once and then perhaps later the son or the daughter of the piccadilly female and then once she gets those Cubs have the own territory will name that after a feature in their territory so the open area behind us is called Piccadilly triangle and it's smallest in the middle of her territory which is why we call it a Piccadilly female in Chong just asking what's the exact location on the map so the easiest way is to go on Google Maps Google Mala Mala game reserves you'll get a little pin there and then we are 500 meters to the east of that pin and we had just on the other side of the Sand River from the camp someone was asking how far is the nearest water and and that is just a few hundred meters away and there is a pool of water maybe 200 meters away and I think that's actually where she caught the Impala when it was coming down to drink Mellisa grub asking how old is a live stream for year it's about 30 seconds old I see that's the lag time from when we are talking to when it shows up on mic screen so we are actually alive and it's not very old at all I think all of the world's carnivores are not considered endangered if anything the leopards are doing the best of any carnivores and and you get them right across through Africa except for in the middle of the Sahara Desert and the normal and then you even get lipids through into Asia and in the past that go as far as the Baltic and then to sort of the southern parts of China it's a massive range could a cheetah breed with a lipid naturally an awesome middle boy said no they're quite different species they wouldn't even really be able to interpret the signals from one another to say like this females and season and approaching mating time and that and then leopards actually each cheetah so [Music] you know the odds of any sort of natural interbreeding are so slim and that's limited a lot body behavior I wouldn't even get the opportunity to make with one another never mind even understand the sort of languages they're speaking and then Melissa grab we did misunderstand your question there these large streams have been going since I would say probably what mental you know much so from probably from about the beginning of March no end of March say we've been here for a while now and kind of least tracker time here but yeah so we've been going for about a month and Nadav has currently let us stream on his latest sightings channel and we are streaming live from Mala Mala Game Reserve Megan Lockhart asking or Indian liquids the same sauces African leopards so I don't think there's a huge size difference but the leopards in this part of the world do tend to be quite big I think the smallest lipids are the ones that they see in Israel and those lipids I think are a fraction of the size of the the African lipids that were like this lipid so they I think males are sort of 30 fully kilograms where she's probably 60 ish kilograms well no maybe 40 50 kilograms and males are between 60 and 70 kilograms sometimes much bigger in this part of the world Craig Peters asking how often do they kill so that's normally about every two or three days depends on what size the last thing they killed was and how much of it they were able to eat before potentially got stolen you know asking what is the most common animal leopards hunt and out of the antelopes definitely impalas but they catch more scrub yeah I think they catch a lot of scrub is that we don't see in it just because they tend to catch them more at night and we only drive a little bit into the night but out of a larger species certainly Impala we D and Washington asking we'll still be able to run last dreams after the lockdown is over so gas can answer that because he's been dealing with the admin like a Trojan yeah we are planning on doing say you know we at the mercy of our president at the moment and of course at the mercy of this pandemic that is worldwide I think the tourism industry will be one of the last if not the last to open in South Africa so locked on maybe a little bit longer for us than most other places but yeah we certainly are aiming to continue with our live streams and potentially our videos after the lockdown Jonathan asking can a jaguar mate with a leopard and so not in the wild cuz Jagger's from South America all the you actually used to get them into North America as well I believe there was one scene not long ago in Arizona that you know they wouldn't actually come across one another a lot of the animals like tigers and whatever weird names they come up with for these animals those are zoo animals where the it's very unusual and natural conditions where they are mating but it's not something that would ever take place in the wild one of the reasons loggers get so big is that they're actually they missing one of their chromosomes because the two species don't quite match up chromazone one so those loggers are actually eternal adolescents so their pituitary gland doesn't switch on and tell them to stop being an adolescent which is why they grow throughout their life and sadly that constant growth makes them very very vulnerable to cancer so most of those animals don't lead a full life and normally die of cancer that a relatively young age first lady siya asking how often do we see honey badgers we don't see them all that often there plenty of them around we see their tracks almost on a daily basis they are for the most part nocturnal animals and like I said but earlier we don't drive around all that much or fighters often at night as we did during the day some of you guys have just asked about these vehicles driving around and we are continuing to have to maintain the property and there's two tractors that wasn't drive by earlier and another that's just driving by and you would have noticed that the piccadilly female that pickup ahead I think someone said that they are used to the vehicles and they are indeed and but they certainly more comfortable with the vehicles that we take game drives in just because they know how these vehicles will behave around them and for many many years you've been driving in these same vehicles in the same gear and all of the vehicles have the same engine so they're very used to the noise of this engine as opposed to a different vehicles engine be be asking do lions leopards considered lions as enemies yes they definitely do the Lions would love to steal this carcass from her as far as we know there's no Lions in this immediate area we're in the middle of the Campbell er prides territory who if you go back on later sightings videos a lot of the live streams I think all of the last genes with lions in fact have been of the cam bulla pride they just happened to be quite far south of us at the moment and so I think she'll be lucky from the point of view of avoiding lions the most likely thing to steal her kill at the moment is hyena it's also getting a bit late on in the afternoon this is about the time that the hyenas are gonna be waking up also the scent of this Impala is probably wafting out slowly sort of is a widening circle so at some point to another hyena might realise and come and follow up then in MIDI boy 3 that's how you pronounce your name or your handle how come lipids are doing so well as in in a population rather than other cats so lipids are highly adaptable cats they eat a wide variety of food from insects through to fish Beauty anything that can anything they can catch really and because they're solitary they're guess they're catch or they they get less attention and there's a program the BBC documentary and one of those I think it's wild laugh in cities one of the wild if wild if episodes where they talk about the lipids in Mumbai City and that it's one of the densest populations or leopards in the world and yeah so there go unnoticed they're very secretive you can see how camouflage this lipid is here and as marks really said you know you find them beaches and deserts you know and cold mountains and the savannas they're just incredibly adaptable cats in asking what a vet ever intervene here so it would very much depend on the situation so if very broadly for the most endangered animals we will help them if we can if it was something man-made we would definitely help but there also needs to be a bit of understanding say for instance she were to break her leg the only way to practically treat that would be to catch her put a cost on her then put her in a cage with a cone around her head so that she wouldn't chew that plaster cast off and then feed her for that six to eight weeks until that burn hills and then we'll potentially release her somewhere and she is not gonna like any stage of that process you know a lot of these leopards that have been caught and traps and so on to be relocated they die from the stress of capture they often smash the teeth on the bars you know they're incredibly aggressive you know they see it as this constant attack so it's hugely stressful on them so we we try not to intervene as hard as it is particularly with the leopard like this I've been viewing this family of leopards now over four generations since I started here in 2002 so I used to watch her great grandmother and then of obviously a grandmother mother and I've viewed her sisters all the sisters and cousins and that of the year so you do form a bit of an attachment to them and so it is difficult sometimes just to sit back and watch but at the same time it's a wild animal if you know nature and sadly has to unfold as it does now this Impala was on the sharp end of nature taking its course but it does mean that she gets a meal and her Cubs get a meal if she breaks her leg and content and does that means the Impala won't be caught and eaten and its youngster survives you have to kind of weigh up the value of one laughs against the other welcome Dave see you've just tuned in and then earlier there is a question from Maggie and Gordon we have not been into the Kruger National Park there are certain the lockdown conditions and but I don't believe there'll be much change in animal's behavior with fewer vehicles around we haven't seen much change here at Mala Mala whatsoever wolfy some asking is there a reason she started in the stomach area so partly that's got to do with that's actually the thinnest part to get through so if you think about the sort of anatomy of that Impala going through the belly the skin is relatively thin and once sort of behind the stomach and intestines is the liver and kidneys and heart and lungs all the nice soft bits and trying to go through the ribs and that is quite difficult like to crunch through all those ribs on that is going to take a lot of effort and and also kind of from the back end all the the hands the sort of backside of it is all muscle and then and so not particularly nutritious so for her the stomach is the sort of quickest simplest option to get at all the internal organs as fast as possible because also she doesn't know how long she will have this kill and we haven't seen any other predators around no sign of vultures or Hina's yet but that doesn't mean one can turn up in the next 30 seconds or 30 minutes we don't know Bryan Elmer so yes this is the Piccadilly female again for everyone that's just joining us this is the Piccadilly female leopard John Mala Mala Game Reserve in the Kruger National Park and she caught this Impala around four o'clock our Tom I think it's not only I think probably about 3:30 yeah three oh you didn't sure what the time is now so help us for now yes you caught us about an hour and a half two hours ago and so then she pulled it under this tree she's eaten a little bit of it now she's just sleeping it off and digesting a little she'll maybe have another feed and we hope think she'll actually put it up a tree and that way we will be able to see over the next two or three days hopefully if another predator doesn't steal it if it's up a tree have shiny has to worry about other cats so Heather Lily asking how many litters has she had so her sister the subway female has been quite successful and has actually raised one of her cubs to adulthood and she hasn't been so lucky and it's kind of a catch-22 so she has one of the best leopard territories in the area because it's such a game dense area so it's where the manual 80 sand Rivers and Milwaukee Rivers all joined together as moralistic over territory but because it's such a game rich area it means there's lots of other predators around so she's lost her cubs to other predators her sister there's a boy a female lives in a lot less game dense area but as a result is fewer threats to her cubs so she has been a bit more successful and her older sister them so Queenie female has likewise been a lot more successful and raising Cubs because she lives in what by maula maula standards is a fairly poor area as far as other game is concerned Alec's question asking why is she breathing so heavily and that's partly just because she's full but she's also had a big meal so she's hot as well so she's just kind of breathing heavily to cool down I don't sweat like we do where we cooling down our whole body she's only cooling down off of her her tongue and it knows that she's panting welcome Luca the roof Verushka larger asking will she bring the Cubs here to feed so I don't think so her cubs are very young we think probably less than six weeks old so they not yet eating meat they'll just be drinking milk it's normally from six to eight weeks that I start to have their first meet and then normally from sort of six months I fully weaned and all exclusively eating meat but you know the Cubs are or where we think she has the Cubs is actually pretty far from here so it wouldn't be very safe for her to move this distance it is a bit of a worry though that she is not far from where the Cubs are well we think they are so hopefully nothing has happened to them but also for a leopard to leave their Cubs for 24 hours isn't unusual even when they are young because they do have to sort roll and maintain their territories I don't think she's aware of it but this morning we saw another young female leopard in the same area and who's probably taking advantage of the fact that the piccadilly female hasn't been patrolling as successfully and welcome back miss and am Andrus so Gareth is actually looking to see at the moment with the binoculars if she does still have sack on walks yes it's very difficult to see we are sitting very close to her but it's actually difficult to see if she does have sex a Kobach's sock I can't say yes or no at this stage Wow cat babies called cabs and not kittens asks disease 1369 and to that I actually have no idea maybe one of you guys can giggle giggle at RT and they desune someone's just sighed because they are big cats maybe that is the reason I've died yeah the Cubs father in their life was here deadbeat dad so I'm gonna say he's going along the lines more of the deadbeat dad because he just kind of left the territory and we haven't seen him in this area for quite some time now but it does seem to be very variable her dad was a leopard we knew as the airstrip now is very easy to identify because he was blind in one eye and but he was a particularly successful leopard and but when they were young you know her sister the savoia female were very young he used to spend a lot of time the more you know male lipids don't likely the Cubs around them but he would be calling them and then as they approached he'd chase them away and even when she got a bit older it often trail along behind her and just kind of keep an eye on her and maybe watch it so I'm not sure what his motivations were but some of our lipids are very good try and buy some more quick and then keep while I'm talking nothing is too short but I think there's lots of people that we are kind of the second a good second choice um I'm hoping so it's not impossible and it normally doesn't happen there because from cab hood to adulthood is normally about five years before they of age before they actually mate so it's very very unusual that a male leopard is able to keep a territory for five years and for that reason they are not normally around when their own daughters are available to or become available to mate it's a very similar thing for lions as well they just not around long enough to just kind of see it through you know and perhaps say two five six years of holding a territory that's why the cats also have what seen by us as a very cool habit of being the cubs are sort of three four years tops to successfully raise Cubs and most cats are independent at two so independent that too but breeding at five and that way they kind of avoid inbreeding and that because if Cubs are on there never sort of in East West by the time they've been replaced and he doesn't want a wife two of his four years raising someone else's Cubs so they do just kill the other liquids or lions cubs Jonah short asking what area we're in today Jonah this is a Piccadilly female I'll give you one guess in one case only the clues on the question into the 1369 asking if I saw some aji nose through my binoculars relatively thick for sure but I don't see any eye Hina's around currently meter Quran so the kill itself is just kind of - there to the right of screen it's hidden in some bush it's not a particularly exciting thing to look at at the moment but maybe we'll zoom out in a bit and you can have a look I meter how old is this leopard 2013 December 2013 she's six years and four or five months so pushing on six and a half years and four weeks called that is a franklin in the background and then Jared right now but there's also a parrot screeching somewhere a brown headed parrot so it seems like the cab kitten thing is gonna Don T's size and the origin of kitten is late Middle English and Chris I kick asking when leopard hangs a kill up in a tree how many days before she won't eat due to the meat going rotten and so it actually there isn't really a limit the meat will kind of rot and fall out of the tree before she won't eat it I've seen leopards eating some pretty horrific smelling meat over the years but something like this she will probably put it in a tree at some point if it isn't stolen before then and but once the stomach contents which is maybe sort of about a third of the weight of that Impala she can't really eat because it's the impalas full stomachs and it's intestine that's just full of vegetation which she's not interested in and then a lot of the weight is also the skin and the bones and that's say she eats about a third of it that's she'll get through that really probably in the next two or three days and then the scraps that are left up in the tree when she moves off maybe Eagles the hooded vultures I've actually seen Janet's liber8 kills from leopards before while the leopards were sleeping underneath the Janet's come out and sneak a few bats but she'll also be obliged to leave at some point to go and get a drink and this leopard in particular probably has to go back to her Cubs also within the next 24 hours at least she may well have to move at some point and then other predators will probably sneak in and steal it pet even just saying a big thank you to us thanks pet we really enjoy these live streams and we glad that you guys can enjoy these experiences with us bond James Bond so no dry-aging of Impala wonderheart dry-aged Impala steak would taste like dry aged Impala steak is a very popular snack here in South Africa we call it ball tongue and it's very good Lance Clark asking is she vulnerable to hyenas because she's so full so she mark I would say if anything just be a little bit more sleepy because she's full and maybe not I wouldn't say she's more vulnerable lipids are pretty sharp animals it might get a few steps closer than if she was up and looking around but also any hyena coming in nos gonna want the Impala doesn't want her so the impalas got quite a big piece of free meat day really where she is gonna react really badly to an Impala nibbling on her so and she'll probably hiss and growl and that but she she'll have to back down and because she's relying purely on his self for hunting she can't afford to get into any kind of fight with Irena potentially be so badly injured that she won't be able to look after herself and her cubs she the sensible thing for her to do would be to back down wixgold saying bolt song inventor it is a good combat if you enjoyed frothy beer yeah bond James Bond beef jerkey is nothing like bull tongue bull tongue is about a million times better star Patrika asking who is a favorite African predator so for me it's 100% the Lions Nick what's your favorite African predator takes a second choice leopards look how boring they're just sleeping Lions would never do something like that I'm gonna go at Lipitor wild ugh it's a toss-up preferably leopards and wild dogs in the same sighting keith picard asking there's a leopard 10 to eat the high affect parts first so not really so she's after the most nutritional parts and more from the vitamin and mineral point of view so the cats can't actually generate their own vitamin so they need to get it from their food which is why it's really important that she eats the liver and kidneys and all that as well not just the meat of the impala if she were to be purely eating the meat or that dry-aged ramp we're talking about she would actually get the lion or the leopard equivalent sorry of scurvy so it is important that she eats the whole thing and also important that she eats it with the fur on because that furs what's brushing her teeth and keeping them clean as well so Whole Foods really for leopards the their definition of Whole Foods and ours is quite different hey have you ever eaten guys ever eaten impala meat and I'm gonna answer that with substantial amounts Nick have you ever eaten Impala me I think people eaten a lot of Impala meat sadly for them follow they're actually quite delicious okay yes you guys again see if she's gonna move it or maybe just needs more just excuse the wiggle again hold it's my hand for now you for me you we'll say if you want to catch up with all of email he's actually neighbor or a neighbor to the Piccadilly female she hated she is just on the other side of the river so if you want to go and have a look and we suspect she's also got Cubs if you want to go and have a look at that video please do on Malta Marla's YouTube channel [Music] although leafeaters and razors of youngsters the Leopards not so much can take a leg or the head of some other animal that they've found or quote back to their den for their cubs to chew on with the lions and leopards and cheetah tend to bring their cubs to the kill I think for her because she has an alternate way of storing it by putting it up a tree or maybe burying it under some leaf litter and in a thicket way the dogs can't really do that that and have that ability so storing it inside of their stomachs is probably the best option for the dogs and with lions as much as I love them they are quite greedy selfish animals so they all just eat as much as they can so the Cubs just need to bail in and feed as much as possible you'll see folks how she keeps looking around because she is getting quite a way that now at sunset the Sun is just about to drop below in the mountains it's quite likely hyenas are gonna turn up it's it's not so much equation as if as of when the eaves and or threat to her Heather Lily asking how big is the Impala compared to the Piccadilly fear bus times yes Shafiq let's see if she's gonna poop coming out there you it seems that she must be facing this way she did look up she's heard something behind us she did turn around and look in that direction earlier so you're not gonna take the camera off of her but quite far behind us to the north of us is a rocky outcrop we know as Campbell copies it's the same Campbell copies at the Campbell apart of Lyons is named after and there's a lot of hyena that sleep in the day kind of on the slopes and in the valley in front of that so if I Hina's gonna appear from any direction I'm guessing it's gonna be from behind us and also where she killed the Impala is also behind us and she dragged it here about 100 yards or so so that scent trail that was created is probably also gonna lead the impalas into this kill miss and Amanda is asking is Piccadilly she's not huge but cheers off and go boson female and she was in a very very large leopard Cheers she's probably probably the most successful lipid here at Mala Mala in the sense that she raised very many cubs to adulthood but one distinguishing feature of this leopard is that she's a very dark lipid you look at the top of her head there it's almost black he's got a very dark top of the head neck and back asking are there any king lipids in the KNP so there have been sightings of King cheetah which is a much more strappy than a spotted coat I've never heard of a leopard having that type of a cut but the closest leopards get to that would probably be there's been reports of what's called strawberry leopards more red than the sort of yellow with black spots they're more red though strawberry colored with black spots I'm assuming the strawberry also referring to the role black pups that you'd see on a strawberry that the other option for leopards is to be a black panther so what's properly called a melanistic leopard but neither of those we've seen here on Mala Mala king cheetah has been seen on Mala Mala before and very fortunately and coincidentally it was when Margaret Thatcher was visiting Walla Walla we saw one here and I think that was in 1980 or 81 so a very very long time ago being very considerate to the angle she's giving us today I think the last time we live stream dish is lying in a patch of grass for about an hour and we couldn't even see it at all the star Patrika asking with a Siberian tiger kill lion easily or hardly so I actually used to look after a number of Siberian tigers and I can assure you that they are much much bigger than African lions but no doubt the Lions and put up a bit of a fight and Forex gold just looking on the bright side there Zara asking why is it shaving it and so that so that she doesn't eat more fur than as necessary so she can't digest that hair on the Impala if she does what she does eat and also what she licks off of herself of iron fare while she's grooming it she will have to pass somehow and other Passard normally when she poops it up or if it there's just too much of it she'll have to cough it up as a fair ball so she wants to avoid that as much as possible and so she old try that Dillon Morgan welcome back this is the Piccadilly female and she is was born in the same by 2013 so she's just over six years old it's saying a Siberian tigers have a lot of fur on them to make them seem bigger so yes that's true but I'm certainly one of the few people that can sell had to pick up both African male lion as well as a male Siberian tiger and I can assure you that a Siberian tiger is a lot heavier than a male lion and even shaved with fur or not [Music] let's take leopard would camouflage in the dense jungle and that is probably very very true certainly I would agree with that a black leopard here just would it would stand out too much to really be successful where one in the Congo or the jungles of India would be far more successful and able to blend in a good ending it's sort of one of the grassland cats that we get here kind of cheetah but you'd in the mall sometimes and they called server line servals in so and for the same reasons we wouldn't see a black servile here because it would just stand out too much in this dry grass but a black servile in the Congo rainforest would be able to get by just as well has a normal colored one like so the Sun is set now and the temperature is dropping very rapidly as it does here in autumn or winter and you can see the Piccadilly female is looking and she was a or try and protect this kill from any other predator jonathan asking have you seen a king cheetah so much for not in the wild I've seen them at some cheetah breeding centers but I don't know of any king cheats are being seen in the wild certainly in the last decade so I sitting here we're just starting to get our first real whiffs of this Impala as she's opening it up that much more it drop out from time to time will give us if that happens hopefully it's just buffering Buffalo you mean a really newborn calf when we had that drought on 2016 that actually did happen one of our or a pair of cheetah brothers managed to kill a often buffalo calf here but it's normally they wouldn't even get the opportunity because the rest of the herd would be very aggressively defending that calf but because it had been often it was far too honorable but that little buffalo calf was much smaller than this Impala was something the cheetah were quite capable of catching Colin fear asking to let its digest fast yes they do and a lot of animals have a much higher metabolism then then we do but there are shield I jest or can eat that whole Impala digested and turn it into muscle and we would be turning that into a spare tire around our gas if we wait the whole thing if angels saying that Impala look Impala look skinny now let's go to our diet having a most effective lapis action ever John Forex call just commenting how bright it seems on the camera but fortunately Gath has a very good camera on his phone anyway that can it makes it seem a lot brighter than it really is but the Sun is set to a while ago now and the temperatures dropping very rapidly now but the yeah I think it's gonna get dark quite soon so we actually go into the shadow of the Drakensberg mountains here so it'll probably be dark in the next sort of fifteen minutes now welcome back to super bikes yeah probably the the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever heard of the sighting was when the coalition of lions some of you may know is the mappa horse we knew as the moitie male lions five big male lions I think 60 started but they tried to take over the Styx pride probably about 11 or 12 years ago not and yatras three lionesses of the Styx pride stayed behind and fought these big these five big male lions whilst the other four Lions took the capsule for the property and just you know just lie and stink flick flex everywhere and just boxing all around the vehicle just quite intense for me well you know I think one of the most intense sightings is watching the maxims male leopard come up the tree the agility that male leopard showed in the trees was just unbelievable I think for me if you go into the Kruger sightings channel and look up lions catch buffalo amazing ending for me that's probably one of my most spectacular sightings that I've had video just look up lions catch Buffalo amazing ending obviously watch to that amazing ending and you'll see what I mean it was pretty spectacular the interesting question what is your favorite predator but not from Africa for me I want to say I'd love to see my my bucket list thing to do is to watch the bass catching salmon in Alaska so I'm gonna put Grizzly Bay on my list but purely because I want to see them because I also love catching fish I think on it a a Jaguar yeah tigers in India Tigers a good one yeah there's a lot of goodies out there didn't you what was that lipid that he had a altercation a clouded leopard that was supposed to be unconscious wake up while I was holding it and was my heart to flatter a little bit luckily it wasn't too big I have you guys ever visit the Pantanal so that's where gas is gonna have to go to see the Jaguars hard left we've been joking that hurt once an oscillation lifts we can go and travel to more places and do the ranges abroad traps can live stream grizzly bears and jaguars and and heidemarie saying a snow leopard in the Himalayas so one of our ranges Daniel Bailey actually just won a competition to go and well a photographic competition and he won a free trip to go and see the snow leopards in Nepal and we are all extremely extremely jealous because that's also must be spectacular we quite interesting to see if she is gonna move this caucus at all it's a lot lighter now than when she started also she wants to take the stomach contents ah because she won't really want to lift that into a tree if she can help it and I've just commenting wow what a prize for Dan but your honor that maybe you must speak to Dan and ask him if you can do a flash stream from the poll for you if he ever does he has not lifted Columbia asking or lipids a basin is out of all the big cats [Music] I don't think so I'd say of the big cats that we get here the lion leopard and cheetah I have seen lipids swimming a little bit more I've also seen lions sleeping in the in the river again there was another interesting sighting I had if you look up Lions beach day on this channel you'll see a video of the Lions all sleeping in the water but up I think fishing cats are probably going to be the best swimmers but you only get them in Southeast Asia but there'd be more likely to swim and Andrew Milliken saying it's looking kind of gray stay with getting into the caucus but yeah so this Impala has been some time now but she is I think that or sliver that carefully you can answer that question we are class are we to the leopard I'd say [Music] maybe six or seven meters away how does it smell this actually not sup too bad the small breeze is wafting away from us but every now and then it circles around and then we quite away father died awhile ago and caliper asking was important Lionel when it was killed or in a group so this is a female Impala so my guess is that would have been part of the hood but we are in the rutting season at the moment so there Marilyn Paula chasing all the females around and that's what might have happened is one of the male's tearing around running after this female might have chased her right into the thicket where the leopard happen to be sleeping but leopards are just so alert then such switched on animals that she wouldn't she would have seen it as a golden opportunity and maybe just snag the Impala she came running running fast to where they kill happened was around a small little waterhole so it's also possible the leopard was just lying in wait at the water hole for our victim Brian Gilman pointing out Jagger's are strong swimmers and hence the caiman in the Amazon so yeah suppose of the big cats the Jaguars in are definitely gonna be the the best swimmer certainly if they're hunting regular in some pretty spectacular videos of them hunting caiman and capybara are skiing or ranges allowed to wear fragrances or does this affect the animals so we insist that the ranges where some sort of fragrance otherwise their fragrance of fins other angels but yeah we try not to interfere with the animals but I don't think they really care too much what we smell like we're not really a concern for them but very interestingly and it does sound like a joke but apparently leopards really like one of the Calvin Klein fragrances I can't remember offhand which one but the cape leopard project where I believe putting some of that fragrance onto the traps when they were catching the leopards to color them for research for whatever reason the leopards really loved that Calvin Klein fragrance and would actually often come up to to check and then one of my more interesting days yeah I actually put some Calvin Klein on a cotton swab and lifted in the road that a leopard was walking down to see if she would well he would react in any way and sadly he didn't so I'm not sure if it's an urban legend or not or Bush legend enough maybe someone is sucking up and come on climb and start Patrika asking what if the Impala players did like a wild dog and the lionesses mouth so and I've can may be there for anyone else to watch but I'm actually not sure maybe just been knocked silly when that lion grabbed it but part of the reason these cats have whiskers is to help them navigate in the dark but it also helps with placing their bites on the throats of these animals and then they can also with those whiskers detect things like the heartbeats on that because when she's grabbed that Impala it's obviously striking and kicking and that but it will pass out and faint away before it actually dies so she needs to know the difference between when it's died as opposed to passed out and a lot of that information is going to be passed on through whiskers like feeling that pulse and that movement so playing dead isn't really gonna help an impala interestingly with the cheetah it's something that I seem to struggle with a little bit more but it's not unusual for the young cheetah to catch something have it start and they're not real to see that yeah it does you can see a little bit of the now we can smile at facts life is deteriorating very quicky it's starting to appear very grainy it is much brighter on the screen than it is here you a little while longer you you and Thank You bond James Bond it's buying that's when an answer to your question they hunt s Lawrence geniuses hello Gareth he learns and learn inside and look at your montage it was great like I said especially like that but no it's a little bit late I think I think we are going to call it an evening I just want to thank you all again for joining us this evening stay tuned or keep an eye out on our YouTube channel find it and see what remains yeah and but I think we're gonna call it a night for now so we could show you this even though we're out on the edge of this range and then just to show you the faces behind the voices this is Mike in the neck facts and goodbye thank you for joining us and Nick enjoy and then for myself Gareth stay safe and we look forward to our next stream which is
