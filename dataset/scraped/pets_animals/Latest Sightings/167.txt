signals good signals good and my side it says alive and the damned if you out there and it if another to live and we are live there we go folks welcome to Malta Malta Game Reserve and we are currently sitting with a Campbell pride there is a gari melon area here and with me today is Nick driving my Kirkman the coming see and then if you have a look in the background there's a whole bunch of other ranges is mulgarath liam and yaku all busy filming and they have been here for a while before us and they've been filming these lines over here so for those of you that were with us a few days ago when he saw the two gari males scrapping we are not far from where they were escaping we are in the exact same Road probably just 200 meters down the road I need of nice to be back live with you there again seems like the sunrise talking talking we do over the live feed so the way that of the last few days has not really been too fantastic but today has been great like I'm just gonna zoom in on these two lions closest yes which are grooming is a message from h h BG h JH g seller for everyone in the team so everybody in the team I'm not gonna say that name again but he's alive and I've had to UT LA I think you should change your name on YouTube it'll be a lot easier to talk back to you there okay he has the delegator these when they might get active game say the dev is saying he says 5:00 p.m. they will wake up I ollie from the UK Ollie Ollie from Moscow and Slovakia well what a diverse audience so far in the chatroom Germany sir Olli Olli asking how covered 19 has affected Krieger and we are not in Kruger National Park itself we border the Kruger National Park we don't we haven't been in there since the lockdown and so I can't give you first-hand experience of what is happening in Kruger National Park however here at Mala Mala we are running on a skillet to stuff and we are very lucky to be in this reserve over this period we couldn't have asked to be at a better place and we thinking of everybody else out there and there's a lot of you that are in small flats and everywhere is closed so left kids in lockdown that's right there you go that's peach that peach is currently and sitting back at the office wishing that he has a peach I'm having to eat it Pete I feel like you should be editing instead of starting on father Gary Mel's there and so when we were here this morning he was one of the male's was yeah that's him this afternoon my guess is just lying in the shade somewhere for those of you that are just joining we currently have two lines in the frame but there are more I'm just gonna zoom out so that you can see them all upset zooming in you're fine okay there you go if you look on the road you can see there's a bunch of lions lying on the road there as well zoom in please they have just seen dot I will zoom in in a moment Dave hi from Ohio yes a also working and watching the stream nice nice to see you there so Pete's saying we must keep it tidy I'm from Germany Sybil Pam Hudson welcome what are these Lions eat these days they're actually looking fairly well fed but not quite fat bit of ground where we are they've moved in quite a large circle and that mall is back where we left them the other night two nights ago so in that time I want to say that walk maybe 15 20 kilometers in a in a circle but you know what they ate on that loop we just have no idea Patrick again it's gonna zoom in on these guys over here Patrick saying that he loves the channel Thank You Patrick we appreciate that you can see and the team is here working on more videos for the channel I'm not going to show you the film crew just yet just cuz you got to one-line standing up which is quite exciting when they're all lying down like this and there's one railing over that's the more excitement right there Patrick De Santis asking if we've seen that walldog slightly so we saw we wear with a pack if you go onto our laughs dream on Krieger lights of sightings look up at the old live feeds you'll see that afternoon we spent with those kept panting dogs at the Mala Mala a strip and we have read mula from Johannesburg South Africa local nomura from Pakistan walkin Malaysia what pride is this so we are currently looking at 19 members of the Kampala pride the cam bulla pride actually have 20 members we do not know where the one line is there are six adult lionesses in this Pride and fourteen Cubs so for now this one adult lion is missing and I believe I wasn't taught this morning but Mike was it was a gari male in this area big male lion and we're not sure where the second gari male is so Forex gold asking why do the cat sleep so much partly it's because they can and also these lions if you think of the type of food they're eating so that eating meat which has got a high energy food when they do eat they get a lot more energy than say Impala would eating just grass which grass and leaves is very low energy value that they're getting from that food so they have to be a lot more active where the Lions have these big meals they can spend two or three days digesting it and you can see how they're sleeping you know artic Spurs and the open they don't have to worry about things they are the things that you worry about so you know they don't have to go into a den and hide away or sleep up a tree likely a leopard would you know they are just big confident animals someone saying hello from Turkey say Peter can say hello and Turkish back to you if he's listening Christine Prescott welcome so Christine asking do we see the Salalah female lioness so we do we actually saw I think two days ago just upstream from our main camp but her a Cubs cab basil doing well Pippi in cricket four weeks ago Aviation Diaries welcome hello there's Pete trying his Turkish merhaba mehmet yeah so you can hear that max Pete's flew in Flint Turkish and Pete can type it Mac and speak it speak it better on a Saturday not Ifrah Michael Oklahoma hi starlings so a question what is the temperature I'm not entirely sure but I think it's probably sort of mid 20s that was a bit cooler today and and now it's actually really nice Pleasant temperature so the hopefully that means the Lions get up and active a little bit earlier than normal you can see there are a few grooming here center of screen there's a couple little being creaming for the last few minutes Michael doors hello welcome from island love the lines my paw hole we used to know them a poco a lion's as the moitie males and they were quite intense lines franca Culp enjoying while having a ball of popcorn having a barbeque in a short while so we call that a Bry and we left prize begins asking all the Lions real yeah we you're pretty confident the real it so far all evidence has proved that they are Karen Bianchini I love the South African accent that's good yeah what is your distance from the prod I would say we perhaps five meters from the nearest one that's a bit harder to see it in the grass yeah and and they is the one scattered around on the road and then we suspect this or more even in the thickets that are going to be off to the right of the screen there for you Karen Bianchini hey what about Chicago Illinois USA Donovan hello from Wisconsin one point seven degrees Celsius here no thanks we'll pass thank you we are the male lions edge maybe not quite sure there's a lot of Gareth from the other vehicle saying there's a lot of little ones and I'll try and zoom in at least on one little line that is a male you can quite clearly see so there's a young male central screen he doesn't have the big main like an adult line would have from the heart asking what would we do if these lines attacked randomly so the Lions don't just attack randomly you can see they're all fast asleep now they're not showing any signs that they even care that we're here but if they were to get angry or aggressive somehow you would see them standing up facing us lots of growling tail swishing ears flat back not too different from an angry house cat or a dog at home you don't need to be a animal expert to read that behavior but that give us plenty of warning before they're dead attack and in that case while they're giving us all that warning would trust the NIC to get us out of here safely fortunately the hair that has never happened I've never attacked their vehicles but we do get some lines that just aren't used to the vehicles coming in from the kruger national parks bigger wilderness areas and those we spend quite a bit of time at distance acclimatizing to the vehicles they normally because they're just not really big confident animals takes between six months in a year before they accept vehicles after that they just ignore us and be part of the scenery welcome Jonah short see there is a question a bit earlier from Belinda from the UK asking how old are the cabs so there are five different litters of cabs here three cabs in one of the litters are 1 year 9 months old and other three cabs from another litter 1 year 8 months old cheek herbs from another litter when years 7 months old and other three cabs are one year six months so there's letters or any amount apart the phase four letters and then there are three very young cubs not very young but ten month old cabs and the size difference between those and the other four letters are quite considerable seven years old yeah sorry folks I was just checking up there there was a question on how old is the oldest lioness on Mala Mala and that's lioness from the our field prodigy I think is 16 years old and she's used to actually live in this territory that the Khumbu Laprade took from her or move the eye field prod out to this far south of our reserve so we don't see them that much it's quite a long drive to get all the way down there and the gentleman that was speaking about them a polka was earlier they were actually born into the our field pride Thank You Johnny short thought I was right also consulted our resident expert on the liens Gareth mathil Smith at mrs. left-wing welcome back again thank you for joining us on each of these feeds other to Bradley Thomas from Safari architects so for those of you done in South Africa we have our own special languages house it means how are you well how is it I think yeah welcome John Tobias as well John T is an amazing father and a new father for all of you it's very tolerant of his baby daughter screeching so they're 14 cabs in this part of lines what has been your favorite male lion coalition of the years or max been around a lot longer than I have so he's got more to choose from yeah they kind of toss on with the questions where the way street mouths fathers of them opposed yes they were and they might well have been some of my favorite lines cuz those were just big solid male lions and then a bit later on we had their Claridon males which were lions that came out of some kids cartoon book they just looked so lion ish like if you had to draw a lion that's what it would look like but those two males with these big beautiful male lions there Claridon males welcome Brennan Col Dillon Morgan how many females are there there are six adult lionesses in this pride really asking do they have Cubs yes they do the balconies that you can see on screen are Cubs are up between a year 9 months and yeah and 6 months old and then there are some smaller ones that are about 10 months old it's just hard to see them in this long grass hopefully when the Lions stand up and get moving we'll be able to see those smaller cups but there's no really little Cubs at the moment so the F kin from White River now living abroad welcome I grew up in water there jaunty I hardly believe that one is still going he's quit a good innings in and if that's the case just went I see cougar sightings on a dove is chiming in every now and then and he's been of great help to us on all of these live broadcasts just thanks and a dev my story you mentioned if you want to get note notifications just click the bell icon just in case any of you guys missed that and if you want to get notifications on when we go live click the bell icon mmm rice sod you just cancel your trip that's a pity hopefully you can just delay it a few months or I have a long attacks and still do that trip in the future welcome back Friday get back there film crew I'm just gonna before they leave I'm just gonna point the camera at them so you can say goodbye guys trying to sneak away okay they're gonna go find some more game to film and say if you do feel the need to find any more videos please look on our YouTube channel these guys have been working very hard getting all that footage just guys waves to them all so Friday asking what did he miss out on oh not too much they've just been moving around a little grooming themselves this is the cam boola pride again one of the Gary Mel's was with him this morning you just haven't spotted a me at this afternoon I suspect he's just lying in the shade somewhere very often these younger lions hassle the adults the males tend to go and sleep somewhere separate not too far away but just that the Cubs aren't bothering them lying around where they are immediately really asking are there any perches in this area and the sad reality is in all of these conservation areas throughout Africa and there are perches and there are different kinds of perches some poaching is more organized than other kinds of poaching you know some poaching is with snares to try and catch smaller antelope and the like for the bush meat market and then there's more organized syndicates which perch larger animals such as rhinos but yeah wherever there is wildlife there is poaching and that's just the sad reality reality of it at this moment and everybody is trying very hard to protect these animals and we are - yeah and thank you so much but bet we actually look forward to doing the broadcasts every day ourselves gets us out of the house and it's not she's chatty a few other folks and thank you so much Terry Golson so Sara asking is Malvo any female member of staff so no she's not we've got a couple that two of the female ranges are on leave at the moment if they're watching I think Robin and is all you can say hi and then we have a few in camp as well and well done for recognizing Mel they obviously you've been watching our channel thank you so much cement V I know you watch our channel and come into in all of our videos welcome nice to see you here Debbie is just saying thank you and Gaby we appreciate the support John Tobias asking before I go I cannot pan around to figure out your position okay good luck with this one okay so I'm gonna zoom out all the range is watching let's see he gets us first so let me go this way around this is more natural for me there you go Robin so saying hi hi Robin are you missing you missing all those ranges that are home now and Zegna skillets and stuff here at the moment and yeah we thinking of everybody at home I know everybody would love to be here thank you a GT highly appreciated thanks to dev Danson week also I can't see that Marilyn yet so we hoping he's gonna pop his head up soon Oh in fact we're all hoping that the Lions get up and do something soon BC wildly incorrect but the effects if like what a the dive kicked it off earlier with guessing the Lions we're gonna wake up and get active at 5:00 if anyone else has got some guesses and let us know the time here at the moment is 4:30 it's a bell saying we are told to stay at home and how come we see tourists and came drop bells unfortunately there are no tourists here we wish they were and all the people that you see here are ranges that work here and we have remained on the game reserve and you know the there are some critical functions on the great game reserve that need attendance and we have remained to continue working here during this period Joe this there we go so you got a nice explanation from Joe I didn't have Charles watching and but thanks Joe for helping read a art and yeah we each other I don't know if you are watching but we did I gave you instrumental out over this live stream apologies if you didn't want that to happen but we think that you didn't very valuable work in this area so we appreciate it and we feel what you're doing needs a lot more exposure okay so we since I'd much a pity somewhere jaunty you've got the river correct just which side of it Sam okay the range is ever dot must @e Tartars I don't know about that Scott saying I'm oppressed you have the bandwidth to provide this clarity and yeah so we we unfortunately the coverage we have yet any covers about ten percent of the property and so there's a lot of sightings that are happening on Mala Mala that we don't get to live stream and a lot of those sightings you can find on our youtube channel and we have gone out and filmed them so if you do want to see what else is going on in the property please feel free to go visit Mala Mala gamers youtube channel and thanks so much go on from the hot Big Smoke hey how is luck down in your location I don't know if he's speaking to us but we feel very fortunate to be an at malum allah with thirteen thousand two hundred hectares as our backyard so we are thinking of everybody that doesn't have access to nature at this point that is very seething having this on our doorstep a lot to go for drives to squeezer no we have to remain on our property we do border the kruger national park and we are very close to spook easy and squeezes just south of our southern end of the property but yeah yeah I've seen it does our two dead already Friday modern mall is not fenced we fall within the greater Kruger National Park and so there's no fences between us the sabi sands manye Leyte timber Vaati game reserves classy real going all the way north and then we open up into Mozambique and there's a little card although an to Zimbabwe so in that whole area that they reserved and compasses now you could fit Belgium inside there so it's a fairly large area say Sally is asking which lipid territory are the Lions in please so there's actually two lipids there's a female lipid and a male lipid and the female leopard is the island female and the male lipid is the occipital male mark race that fought between the magenta liners and the map ojos it's quite possible that they did do it they certainly didn't do it on Malta model or not that I'm aware maybe they did it in the sabi sands Game Reserve like I was saying to Friday there's no fences so these animals can go where like once they leave our property we have no idea what happens to them unless it's also posted on social media perhaps by the the area that that's happened in and thank you Scott and Rhys odd we actually are hoping that this will boost the tourism industry and not just for Mala Mala but tourism as a whole all over the world a lot of folks don't realize that those tourists coming here to view these animals pays for their conservation so no tourists no conservation and quite big stretches of Africa so hopefully we get to see all of you that are commenting here at some point in the near future then Dillon Morgan asking is their dominant female well not that we've noticed all of them are sisters and they I mean between six years sorry seven years and six years and nine months old so they're all more or less the same size somewhat little bit bigger than others but there are as a group fairly large lionesses one of the aunts was actually this absolute beast of a lioness and then yeah when they moving and hunting and that there's no real order of precedence certainly when we see these lines feeding all twenty of them all the Khumbu Laprade all 20 of them and the - Gary males if they're all with the prod it's just an absolute it's like watching piranhas they just all bail in grab whatever and pull as hard as I can and see who he gets away with the kill Anisa I'm glad you in the family are enjoying the game viewing from your house yeah welcome so there are males here there's one young male lying on his back v I'll just see him in again there you go is one young male they are more here I just can't point them out right now this the sonim screen is quite clearly a male seem are to get in there and so Ranger boy do we see the Birmingham mouth so we refer to the booming males here as the Gauri male so it's just a name that we were using for them but yes they'd the Birmingham males and their Gary males are the same lines and they we suspect one of them is how are you certain he was this morning and they're the fathers of all these Cubs you can see Michael stain asking where the best place in Kruger to see most lipids is so we are fortunate to have a large privateer and gamers there on the ball of Kruger National Park we fall within the greater Kruger National Park and because of it we can offer aid and we have a guided operation which means we can coordinate our drives and we've got very strict driving and viewing procedures which has helped us and get the animals used to the vehicles they are very tolerant of the vehicles leopards are very secretive animals but here we get to view them very close by and they behave completely naturally without any sort of bother about the vehicle but if you are asking about to the in Kruger National Park itself I would imagine as kakuzu because those lipids might be a bit more relaxed being close to this area we'd love to see the maxims mail some day on Drive yeah ease of all the leopards here is one that we believe might have come from Kruger National Park side just because he is more secretive than the other lipids we view here we do see them sometimes but not that often partly because we have so many other big predators like these lions there's lots of Leopard and there's hordes of hyena here which tend to you know there's just too much conflict and competition for the cheetah so we don't see them too much Starling is asking well we continue this Drive after curve at 19 starlings we are not sure we are just rolling with the punches right now and we are just doing our base to bring this wildlife to your lounges for now we're gonna cross those hurdles as as we get to them and then so Fernando so maybe just a recap for everyone that's joined in the last few minutes so this is the Khumbu Laprade they are 20 of them at 6 adults with their cubs and then there's two male lions the gyri males also known as affirming of males dominant over the pradhan away the male is it was one here this morning but I think he's just lying here in the grass somewhere so Ranger boy asking win loss to BC sable in the winter the end of winter so I wanna say maybe September issue last year maybe as late as October but yeah they are something we see pretty much every day in the winter they live in the Kruger National Park but they walk across Mala Mala and head down to the river to drink and then they head back for the afternoon so the only here sort of in-between the day in between the drives or so between breakfast and dinner yeah drives tend to be longer in winter so we do actually see them some Bittaker just asking about the perch is killing more honors and elephants during this coronavirus so of all of our departments are anti poaching unit will not just ours but all of them in this region actually at their busiest and most active it's something we can just never let our guard down so while we've kind of closed down the camps and wrapped up a lot of those sorts of operations operations the anti poaching is going full steam ahead hazal saying thanks for this at salt my lockdown is all you're welcome and yeah we are thinking everybody that is cooped up indoors at this time so yeah we are happy to bring our backyard to you so just quickly no you basically we never play lion sands from the vehicle we try not to interfere with animals at all and it would also be a phenomenally bad idea I'm sure the very mouths do come on - Mala Mala we've got two sets in the north and in the south range of way and then Philip asking how come there are two males lion prides a pride is really the female so the this is the Khumbu Laprade the other prods the marthy pride and our field prod we've been viewing for about 40 years or keeping records of anyway so pride is the stable unit and those are all the related females it's the males or male coalition's we call them that are related brothers and they move around and the coalitions of males will change over time so this can bullet prod resident on Mala Mala for the last few years their males have changed from the gara males or other gallery males at the moment previously it was the met repair males and Mannion late emails and at one point those of the Kamel so and that's all been within the last five years so there's a lot of turnover of maryland's Kimberly Lopez asking the any leopard cubs on the property at the moment there's the island female we haven't seen it for a while but she certainly got a cab and then if you go into our YouTube page Mala Mala you should channel you'll see we did our it'll post about the Piccadilly female who we suspect as gjerstad Cubs this week but we only gonna try and look and video those Cubs perhaps from when they're about six weeks old we don't want to interfere with him when I too young he also say there's this weird female that has Cubs and the look are female yeah so there are a number of lipid cubs on the property Shaun Chenery that have a topical question what's the worst pandemic that hit the wildlife well the obvious one is humans but I want to say the turn of the century or the last century in 1900 there was the rinderpest outbreak which killed a phenomenal amount of hoofed animals wracked from East Africa through to southern Africa and so that's probably the certainly in South Africa is the worst epidemic disease to to occur so Karis the lion ages so the lionesses are six seven years old and then three or seven years old three or six years and nine months and in the Cubs range in age from a year and nine months to ten months old the animals died during the drought I don't know if they were counted racine so we it was really difficult for us to keep up at one point because it was hard to say if the animal had died as a result of the drought and or had just been found perhaps by the Lions or the leopards because when we had find the Lions they're eating a buffalo we hadn't no idea unless we saw it happen whether it was the drought that killed it or the Lions killed it ultimately it would still be the drought because the Lions and he got it because it was so weak but it you know here on Mala Mala I think we had about 20 a shipper Buffalo more than a hundred we are very very fortunate that the Rana was paid by that but then other animals like the Impala they did for normally while during the drought so we have warm pollen now than we've ever had and Thank You Philip Cristina definitely was a very very sad time on the plus side all the that we see now are they fittest and healthiest survivors of that drought and it's also one of the reasons these line prods of quite big like 20 lines is pretty unusual and it's not necessarily a terrible thing it is you know one way of almost cleaning out the weaker genes and populations in these areas I mean it is very hard to see but it is not you know it is a natural form of population control mark gres so those lions it was probably to do with those thorn bushes that are I've never been to Sava but I believe that the fawn bushes are quite an issue there I do you know when they made that movie they were actually gluing extra thorns onto the trees maybe it has been exaggerated over the years and but also the Mane's is a genetic component some males just have bigger Mane's and others somewhat darker cyma blonder we've had a few that are more orangish perhaps but yeah there's quite a few factors about the Mane's it's probably not one reason it's a combination of reasons someone asking are we expecting any rain we had a few days few rainy days now I don't think we expecting anything it said next Thursday I think but those long-term forecasts are not the most reliable in this part of the world resort thank you very much that's much appreciated unbelievable thank you do we have an idea of all the lion prides in this park we certainly do know the lion prides within the boundaries of Mala Mala and yeah so we don't know all the lion prides within the greater Kruger National Park but we do keep a very as accurate as we can I suppose record of most the Predators within Mala Mala if you do want to find out more about the animals that we do see like we've spoken a little bit about Piccadilly female the lookout female and the likes please feel free to head over to our website and under the wildlife section you can find our game reports are monthly game reports and that will tell you about the sightings we've had the numbers of sightings we had if there are any kills what they killed and this data has been used you know if kids we've been gathering the starter for many decades now and it was published or a lot of it was used in a book recently called shaping Kruger so if you are interested in this area and I would recommend reading shaping Kruger it's a brilliant book and it gives you a good overview of how the Kruger National Park has changed over the last hundred or so years a couple of questions about where Mala Mala is and so very broadly the Kruger Park is like a backwards L and we in the corner of that L if you look at a map of the Kruger National Park you'll see the capital main camp if you will is skukuza so we north of skukuza for the next 20 kilometers we border right onto the Kruger National Park between the Kruger National Park and the sabi sands Game Reserve really any threats to the Gary Mouse at the moment no surprisingly we haven't seen too many young male lions it's a very good thing for these cubs that stability that the males are brought in and they've been pretty settled and confident as allowed them to raise all these Cubs without nur or any external threats Friday asking do you like working there like when you on leave do you want to stay and just relax the people so it what's funny is that a lot of the guys go and leave go right next door to Kruger National Park and do exactly that they drive around by themselves not guests so yes we do love working here and to be honest not having guests for the last few weeks is actually being a bit weird for us and it's so nice to have all of you and have you basically as our guests for these last few drives it is really something we hoping to do much more of in the future these live streams it's a big difference between taking six people tops out on game Drive this is I don't even know how many thousands of people are watching these feeds at the moment believe the last one was about 15,000 and well as well as you 391 commenting at the moment it's such a pleasure to actually take you all show you what we have here eleven minutes till I get up in the Darcys say yeah and it does guessing that these lines are gonna get active in 11 minutes what's interesting about these lines is that sometimes during the heat of the day even they are active and they're quite strange in that way sometimes you find them walking around at the and the strangest times lions don't really like to be active when it's very hot but we have found these guys walking around ring me to the day so 8,300 get some a safari so far yeah nice welcome to every single one of you it's nice to have you here and David asking about the Akuma and Torchwood prod so they could possibly we've seen them kuma pride a bit closer to the marthy prides originate original territory and but nothing yet in motley at the moment the Khumbu Laprade are sometimes seen in that area but they've got a huge range that they covering at the moment Megan easyshare asking you just changing how do you know they'll get up in 11 minutes only did the Dove knows why because that's his Beresford director yeah no does beta that they'll get up in 11 minutes and they are active at night lion well not always and yet not it not cluesive Li at night rather but there are active during cooler periods and the Devas guessing that there will be if you have a Casey welcome to gas T how's that asking who isn't the dev certain the dev set up this channel Kruger sightings and he's he's very kindly allowed us to use this as a platform to reach out to all of you and he's definitely go and check out his pages I'm ridiculous sightings on there just truly amazing stuff if it no one had filmed that you wouldn't believe that it actually happened and then as for the rest of you asking the the times so it's only in the dev that's come up with the five o'clock time I think there was a Megan earlier that called it a little early when that line is good at moved I'm gonna say we looking closer to 5:30 that they they get moving maybe look pretty settled a good sign that they're gonna get moving is when they all start stretching and grooming in that and then also grooming one another just reaffirming those social bonds and the pride hopefully that's also the point we'll see this male lion Pappas head up out of the grass and then they'll all start to get going after that so a few people asking questions about I think someone asks is this Kevin Richardson it is not so I'm just gonna reintroduce you for those of you who ever lived a little bit later and currently sitting here with Nick he has opted to drive for us today everyone an amazing valor basic driver Mike Kirkman he's reading the comments and keeping your little change and myself Gareth and yeah holding the camera steady as I can it's quite amazing how heavy a cellphone gets after a while I just want to make you guys aware so we are streaming off of herself in this lockdown happened pretty quickly I know they've been a few comments about the poor audio and yeah unfortunately we we couldn't gotten by all the gear that you know we desire and but we are making do with what we have and if you got a youtube channel there are a few more I guess polished versions of sightings that you can go and have a look at we try to try and post a game drive every day or every other day and so they are relatively current and that way you can see which animals are moving away and doing what on the property [Music] office Bruce is one of our camp managers at great rez camp so he actually lets himself out because he's quite sneaky that way often goes on game draws you'll see him in one of our youtube videos enjoying a wild dog sighting that we had but yes he does get out of the office from Tom - Tom teaches saying get a tripod I will once lockdown ins Captain Andy so I'm not related to him I have checked yes this captain Andy asking mark Hickman if he's related to Hickman of cake men's camp Hickman's camp was a mallomar camp and it got sold off in what year 2003 2003 mark in fact mark I think he told me yesterday you're the last person to wake there's a model mother angel it was a lot smaller Mahler Anja Kirkman's camp and at Harry's camp does a pride of any competition so not really they were sort of a new pride we first saw them as six young lionesses when they came on to Mala Mala and they actually took over the territory that they're living in now from a long-established pride the our field pride so they they actually were the competition themselves and it was quite a violent takeover they killed one of the our field lionesses they had quite a few run-ins with some of the other parts and now they're dominant more or less over the middle half of Mala Mala and more less centered between Mala Mala main camp and Rattlers camp and then both sides of the river they spend a bit of time in the sabi sands as well and then north of them they've got the UM Coomer Torchwood and Martha Lee prods and the South the high field prod and the Sand River pride and then sometimes on the Kruger boundary we see the four ways prod and there's another sort of unknown a bit nervous of vehicles pride of lions that we haven't named yet because we don't see them that much and Patel there's quite a few lion prides on the periphery of their territory but none of them dare challenge such a large prod them sauce rasa sayang makes more realistic when you're doing it freehand buddy thank you very much so Blair Witch yeah and then just that Cummington what with the lines dia if I had win Paulo which can buy one nick was willing every heard of in polity run this way on the way on the drive year and unfortunately none of them took up his offer so Christine's reeling through all the prods a the sticks prod they used to be in the north of Mala Mala and they actually seem to have been ousted by the Torchwood and in Coahoma prides so they've become quite nomadic and I've seen all over the sabi sands as well as Mala Mala we haven't seen them for quite some time here on Mala Mala de just saying how's it to Garrett from Texas how you Roger nice to see you up on the grief Phillips that's not always carriage that's included in being a ranger sometimes it's just faith and trust that these animals the respect has to go both ways so we respect their space don't interfere irritate them as much as we can control and in return they just ignore us as long as we behave normally they'll behave normally if we do something unusual or weird then you've provoked a reaction which is the last thing that we want to do Petra maribor ceman welcome back thanks for joining us again there's a shout out to Wiggy impairments an FK the local HR champions not sure who you are that is a shout out from Rhys odd I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing your name right guys forgive us with the pronunciations of some of these names and we trying our best Rogers yeah I'm good thank you and nice to see you up here I hope all is well in the in the US and be nice please come visit RFK again Christine I see movement one minutes ago and enough I think that's wishful thinking right now it's a decline we are on Mala Mala private game reserve right next door to the kruger national park towards the south friday bathroom breaks or something that we do before we leave camp and then we don't drink anything until we get back from camp I've got cottonmouth right now from all the talking yes of in there's this pride specialize in large prey seeing that is a large pride yes of last year we were wondering whether this proud of lions would ever kill a buffalo and we saw lots of interaction between buffalos and the sprite but the buffalo has always seemed to chase them off towards the end of the winter however they did manage to catch a buffalo which was very exciting for all of us and just the hilarity Tanit from Johannesburg pretty sunny asking if there any meerkats in the park unfortunately lot they prefer drier areas and they are however close relatives of this and there are a number of different Mongoose pcs yeah and hi Sam very glad you also into nature conduits conservation okay I don't know carico asking to show the sky okay so pit row mari Bosman also saying quote it is six when there will get active I'm just pointing up at the sky now it's partly cloudy and everywhere except for the it's a bit more than partly cloudy but yeah I don't think there's gonna be any rain it is nice that these cutters has started urban hours a little bit hot earlier so Jurassic sushi the time here is just after 5:00 on a set five plus five at the moment Friday if you're going to Kruger sightings YouTube channel you'll see there's a couple of really amazing sightings that we've seen personally I've got two three sightings on that channel one of lions hunting Buffalo and actually getting into a huge scrap as well as some hipper and Rana having a bit of a showdown on our airstrip that there are all pretty wild sightings so patron Mari boys been asking are we live every day and not every day we have other duties to fulfill here and we only have 10% coverage over the property so when they are sightings you know in those areas then we will go live if you do subscribe to later sightings Kruger or any of Malta models social media platforms we will notify you when you go live Sheriff asking is with the largest prod that's ever been seen so this is one of the biggest prides well it's currently the biggest prod certainly on Mala Mala the Ifield pride if I remember art was up to 23 at one point now may be wrong but I think there's one in the kruger national park at the moment that's something like 40 lions as i referring to them as the mega pride and foyox called there's no drinking in south africa during our lockdown so we would never do such a thing there we go and the dove is put it out of my exciting's up there in the dev on point as oh yeah Jurassic see I'm pretty sure if a water were to come on maxi's Lyons I'm not sure who would be more surprised the Lions or the Warthog but it probably wouldn't end well for the Warthog if you got away and have quite a story to tell there Michael come bring asking how late will these lions start to get active today we've had a number of cases I think an ad of guest five o'clock it's now five past five I think Pedro guest quality six what is the name of the bird sound in the background well there are a few birds calling you not right now they've all just gone silent there was also a squirrel chattering in the background and then there's been a few Franklin's calling to you and a cape tittle del j tu almond Joe welcome where are you guys si containing sticks he says guess again remember say containing sticks is full of gravel I'll give you a clue if you wear your sunglasses all day you end up looking like one of these animals you were to use it Zulu name mark gray when any of the animals died we depending on what it is either it is destroyed if it's something valuable like ivory or it's stored very safely and securely at a secret location so that it's not here on sight vintage voided is indeed real the Lions are doing their best to look like they stuffed at the moment that if you watch closely every now and then you'll see one rollover and Richard Sears so pretty sunny asking about meerkats again and now we don't get them in this area we find those in the Kalahari Northwest of South Africa and Botswana and Namibia and here the closest relative would be the numbers of there's a number of different mongooses that we get you that are closely related to meerkats and in fact meerkats are mongooses Robin sue winning for the Rangers where are we competition mocking the boys out of the park what is Robin say trouble already since add much appearing nice robin nick says you got the inside scoop yet okay so we currently looking at a few crested Franklin's yeah and they're walking straight towards these lions I think if anything is gonna play the role of a rooster and wake these Lions up it's these Franklin's it's gonna be interesting what which route they decide to take from their effects just being a little quiet while we wait for these birds to the common sense has arrived Meeta hi nice to see you online again my Franklin's are damn into walk through there folks I think the Franklin's of Chozen laughs yeah yeah yes I've just answer a few of those questions that we're coming through so these are called crested Franklin's little Covey of they're moving towards the Lions now I don't know what to say stem to try then the Lions they're not gonna actively try and hunt these down it would be a little snack for them but took me these ones if they were determined to get eaten the Lions would definitely oblige them they'll never turn down a free meal Starlin Scooby Snack would probably be about track and then Mockridge just asking do we ever help the animals if they're injured if the injury is a natural injury then we don't help if it's man-made or man caused in some way then we certainly you do help also if it's one of the very endangered animals if we can catch it help it and release it we do we mentioned Joel Elvis is one of the vets that we do use remarkably dedicated human being him and gareth's Pinta call not faring a little Aaronic offer on the one Mott for a few hours and not because they had to but because they want to do so collar we did have quite a you know interesting wild dogs watching the other day if you go on to the same Kruger sightings page and check some of the previous live feeds you'll see where Gareth on and Nick spent the afternoon with the wild dogs they're also quite a few wild dog sightings on our YouTube channel there's some good hyena and wild dog interaction a and if you just go into the model on the game is a YouTube channel you'll see what some of the pecs in the area have been up to here in the last week or so has also what tugs are a type of pig so they'll eat just about anything mainly sort of vegetations I do dig up some of the roots and bulbs as well and then I have seen them feeding on caucuses from time to time provided there's none of the big predators there and two or three times working in Zululand I saw them big warthogs chasing cheetah off of fresh kills and stealing it from them but yeah so being a pig warthogs will eat just about anything Kamri so at the moment they actually aren't any males with more than two males there's two of our males on the south and two other of our males on the north and then these two gari males here more or less on the center of the reserve but these young males that are in this pride when they get to adulthood or perhaps in the next year certainly all the brothers will move off together I'm not sure how many brothers there are total that if there's five or six they'll move away together and actually perform quite a powerful coalition themselves and thank you so much starlings one of our regular viewers someone was asking if this was they really a tiger spotted in the Kruger this week highly darters much pillai it is April I was that on the first of April that's possibly okay maybe tiger fish yeah Mike is a very keen fisherman so they are tiger fish in some of these rivers in Kruger National Park I don't think there's anything else that even has Gary mouths actually initially five brothers when they we first saw them in this area and they came in pretty hot they killed a few of the lionesses in the area particularly from the sticks pride one of the brothers was actually killed by a snake we're not sure what species of snake or the circumstances around that and a little later on another of the brothers just vanished we don't know where he went to and and then the third brother the other Burke who dislocated his hip somehow and there was nothing we could do but he was around for quite some time able to follow and keep up with the prod and eventually did succumb to those injuries hey art was pretty sad to watch that process unfold but like I said there was nothing we could really do and we certainly didn't want to take away any chance he did have of recovering or managing to cope naturally meter asking if we ever use drones to spot anything unusual like cheetah meter we don't use drones occasionally we use drones just for some aerial photography or videography for marketing but we don't actually use them to try and find animals and they Christine coming up with the names of all those lions vintage void it's a bit of a pop day question I don't think anyone has tried putting all these animals in a box together since they're Ivan Tom's xa the yeah do we know which product isn't so the film crew has found another pride of lions but they're just out of cellphone range and so we are not gonna go there's quite a long drive as well you're not 100% sure which pride it is yet and that perhaps you'll have a better answer for you once we get back and edit and look they're close to look at them an eye on the footage that I'm hoping they would have catch it captured so James asking how many females on a lion pride so it's hard to set just depends on the particular pride and this prod there are six of them that currently we have the I filled and monthly pride where there's just one lioness in that pride so it's it is quite variable they can't really be too many adult Lions because then there's just not enough food to go around too many mouths to feed but yeah I think the Kruger averages seven Lions in a prat so this is with twenty lions here's getting towards the top end of pride size it's gonna reposition a bit low and bum cheeks gone numb yeah so next I'm just gonna reposition a bit I think we we just get it yeah I think even if you just go forward okay where did they say us I think yeah I think this is good here this is lucky yeah this is very nice good you okay so Nick has come up with a great plan here never know if he's made my life easier or more difficult yet but definitely a bit of you let's try and put this like this so you guys I am shaking your honor but I'm just trying to get a nice viewpoint for you all [Applause] so facts on that looks like we're having a earthquake here but we're just gonna trying to get a good position to see all these lions you will hopefully wake up in the next nine minutes and prove me right at the moment wait this is nine minutes you said 12 plus five yeah okay well they are a few that I was riding on today Beck's but I think I can at the moment it is 5:20 yes a sort of welcome back Darryl tan in Jelena how long has pride been there I want to say maybe four years now so that it depends how you want to look at it but they from a pride we knew as the motley breakaway prod the mathy pride is being seen and recorded on Mala Mala for going on to 40 years and they actually split off from that part product got so big that there's just too many mouths to feed it's a possibility the same will happen with this product so if all these Cubs survive and they are 20 of them now or 20 lines in the pride they mock wall split into two groups Nadav say he's got a new target [Music] Gilbert saying it cut it to 6 welcome Gillett rezard full of confidence they on Stallings enjoying her morning coffee we down to instant coffee here it's maybe the one drawback of being a little bit far from the shops Victor I'm pretty sure the Lions would welcome your presence and see takes our they are two males that are dominant over this prod we know them as the Gauri males and one of them is here we just cannot see him for the life of us at the moment we suspect he's on the far side of the stick it in front of the vehicle Laura is Hardy they stopped hands biting them so they actually don't I've had a pretty funny sighting once where we found a lioness or two lionesses with a fairly freshly killed zebra and there though the zebra was dead that Ranna kind of bite and then run away from it and when we got closer we saw that the zebra died right on top of a an ant nest and it was just swarming with answered with biting the lines like crazy eventually one of the lionesses just sucked it up and ranan grabbed a part of the zebra and just pulled fall and march and dragged it off of the ant nest but it was pretty funny watching two hungry lions being held off by a bunch of ants from a freshly killed zebra which are desperate to eat it's also one of these lioness is a while back and I saw lying in one of the more open areas suddenly levitate and when she looked down and I looked over with the light source Corp Ian walking around I think it it Stanger in the shoulder let's see you tomorrow holiness and am Andrus Stallings if we did get out um it's hard to say what would happen I'm guessing nothing good these lines I have come across them on foot before not exactly on purpose but they do growl at you and let you know from quite far off that you are not welcome if and I'm gonna volunteer Gareth to get on the vehicle I think they would initially run away but after that once I got over their shock and surprise I think things would get pretty dramatic very quickly and if you head over to our Instagram page so what we've done is set up a few camera traps in camp and we live in the staff Villa dressers maybe 300 metres away from the camp dining room and there's a lot less traffic in camp itself at the moment just because most of the staff are on lockdown outside of the reserve and obviously there's no guests here at the moment so walking down to dinner at the moment is getting more and more sketchy and if you hit our Instagram page you'll see one of the lionesses we suspect was one of the company lionesses because they were headed in that direction on that day I'm hunting in parlors in camp and Sofia avatar Instagram page you can have a look we are quite interested to see what does walk around camp there I think all of us have walked into different animals in camp We certainly have a hina that visits our house and actually gets into the house from time to time so yeah it's a grace welcome how much land as a lion eat in a week how much food so if I remember right from the textbooks I need to eat about five kilograms of meat per day but the way the Lions catch these big animals they might eat 15 or 20 kilograms of meat and one sitting but then not have to eat again for the next few days for these Lions sunning like a bouillabaisse followed by a little entree of Impala perhaps or dessert of Impala we'll see them through the week in a perfect world for them they'd want to catch something like a buffalo and that's gonna be enough to give the whole product good feed here Mark GREs thanks for the the kind thoughts we hoping to get a order in soon ourselves in fact Irene so we don't get peacocks in Africa believe they're strictly from Asia and India specifically the closest thing we get here's the little Franklin's that we saw tempting fate with the Lions earlier does the Heena run off with your shoes that it happened about three weeks ago that one of the range is one of the hyenas we I know further another angel she's that he left outside and yeah so they do you in shorts there we go there's a little bit of hope hazal so when sang about scorpion it's I believe like a very very bad wasp sting and I don't know if jhana short is still watching but he's someone that had a good chuckle that much to his dismay when he got stung on the footbath scorpion as I recall it wasn't a pleasant experience for him and he he made it pretty well known and Rabbani we are on the Mala Mala game reserve next to the kruger national park at the moment and Sophie wants to know how long the Cubs stay with the prod so if there are females I'll actually stay with the prod for their whole life so all the females in a prod are related other mothers and adult daughters or aunts and cousins and so on these lionesses are all half sisters or full sisters and half sisters the young males normally leave or not politely asked to leave when they're about three years old in a perfect world but sometimes it's a bit younger than that and sometimes it's actually significantly older than that McCrae asking if we have trail cameras in camp yes we do and then we'll be showing you some of the animals that walk through camp on our Instagram page Meeta that was one of the youngsters of the prod until folks so these lines like I was saying much earlier they've actually covered a huge amount of ground since we last saw them I have no idea how far they actually walk but Maul is following the circle at probably not far or 15 kilometers it might explain why they not keen to get going immediately there's a lot of stretching and yawning happening at the moment and always a pleasure bunny see then swimming legs so go walking at light absolutely not so Jurassic sushi if we played a alliant calling they probably would wake up but it's not something that we we want to do because he pretty much instantly set them from sleeping mode to battle mode witches is not the the mud that we prefer they're in and then just I had caught in Jurassic sushi just to address that again I had quite an interesting sighting in the northeastern part of the reserve probably about 12 years ago now and we're - blond mane Lions came out to the property we had never seen them before and they were roaring and one of the guests summer vehicle decided to film them roaring and just after that finished he played back the video of those lions roaring just to see if he had captured it and those Lions picked up their heads and ran off and we did not see them again so they hid themselves raw and ran off the property we learnt a lesson that day and that's not to play the Lions roars back to them so see take the Prado who won it into camp yes I did like Gareth was just saying if you look on our Instagram or Facebook page you'll see the one of these lionesses in fact chasing an Impala past our security cameras and camps other not generally the they do avoid the camp particularly when it's busy but now with no guests around and a lot smaller staff compliment they're not perturbed at all and just one-two-three camp at will and provided they're not an immediate danger to anyone we just leave them be there's no need to pick a fight with them sassy Cassie's we try or are trying to do a live feed every afternoon perhaps around four five o'clock until it gets darker and South Africa usually sort of 6:00 6:30 time but it does depend way on the reserve we are we just filming with a a sulfur and camera and are reliant on what little sulfur and signal we have so the animals on an area with good cell coverage that we can stream at laughs then we will try every afternoon to do that so noxee 21 asking about how the animals are named how does that come to be and who does the naming so once territorial predators mercy lions and leopards into the property or become established on the property and when I say established I mean when they set up a territory and hold that territory they then get named after either a road or a feature near the center of their territory now every single Road has the name on the property and there's plenty of other features on the property we do this so that as the territories shift over time we can keep track on how they move about the property we have keep kept records like this for very many years now and we've got a great data set that has been used by scientists authors and we have kept our naming system very consistent a lot of people ask us why we don't call the beaming Birmingham Mail's the beaming emails but rather the Gauri mails and it is for this reason that you've kept this consistent naming system that we have so that when scientists and authors do you get hold of our datasets they don't have to try and decode it it is one system we use so they can easily go decades back and figure out how these territories is shifted how they've moved and very easily so we have remained consistent in that manner and but also because we're one of the oldest and largest private game reserves with animals and we get to see these animals right up close to us and we have been capturing data for a very long time we've had a great opportunity to do so and the book that I mentioned earlier shaping Krueger is a fine example of how that data has been used and Mala Mala is mentioned quite a few times in their because they did get a lot of their data from us there are organizations like Penn Theory which are starting to consolidate all the Predators from other reserves around us now so in future we probably will start naming or sticking to the names of the cats that come out to reserve if they really have existing names otherwise we will name them ourselves as per usual and thanks again the Devon point there with our camera points game reports and the live feed they're Lorna asking is the problems with poaching so sadly the whole of Africa and we're not immune to poaching anyway but we do have a very limited amount of poaching that does happen here and we have a number of separate teams actually whose sole job it is is to to combat that poaching and also we work very closely with our neighbors particularly the Kruger National Park have been amazingly effective and stuffing poaching from happening and making lots of arrests particularly in the area that's opposite us they work very closely with us and I'm credibly helpful and definitely do their part to contribute yeah I think it's just with and you know appreciating the work that a lot of these anti poaching units are doing on the ground and what a lot of these conservationists are doing on the ground they work very hard very long hours and and they are very often the unsung heroes so there's a question from a how many lipids of southern of our males killed on Mala Mala so we're not entirely sure it might be as many as six we know they killed one leopard the kicker lazy female and then another of the big males that tree ha smell me suspect she also killed or they killed the colossi females cab which is the brother of one we know is the Three Rivers female those of you that want to check on all those names if you go to that link you know dive just posted or Kruger sightings just posted with the Mala Mala game reports but yeah they were incredibly disruptive when I came onto Mala Mala and you know aside from interfering with the lion dynamics Ursus seemed to take an out a lot of their frustration on our resident lipids and kind of turn things upside down for our leopard population for a few or more than two years you know the lipid dynamics have been pretty pretty interesting over the last two years no graves and where's the big male say since Nick does not have a door and he is nominated to look through that Bush Lee and he's gonna come out of the vehicle we believe nominate a person only because he doesn't have a door we had nominate we do believe he's just on the other side of this bush and hopefully he'll get up soon Matt okay so Camry asking is pride ever hunted a hippo not successfully but they certainly have made some attempts I think we have I'm not sure if we actually have a Donna Mala Mala channel and I suspect you I remember our there's a video of them jumping on an off one of the hippos during the drought in 2016 mark gray do we use helicopters yes we do we it depends on what the need is on that but certainly for the anti poaching helicopters are used quite frequently it's just a very effective way of getting people out into the field as fast as possible and as well as if we do have to work on or capture one of these animals for veterinary reasons we will often use a helicopter we're quite far out borrowed it's about three hours but sometimes by helicopter flat it might be as little as 20 minutes and so we sometimes get the helicopter just to bring the vets in depending where the vet is and the helicopter is so a helicopters do you get used meter asking raised the second male so there's one line is that's missing from the Khumbu Laprade currently there is a bit of movement there and there's one male one of the gaya males is missing we suspect that it's a payor we suspect it's the female that's in East hrus and one of the Gary males that is probably stole with her somewhere we don't know where everybody's getting very excited that they're starting to roll over so Jack Brian asking about the difference between a safari park and wild lion so we do not feed these lions from vehicles that own associated us with food and also we are kind of trained and well aware of the danger these Lions pose if you do interfere with them something that not everyone understands perhaps going through safari parks you're some failure dramatic and/or funny videos of people not obeying the rules and certain safari parks whether it's with lions or monkeys or camels giraffes the YouTube is full of videos of people that do not follow instructions well and if you get on that rabbit hole I'd recommend you tubing clear the cars seat take so we do take care of some of the more danger wildlife if it does have a significant injury and also one that's actually treatable now sometimes long-term treatment is just not possible and you know we can't put a cone around the Lions head to stop it biting at stitches sadly so some things we we just leave but these animals are amazingly resilient if any of you have been to the crew go any of the other parks you often find zebra that have picked up some pretty horrific wounds and that heels over the straps don't quite line up anymore but it just shows our what was probably a horrific injury at the time is just healed incredibly well and these lionesses also give one another pretty hard time and a lot of the scars on their faces from their sisters as opposed to what they've been trying to kill say I think is pity I think he said quote it is six they're gonna start getting active we're not quite sure if they active just yet this is called a grey area that we're working in currently but they Sydney look like they are starting to wake up a bit Lorna so obviously another topical question there about coronavirus and cats so I know they have had it in some of the zoo Lions sorry that zoo tag I believe was a Bronx Zoo and so far no one has tested the Lions are tear but hopefully with South Africa's very prompt and very effective lockdown and it would have stopped any chance of that disease spreading from perhaps touristy these cats somehow I'm not sure how that would happen but you know we can't say for now what the long-term impact will be Senate dev trying to get clear on the rules determine what active means and the dance I think we'll put it to a vote yeah we'll take the first ten ounces is active just grooming or as active moving away more than five meters from the spot they currently lying in I said so pretty confident with his 1807 there someone asked me I think you know asked earlier are there any caracals in South Africa they are indeed now they're incredibly rare at Mala Mala have any ever seen two of them and eight years here but it's something that if you do you see it's an amazing sighting a normally pretty short-lived on the dev I think majority is going with moving about and so dart City asking the weight of male lions so it is pretty variable it's like reading a guidebook on people would show a pretty broad age weight and hot depending on your study sample but most male lions are probably in the range of 180 to perhaps as much as 250 kilograms I think the world record was 267 but also that is from a lion that was hunted so it's hard to say whether you know how accurate that is if hunters or anything like fishermen is a little bit of exaggeration sometimes in those sizes James so most of the Linus's Oh so that's an obvious statement but yes most of the prod is lionesses so proud of lions really is just the lionesses the male's come and go over the years but it's the females the lionesses that are the course stable group that hold territory over a given range over the years the males like their young males and this pride will eventually before start probably in the next year they'll become pretty nomadic hopefully with luck settle down and take over a territory that might include the range of two or three prides of lions and then if they're lucky control that area for perhaps five six years before being a stood and turned by some other new incoming Lions which is being the case with the Khumbu Laprade the Lions you viewing now when they first settled on Mala Mala they went through if I remember correctly three different male coalition's before eventually the gara males came in just very powerful dominant lions and settled in and they've been dominant ever since and allowed these lionesses to raise these cubs Matt Kade Alliance cuff up fur balls so they do sometimes every now and then we'll see them eating grass and the chlorophyll implants actually toxic to cats so the chlorophyll is what makes plants green and for this allows them to photosynthesize so that's toxic to them makes him sick and helps him to cough that up that's wife at home you see your cat or your dog even eating lots of grass it's time to put him outside Ignatia asking couple males sharing between several prods yes that is true some males might have two or three prods that fall within their territory who are they asking the Dove when latest sightings was made I don't know if he's answered this year but I learnt this 2011 yeah and the dog was at the age of 15 when he started later sightings of creepy sightings it's quite incredible so for those of you that are watching this instead of studying and homeschooling get back to the books or just be like Nadav super clever super cool guy and Jack so yes we would be in severe danger of being attacked if we were to get out of the car right now which is precisely the perhaps number one of the top 50 reasons that we don't get out of the car right now comes it's a young male that's standing me so knock see a lot of the grooming that you're gonna see now as these lions are waking up and getting active is it's gonna be between the mothers and their cubs but also the lionesses the adults between one another but all of the Cubs are effectively raised by all of the lionesses as Cubs they can nurse from any lioness that's got milk and then when they make a kill it's not like the lioness that makes the kill it keeps it exclusively for her cubs and she'll feed any of the Cubs and all of them will just bail in and see how much they can eat but there's no sort of node exclusivity perhaps with the love between the Lions and the screaming and the tension you see so Michelle would with sorry this feed is going pretty quick I missed your question if you could perhaps repeat it there in the mean times james sheriff so we are gonna try and stay with the lions as long as the lock holds gasps camera or cell phone is actually amazingly good at picking up the lot but it is getting pretty dark yeah the Sun set quite some time ago but we will stay with them as long as possible I feel like we need to wait at least until 1807 or six or seven 3cf arise that is correct or not exelon max looking for you having to reply it but we just want to say that it's lovely to have you guys chatting with us and and it's a real pleasure to be able to bring these sightings to you in your homes wherever you are John Laura is saying it's truly amazing that we can watch this and I think that's maybe something we should all appreciate is horrendous as things on the world right now it's all 20/20 and it's insane that we are able to sit in the middle of the bush miles from anyway and livestream are proud of lions waking up grooming chatting with people from all over the world it's incredible that this is something we can do the world is a pretty amazing place so Appa the most of the the baccala bird calls you here are actually the Franklin's probably crested Franklin's that we saw earlier in the stream mark Reyes or the Lions do sometimes try and help with the hunting but more once the pride has actually grabbed hold of something particularly is something big like a buffalo then they just run in with that muscle to pull it down so if we gain by the five meter rule I think we need someone to pace that art it seems like she's just on the edge there so thanks without getting too crude but when the lines will start going to the bathroom that's often a very good sign that they just about to to get up and get moving like I said we're gonna try our best to stay with them as long as a lot holds and and again gasps camera is your phone is pretty good with this sort of thing but probably in the next 15 minutes it's gonna be just too dark to see will stream properly without it becoming too grainy Daniel we actually have no idea when things will open up again and we're just waiting to see ourselves but I'm pretty sure there'll be a lot of press coverage once things get open and moving against Pepsi so you guys I don't know what I do ecology is human area era yeah we can be definitely downwind Ursulines going to the bathroom there's significant smell as a result and so as much as you don't like to be here I'm sure that's one aspect of it that you you can be glad you're doing with that tr1 we're not sure how many male Cubs they are as a Michelle or Robin specifically so the Lions are just in the process of waking up and they are presumably gonna go and look for some food but at the same time they're gonna be prowling and patrolling their territory making sure no other Lions come into it or other prides and and it's quite a number of animals in this area zebra lots and lots of Impala if they carry on along this road they come out into a big open area where there's certainly some wildebeest but yeah they could be just about anything that they come across when I said off at mark it's pretty much the first thing they see they'll try and hunt they don't actively head out with the goal to perhaps go and deliberately set out to catch a zebra or something the one exception might be buffalo hood is something that these Lions just they just detected and like buffalo mooing and that is like dinner bells for these Lions that you might have called it pretty well looking good for you there has been a couple of patients from different drugs asking about white lines so no we haven't seen any white lions here but we currently have a white buffalo and again if you go into Matamoros YouTube feed channel sorry you'll see we have one of the episode titles a white buffalo and you can ever look at that it's not impossible that the genes for white lions are in this area and we would be blown away if we ever were to see a white line cap being born here but yeah fingers crossed it's not impossible a lot of our male lions the Birmingham males or Gary males as we refer to them and the other males are all from the timber variety where the white lions are seen so the genes are certainly in the area but the the Cubs themselves have yet to be produced so I think her eyes are might be on the money year I think those lionesses are just on the edge of that 5 meter Barney and they do look likely gonna continue moving hello Barnaby nice to see I hope you enjoy watching thank so you might notice it's getting quite grainy now and the view on my screen on my cell phone is far far brighter than it is to look with the naked eye I can just about make out some movement here say we're not going to be around for all that much longer and but you are just on air say thank you all for joining the chat thanks to Nadav again for being on it yeah one of the lionesses is calling me and yeah subscribe to our social media channels as well as latest sightings channels and you'll be notified when we do go live do you think what we gonna do is keep this feed going for perhaps another ten minutes perhaps at the max that I feel like we need to give rise out some closure and when these Lions get going and I think he's certainly being as close as anyone and also loving the confidence they calling it almost bang on you're ready folks I think maybe what we'll do Nick has just suggested this that maybe we loop around and see if we can actually find that mail and if we can maybe just get a shuttle in before we finish up here [Music] standby differencing yeah this not really starting to get dark on there on the screen as well and and there is a lion cab that's blocking our way here so we're just going to respect to space for now and yeah I think yeah I think you're bang on there or the closest at least and see yeah thanks for joining us folks I think we are going to call it a night and it's been a real pleasure having you join us and ask all these brilliant questions it's very entertaining for us as

little uncle a little uncor now it's getting too dark as well guys have been asking about the bending and mail or what we call the car email right in the center of the screen nice very dark so it's difficult to see him and but there he goes look see in this is a lioness right yeah it's amazing as soon as you stop live-streaming then all of this kind of stuff happens if he's law yeah say he's lying dhania KFX and these are uncool for the evening we'd just like a Marvel movie yeah
