it's gonna end the stream quick get on YouTube and then just create a new video can we live again 4x sorry about that technical difficulties it's been quite a while since we last live streamed and just refreshing our necessary codes and being a few things behind the scenes yeah but it seems as though we are live again Yeah right specs I take to you welcome to everybody I think we are sorted now and just another welcome I think this is maybe the third time around but I think we are properly live now welcome to Mala Mala Game Reserve and we have the cam boola pride and single Gary male currently in frame and with us today on the vehicle I will show you them at some point but it's pitch I'm sure you all familiar with Dan and myself gareth again and lovely winter's morning here afternoon here on Matamata game reserve these lines are just enjoying the last bit of warmth before this evening where it's gonna turn pretty cold as soon as the Sun sets I say hello to number from Pakistan [ __ ] big book welcome back from Indonesia Bernice found an atoll under Mohammed from India irony from New Zealand Tory from Florida and to run Australia's Guard said welcome and pyromaniacs where is Mala Mala within the kruger so we are technically within the greater Kruger National Park we do share over 20 kilometer boundary with the Kruger National Park it's an open unfenced boundary so it's only humans that know the difference these lines you're looking at now will move freely in between my Allah my Allah Kruger National Park and sabi sands even into parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique if they wanted to hi Andy welcome back cupcakes sugar pie from Texas welcome pyromaniacs saying expat living in israel now I miss the park it's the best place on earth we agree and the seasons are changing very quickly yeah no I guess we nearly met winter already but the bush is opening quite a lot here and this pride of lions is starting to spend a lot more time around the river as water is drying up elsewhere away from the river so we have a summer rain and it is not a winter where it is relatively dry and these lands will spend most of their time from here on out until the end of winter along this river in which they are currently lining which is the Sand River and lie in the reeds here and just wait for any prey species to come down and drink at the water and do a lot of hunting along the water course and along the river banks I'm so Nikhil to answer your question and so the name of this pride is the Kampala pride we name our predators according to areas where we first start seeing them establishing a territory and know their name will not change during up during a takeover they will stay the same but they might get evicted from their land that they will we will continue referring to them by the original name welcome back you undo [ __ ] nice to see you again and sticks and stones asking any update on the marquee female and cab PD one answer that one yeah so sticks and stones we do have an update and if you stay tuned to our Instagram account tonight we will post a day I won't tell you if it's good news or bad news keep you in suspense a little bit longer say I'm more on the marketing side of things you can see the line moving in screen now is one of the youngest litters in this pride there are four litters in total and those four litters comprised of 14 Cubs and then there are six line essence some of the older Cubs already pretty much you know and you see them at a distance they kind of look like lionesses already you're getting quite big and all the cabs are just over two years now the youngest three are just over one year when you're one man yeah Shyam's it has been a while and we apologize for that too you know busy time on the reserve we are busy building on fire breaks it's all hands on that kind of job but we hope to be bringing you more like regular streams again in the coming days and weeks welcome back Christine Prescott nice to see you back Sheila Muir welcome and bright burn to answer your question with their territory Rangers if they if you have a map of Mala Mala and the sabi sands you can just which you can't find you can google it's malamar come on our home page on our website on the home page there's a link to a map of the area and the Cibola pride pretty much controls I'd say about 70% of Mala Mala and then a portion of the sabi sands to our West the territory well shift and change is very dynamic and during the winter time the territory seems to narrow along the water courts along the river here maybe not necessarily the territory they just don't explore the full extent of the territories rather put it that way yes sir you can't really see it in picture now but the water course of the Sand River is right next to us and this is a perennial River and as we head further into the dry season this river and its banks will see a significant increase in foot traffic from animals seeking out the river to quench their thirst so the Lions don't have to travel that far in such a they pray they just waits along the banks of the river and wait for the food to come to them poor maniacs asking curious as to your streaming setup how do we even have internet out here well we do you have a sulfur and tar close by which and yes cellular range over parts I'd say maybe 10% of the property so when we can redo these live streams and latest sightings YouTube channel thanks to dev and it's been a while since we had our last one like it said Gary quite busy with other things at the moment we having to bear in firebreaks just because all nation is drying out and the fire breaks help us prevent runaway fires should have fire okay Yamaha rider the answer to your question is no and there's no hunting in this part of in my Allah my Allah at all or in the kruger national park ran a year-end rain-x ranger at Mala Mala and hydro recipes there with you listening Jane H makes a good point these lines do seem to be the kind of required two meters from each other practicing a form of social distancing with them that is going to change very soon when they start getting active [Music] Yamaha we're not ignoring your questions it's just quite a few coming through I've heard of Rob the Ranger but I don't know him and blessing Clare welcome back one of the guy mails is just at the back of the furthest part of the screen you can't really see him he's lying on the shade but just one is here and not not all the members of the come from the Prado present either their knee about 12 of the 20 members here welcome back Sheila and Mia Ferrara welcome back and a Gina in from Australia and in Smith's asking the Styx prior to season model more in the last two months been the Styx prior it hasn't been seen on month all in a while but I believe one of the young the young male from the sticks bride was seen a couple days ago I killed an ish they are not dead just lying down resting hi Kimberly welcome back Kimberly levees so a lady asking how many lines on the sprite so there are two territorial males that are dominant over the pride but if you are referring to the Cubs at least six of the Cubs are males possibly a couple more but definitely six of them are males yeah Ferrer asking how yeah yeah we're doing very well thank you it's always nice to be out in the bush and that's I'm speaking on your guys be off you guys can see how you do but I'm doing very well thank you I had a few days break not so long ago and feeling very refreshed and happy to be back in the bush here are you doing Pete Samira I have a 14 month old son he kept me awake last night so my bush and Blair we can't I can't see from here which of the two caramels it is but we'll let you know once we yeah so dads have a closer look with his binoculars and it's the it's not the one to the equal sign star the one with the darker one Christine asking if they've eaten recently it did look like they might have had something last night like this prides being so many lines is a very good chance of a very kill something small but if it's something small disease every night you can imagine them lasting very long there are quite a few vultures and some in the trees around us so there's a chance they killed something small during the middle of the day here as well then the kill Kondapalli asking is Styx a place there yes we have a few roads one road is called face any Styx the other SiC and turning sticks and then we have some rocks called sticks rocks as well as the sticks crossing actually quite close to where we are now it's a trump phone call Kolby it's it's not hot out here at all might look that way but it's just this very warm sunlight you can see the fact that these lines are lying out in the open there's a good indication that they aren't if it was hot they'd be in the shade but they're it's actually a little bit getting a little bit nippy now so they are lying in the Sun on purpose to get a last bit of warmth before darkness falls and bright burn and I pulled my hamstring earlier mocha I'm not that mobile but you're more than welcome to come and give that a try and to stacy bar it's at Mala Mala game reserve the mother mother as you said ma la ma la gamers of all one word in writer joiner asking all the calves and the calves are well these eleven these fourteen caps eleven of them are between two years old and one year nine months there are four letters of all the ones then there are three younger cabs which are one year and one month old it's very impressive guys did you memorize that I thank you Peter I have no cheat notes hey what's a trouble with these lines as the ages change every man and welcome to Vietnam are mesh from Singapore and from Iraq even so it's all those folks joining us now I've said before but we'll just repeat it quickly we are coming to you live from Mala Mala Game Reserve bordering the Kruger National Park in the northeastern parts of South Africa and we're currently with members of the kombucha pride we just heard something moving behind us a pilot there are there's a herd of elephants just behind us if you can't see now I'm just wondering if there may be coming closer to these lions Kimberly Lopez asking any news on the picket Lee female and a cab for those of you don't know you pick an alley female is it's one of the female lipids we have here at mono male he has quite a young cap which we discovered just a few weeks ago piccadilly females being seen tries to camp on quite a regular basis when lost is the cutscene kappa seen I think maybe about six days ago okay but yeah there's we have no reason to believe that anything's happened to the cub she's still lactating and showing soccer marks we assume the cub is fine I saw Emery from New York Dean Smith asking if niqabs appear in that pride in the next couple of weeks do you think they can survive in the proud it's such big feeding competition it's actually a question you've been asking ourselves recently as so typically lionesses will give birth in two-year intervals so as Gareth mentioned earlier the all the oldest Cubs already passed the two-year mark so the question is will these lionesses automatically go back into issues and start mating and having Cubs again or is there still too much pressure on the pride as a whole from the rest of the Cubs that they will not look to have Cubs so there is one lioness she has been spending quite a lot of time by herself and we've been speculating as to whether she might be pregnant to not be done at this point and but should one of these lionesses fall pregnant there will probably steer clear of the pride for the most part not just because they can't move very far from where they keep their cubs in at the inside and obviously those Cubs are very young if there would be wait to be born now and they can't move very far and mum would have to go and hunt to get enough nutrition to produce milk and then go back to the Dane sites and feed their cubs and carry on game that's until the Cubs are enough to eat meat at which point she will have to hunt and then move the Cubs to the kill so she still can't had very far away from the Dane side at that point where is the this pride at the moment moves very long distances and almost on a daily basis they're moving very many kilometers that line is that the young cubs wouldn't be able to eat follow the movements of this pride just for a Cubs sake should she have kids eventually when they get a bit older and they can come can join the pride they will struggle she competes at feeding time say there's a bull elephant behind us I'm not gonna point the camera there right now it's walking behind the bush and in the shadows of the riverbank they can't see it's all that jelly but if it comes coast I'll definitely show you Jennifer Roessler how cold is to get there in winters in the dead of night early mornings it can get close to zero but the moment the Sun comes up and as it starts rising in the sky it warms up quite quickly so you know early in the morning you could because of the wind factor because we're in these open vehicles you wearing maybe four layers with gloves and a beanie but as the day goes on you gradually shed those layers and for most of the day actually just a t-shirt and shorts it's a very pleasant winter weather the nil King saying thank you for your videos of the lockdown much appreciated Neil thank you we appreciate your comment and that any of you come across the map ojos and all the Majin Gilani's your thoughts stories on them I have spent quite a lot of time with my Paco's when their face became territorial in this area they were born on Mala Mala we need them when they were born into the I feel pride and the I feel pride held pretty much the exactly exactly the same territory that the cam bullet pride currently holds and they then reached independence moved about or what became nomadic for time and then when they came back to Mala Mala and they stake their claim the the territory that they claimed was initially in the maratti river so they recalled them little white emails yeah and I had some great sightings of them I think after I left malamar the first time Peter would have seen them Abajo was quite a bit arrived just after I left the first time around yes I was also here for most of the what we called the money late emails the mijung islands for basically I started here they just become dominant for quite a few years during my initial stint at mana mana and it's difficult to narrow down one story with many many amazing sightings with those lines and so Sophie Marie asked me how long how long do lions live so out here typically females will live up to about 16 17 years of age and males not as long maybe up to about 13 and the reason for that is males quite a tough life a lot of fighting has to be done and as they start getting older if they past their prime younger males will come and challenge them for their territories and then the females that come with it and the males will often die as a result of those fights whether they get killed in the fight or they just get injured and then they're on their own and they don't have the support of a pride to help hunt for them india ferrah saying did you guys know rhodesian Ridgebacks wear braids to track lines in Zimbabwe I have heard of that and my experience with rhodesian Ridgebacks is that they're very friendly dogs so it's hard to imagine them tracking down lions I don't know how they would have used them to actually hunt the Lions or to what they roll would have been I don't if I was just trekking or whether they'd have them chase them down or what the cases yeah I don't know how they would have used them and but there are very large dogs they killed so the reasons that the wild lions have a shorter life span there's just because they have a much harder life if you're living in the zoo not only do you get fed every day but you are also taken care of by vets and Amira met the computer pride has been our model mother for or they've been a dominant the territorial pride robots than three years 2006 September 2016 my first row yeah so September 2016 is when I first started setting up shop on Mala Mala after they broke away from their natal pride welcome back semi Jain cafe nice to see you back here sticks and stones dia do you foresee a breakaway pride forming in the future what you it can be be in the future typically with large crowds of lines like this if they continue to grow these price they do you break up if all the lines survive in the prod and this pride seems to be doing very well and so Susana from Bolivia welcome asking if there are any changes animal behavior since lockdown in the lack of visitors and the short answer is no as you can see these lines are they're not paying us any attention we are pretty much just a fly on the wall we're just something that to them is part of the environment and they've they they know they can't hunt us they know that we don't hurt them so we're just a living creature that yeah it's part of their existence so they don't pay any attention to us so whether we're here or not they go about their normal lives the only possible noticeable change in future will be any young animals being born now especially leopards I'd say if they're not getting they're not seeing as many vehicles he'll just take a little bit longer to clamat eyes them to the vehicles and it would normally in the dev it's just send me a message saying also streaming on Facebook at the same time with little emoji of sunglasses on pretty cool thanks to dub so there are people on Facebook currently watching this and we are not answering your questions our apologies we are currently answering the questions on the YouTube feed and yeah so if anybody's commenting on the Facebook page we haven't actually had a look at that yet and our apologies that we aren't answering the questions so we are trying to see on another phone yet Dan's gonna open up the Facebook page and see if there's any comments and we'll see how well this works Arjuna thank you very much it was a so NIC actually had hours of footage from that sighting and we just managed to condense it into a couple all those few minutes but it was a very nice sighting who is not just here mother leopard and cub playing around and if that of you who might not know what Arjuna is referring to we have being pretty much on a daily basis been posting episodes on to a YouTube page and part of what we've called our ranges in isolation series which you can find on Mala Mala gamers youtube page and there are links posted to each episode on our social media platforms Esme Watson and just to answer your question there do we have to feed them sometimes how many prides on this reserve and how many reserves are there so as we we don't feed any of these animals the none there are very many reserves that border the kruger national park all of that is reserves that border the kruger national park have open fences with the kruger national park together with the kruger national park we refer to it as the greater Kruger National Park and the Creator Kruger National Park is the size of Belgium so although it's very big we consider it an open system it's not really but it is very large and we let these animals it's large enough for these animals to catch what they need and to balance of themselves for the most part I think there anything one of the areas which the balance is tricky might be with the elephants just because they are very prolific breeders the population numbers increase tremendously and they have nowhere to go where they used to go the east coast of Africa to the west coast of Africa there are not currently contained within this area the size of Belgium which sounds big but four elephants and the ancient migration patterns is actually quite a small area further lightening around just to catch up to the more recent comments we haven't responded to your questions we're sorry just yeah quite a few coming through me and Mala Mala we are not open now however the Kruger National Park will be opening to soft drives I think on Monday but I named the respective provinces and Santa or all those African national parks but only within your province Ben Smith's I believe the these males the guy males are the dominant males over the tortured so the technically the Gary males were dominant over the tortured pride but we having actually seen male lives with the torture price for quite a while unless you're referring to the young male and that is kinda becoming no medic I guess will breaking away from the tortured prod but we haven't seen them interact with any other male lines to this point Kathy Palmer you must welcome it's pleasurable hours so Sara they're masking any information on the Salalah female and their cub also known as the monthly pride we do we'll be posting a little video about that this evening on our social media platform so stay tuned for that so vicious some Maxim Marga was the mega the kids were watching please let us know what their names are be nice to say hi to them and if they have any questions we'll be happy to answer them as well Blair we have not had any recent sightings of the southern of all camels but it's mostly because we haven't really ventured into the southern parts of our reserve at this time of year the sightings are quite common like it's quite difficult to get down south without finding other animals but you all try and venture further south at some stage brach been asking which one of y'all is the ladies bad pizza and you under the child's that you must be the ladies man dr. Faisel welcome from Saudi Arabia and Brian Gilman yes we did [Applause] so that's episode of the symbol of pride attacking the mathlete pride Oh Salado pride that actually took place on Malta Malta Game Reserve was trashed our boundary with our neighbors CSP did certain it's on one of our episodes on YouTube and the lioness he got beaten up in that episode just watch our Instagram page for an update this evening on that line is the Marty Lonnie's Ben Smith was a hairy very hairy hairy hairy belly member so one of the claritin else was he one of the largest males you've seen on the reserve yes he's definitely one of the bigger ones it's difficult to say with these animals whether or not they're the largest because yeah for an accurate measurement that you have to kind of weigh them or measure them a lot of love is lost through our Arizona and human perception I know for example seeing a male leopard one day and you think he's a really big male and you see the same male leopard two days later and he doesn't look that big at all so I also think being in the vehicle we're in this big thing that gives us a false idea of how big we are also helps if they're standing next to each other to see sizes yeah yeah probably the most impressive main male I've seen in my time here at Ala Moana Christine Prescott asking what time they'll be getting up today any guesses okay so time now here in South Africa is 20 minutes to 5:00 then what's your bit 7 minutes 7 minutes 5 that's a that's a good good time very confident it's actually making me nervous and there's something we don't keep you gonna take 8 minutes and again thank you Christine for those kind words the Kathleen Jones asking for those 3 cheats alone the reserve we lost her tracks them a couple days ago in the northern parts for reserve but because only a couple of vehicles out every day and we hardly scratch the surface of our reserves let me go out on our daily drives so they might be we just haven't seen them but so the last known sighting was I think almost a week ago no man Frank the cheers unfortunately we are forming on cell phones on mobile phones I'll zoom in a little bit there for you just sort of fewer lines so Gareth has doomed in a bit but yeah we're not using any fancy cameras out here we kind of keeping it simple Pizza Ferrari welcome back New York City Russell McLaughlin is Ross aren't you supposed to be working so salvation so we have to say hello to forgive us about proof we pronounce you pronounce your names wrong but I'll take the second name just and Suraj and then 17 got to have you guys watching the livestream dates entitle welcome back doesn't Sarge have you been on Safari before if not you 20 tell your parents to get you over here Sarah same all the mother is the best reserve that's why they named it twice that's right this is the name so nice you have to say it twice been the ultimate Ottawa male was seen or as a few weeks ago I know he wasn't too far away about two days ago but you didn't actually come on - mala mala that's who is and there you see someone commenting on the stream cause Russell MacGuffin in character bar to zoom in on him boom crews here at the moment high rest way for the camera I don't know if he can hear us it might take 30 seconds for him to wave yeah okay we're not gonna keep the camera on him too long we'll get back to the lines I said yes welcome back Kells guarding lights welcome back yes sir Sylvester and so your comments are just asking how long the Young Lions will stay with the pride sir so just how it works is so in this prideful jump though for example there are 14 Cubs some of them are males some of them are females generally what happens is the females will stay with their mothers they will stay with the pride and it's the males who move off and they have to go find eventually find a pride of their own and normally they can do that around three three and a half years yeah so generally the male Cubs will stay with the pride yeah and I think it also depends you know it depends on pressures from other Lions in the area as well and after you eat in the in the books it will say you know anyway from two to four years but it very much depends on the area and what pressures they are from other male lions in the area and there's an area that I've been to on the border of South Africa Zimbabwe in the that area is surrounded by hunting concessions where they do hunt lions and they had hunted many male lions there many years guys about 15 years ago now and the territorial male in that region was only 3 years old and that's because there are no other adult Lions to kick them out of that territory so it depends very much less on their on the pressures from other predators who are the lines more specifically I think there's some of the things that have happen in parts of Zambia I know where male where unfortunately Lions have been poached out and especially the older the bigger males younger males do you become dominant earlier and we'll see what the knock-on effects of that are later Meeta know that only some of the lands are here at least 12 members of the Kampala pride in one Gary male so one of the male's is not cheers where there's another eight members of the pride aren't here at the moment they might not be that far away I'm just gonna zoom in a little bit on the male there he's lying in the reeds their meter welcome back so the lion is in the foreground and if you look in the reeds in the background one of the guy in males is lying there can just you what of his mane and these paws so tomorrow to offer your question of any of these lines mated recently so one of the lionesses one of the six has been mating for a few years now and she's never fallen pregnant so we think that she probably can't fall pregnant and then one of the other lionesses has one of the mothers of the Cubs has started what we saw her mates a while ago and it's her who we suspect may be pregnant again we're not sure there's a possibility this is one of the young male males is getting a bit Restless there what's the time ten to five that's it six posture so I'm closest right now raspberry Watson asking if the Lions were resting well because we're in between them and the elephants not really watch me they the elephant is far away enough and there's nothing so it probably doesn't can't see the lines there's not much wind at the moment so this has no wind blowing from the lives towards the elephant so you weren't able to smell them and that elephant has actually moved a bit further away now but our presence doesn't really have any effect on on their behavior Angie cats good morning it's good afternoon here but good morning to you wondering if there's any news on the Mafia honest well it's a la la' female and a couple the marquee proj Angie cats make sure that you and check out Mala Mala game reserves Instagram page this evening we'll be giving you an update there I'm so thank you asking how common inbreeding is in a pride that's not common at all Nikhil especially in this area was healthy population of lives and the healthy dynamics and the reason for that is the younger males do you get kicked out by their fathers and they have to go further afield in order to eventually start setting up their territories I think lions can have first generation incest before it starts becoming a basically father's can't make you their daughters but not past that Jeanine asking if I compete with any neighboring prides they do indeed and so they recently had a one side of the fair where they attacked the Massey pride and the mathy pride consists of one female and one cub so she did manage to escape with her life well and the mother and cub hadn't been haven't been seen together yeah look out for our Instagram post tonight because we will announce might be good news or bad news Lawrence geniu it's been a long time welcome back that's unfortunately Mike isn't here yeah and Petra Mari Boardman hi Howie done and so there are compromise [ __ ] I think it's dark Ravenna he is not that impressive because he stole young he doesn't know is not that man yet yeah so it's just pointed out they're flying towards us we're not gonna see those in I was hoping they're flying towards us but there's a whole bunch of vultures in the distance there maybe I can this is a minute button can't you see them flying in the distance they get back to the lines so we are expecting this crowd of lines to be more active during the day from now until November ish because there's quite cool yeah during the day and it's actually a good time to hunt along the river because a lot of the other prey species will come down and drink at the river during the daytime when the Sun comes out and starts heating up not many animals will come risk drinking at the river tonight because it's cooler they do you like to hunt you in the daytime over the winter months a different question and the old king is asking if we could describe each other as animals what would it be if I were to be accurate and boring I'd say that Beth Pete and Dan typical Homo sapiens then majestic male line Andrew W we are about four meters away from these lions and we're filming with us often yeah we're quite close to them is the camera controlled remotely no it's controlled by myself Gary Janeane Smith how often do we live stream you live stream whenever we get the opportunity to you we rely on cell phone coverage and the cell phone range is only about tapes into the property so in this stuff going down within that's range and if we are available then we will be live stream so if you just follow our social media pages and channels as well as multimeric games as well as in the dives or latest sightings YouTube and Facebook and Instagram and all their social media channels and we put notifications up when you do large team if you're on YouTube you can click the bell bottom you the bell icon to get notifications for when we do go live Maira might no we have not I've never met Kevin Richardson but I do know of him the lion whisperer hello G Peter Palmer from San Francisco cows guiding lights asking if we will still do our live streams after when we start receiving guests again and we are hoping to continue this and it has been quite well received so yeah we're also trying to ensure that we can bring them to you in a more regular basis with looking for equipment like sulfur and signal boosters and such because we only currently have mobile reception that's good enough for live streaming on about 10% of our or reserve this is Lapwing welcome back so Russia Jackson asking how they protect themselves from poisonous snakes well I think the biggest protection be their reflexes and the ability to quickly evade something but I do know of lions that have been killed have have died as a result of the snake bite in fact yeah I think so these males this male you see in the back of screen he used to be part of a coalition of five and one of his brothers quite a few years ago died as a result of the snake bites a few questions there has Robin doing robin sewells birthday today so she's doing very well and then to answer your questions about the flies we do you have some small flies that part yet but we don't have city flies in this area anymore there's a render pasted art break in I think 1896 and most of the cloven-hoofed animals died in this area and there's City flies relied on those cloven-hoofed animals to survive and they died out to the point that the city flies eradicated the titie flies as well so we quite thankful of events have tsetse flies in this area anymore but we do have other small biting flies not quite as bad as it sits inside the lawrence juniors asking us what would we do if three lions were in our house he's asking get pizza and then make sure I'm behind and behind in the to move house welcome back Superbikes and so Kathleen Jones maybe Nadav can help you with that answer who controls the this YouTube channel why I'm not sure why you aren't beginning with notifications and so not a need you well you have to subscribe but then also there's a little bell icon you have to click on that and that's our icon will should mean that you get notifications so no dive just saying that we've had ever 1.5 million viewers over the stream I'm not talking in the stream of all of our streams I'm sure you need all of our streams it's been so amazing hype everyone loves the streams yeah no doubt it's being great and everybody is enjoying it I think mrs. lapping is looking forward to a gin and tonic yeah and the question is yes the liquor stores have opened again Lamar might know I haven't we have not met him I mocchi sure yes you know who Dean Snider meter yeah unfortunately no sign of Jeannie cheetah cubs at the moment maybe if we do see cheetahs we will try large and then livestream them for you ricks Lineker by a donkey by uncle Rick's and say I had some break-ins visit visit me here I was guarding in else way and and they keep they asked me why I kept on saying buy a dog - yeah say it's pronounced by a donkey but it means thank you very much in Afrikaans one of the local languages yeah and so Peter Palmer asking whether our current plans are for reopening and receiving guests well unfortunately well unfortunately by the local is out of our hands will just depend when the government decided to and they feel it safe enough to open up our borders again so whenever they deem it is safe enough and I think there is a set date for that yet but - we are current estimations which are changing almost daily is that international well we might be opening international borders only next year maybe February and Gideon Frane Ameri saying is Japan or some term Meyers McCoy trio from pronouncing that right not moving down to self-care effective method of control of TT flies has not been implemented in southern Africa for some time but Swarna store implements control we haven't had to put in methods or in place to you because there are no it it supplies yeah I'm not sure about that flower then you're failing to is it city fly but another way they deal with them in East Africa is they put up blue and black flags which attract the city flies and they put chemicals on those flags which kill that city flies it's quite interesting cuz I think the Botswana flag is blue and black as well and then Oliver Matthew saying 5tp toss your rcg average-looking into double figures here so the panes of media asked [Laughter] Nuttall Smith would say definitely not interesting double thing is here I'm pretty similar to when you were here only it's on yet another undefeated winning streak Rex Annika how much longer will the streams will be going for we will these lines as long as we can the lights but once the light fades then it comes with tricky forming apart it's a mobile phone from the half an hour and then ya say and they kid you in front of me I just care firing this that's not a fly at all it's sleeping sickness which you get from the city life so I'm yeah kid you know I don't know enough about that seem to be able to answer you alright so it's six minutes past five and these lines are not active yet Garrett is wrong they might be starting to get active which is not the same thing you should have clarified what extra means before we got to six past lot but so yeah for you folks watching this one line is in the center of screen that's now lifted ahead and started licking her paws he's getting active yeah but it could be a very sign that they are starting to think about getting active they take a long time while they it does vary but generally they do take a long time to slowly wake up they will just your students see one of the two of the other lionesses will start doing the same thing grooving themselves yawning running over floating back steep begins and the Cubs will get involved they'll move over to each other they'll groom each other quite often sexually the Cubs you get going first but in this case it's one of the lionesses just you quickly going to another topic all of the math you still having sleepless nights about the googly I'm going to figure it out yet it's a lot easier to chip when you can reply it's something okay something in the remedy so if you folks see all those lines have suddenly lifted their heads and they're looking downstream south so you know hyena has crossed the water and these lions are active yeah so not sure these lines could have seen what crossed through the river but they heard something walking through that line that hyena decides to walk this way through the reeds gonna be in for one hell of a surprise and so I think these lions heard something moved through the water that I initially reacted in case it might have been a certain prey species maybe the Apollo water buck and probably notice the psy.d nut and haven't continued to show much interest although Lions will try and kill hyenas if they get a chance but they weren't necessarily go out of their way to do it and just to clarify hyenas weren't trying to kill Lions to eat them they kill them to eliminate them as competition it's quite a nice view of the backs of their heads now it's just you can clearly see the black marks in the back of their ears its crystalline see also the best view of Gareth that's I'm on the side of the camera if you can see how when they're hunting and how they can coordinate things from watching each other from behind it's black marks and back that yes stand out very much as well as their tails that tuft of a in the back of a tail in the end of a tails in the front they're far more camouflage David Tallis welcome back should welcome back it asking how often do we squabble amongst ourselves and surprisingly not often we don't have a choice we have to get along so the Sun has city and the light will fade very quickly now and the temperature has dropped quite considerably already so he's gonna run jack yeah you don't mind gonna make a little bit of noise and there some of you are asking when will the reserves open again on our national parks I think the kruger national park opens in about a week's time but any force on monday any force soft drives and any I don't think you can stay overnight so if you live quite close to the Cougar National Park you can take your car in and go and do some game viewing but only for the day I'm sure there will be long queues at the gates with people trying to get in that dove will he be one of them I'm sure that that is chomping at the bit to get back in the Kruger Dan Bailey do you have a question for you from my Kirkman he's asking if you're feeling position yes I'm looking after your fish for those of you are wondering where my cake minutes today he is unli and he's obviously EFT is fish behind they are well cared for Mike they're all swimming in the Sand River right now so Lisa asking if this resting spot is often used by the pride as Lisa they have a very very large territory it covers several thousand hectares and [Music] within that there are certain areas that we are kind of more likely just like if they are in this general area then there are certain spots within that area where they are kind of maybe more likely to be [Music] yeah in a roundabout way yes sometimes like when they are in this area this is quite a common place for them to be it's nice and sandy and comfortable but on a hot summer's day there's no shade but in winter it's nice to send themselves them Nadav says he wishes he could be there tomorrow but he has exams to study for I'm still the dominant you know so Ben's one of our other angels just found some more lions in the northeastern parts of our reserve quite close to a herd of buffalo and then giving us the idea and those lines yet but I'm guessing it might be members of the tortured pride they were trailing a herd of buffalo earlier good luck with your exams I'm sure you'll do fine a Peter Palmer yep that line on the left is definitely embracing that pose Cemal so ng pop yes we do have an update and we will be sharing it on our Instagram feed later today watch at Mohali Game Reserve Instagram feed so Nikhil I'll see what happens if we get dance in the Jeep and walk into the pride right now obviously one of the things we wouldn't recommend trying it but typically the Lions first the initial reaction will be to back off because all that would be a sudden get a fright raid something has come out of nowhere so they'll initially maybe take a few leaps away from you but once they call your bluff thank you change I'm Rex so we think they did kill something during the midday periods maybe something small there were some vultures in the area but they none none of them are particularly full neither they have empty stomachs either hi guys and especially Gareth mm hi Meghan Gordon welcome back and height a nice to see some family on there Maggie there are no white lines yeah there are a few that are lying on their backs and you're probably just seeing the underside of their bellies ewwww Meeta asking with the pride split up for hunting purposes meter carries me the pride might split up sometimes the adults lionesses leave the younger Lions behind and might be because the younger lions are spoiling the hunt or had been spoiling many hands before the that point and then sometimes that lets say a lion it should give birth to Cubs now those Cubs would not be able to walk with this pride because there wouldn't be very mobile the it and that lioness would have to stay close by to those Cubs in which case you'd have to hunt for herself and she would not hunt with the prod Peter Palmer asking what a scam bull Amin are the prouds named after places they are indeed we name our cats after areas on the property that first established their territories the Campbell a pride are named after Campbell copies so Campbell copies is named after wet Campbell he was one of the owners of Mala Mala many many years ago and his local nickname was Campbell ax and so Arjuna saying grooming happening movement in five minutes in fact you can see a load of the line we started to put heads up now grooming themselves and each other and Arjuna it's anyone's guess it could be five minutes so they could all go back to sleep and could be another half an hour but we let's hope for five minutes in the kill saying but how come the name is billing him the place from England nikhyl a funny thing about a lot of these farms in this area is that they were named after places far and wide we have a Utah you have a Birmingham we have Wales cata London so yeah that's just farm names and that's probably just a relic of colonialism mark Bloomfield asking his Krieger open for this disease I've seen the dogs click on it there this is open for visitors but any visitors that are within the same province as Krieger and you can only do day trips no overnight stays it again just asking a little bit about the felts and the rainfall say yeah what what rain pulled we get you yet our annual average is about 550 moles we've had about 500 I think just over 500 so far this this rainy season yeah and I'm the crests we have a lot of come breed some woodland there's a lot of Stanley crests up here and with marilla's and then obviously here down at the river we've got riparian woodland all along the banks of Sandra there but a piece that excites around and there's all sorts of different vegetation in there from gory trees to jacket plums to gardenias I don't know if that answers your question so much I don't know how well you know this area but if you've ever been to sketchy so we are just north of squeezes so the felt here is very similar to that the felt around Skukuza welcome back kg1 Rachel they're kind of asking where on the reserved are we now so we are in the western parts of the reserve the river runs along the western parts of the reserve from north to south and we are probably about a kilometer if that north of retries camp and we are just north of the confluence of the match appear that way the mesh behavior that meets the Sandra there and Charlotte Nicholson we share a common border and the dev this is the bush so much the getting tired of the Heidi doesn't have brakes Lineker asking with this air be underwater in summer definitely at certain points in summertime this river does flood bank-to-bank but the water channel is some few meters 30 meters to our waist it'll take a bit of rain for the channel to VGA so Stephen Austin asking if we allow hunting on Mala Mala we do not we were actually the first gamers of choose to make them move from hunting Safari to photographic Safari is back in this in 1930 1960s so we just shoot with cameras it looks like there are now officially starting to get active know how much longer the lights gonna hold press a lot lighter on the screen and it is out there okay they're just going to the toilet there you can give them some privacy see the gauri males just lifted his head they underwriter scream I'm so oh my wrath Sean that is correct that is the reason Dedic facade no they do that they maybe go into Kruger a couple of times a year and they don't go very far east of Mala Mala it was briefly going and they come back the are eastern boundary of the kruger park is pretty much there as far as they'll go the kill so we have some almost failed large reserve so we do have open grasslands and then we do have these kind of thicker riverine forests as well and then we've got there is a lot of rocky outcrops the vegetation does change a lot I'm sorry I've actually they're trying to get to everyone's questions but if we have missed your question we are sorry it's not intentional just haven't you ever looked most of these lines are starting to get active and we will follow them as a little bit longer but unfortunately one slight die wants live girls and we will go with the light [Music] Thank You kg saved me from having to say Charlotte Nicholson yes garrison myself I have been here for the whole of lockdown Dan to join us and we went down to level four Lumiere we're looking forward to your turn as you are to all our past and future yes any of that Stan he's getting a bit cold so he's putting on his jacket Kathleen will pass on your happy birthday wishes to Robyn Charlotte asked never gets a bit much for us being out here for so long and lots for me Charlotte I was born and in the bush basically and I'm I was born in very remote part of Zambia you make it sound like you're born in an actual bush he does behave like is born in an actual bush I think all of us are here for a reason and so now we don't get tired of this very quickly this pale lioness central screen is one that pictures talking about a Leah that's been mating repeatedly and doesn't seem to fall pregnant and we try just drive a little bit of tracks off that way streets and the way yeah miss ladee this is gonna hold clicks I think we are going to try and get a little bit closer to the gari male before the light gets completely it is very dark here now and yeah we've enjoyed enjoyed your company again it's been a while and you did enjoy these last streams and he hope you enjoy them too and thank you for joining us and good luck with the exams in the dev it may be just before the light fades completely just see the people on the vehicle to Dan and then to Pete have a good evening and I hopefully will be able to do livestream again soon okay and then for myself Garrett thank you very much we enjoy your company yeah that bird quoting now such as the Scopes all maybe a better idea of how dark and here's this all of you who are missing Africa that site should make you miss it even more yeah I'm wondering you'll probably get obscene I'm just wondering if the lights gonna last until it's seen Oh jr. yes my specs are holding up with this temporary fix I have to admit that I did have an opportunity to get it fixed the other day I have kind of become it attached to this look dan I think you might just need to get a little closer this les fans not coping with elastic so you're just gonna get a bit closer to the garments give you a look at it before the light goes completely is hit up he has yawned but by the time he moves it may not be any more light for you to see him so we're gonna show you the caramel and then we are gonna say our goodbyes sex I think and if you can see that but I think we're gonna call it in Matt so thank you a lot [Music] we enjoy your company and we'll see you next time dance the sport ah yes coach so we can actually see either line there and nobody saying thanks guys that shuttles back to camp
