this is it's waiting for you it's waiting for me okay we're live thanks from dev folks welcome to Mala Mala Game Reserve and welcome to today's live streaming that is Mac in the background I'm gonna show you that was you the guilty culprit was was Mike yeah so mike has got the a phone there to be reading comments and responding to comments and today we have Nick driving us everyone okay so Nick is chosen specially today because yeah with some special animals here in screen there you can see 2k panting dogs I'm just gonna zoom in a little bit on them and you can see they are lying in the shade there you can just see the tails wagging there are another 15 behind Mike now I'm just gonna show you where they are they are lying in the shade under their tree just over here the tree that's in screen now it is a very hot day here it's about thirty degrees Celsius so these dogs these Cape hunting dogs or wild dogs are currently just conserving the energy and lying in the shade as are we now we are hoping that as it cools down that these Cape hunting dogs will get active and when they do get active they usually go and hunt around dawn and dusk when it's a bit cooler you're hoping that the full moon tonight doesn't delay their hunting sometimes when it's a full moon and they might hunt a bit later and we are hoping that that is not the case today you're hoping that they stole years but daylight hours to hunt they're very efficient hunters so for that reason when they do hunt and they are quite difficult to keep up with but because there are such good hunters if we are able to keep up with them there is a slight possibility of seeing a kill and that's why we have chosen the original stick today to be our driver okay today mrs. lapping commenting why you guys have found it all in the last three days you know we've had a very very lucky last few few drives yeah I'm just gonna try and set this up here pardon my shaking and then I'm gonna I say I have a exquisite some of those comments this week's get that arise the nice and straight tunic it's teetering on an AGA okay nobody breathe alright so Ben McMahon asking what's their percentage of successful hands so a lot of the literature and that that I've read says that there are the most successful predator certainly here they're probably the most reliable it comes to when you're following them to actually make a kill but like I said that literature says sometimes as high as 80% or even 90% of their hunts are successful yeah that doesn't seem to be the case it's probably closer to 5050 and even so as a comparison with lions and leopards perhaps 5% of their hunts are successful and shrewd a method in asking is a chancer Lions will smell them the Lions actually quite far from here I'd say maybe four five case I doubt that they would be able to smell them and if they were to come across the Lions or another predator there'd probably be some sort of fight but the dogs are not going to get involved with a big crowd of Lion City not the Khumbu Laprade it is more than twenty Lions there mr Haynes asking Mac D like watching the prey perish I do indeed one of the more exciting parts of my job is this one ad well doc no this is a different pack we can currently see only two in frame here the rest of the pack are lying behind us but there's no space for us to squeeze into the shade with them there so we've just started to sit with the tip we're not someone asking Jay is asking can you compare the jaws of wild dog and hyena the dogs jaws are nowhere near as strong as i mean--is ie nazar got ridiculously strong jaws but even if you look at ie nose head and skull it's so much bigger and heavier you know there's a lot more muscle on a hyena and just to power those jaws so then they're not as strong as the dogs but they certainly just have different types of hunting they've got a question here why do we drive open vehicles and say we do drive off-road the animals are very used to these vehicles so in order to get close up to them we do get a lot of photographers here and a lot of the Rangers take photos as well and we are able to follow these animals off-road in this area and the more car there is the more difficult it is to drive off-road it's much easier for the you know everybody to just back and dive when branches coming away and then to try and you know squeeze under branches when you got a roof over your head and Terrence Gibbs was asking half into all dogs hunt and so this is quite a big pack they're gonna need to hunt pretty much every day and maybe even as much as twice a day someone's saying give them an Impala so we are currently on our airstrip in a moment I will just will have a quick scan around and but the impalas do like to come up to the airstrip in the evening time so this is exactly what we're hoping for during the daytime they will go especially on a day like today they'll go and find some water to drink graze and browse in the shade especially now when it's very hot and then as it gets cooler they'll come up to the airstrip and raced on the airstrip for the night and they do that because it is nice and open they can see predators coming and they like to all congregate on the airstrip and just so that there's many years and I still look out for predators so we are hoping that these when the impalas do start coming to the airstrip these dogs are maybe able to intercept them the Dove my R equal to seen for a while kills in 20 minutes in Krieger team parlance grab here send enough no wonder he has a keen on the dogs today we us are pretty keen on dogs I don't know about you guys I don't know yeah yeah favorite when it comes to my favorites so Alliance just cuz we get to see them a little bit more often if we saw the dogs as much certainly be my favorite but we don't really get to know the the different packs of cat panting dogs as well as we get to know the lion prides and but even so it's always fun to watch them and it's you know even aside from just the the animals and solves just trying to keep up with them and watching how they're running around it's it's always very exciting so got a question here do they ever den and Mala Mala so not this pack but the one that we had the other day with the one year she'd end here last year unfortunately she lost her pups and then one of the other packs tend in the far south of the Year actually moved it in onto the southern end of Mala Mala and raised their pups there but we haven't had a den or successful dane from a big pack for about four years now so we fingers crossed we all have a pack this year chalo nice to see you and thank you for telling all your friends to tune in and I hope you are safe over there in the year so I'm sure you're missing South Africa and it's nice to see some South Africans tuning in from abroad Ben was asking a little bit earlier Ben Mac Mahon asking a little bit earlier but does a larger pack make for more efficient hunts definitely the the it's a bit of a trade off having a big pack they're gonna be more effective and keeping an eye on the Impala and running them down but then there's a small Mouse to share it with and there was a question from Ben as well why there's such efficient hunters and that just comes down to how their hand so they pretty much share their strategy is just to run through the bush more less and align and flush anything out and then just ran it into the ground and wear it out where the cats tend to sort of stalk and pounce on animals and so they're more ambush hunters is the cat strategy however here where we are now on the airstrip the cheetah this is a pretty good area for cheetah - interestingly the the cheetah and the dogs don't seem to use the same area we kind of Odyssey one or the other so we've been seeing one fortunately been saying that dogs almost every day but the cheetah we haven't seen any for I want to say two three weeks now in legit and legit spliff asking ask equation ax can I just see it there cookie have just forgotten it please try and capture footage of the dogs hunting and eating live prey legit spliff if you go onto our YouTube channel Pizza caught some action with a pack of two dogs just a couple of days ago and he's just uploaded a video ciao YouTube channel you can go and have a look at it and you can witness how the dogs are feeding on their on the carcass and see how the hyena how a hat and hyena rather still the kill from Kaka citizen rock hey hi and then and then cholo just saying that are you sure Traven know is watching trevor if you are watching i hope you are otherwise surely you can tell him to watch cam rod asking if wild dog hey panting dogs and what else we've been calling them it's a cat panting dog painted wolf is another name wild dog and they're all pretty much synonymous it means the same thing the you know it's just across the range I've been called various things yeah we prefer to use Cape hunting dog because it's not a domestic dog and also forgive Gareth for his clumsiness with the camera there but but yeah they called many different things but painted wolf is perhaps the the prettiest name for them but it's not one that gets used to often sadly his Shiva never visited your game sanctuary he is the most famous of African living in the years and talks about wildlife it's Lepke I don't believe he has and sadly no it would be quite fun to have him around yeah you could do this this chat instead of us I'm sure you'd have some interesting things to say about all dogs Jay is asking anything in common between wild dogs and the dingoes of Australia so Australia's fingers as understand are actually domestic dogs that were brought over by the sort of Polynesians that would have colonized Australia at one stage and they since become feral so they're feral domestic dogs that have returned to the wild with these the Cape hunting dogs it's a completely separate species to the domestic dog and actually one of the oldest of the the canine family and they're not able to interbreed with domestic dogs at all unfortunately the they are related enough that they can spread the same diseases so even though we see them fairly regularly here they're very rare animals because this is like a non distemper and rabies has wiped them out in quite big areas of their range so some of you have been asking where we are we are Mala Mala Game Reserve we are bored of the kruger national park and we have no fences along any of our boundaries we are sandwiched between the kruger national Park and the sabi sands Game Reserve we are lucky enough to be under lockdown on this property and so we are trying to bring all of the wildlife and nature that happens here everything that happens on the property to you in your living rooms so we're just gonna have a bit of change of scenery here we are going to go and have a look at the rest of the wild dogs so I'm just going to pick this up and then just give you a view of what we have around us so they are lying under their tree their center of screen and Islands asking isn't it about time to dance not quite yet but very very soon and those three that we were looking at seem to be the alpha male and female he was showing quite a bit of interest in her but earlier and and her teach do seem to be a little more full so we we speakers are the buzz of the alpha male and female and and then the these are the rest of the pack perhaps last year's youngsters as well as the non breeding adults J is asking how far we from Mala Mala resort itself so the camp itself is about a kilometer from here we add our airstrip at the moment waiting for the dogs to get active and for those of you who are watching yesterday's live stream with a camp bulla pride they were seen this morning and they were seen this morning if you can see those little Hills on the horizon there that's where they were seen so as a crow flies I'd say that's about what would you send me three kilometres so Peters looking for them if he finds them he's going to try and stream them on Facebook on latest sightings Facebook page we're not sure if Peters found them yet but he is looking for them it's nice to see one up in a birthday house how's it working in terms of the audio that you are hearing out there is the timing is it in sync with the camera but my voice okay clever and the are you guys live rat gnaw on say yes we can confirm we are live right now and Craig give the crows fly because everyone wants to be at Mala Mala cake is another AJ he is not unlock oh he is on lockdown but not at Mala Mala at the moment we welcome Craig I'm sure you missing us here yep me missing you chance give this is true that the offers anyone to res paps even if it's not to iron so interestingly we actually did have that situation here about four years ago the last time one of the bigger packs tend where one of the other females gave birth and the alpha female raised those pups along with her own even though they were about a month apart in age and so it was quite strange seeing her nursing her own pups and then the other females pups which were about a month younger so there's quite a big size difference pretty obvious that they weren't from the same litter but they were able to raise those pups successfully until they did move the den and they became all became mobile so before we get any comments about our counting skills and I have just counted they are 10 right here there are another three where we just came from the one was out of view so that's 13 so there must be more lying in the shade also a class bar test and then there are few people commenting about the audio is good thanks for that isn't it one of the ranges no he's not but he's probably as good as yeah and at the moment probably the most important part cog in the in the machine Christopher asking if the dogs hunted successfully this morning we actually don't know when we first found them they were running around on the airstrip just playing and that they seemed pretty well fed so my guess is that they had caught an Impala earlier on in the day meuk a asking are there any natural rivals in the area so for them the lions are quite a big threat and then a very regular enemy of this as the hyenas will actually or we did put up a video earlier today on Malta mollies YouTube channel showing exactly that where the pack where the females only got one ear this is a pack of 2 that caught an Impala and a hyena pretty much immediately arrived and stole they kill from the unfortunately they had a good feed and that was maybe 500 meters from here yesterday morning so you know we wondering actually if those two packs will come together obviously this big pack will have a massive advantage over such a small pack of any two we've got a lot of ranges that are tuning in from home here and just a shout out to all of you guys and I know you all must be just desperately wanting to be back here I think we got fortunate to be here but I know from yesterday's job everybody is calling you know which road we run and yeah so it's good to have you guys join us we think thinking of all of you guys that I mean are you guys like being outdoors just as much as asking how did you know where to find them so we did see them here this morning and they were more or less fun were excellent we were looking for the Lions that we're live-streaming with last night when we came across these dogs and then also with one of the leopards at Piccadilly female he's just given birth the copies to the north of our camp I'm not sure that we had been able to find her this afternoon and even if we did find her she's probably be added in so we don't view the Cubs until they're about six weeks old and so he so thank you for that comment John T that's Mike miss Jackie in the camera he's laughter yeah so we all are we gonna be leaving the piccadilly female to herself for a while until she's successfully raised a calves past six weeks and Feisal I'm actually not sure what the name of this pack is and I don't recall seeing such a big pack here for quite some time so I couldn't tell you but there's I'm sure there's quite a few people on this channel that might be able to help you out there if you do now folks if you could comment painted wolf asking to any prey alarm Korena not too often actually interestingly the animals provided they're healthy they don't seem too concerned by you know but every now and then they will call particular in the hyena rash them to just kind of test who in the herd is limping or showing any signs that they they're gonna be easier to catch the Dove getting excited they're seeing the one standing up saying our H around five they'll be they'll all be up we hope in sedative and Ben Mac Mahon was asking a little bit earlier but how often do you hire innocent sorry you know pretty much ways not necessarily hunting actively but certainly on the prowl it's actually crazy a we can drive around the never see I Hina and then other we watching these cat panting dogs or a lion or let that make a kill and I he knows just seem to pop out of the woodwork within minutes sometimes even less the hyenas are on the scene but a month ago is watching one of the lion prides a tortured prod quite spread out and between the four of them one managed to catch I ena and so I catch an Impala but the other lionesses were still trying to find her when I used the hyenas and followed the Ines in to find where she had made the kill in a thicket and they actually got the two I eNOS got to her before the rest of their sisters got there so the hyenas are just hyper alert always on the lookout for a meal if these dogs do make a kill the there's enough of them to defend that kill from all but the biggest pack of hyena am I asking if Pete finds Alliance will we understand him over there area luckily Pete's not in charge of the area today he's got the Aqua is a lot more coherent so Jay is asking hi hard as one get to Marlo miler from Johannesburg and so you can either drive from Johannesburg or you can fly from Johannesburg T's kakuzu and get a transfer from skukuza which is pretty much on the southern end of Mala Mala and to the camp or you can private charter plane and fly directly to the airstrip where we currently are or if you really want to you could probably walk or hitchhike just confirming what we are saying about Pete's terrible English and and then harder asking is the anti poaching teams still at they are always art and always on patrol here sadly we can never let our guard down but there's always actually a number of different teams in different places it's one of the reasons that we still have wildlife to see is us and our neighbours the kruger national park especially very effective and protecting this area please have the hosts introduce themselves for late comers okay so we have some okay panting dogs just over there we have Nick he's taken on the driving duties today good luck for later Nick and then we have Mike Kirkman he's part of the furniture here at Mala Mala he's been around for at least 40 years and in myself Garrett y'all for ta my lady act okay it's okay that's enough Vidya to the ha yeah and J is saying if you hit choc tail you'd arrived in a body bag and I think would be more accurate to say you'd arrive in a doggie bag perhaps test Tyga asking these foreigners and wild dogs [ __ ] and actually kill each other and it's normally not their goal to kill one another it can happen certainly particularly if they get very violent but yeah we've got quite a number of funny videos of the wild dogs fighting the hyenas backsides and nipping at their hind legs just two more to drive them off and harass them then to actually kill them the dogs do kill things by disembowelling them which is one of the reasons I've got somewhat of a bad reputation particularly in all the texts but it is a very efficient quick way the very gruesome of of killing an animal that's only a lot quicker than the lions which strangle their prey to death which can take quite some time depending on what it is that they're killing hi Riza from Indonesia welcome like these comments are coming in quick and fast so we're going to respond to them as we can and but just bear with us if you don't get around to your comment and then yourself it's one of those things where it's we never know when these dogs are gonna get active so it's gonna go from boring to hyperactive all action very rapidly it's crazy with the Lions when they wake up they take about an hour or more sometimes to get into gear if the dogs they go from sometimes sleeping to running in about a minute and so it goes we just have no idea how this is gonna turn out and that's why I mix kinda has to be foot on the pedal ready to go Joe welcome JD Wallman JD Ullman ricans 23 minutes until that happens and Nadav has already said five o'clock Nadal time's running out you see there's 8 minutes to 5 nah there's a bit of conversation going on about hitchhiking through the reserve is this Adam Adam pocket have been asking can you give us an idea on the population so I've seen quite a few different figures but certainly in the Kruger National Park the area that we in all the greater Kruger National Park anywhere the numbers probably between 180 and maybe as many as 250 and what has maybe not really that well-known is that the park has actually been able to expand in size quite substantially into Mozambique and up into Zimbabwe so it's hard to say if their numbers are going down or they're just becoming more diluted over a bigger area hopefully it's the latter that they're just able to spread out and use a much bigger area these dogs need huge areas to roam one of the packs it was monitored here believe their range was about 900 square kilometres a lion pride in the same area it's averaged about 200 square kilometres so it's huge range and it needs to include a lot of Impala to feed all these dogs they do seem to be getting a little bit more active and that Madhavi smiling right six minutes to be correct Robin your guess is awfully close to the 23 minutes just slammed but I can't I think saying 28 minutes you need to give us a hard time and yes he's testing on that you know yeah we're looking at a land reverse clock remember which is notoriously unreliable not be showing us the Chan Tom in Taiwan you know Yun do please see watching from close by now spread welcome you hon nice to have a local on the channel it's straight you for now una del Sol one of the best parts of watching these dogs get active is that we're gonna start greeting one another maybe have five minute play session and it sounds like you're rattling a whole cage full of Canaries because the twittering and that that goes on is crazy and it's not a sound you'd expect a dog to make and thank you yes you're on one for for sure oh just making the shallow for these animals are carrying on their world hasn't changed nearly as dramatically as ours but yeah we're actually quite glad to talk about something else and let you watch something else on TV and on social media then what's happening in the rest of the world I think let's you'll stick to the wildlife and hopefully they'll entertain us a lot more than what else is going on right now then Justin funny calf just saying a big thanks to our Rangers and anti poaching teams get on Team South Africans and people the world ever in your date for your contribution to conservation thanks to that Justin and I'm sure the anti poaching teams appreciate that comment as well they are working and it could be hard right now thanks Jase appreciate the comment a Terry Harris and Port Alfred that's I don't even know you guys had TV down there yet we've got a little bit of Tom down there and a beautiful part of the world as well and Thomas on eboot too lazy it does so wild Zhu Li from Richards Bay he's also one of our colleagues in the big favorite you definitely gonna get him presenting these things one day a true character and they'd have got three minutes to kickoff according to you [Music] one of the dogs guys through his morning stretches there as well j-just Center we too are waiting for action now lady hello from Boston welcome you guys ever seen black mane lands we have and Maryland's you saw yesterday been the Gary Mel's they've got some pretty impressive man's but we had another pair of Maryland's here the Claridon Mel's ado stealth particularly impressive Maine's if you go into in the doves Channel Krueger latest sightings you'll actually see a video of them killing another line that I posted they believe it's Buffalo stops lions fighting three lines fighting and you'll see their main on those lions and also see them kind of at their rawest and most brutal as well even on these two a little bit they look like they and the current time here is five o'clock one minute to five so in the dev and this you've got some firecrackers you can love in from jo'burg yeah I'm not gonna get active I think Joe's next he called it 23 minutes past five and I'll see if he's right anyone else that can guess what's on these dogs are gonna get moving you're welcome to post it and we'll see who wins sorry Nadav Petra Petra sorry saying could have passed that we all see that's okay so likes cash is gonna pan Iran to this a little boost it just appeared behind us a little bit far off I don't think that dogs can see them from where they're lying so flat in the grass normally the dog shell wouldn't really stand a chance of the big pool vote abyss but there's enough of them that they certainly could give it a try Joe Wellman revising his to cut a pile sixteen minutes fast 5j I know but that Petra you're gonna have to discuss our class your guesses are Robyn and Brian oh they're also pretty close together they're Robin Hester 32 minutes past 5:00 are they asking will you do a late night last stream unfortunately we can't with the spot lots and that it's not too easy to film also that which animals we can film will be very very limited at least now in the daylight we can kind of show you a broad variety of animals and pensive asking to have any resident cheetah and we don't really there are a lot of cheetah that are fairly nomadic and move through this area but none that all we can guaranteed to to go and see just true actually of a lot of our animals perhaps except for the leopards and even with our resident leopards knowing they're here and knowing exactly where that particular here is is not always too easy okay so it looks like two of those dogs up should we go and see what they're doing there yeah let's just reverse a bit and then you'll see if I said two of the dogs in the distance they and I've just stood up you can go and so we're just going to see what's happening from yeah I think that much they are yeah it's just wait here for now I think you stand back Roger okay so if you have a look at that tree center of screen and I'm gonna try and zoom in see a little bit of activity yeah so they might come this way we're just gonna stand by here is kind of trying to claim that we're gonna give you another three minutes leeway here after that uh I think it goes on - oh yeah kook Rob Lowe actually called it a little bit closer and there was a question about snakes yes they are snakes yeah Jess and we see both black mambas and worms lungs but not that often some would argue fortunately but you see a snake in the wild is actually quite amazing even though it is very rare well that's perhaps what is amazing nothing I've found the lines here so right now asking can we go to the lion sighting so there is another team of oz it's currently looking for the Lions they haven't had any luck yet so we're gonna stick with dogs and then bird in the hand is better than two in the bush quite literally it looks like there's a little bit of action about to happen with these dogs yeah okay so he's on the menu they're very cold and it's trying gets the wastelands truly can smell them here fxa just bear in mind now and if these dogs start running it might get a little bit lumpy here so just bear with me I've gotta hold it with one hand here and film with the other do you have and you're gonna try and stick with these dogs as far as possible say you got this right yeah I'm curious much more light on noggin crystal hold 507 at 506 I feel like you're cheating [Laughter] okay so this is why Rangers get very excited about wild dogs when they do you get active it's very entertaining but we have there's a herd of impalas way in the distance that has heard this commotion of the wild dogs they are on the southern end of the airstrip and Mac's gonna try and zoom in there but I'm afraid they really are and you can still see them running maybe there are some impalas on the airstrip there and that's a good sign for us I don't know if you can see them I don't know if I'm pointing in the right direction yeah yeah and we just can't see it nicely on the screen they're just crossing the airstrip there and it's quite interesting I would have thought they would have heard that it doesn't look like they have a couple folks asking where we are so we are at our airstrip and it is unfortunately right on our western boundary we hoping that the dogs will continue down to the river eastwards or now I'm hoping there go southwards towards where that big herd of Impala will be crossing the runway seems like was the full start for now huh yeah couple of folks have already mentioned the the smell of these dogs and it is a pretty unique smell I think if you have a dog at home and you've got an old blanket if you were to weight it and then make some socks in with it perhaps you'd get an idea of the of the unique that these dogs have I wouldn't say it's a bad smell it's just a distinctive perhaps mark I'm gonna come leave my laundry at your employee just behind us here that I think will despair cuz I'm for nice got his head up he has been rolling around so jeaious the sandrov actually has quite a bit of water in it at this time we had some rain just a few days ago and then we actually have rain predicted for the next three days and so hopefully it'll be able to stay nice and full right through the winter selim so we are in the Mala Mala Game Reserve which is part of the greater Kruger National Park in the north and eastern side of South Africa did anybody enjoy those dogs running around does a good description that Mac gave earlier like shaking a cage full of Canaries the noise that came out of the modernity we could hear that noise amazingly and very very fortunately I'm guessing for the humans of Africa they've never started to eat people and there's actually many videos of them running up to wildlife photographers and cameramen and just sniffing them running around I've certainly never had a bad experience with these animals on foot if they do see you they're just more act like they're surprised to see you then it being an aggressive encounter in any way we've got Joe Wellman keeping school on the Tom's there Joe if you could keep us up to date he is a very honest soul yeah with the comments I flipped through so quickly it's difficulty to read them it's got nothing to do much reading ability been asking do this much of anything to do with their ranking know their spots are more or less born with them they don't really changed too much once a adult says little pups a are black and Cullinan when they get to sort of six eight weeks old you start to see the the very distinctive coats developing but then it's actually quite useful for researchers they can identify each individual dog through its unique code pattern it's one of the ways that they can always get an accurate count of how many dogs are within a given area even when that area is extremely large [Music] the dog hunting strategy is very different way they just go running after the animals and into the ground yes and I've been here and not given a chance to race it's a really good place to hide from lions and lipids but a terrible place to hide from while dog and cheetah the Jay is just using a strip abandoned just for the lockdown period it is there's no flash coming in over the flock down dude but it is not abandoned people do hire private charters and fly asking Rangers so there's actually quite a number of different options and places to study and then normally when you get to achievers if you're gonna work at they'll do their own in-house training again so Mala Mala we've got a mix of some of the ranges that have got a more academic route our most academic ranges have got three degrees two of them and then quite a few that I've got one or two degrees and we have others that have got a more practical route and perhaps [Music] studied myself I studied game launch management and then we have a few that have just been doing this for so long before there was even the option of doing courses more studying formally so yeah there's number of different routes to to come at it however all of them when you do start shall we all go through the same in-house training which Manion the and involves the ending all the rides and how Mala Mala specifically operates but a few the facts behind us is some more Impala coming out onto the very northern end of the runway so it's taken the other key to find and they've just found them where the lines are left so I don't know what they've been doing that side but I'm pretty sure they'll go into Facebook pretty soon it has taken a long while to find lions in the same spot where they live those of you that are not watching this on your on your phone you can perhaps if you have two devices where you lock down with the Betty someway one of you can be watching the Facebook happening with Kruger latest sightings and that's the computer pride about three kilometers from here and then that's with the dogs both of us are waiting to see his particular Mayans are notoriously lazy just put the link up for everybody if you want to go and see those lines there's the link thanks to death am i hearing a dog knock in the distance what you were hearing was baboons barking they sound very much like a dog sonic dogs so there is one bit school in South Africa it's called under support it's just another question from everyday I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing your name properly but there's one vet school in South Africa called understood and all of the vets that are in South Africa have been to that school it's based in Pretoria and they are a number of vets in this area and that attend to the wild animals RTA Kruger National Park itself as they earn vets and then there are a number of private mates that come in assist we need does anybody know Joel's handle you know say an everyday muttered in about the vets there if you're interested in that I'm going to just get we're looking for veggie visits Mala Mala often and his name is Joel and he does some incredible conservation where care it's worthwhile following his account if you are interested in that stuff he is in and about all of these reserves and yeah he's got a very interesting Instagram account just gonna get their handle his name is Joel Elvis if you want to have a look salon je l so named Elvis al ves and his handle is there and the school conservation and the school [ __ ] said the conservation [ __ ] okay here we go looks like the dogs getting live rain forecast for this evening so you can see the grass and the dogs tails blowing and the wind that's picking up pretty rapidly when attending Charlie's live now and that's just easy scam handle I put on me if anybody's interested in a year so it's normally just one letter almost exclusively any one letter in the year and usually in the winter say perhaps from May at the earliest through June July August thanks we're just checking if feathers are live on Facebook yet I think they only just found Alliance might be struggling with signal with where they are I'll follow me from the Mozambique border Mike I mean you know that answer in a straight line I think we're about 60 or 70 kilometers there is one point on Mala Mala where you can see both the Drakensberg and the bombuh mountains at supporter between South Africa and Mozambique it's not that far in fact young Kinnison thank you for putting that up there at the conservation rates there is Joel Elvis's hang handle lines alive thanks to the deaf just with regards to the cut over the dogs I'm in the head never fit to his marble cake but Romeo's good is anyway for each individual the question how far we from Zoomers my guess would be that's about ten or so kilometers to the north of us maybe a little less but so where we sitting we're more less at Mala Mala mein kampf if you were to look on Google Maps we just south of the camp 2020 I'm sure you've got a smart TV you know every single this morning counted 17 of them guessing they're all still around we only counted 13 this afternoon but I'm sure that's just because some of them are lying in the long grass hidden away from us at the moment Thanks maybe you can also just give us a hand and let us know how the wind noise is coming through it's actually starting to howl a little bit here with the wind gasp trying his best to protect the microphone input from the wind but let us not so jay is wondering what toothpaste the dogs use so it's actually not such a bad question because their teeth are actually very white and that's from it's not so much the toothpaste as the toothbrush so when they eating these animals like Impala and so on that fur helps too ok great see those young dogs are just picked up stick blowing interestingly all of these animals often it's the oldest or maybe an injured individual that also stays as a babysitter with the pups while the rest of the pet goes out hunting when they return with the food for the pack they're also again regurgitate some of the food to that babysitter as well as the pumps so there's no loss to the to the babysitter and staying behind so I'm just gonna zoom in on what you think alpha male and female just behind this wild dog yeah they're standing up in the background so just behind this dog you'll see that there are two sets of ears behind them and those Jeff sticking together since the moment he arrived no female not asking if any of them are colored or the house is colored and not that we've seen with this pack but some of the other noticed jaunty but maybe next time she gets up we'll have a look and see Gordon nice to see you on the feet I know you're supposed to come out to South Africa this year I'm sure that's saying it's looking like it's getting but dark I'm gonna ask ya just to pan over to wards or sense it you'll see there's a lot of clouds closing in but the sense it's not quite as beautiful as yesterday but not too bad mine's the same as yesterday yes they are from those lines moved in a straight line perhaps five or six kilometres but we're not sure how much a zigzag din between those two places and yeah we are going to be uploading a video on our YouTube channel where you'll get a closer look if anybody was watching yesterday you saw the two males fighting and add a little bit of a tough and in the video that you'll probably be posting tomorrow morning you'll get a close-up look at that one males face it looks like he's been it looks like they've been edited with each other quite a bit over the last little while so if you go to the Mala Mala and youtube channel you'll be able to find all of our videos there which are a little bit more polished and you'll just get a closer look at the animals and I'll say maybe some more details about animals you end up to see asking what is the most interesting thing about the dogs and for me it's probably this waiting for them to get active and then just seeing them good and trying to rock it around and keep up with them I'm sure even watching it home you can feel the tension building mouths thanks I'm not gonna try and zoom in too much and because once these dogs start running out trying you know it's a lot easier for me to try and keep them in frame you'll see what links that they that yeah I'm actually not sure what this particular tax name is you know are 17 of them so I'm pretty sure there will be a while nine back gentlemen I'm gonna have to ask you to please a moths original only meet current asking to debacle hello just make whimpering noises so you heard all this tutoring of this bark like a dog would make and then they don't so much howl but if they separated somehow they make this what lard hooting sound too to call those missing members of the pack particularly when they have been hunting say Impala that chase can last 1 or 2 kilometers and they do often get separated so they have to make that hooting call to kind of regather the troops interestingly when they missed often they go back to where the hand started and they use that as a sort of a rally point if they have caught something then they just try and wolf it down before it gets done and perhaps by eanes alliance and then they will also try and call the rest of the pack there but they do regurgitate food to one another so even if some of the spectres are late they might still be able to get a bit of a feed pleasure and I hope you and your family keep on enjoying these videos occasionally how many teams of design so we don't usually operate in teams and it's just under this lockdown period that we are currently split ourselves into teams just from a foaming point of view and it's but easier to get you know different shots if there's more of us in the vehicle filming and right now we need a driver we need someone monitoring all the comments and we need someone holding the cell phone for the footage and so that's why we are currently in teams run shots and saying I'm doing schoolwork right now pretty good job so far even though I might not have been the most attentive student Jase is asking what is recommended duration of stay at Malta Mona so mostly I guess there for three nights we're really lucky we've got an abundance of wildlife so if you say it with two nights you're pretty much guaranteed to have seen the big five but three knots is what allows you to spend some time with the individual animals instead of racing from one sighting to the next as you can see with this dog sighting we been waiting here for some time but it is still exciting to sit and be able to watch and wait and see what happens and discuss other things just as we've been doing now and we fortunate with just hot we know that the awesome lions on that the property that we can also go and see and we can just move from one sighting to the next if it gets dark perhaps we can go to the Lions for now we sticking to the daylight hours just to make it easier for filming as a guest so that experience is a little different so mike has been talking about meter he's been in charge of the Commons the meter meter says hi Gareth we safaried with the last july amazing time meter nice to see you on the feed please come back I'd love to take you out again this is Kim have night vision hi leaders three months is a good time to stay in Mala Mala you'll see a lot of stuff in treatments unfortunately we having to wash on vehicles ourselves at the moment he will say changing and have to maintain them ourselves during lockdown danny is asking how can you tell them apart and so with the juveniles it's hard to see in the picture but there are little bit smaller and these pups are actually gonna have to help contribute to raising this year's a little bit heavier bodied but it's not a reliable way to guess and then there are records if you've ever seen wild dogs in the Kruger Park or they do ask if you've got photos of the flanks right and left side to send them in and they use that for research and they can map out where the individuals are seen and trying to get a total count of the nine individuals in the park so if any of you are busy okay don't know if you can hear that but there's a Valle de Beer stored canoe that is alarming in the background if anybody is streaming the liens just what's happening curious can can you guys if someone is streaming in the liens I also want to know if you can actually understand what Pizza saying because he members a yesterday so there's 17 of the dogs here not all of them I shot at the moment we filming the bulk of them in the middle and then there's some to the left and right of the screen north and south for you Christine Prescott's is the liens are flat cat as well as amber thanks for that glad Pete's not beating us and the exciting sightings being spied you know this morning I counted 17 this afternoon we only counted 13 but they all sent me some around well there's a moon rising I don't know if you'll get the Sun on myself in the days and being arise somewhere you can't see it all the kid yeah I'm gonna try and see him in a little bit as I think it's so if anybody is watching that second livestream I've got a request why'd you tell Pete to stop mumbling so I got my aunts online again gene and Sheila hi guys to drugs as you're just gonna reposition you and get a slightly different view on these dogs so that dog standing top-left corner of screen is looking at another three dogs put them in the middle so that dog knee is looking at another three that are on the airstrip they're not happy and I'm looking towards the northern end of the airstrip and hoping something plays aren't you so a couple of folks asking are we gonna do this every night yes what we're trying to do is find the animals in the morning our YouTube channel and then in the evenings we've been trying to do the Kruger sightings for Nadav and sure part of paradise with fuel and it's a lot easier as far as knowing where the animals are to find them in the morning so that'd be more this can guarantee that we'll find them in the evening but nervous that the dogs weren't gonna be still this afternoon fortunately they were a little bit of trouble relocating those lions and also found this morning but you know we hoping that finding them in the morning that tactic will help us with the afternoon feeds just when we hope to bring you this is a more regular feature certainly during the lockdown in South Africa and hopefully also going forward into the future and maybe after lockdown we'll also have something a bit more high-tech than just the cell phone to bring you this Shawn grant asking the smaller cats yes we do see all of those species it's a lot harder to see those animals too much about hiding thanks okay just get ready and be with me while we drive yet not sure if these dogs are from the same pack my neck should be a bit of an aggressive interaction luckily I couldn't be more open than Haleh malas airplane parking bay [Music] animal lover Foxy's coming Naza top to start watching the video [Music] next you can see the moon rising me and it is starting to get dark now and we are when it does gets too dark we will in this transmission even if we wear out our selves we would not view these animals at night say yeah just just to let you know we are nearing the end of our transmission let us be lovely having you all aboard let me have you all join us for the sighting if you do want to find out any more about the animals here but what is going on the mana mana on the property itself we are trying to form all these sightings and put them on YouTube so if you go to our YouTube channel you can find arranges in isolation series and hyena interaction and I think two or three videos and please feel free to go and have a look then if you want to see or get to know our animals better please head over to our web site at www.clickincomputer.com [Music] and again the Duff and thank you for all of your help the deaf chimes in from time to time and he's very very interactive helping us along the way here and it's been a great help all of these transmissions so again the dev thanks to you so just one other thing we had our Rangers photographic competition recently and the winner was Dan Bailey one of the Rangers had
