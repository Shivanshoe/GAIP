the drinking okay specs it seems lucky laughs can you get on taught you to badger you can see the channels are there comments you know that's there we go like this effects are alive here at mono moly and we are with the island female lipid here is just behind that be sure they can just see a head poking out into the road I'm gonna zoom in a bit there this years there there's a sick and lipid just over there that is a three year others female you see that there are two vehicles in shutteth is yaku filming for a youtube channel I mean he's busier the staff drive I'll get back to that in a minute let's just watch what these lipids do you okay and yeah that would actually be good thanks yeah that's a Three Rivers female busy rasping or roaring and see the island female has been displaying quite territorial behavior she's been scuffing her feet she's been rubbing a st. Olaf over the grass and on the road they're running around and so we are just gonna try and observe what happens here and see how this plays off okay so this is the island female here [Applause] please yeah okay thanks so it looks like we're getting some comments in yeah I'm just going to get set up a bit bitter so I can't see it okay there we go hello everyone effects are you currently sitting with the island female lipid yeah and and there is a second lipid in this area and this is why she's growling if you listen carefully you can hear growling since asking for close shots and chronic I'm gonna try and zoom in a bit yeah and it's gonna be a bit shaky I'm doing this off of my cell phone yeah trying fax I'm struggling - there we go focused on it you can see how lit she is and she's growling we are gonna keep quiet from time to time just so you can watch this play out beautiful animal we agree she's very beautiful except you could hear that that was the second here he's gonna watch it there that that was the second lipid that's in this area known as the three-year of his female and the island female is just that behavior that she was shying na is the lipid that is currently on screen and she is running around leaving a saint in the Grasse and he does not look happy to see how to hear the theory of his female cyclists bye and that was the theory of his female rasping I say showing some territorial behavior so we're just gonna sit and watch to see how this pans out okay I'm gonna try and attain to some of you coming to the moment I'm just gonna zoom out a bit and as soon as these leopards start making a noise or doing something interesting again we'll keep quiet trying to sit okay yes this is a real lipid we know her very well her name is the island female hello there in the USA hi from South Africa guys so just to fill you in and your TJ Andrews love at the same time well that's good going we can't even achieve that yeah okay let's watch what she does yeah you know I replied some comments jet packs you gonna gonna go just a little bit forward on the road and see if these lipids come our way it sounds like the one leopard is headed our way here we go okay so he stole that I'll if you know I think you're gonna stick with her and she is the older of the two lip it's prison - yeah she was born in February 2013 so if someone can do that net I can't maybe you can reaches for Jeb okay there we go okay Sam with briefs missing here he'd range at maloo maloo and he is helping us navigate here while we be this island female lipid so she's a particularly large female lipid and the two-year of his female is quite a small Leopard it'll be nice if they both come into frame and lipids are very very secretive animals it's not normal to view lipids like this and for the most part they hide away from people in vehicles but we have spent a lot of time driving very carefully around these animals and they've gotten really used to our presence that they tolerate us and it's just an amazing experience to be able to watch these natural habits play out in there in the wild here so there are two other vehicles of this and for those of you that are joined a bit earlier I might have seen a second vehicle next to us look at here scuffing her feet there it's a territorial deplete behavior there she's leaving a st. all over the grass use the clock yeah something sailor was gonna make one of you thing to play this okay nothing important they establish their territories they have physical boundaries such as rivers and sometimes in some cases not really in the case of leopards but in other territorial animals like lions then fences may also play a factor but these sort of invisible line that we can't see get drawn through these confrontations that that play out she is territorial she would she still sort of be you know feeling the waters as as far as geldan it's just the same person interrupts hearing on in and justify her growling don't know if you guys can hear that day FEX I don't know maybe just wanna write in the comments there and if you can hear these leopards growling or rasping it won't be very loud turn up your volume as much as you can just to just William putting my hand on a cell phone there's no gimble's or anything the quality can get a bit shaky from time to time but we'll do our best to keep our a steady hand we've got the steadiest hand in the east yet those comings coming their beer yeah Island female here in front of us she she doesn't look she's not displaying the exact behavior and aggressive leopard would normally do but what's that lying down and rolling around it's also just to leave a scent behind most of the communication has is olfactory and birkhoff's the roaring and growling you're hearing that's the leopards telling each other that they are upset with each other's presence and then the synth marking and rolling around and that is also drawing these lines of the territory and saying you know this is my section it not yours the those those markings also you know have several messages and as far as the you know what aggressive that animal is the case of merit females marking for males and males can tell where the females in estrus or not there's quite a lot of information these animals can get from those marking a lot of the what's happening is also fostering the roaring back to each other and potentially if they get closer they may do for the lateral displays as far as to see who's the larger the smaller the view before they actually go into the physical confrontation obviously they want to ward off the aggressor and as a person physically confronted and avoiding you in the bush otherwise be a small engine you could prove quite faithful over time so they do they don't necessarily want to go straight up and kill each other but shouldn't get to that that's and has been witnessed before and they may very well though get into a physical confrontation if neither leopard backs off eventually so the other day said the three rivers female is on the seems to be on the left-hand side of the frame walking from right to left away from but too early to call call it now as far as the outcomes of this encounters concern but potentially she could see that this lipid is far larger and might want to back off the island female here does seem to stop growling from now but you know he may well she was in a few minutes we will say about that legs just asking if she's pregnant around eight week mark we haven't seen that cub for the last two weeks which I mean it's it she has Sharon Saunders she still lactating so they will move their dens from from time to time and we assume that she's just being a dentist somewhere where we haven't found it yet so it'd be interesting which you know unfortunately gonna be darker but later shortly and a father but if it was if we had found her said tomorrow morning we could follow her and she could do that then but we let the leopard show us where the limbs are we don't really go out of my way searching for them just tell your kid to stand by give them a little bit of space one day get it all in this effexor comes the three rivers female I can see her walking down the right so I just had to do a quick maneuver they just make sure that we're not in these animals away and it's quite important see Serena dev so there's the three of us female and here is the island female okay so I say I'm gonna move around it but not just so that you get a view of what's happening it comes to the three of us you know and then I'm just gonna pan to the right yeah so that I can be about about 40 meters apart [Music] the remarkable scene that's playing opportunity to be sharing it live with you is quite amazing do you get to capture these matters from time to time but not so he claims was just asking what's the length of the eastern boundary but 18 kilometers pounding with the kruger park that's unfenced incoming go as they please unfortunately we can't but they move around very freely we spend a lot of time with these animals from when they're very young but you etem them to the presence of the vehicles so we will start off by limiting the number of vehicles and the amount of time that can spend with these lipids when they're really young and maybe put a second vehicle in this case this was actually two separate sightings that mesh together which is why this the three but these liquids from very very early on because they're not very comfortable around it they sort of go about their day as naturally as possible without engaging and interacting with the vehicles at all so we very much a fly on the wall in the scenario you'll notice that none of the liquids are looking at us or paying any attention to us they were walking around they're not shying away from that at all so it's a true privilege to be able to sit as well and and what is these scenes play out as they would as if we weren't here at all the older of the two [Music] he does tend to this is a sort of encounter that will potentially solidify the sort of eastern boundary of here territory into the side that it's not work I'm just gonna try and get into a better position yeah excuse the wobble yes I just wanna point out where few of his female is the two-year of his female has walked to exactly where the island female has just come from and she has scraped right on top of where the other females described get his turn off the volume [Music] this is something you'd see they and sometimes don't go into just growl at each other in posture at each other for a while and then go this in my experience I have seen this after the to meld if it's for a period of three days they just followed each other around and if they constantly were displaying at each other but he never wanted they actually physically fighting so this can take some time but they're these lipids are very close it's not you know the outcomes haven't been decided yet they are the leopard just for those that have joined us leopard and shop at the moment is the island female is a seven year old Xai just cut briefs off they're quite really but we'll do that from time to time there is some lions roaring directly north of the scat that we see in screen here we are facing north essentially in the background of the two vehicles that are with these and [Laughter] [Music] it depends very much on what lost yet so if she hates a scrap here this morning then she wonders this afternoon this evening another question here's the road use of the boundary and it can be and a lot of these boundaries saying but being the the end of the wet season everything with grass as long as liquids use the roads is for the same use and we do the path of least resistance so there will occur Sint Maarten do their the territorial patrols along these established roads Cuba for the ease of walking along them and they can influence them the size and shape of the territories if these roads didn't exist they wouldn't be patrolling along them and they're walking along them perhaps there would be game trails a lot of our roads our game trails that you've just made so that's also one of the reasons we do see a lot of traffic from the animals on the roads but yeah it's not generally not always the case but they will take advantage of the factors so I'm the question of the the creator see there's a some prey walked into the road now with their chaser they sometimes would do it depends on where it would walk out if it came right in front of this leopard then maybe she might go through but she's a little bit preoccupied with the presence of this elevated food is not very high up agenda at the moment but say if there was no the leopards around her and she was just sitting in the gas and something walked within sort of it's called a ten meters or 30 feet from it Thanks say you've just heard what we'd be talking about we are back live now and yeah we sorting out some teething problems on our side and yeah we just trying to be sensitive around these animals and and yeah so you've decided to give them some space and we're just going to form this live here okay well good thanks to dev so we're just gonna film this live here and and the other two vehicles are gonna go and look for those lines I think I think we're good for now and so let's see some of those come and see just a bit of an ek kay thanks the dev so just wanna shot asked to Nadav there and he is helping us get Lobby and as you can see we are not we are not technically minded at all these are Rangers Rangers not working out of our natural habitat online please excuse us I hope we didn't say anything - yeah okay here we go so let's just watch them live for now and just appreciate what's gonna happen here just in consent context to what's going on uh there's a couple of people I see is just joined again and some maybe some new folks but there's two liquids in this area the one that's in shock at the moment isn't a seven-year-old phenom then the island female and then to the left of the shock there's a four year old female lipid called the Three Rivers female we are sitting on the boundary of the eastern boundary of the well that sounds like is the third lipid in the fray here has been Aurora and growling at each other and that can potentially attract other other Doonesbury and that's likely another male lipid things are heating up a little bit yeah so let's let's see what players are so we're very fortunate on Mala Mala to have one of the the highest letter density is recorded in at least in Africa and one of the highest in the world kaliesha structurally the sign a female walking towards the area of where we heard the third leopard roaring say folks there's lots happening around us you know there are baboons that are barking down at West Street Bridge is lions roaring tar north is in parlous snorting to our south is a Lepidus roar rasping roaring toss off and we've got these two leopards in front of us here that I having a standoff hey Sheila my auntie Sheila I can't see the comments right now briefs is handling those I'm behind the camera so he doesn't know that to my auntie but Sheila table is my aunty and yeah just a shout-out to you nice to have you online [Music] like Sedona if you can hear that but there was a second lipid to respond to here harassing me and it's not the fear of his female he's also in this area and the three year of his female is just behind this bush yes some way we're not gonna move around too much and you're just gonna stick with an island female for now and see how this plays out it would be curious to see who the stayed later this priest I don't know if you have any guesses as to you think it might be there's quite a few options this is a this is quite an interesting spot where we are waived there's an overlap of sometimes two males different males that we see in this area and then this is the once again the boundary of two females the option of four different methods he does tend to stick closer to the river doesn't really venture as far away from the river is really hearing the roaring it could also be the India teeny male we've we have seen along the road property haven't seen him for a while but could potentially be him I'll throw a curveball in there and said that it could also be the Senegal Bushmills once again a lipid that yeah so I think this I think we should stick a other female urine she's walking he's you know there's been a call and answer from her and the other lipid is rolling through the shaft of us which we haven't identified yet so let's see what she does it seems that the interaction between her and the three rivers female behind us may have just subsided for now it seems to them they're you know the the smaller Three Rivers female may have decided to to move off and not to challenge the much larger older Island female this was a portion of the ante Mouse territory at one time I have seen it here before but she doesn't really utilize this area not for me not for the cell fence but it'll be quite a wide shot you like so we are testing YouTube to see what works better between YouTube and Facebook and we currently can't see your comments on the screen while we are filming so it takes two of us to see all of your comments so Brisas got his phone running watching the comments while I'm filming and yes if you see that we aren't replying to comments we've got a lot to consider here you got two lipids in the area we don't - we also have to be very cognizant of where they are and how they're behaving [Music] let it is now roaring from directly west of the physician of of the island female over here she doesn't usually go much further west of here so since she will walk up and down the road as opposed to me first she would over here Franklin alarm calling me she's just been listening to that it's probably that either late that that's headed this way she's smelling the three years female the two years of you with us earlier you will see in the tear of his female st. marker say so she said marking right on top of where the three of his female said mocked India sees an alarmed calling in parlor can she hear from the animals that that other leopard is getting bit closer snorting sandy here is an Impala alarm calling it's very likely that that Impala can actually hear [Music] another corner an answer from the liquor to the Western science to be getting a little bit closer so God still anestine are responding to those calls not relinquish again so when driving with these animals as well we're constantly assisting the body language looking at making sure she's obviously not reacting at all to the vehicle but where she was walking there and she stopped to turn we would then stop to just see what's the reason why she's looking in that direction what is she may be listening to or what did she see and that will give us a little bit more insight as to what's really going on in this area our eyesight is very limited here because of the season it's very pushy very thick so we can't see what other lipid might be around here but obviously can can hear she's got much better hearing than we do so we'll use her senses a little bit and just try and read their body language to see what's going on and it'll give us a little bit more insight once again she's turned again to look into the direction of where there is some Impala alarm calling in the distance that's also giving her an idea of where this other other lipid might be see one of our older Rangers Brendan Cole responding here saying that is coming random old living in the past year that was the Princess Alice pans male was the dominant brain and we are we are close to Princess Alice pans you can probably see the red we're on does he recognize it please [Laughter] but I want to start the driftwood with the etiquette class the wall she's listening did I listen to you what sharing on facts every road here at Mala Mala has a name and it helps us first of all read each other in safe is an animal that is found we can tell other ages on our radio she's just everything and where that animal is found and we are able to do so in a very short sentence but it means that we have to learn every single Road on this property and there are many roads this particular the roads name is and we were waiting for BC to get back to us to see an area where their first territory amar amar would be a young or an old lipid so we actually haven't established we haven't really had a good sighting of this it'sh male - even though where he would normally occur so we'll give it some time they didn't get comfortable on the property starts in marking start establishing himself and then we will give him a name somebody's just asked if they are black lipids on our game reserve fortunately not well that would be cool head that would be amazing they have been record while not necessarily documented sightings but stories of black leopards in South Africa before there's a small population of leopards in the Cape and I did some work in that area and did some research on those Gators and in the time that I was doing that work there were reports from farmers of black leopard in one area I have heard stories as well as the mountain ranges to the west of where my other male is and stories of leopards is well there's a strawberry liquid which is a liquid with a sort of pink red coloration and then in an area called the majalis burg which is on those sort of more western parts of the country west of Johannesburg and Pretoria northwest of Johannesburg in Victoria there's has been reports of a koh here we go it's just a me a private message yeah that didn't manage to pop up on my screen Brennan Cole has given us the name of this road okay say I'm just gonna keep quiet for a second okay please do you wanna find now that private message from the Dove is gone or for my scream a be please can find what what brilliance is where we are right now well then maybe if I just get a decently run yeah while I'm screaming laughs okay here we go I've got it skukuza Road north of the shortcut to princess at his parents let label please that's that's good gag been enrolled at thanks a yeah and that's pretty good going just behind that littered is another edge going waste so we uh fake kinda facing soft you just okay just behind it I think piece is telling me to shut up for a minute there is something in these bushes here can hear I think you stand by you know just changing significantly they're focused on one spot what's elevating she knows there's another leopard around a piece is gonna attain to those questions well done Brendan that was good going and so that road just behind the island female is a shortcut to Princess Alice pans and we are currently on skukuza right so it currently north of the shortcut to check the princess bands had an encounter with another lifted earlier on the three rivers female seems to have tailed off now but then just as that sighting that encounter ended another left had started roaring some ways away from this leopard and now she's walked towards where that that first that third leopard was roaring from so she's not too worried about lions he ain't although we have heard lions roaring roaring not too far away from here but I don't suspect I see another lickin in the road this way the tear of his female was Brendon win last we surrounded by three leopards lipids are typically solitary cats and says to have three in such close proximity please she's coming by okay so we are going to just drive away from here in what it's turnaround and then we'll get back to say you get ft really stomach this like so we gonna turn around you're just gonna keep the Christians aside for now and yeah Greece's friends about to die but we're gonna try and stick with them for a little while longer she is its back in the road just in front of us okay yes we're just gonna have to go and I'm gonna just cut the speed for a second and we'll be back with you guys shortly please don't go anywhere it will literally take a minute and we'll be back ok effects so hopefully we back up live enough and I think we are will give it a second there are we live again ok effects a back live here we've just followed the island female back down the road okay thank you okay so I'm gonna miss the chair that you can hardly hear Bruce I said briefs you need to speak up I'll try and hold the phone a little bit closer to briefs as well we saw a few minutes ago another leopard walking across the road at the hedge here the island females now walking in that direction there has been a bit of luring back and forth between her and potentially think there may be as many as three in the area so we still trying to figure out exactly what's going on we're just letting her sort of following the island female and sort of seeing her perspective of thing we'll find out who the other lipids are shortly oops [Applause] you roughly may we saw the other liquid crossing the road a few minutes ago [Music] the other female here also just trying to figure out what's going on top now I'm listening on those ears are now picked up and it seems to be concentrating sounds like some lines they've been found as well if he game Drive but all of our staff that have been looking after us behind the scenes taken them all out and their guards and they've had a pretty magical afternoon with two leopards and NASA lions elephants all them all that doesn't disappoint thank you Miss wick stand up okay see she's celebrating there again now roaring behind us just mocking over with the Three Rivers female is marking earlier just while we parked yet there's some evidence of the tree or others female she said knee lifts her centers off [Laughter] so I just see there's a message now from the admin page anybody watching follow the Kruger sightings YouTube page and turn on your notifications for them and you'll get updates when we go life there see you another message behind yeah I'm gonna turn around slowly in the red what is going on yeah do you think that is the theory of a female again yeah all we know is that there's mini lipids here right now you go on to the monomer YouTube page isolation and that's just a daily video or two of what we get up to you not just sightings but also some of the behind the scenes stuff of our our game reserves work really we don't have any guests due to the corona virus the whole of South Africa is on lockdown at the moment really privileged I believe and then I'm sure lots of people wouldn't would jump at the opportunity to have so it's a privilege of ours to share this with you as well seems the other leopard that's further down the road sure is moving away I'm a female not breaking a view of that lipid now she's going back to scent marking another lipids also just sniffing where the island female was marking a few minutes ago back and forth here yeah yeah thanks gonna just have a quick look see how thick it is in yeah and and see if it's easy to follow here if it's nothing we'll try and follow up on their sake and later down the road but it is quite thick in there I'll just loop around and see if we can catch a glimpse of there from this open area in front of us yeah yes I can't see all your comings right now but it's lovely to have you all with us yeah and I'm gonna actually go back to the right areas but thick and foggy yes and it's getting late I'll never feel like being a man at this hour so briefs got a message arm your Uncle Stuart's good friend [Music] I'm not sure look I'm not sure I'm gonna have to get back to that message so fax you're multitasking a game they might have been another name in there as well but we will get back to you in a second so you're not have a look and see if we can catch a glimpse of the second lipid lipid yeah and it was mark Thank You Nadav Nadav is is helping us a lot here and I'm mark a good friend of your uncle Stuart mark - Elaine I hope I'm pronouncing your name right spruce is an excellent the dove again thank you so much for your help I don't know if we're getting any better at this but you'll keep on trying it seems like people that we can get worse well at least we heard Yahoo just you can see Brisas just turn the lights on and he has also just got spotted the second deputy yeah yes we're just gonna see this is again she is also looking into the bush where the island female was looking so there's still a high likelihood that there is a third leopard in the area here and if we were to guess and that race has already said Maxim's male my guess could I think I agree with Reese and I think it's a Maxim's male that's hiding in the bushes so maula maula when I started working and I've been able to follow her from sort of day one really when she was first discovered in 2016 and with her and her brother and the mother the kicker lazy female and she just every year Oh her mother was killed by some lions the Avoca males who have since moved off to the southern parts of the property and one year for a female leopard is a box sort of the youngest they can really be often and potentially survive and she moved off well she stayed around the main camp a lot for quite a while and then slowly moved away from from there we've done and what happened to her brother but it was interesting watching her as a one-year-old lipid sort of start to make her first kills and learn some of the hard lessons of being a leopard Archer with the lions and hyenas are ardent always been quite traumatic being around her and it's been quite interesting though watching that whole process play out of a little game from from this to establishing that it's this territory and I'm sure she's had other altercations in his time with other lipids but this is the first time I've seen her having an altercation I'm very proud to watch this stand your ground against the big old Island female so hopefully that means for us that the The Three Rivers female is is becoming more established in this area and we will get to see a lot more of it hopefully then also the cheese's you'll have some cups being around four years old it's wind sheets that are most comfortable and having established that territory she would start looking at potentially mating and having Cubs from this edge like I said starting to get quite dark here and it's a lot darker than what it looks like on my screen but when it does get too dark we are going to leave these livers not only just being able to share a live Leopard sighting with you all but one so dramatic way now there's the constant back and forth between two leopards roaring and posturing at each other and then as I said the story playing out of this this young leopard now the Three Rivers female becoming a lot more established in this area and standing up to some of the larger adversities around here unfortunately with these cellphones I put a spotlight on it it's just gonna blow up and you won't actually see the lipid okay the headlights work a little bit better but we are slowly coming to the end of the sighting we may very well come back here tomorrow morning to see what's what has happened these encounters can play out over a day or two it's there any came to the two leopards any came together today so they may very well just posture and roar and growl at each other for a while and very well we were possible that tomorrow morning they could still be in the area so David I'm just saying thank you to the Mala Mala guys for this live stream David thank you very much we appreciate your support and and we're glad you're enjoying it and that's to everybody that's enjoyed this live stream we are an incredibly fortunate position to film or to be on this property under these conditions and yeah I think it's just nice to be able to share it all of you back at home in your various countries we're having a lot of fun here and if you want to see what we are up to you other than in the live streams you can go to our ranges in isolation series which is on YouTube just go into any of Marmara media and get look for a YouTube page and you will see our ranges in isolation series and you'll see what we have been doing there are more polished cuts of sightings some guided drives some behind-the-scenes stuff but yeah please go have a look at our pages some interesting stuff there written call thank you James fantastic what you guys are bringing to us economy the whole message a Britain thank you I'm very impressed that he knew a trade rerun and yeah very interestingly just to finish off this three rivers female has just walked down the road we saw the island female on a few minutes ago and have gone to every single spot that she sent marked and st. mark so she's not relinquishing a territory either to the to the jalapenos is definitely this encounter does not seem to you have a decisive Victor and st. very interesting to see what happens tomorrow morning and we'll come out your first thing tomorrow morning and have a look and then maybe if if there is still something going on yeah we'll try and do another live stream otherwise if that's not possible we will see what we can film with our cameras and then you'll see it on our end is in isolation series as well so stay tuned to all of our our social media pages the Mala Mala Instagram and YouTube page and that will give you more details my name is Bruce missing I'm on Instagram behind me and on the camera here is six-six GVR garrison Roya just guys but yeah keep in touch saying if this is helping you stay saying well we're very glad you could be assisting in Manor that yeah from all of us at Mala Mala thank you very much for joining us yeah thanks piece and then just one one last shot art to Dan Bailey who recently when BB I don't know if you watching this Dan Bailey is one of the ranges here unfortunately he was not on the property while we were in lockdown he is great on social media and with this tick that we were busy trying to sort off the side but he won the ranges photographic competitions if you want to see those photos I guarantee instagram my instagram page and well done shiden it's pretty incredible photo and yeah okay check it out cheers from automata and the Dove again thank you so much for your help just
