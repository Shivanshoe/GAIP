was funny my neighbors were all together last week and i was up late and like i'm gonna confess like i got caught listening to backstreet boys a little bit louder than i should like three o'clock in the morning and so i told him when the song ended i heard them outside talking and i was like hold up if i can hear them i know they can hear my music so i i immediately played like metallica and like some van halen or something after that i wasn't about to go back outside next morning as soon as i went out there there's some people outside and uh ricky this is like he was we have son-in-law he was he said uh pete in front of everybody he's like just to backstreet boys last night and uh you know usually i'm pretty quick and i could come up with something pretty quick to say and i was like uh yeah i was like who's listening to all different kinds of music and uh and then it hit me i was like well really it was for me lamela likes it but uh yeah i got called but i was listening somebody said afro samurai said you have to be careful with brazil nuts if you eat too much you can get selenium poisoning selenium is good for health and small quantities though all right so we have your disco lamp speaker you probably have to eat a lot too it'll be bad and then we got one more thing in here oh my goodness oh what we got here some apple no sugar added that's what i'm talking about

to look at it and i got my glasses uh happy why do you like everything so even okay so really like even with these like when i give them a serving of this they can literally only have like a tablespoon of it at a time so um but you just have to be really careful but what i'll do like if i give happy some i'll have a spoon he can have a spoon and i'll take really big bites real fast and
