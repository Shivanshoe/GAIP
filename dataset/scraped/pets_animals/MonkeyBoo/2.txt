message like i can auto tap in seven tabs we do not advise or encourage anyone to get a pet monkey for one thing guys i'm usda licensed i'm a licensed exhibitor i'm licensed to do shows with my monkeys uh do educational stuff do the entertainment stuff movies tv shows i'm that's the stuff i'm licensed to do i i'm not even like like i could probably do some monkey training i'm not a fan of it i've been bitten by other people's monkeys but um like that i'm licensed to transport my monkeys not other people's my monkeys and like i could add i could add monkeys to transport if i for a trip if i needed to or other animals because like i could actually get down with a tiger or something maybe i want to i'm not sure i'll check my license i don't want a tiger tigers are cool when they're babies but after like six months they start eating 20 or 30 pounds of food a day what do you think hey monkey meet uh say hey sit here right here she's got she could see herself on a couple different we're live on youtube also what's your name this is monkey mila this is monkey boo's girlfriend mila monkey mila like how before we do a match how many people do you have in your thing like watching be honest 12 12. we beat you last time we battled you beat me before yeah we've been live before remember you're telling us how we came to youtube oh okay okay i don't know if we'll beat you but we beat you one round you beat us twice oh okay okay okay i remember now i remember you guys okay i do remember sorry about that man i talked to a lot of people so and i don't do a lot of tick i don't do a lot of the tick tock very often so there'll be a i got some i got some of my wranglers in here tonight i believe [Laughter] it'll be all right the thing about these battles is what i really don't like about them when people are doing them they sound like begging auctioneers man like i don't ask nobody to send anything i say thank you i follow them back you know you know you know like you know if you want to if you want like you don't have to have people send you money make good content and you can make money now content videos like don't pay a lot on tick tock compared to other platforms um tick tock might get mad at me for saying that but i've had a i've got a video tick tock debate 54 has 54 million views uh i can assure you there's not one other platform that it would like when it when i when i see what it made i was honestly like very very surprised all right samantha have a good night thanks for uh everything appreciate yeah that's a lot of freaking people hey no politics guys in the youtube chat please i just seen something about best president no politics keep that keep that to yourself this is my monkey my monkey pages are about making people happy and everybody getting along and uh people don't usually get along when you start talking politics unfortunately we ain't doing that so so you said i give you some youtube advice and stuff have you have you applied any of it and has it worked we haven't posted yet all right so so i would i can't get up because i got two things going here i got a i've got in and i and honestly i'm guilty of this myself but at the bottom of my board like it's got all the little notes and all kinds of stuff there's a white board and big letters with a star on each side that says every day you don't post a video is a day you don't go viral and like i said some days i don't i i don't post some days but um you know it just depends but but that's that's that's something like every time i read it i'm like damn i should be posting every single day but like like i've had some issues with youtube like i'm just now getting monkey boos page crank back up you know that's my that's my that's my big big that was my first big huge platform and that's still probably by far my biggest audience i have two and a half million subscribers but we were having issues like our videos were not being pushed out um even like my my other two monkey channels like i was having some issues that youtube was like unsubscribing people from the and and that and i've seen that happen before like you know sometimes there might be like a channel that nobody's messed with for two or three years and they delete the channel or basically kill the channel often that can happen but somebody's going on like we have two and a half million subscribers and it got to where we were getting like 5 000 videos in the first three or four hours and so some people that sounds like a lot but like obviously the video is not being pushed right yeah and and i've never i've never been one of those people to say hey make sure you turn on notifications man if people want to watch if you make good videos and they know your name they're going to come they're going to come looking for you you don't have to you know i don't want to be sitting at work and i mean i know there's people here and that's really super cool that like as soon as i post something they want to be able to see what i'm doing that's awesome but like at the same time you know if they're busy doing something else and they don't have notifications so there's you know i won't get into the the youtubers that i watch um well well i can tell you guys like who some of my favorite tick tockers and youtubers are but i don't have their notifications turned on like i hope you guys have mine turned home but like but i like there's officer yuri on tick tock i love his videos a little shirley's boy on tick tock um like you know you know like if i hadn't watched in a couple days i'll go and watch what they posted for the last couple days and catch up on them um yeah you know i have a huge follow-up so like i don't have any notifications like text messages and calls are the only thing i get right she's like see his cartman hat i got this in the mail video today they sent me a cartman hat somebody did dude my life just went from 12 people to freaking five you see you got somebody to tap and share those five people don't tap and share like five times each you'll shoot up to like 10 people so like i'm at 91 or 51 right now everybody tap and share real quick and we're going to see if we can boost it up real quick before we jump off here come on yeah i gotta i got everybody tapping chairs see it looks to me like it just went up to like 15. no that's your thing i can't i can't see yours i'm sorry i just called you all right well thank you yeah like we definitely if i follow all the gifters back when we're all done and stuff so this is this has been awesome that's probably it was uh she do girl or tina woodward or uh harpo chick they're all really nice we have some really nice fans so be be nice our fan be nice to our fans and and you know talk to them and stuff and they may come watch your content thank you yes that's that's the that's the cool thing about it all right so we're gonna jump off here i got a couple of more people we're gonna you know there's two brothers that are always live they're verified one's got the mustache and one don't like we've done it we've done lives with them we beat them in a battle one night and uh they just declined me and so now i'm calling on property brothers 2.0 i may have to make a video i might have to make a video about them the island no the other guy no i don't mess i'm not messing with them they don't want to get on live with me like i do comedy before i did monkey videos like you know like you know when you go to a club and you heckle don't don't heckle a professional comedian like i've got paid for my comedy that would make me professional the island boys really you cynthia from rugrats barbie doll looking fools like you do not want to get up on there with me like first thing i'm going to tell you like when they pull their money out i'm like get the marker out and run it across it and i'm going to put you know just maybe there might be a chance i can pull some bands out and like i'll run a marker across mine if you run across yours well how about this i'll go to person would you be like now let me see yours and they won't i've never seen them do it so yeah like
