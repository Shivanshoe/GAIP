got the race I'm good I mean hey guys it's Tom here and welcome back to another video so I've had a bunch of requests over the last couple of months to try out using an eye tracker on warzone which gives you a real-time update of wherever I'm looking at the screen a blue bubble you can see bouncing around is the focus point of my eyes during the gameplay so over the weekend I got my eye tracker set up and I played a few games with my friends study and Westie and unfortunately about 50% of the matches we found ourselves in we ran into a hacker or cheater whatever you want to call them it sucks and for us as content creators we have the privilege to play multiple matches in a day but not everyone can do that and it just completely ruins the experience and recently there seems to be a resurgence in hackers in this game Infinity Ward did a great job last seas are just completely removing hackers from the game and putting them in cheater lobbies and it was great the experience was really smooth for a long time without running into any problems and this is actually the first time since war zones released I've brought up the hacker problem on my channel and that's because I rarely experienced it when I was first being talked about now though a mid season of season 4 I don't think I've ever encountered this many cheaters in a single play session and I'm hoping that Infinity Ward is still making efforts to make modern warfare and war zone as cheater free as possible I'm going to show you some gameplay now from one of our recent matches demonstrating this problem firsthand with my eye tracker enabled but I think I need to revisit this video idea when I get a gameplay that doesn't include any cheaters make sure to leave a like on this video if you want to see that subscribe for more like this and I will see you next time all right let's go into station for another one guy I use on the stands on the side of the building someone pushing for instant res I'll hold it thinking I'm sorry again go in stick and rest on blue yeah went into you here 14:14 pushing hard one time at the Wharton that killed you Tommy he was aiming it was very fast ring this guy's there we died to these guys this guy let's go baby Rosie you're on the roof they're just around the two towers okay just around a few thousand I thought I don't know if I died to a guy I don't know I got killed with a guy with a warden wait if I died will expect into them oh yeah this is this is insane they're running for you they want blood that goes that's noise though okay here we go here we go let's go let's go baby do this oh yeah yeah the unpacking we all watching bien is that the guy yeah he knows we're specking cuz he's shooting our bodies to turn us now exactly we're not going away dude we're not going away look nice costume Lord Rickard cottoned onto the videos reported for Tooting oh yeah yeah he knows how cuz they communicating how to communicate something a kiss have worked out basic symbols oh oh I was a bit snappy and also in the Gulager above all I knew he was there oh oh come on come on hit it he's like I think that was good he won't be able to because the bullet speed is not fast enough so yeah oh there we go we're gonna make you famous we're gonna make it real famous being keep it up great work you he's freaked out as his teammate parachuting swim x marks the spot he's toxic oh wow just too good never seen gameplay like it I watch this hacker user loadout for the first time he's level 41 but he doesn't have any good loadout so he's trying to take other people's weapons Oh baby is this the Grizz is he back in war zone so we've had three potential hackers today yeah why what why do we get these pocket successes and weekend it takes like two weeks before I get weekend following isn't it hang on a minute when was the last proper patch it was it was season four wasn't it hmm so basically hacker community has had time to get round the two-factor or just you know they'll have built-in like protections against a newborn or whatever yeah so they've been able to get round it so they're now all playing just before the next patch comes out mmm he does have a paid growl which is the the purple laser one I picked up off someone did he pick after I was by the by the loadout he doesn't have good level good weapon no 41 so he's putting on a little show for us yes shocks his teammates and hacking so it's like he's right here maybe he's like oh no communicator is the team our guy hack you know it's just know is the N is a shot behind the walls his show his teammate he's there I think they communicate Odie all do you think he's trying to farm up this guy's account to Mouse maybe I wonder if they're going this way right to the edge of the circle because they know someone's here hmm I wonder why yeah I might I might be a viola vaccination cuz there's no buyer here oh yeah is he blind he didn't see though he knows he's there I don't think he does his teammates are driven past it's because I forgot you you don't see their free candy it's locked like facing forwards by 400 big plays big plays yeah you must die then that was there I was sick by the other guy do you see the guy who killed don't do this no don't do it right late honestly growl cheats I cannot tell the difference so look at the kilogram yam itself yeah oh I wonderful I want him to hit like a really nasty shot but he's this guy is amazing I wish I look everything go for the finish go for the finish he must have Nvidia filters on because there's no way I can see through that fog it's like distance haze in via five yeah exactly hides there six people are watching him now hi guys welcome to my spectate stream hey guys today's gameplay twenty gay this is I don't care anymore basically yeah if you like the gameplay make like a subscribe Oh baby is popping off it's like he's trying to fight the aimbot this is yeah this is why you use the the HDR because then you don't need to do any of the it's gonna spray is gonna spray as love hot as soon as he gets up we're gonna do it wait for it he's going to do it for one meme he's made up for it one away from oh man I don't like the appreciation he's not even talking back to us all he does is care about the gameplay right hasn't even thanked me for my sub yet nasty nasty as the 20 oh wow okay tomorrow he's purposely marking to let some I'll get a few girls dirty imagine getting to this point in a game that I playing against hacker how annoying without their I guess we're kind of lucky that we get killed off pretty early mmm doesn't feel like a complete waste to us my god this is insane he's gonna let his teammates right there on the right he's gonna he's gonna let the team in especially girls yeah yeah you're right maybe he's just helping them boost their accounts yeah absolutely yeah or shifting the balance so that it's not as obvious is that so that the first glance kills as well yeah quite a slow 80s though there yeah what's not his is a picked up often just by the loadout I think this is the strength oh yeah this is the blueprint you can get from the contraband blue like Eden oh I think maybe she goes guys pushing the right now yes to go now you might spin bought for this research they must use him in them in the back he's gonna have Finn Oh sky still there in the building you might run out of ammo and die you might run out if I'm gonna die if you get shot now he's dead again yeah I've some plates enemies up someplace you gonna need them oh my god that's the win game isn't even one disappointed he watched this whole game surely love ye might talk to us he doesn't care about it though should we all just like pretend that we just witnessed something amazing wow that guy's
