all right guys so i guess this is it huh we're about to say goodbye to the dansk at least as we know it the launch of season three for black ops cold war and war zone is just our fingertips now and with it comes the largest content update today the dance map is going back to the 1980s with a fresh look and new points of interest based off all of the leaks that we've seen so far we're finally getting balance changes to the m16 org ffar and the cycle pistols which were completely broken at launch have just been fixed in yesterday's patch which is awesome to see and something tells me that raven software simply don't have the permission to alter the cold war guns in any way because the fact that these psycho pistols which are modern warfare guns were nerfed so quickly compared to the likes of the org ffar and m16 kind of tells you a lot about how much control raven really has over warzone but nonetheless it's great to see that we're finally getting the changes we need to bring back some balance and variety to warzone again hopefully these new weapons that we're getting with the launch of season three are more balanced and if they do fit into the meta hopefully they're not completely overpowered but we'll just have to wait and see so speaking of the new weapons we're getting the ppsh smg which can be obtained at tier 15 of the season three battle pass we'll also be getting the swiss k31 bolt action sniper rifle which i can only assume is also available in the battle pass but we don't know which level this will be obtainable at probably around level 30 if i was to take a guess but i love my biology and sniper rifles and this one sounds like it's going to rival the khana 8k which is my baby so it should be good fun then later in the season we'll be getting the ballistic knife which is going to bring back a lot of nostalgia from the older black ops games the carve 2 burst rifle which is said to be joining the ranks of the m16 with a high damage high bullet velocity output and solid recoil control let's just hope we don't have another overpowered burst rifle on our hands we'll also be getting the full auto amp 63 pistol as well as a baseball bat when it says in season like this it usually means that we need to complete an in-game challenge to obtain the freebase weapon or you can buy a blueprint bundle version when it appears in the store i'm really looking forward to all of this new content especially the balance changes because i mean the most important thing is that the game is fun for everyone and i think we've all been through some pretty rough times in warzone as of late you know the met has been pretty broken for a few weeks now so i know that myself and my friends haven't been enjoying the game as much but we still love this game and hopefully we'll see better balancing of new weapons that are added to the game as well as more quality of life changes that just make the game more enjoyable for everybody so with that said thank you guys for watching as always leave a like on the video if you did enjoy it and subscribe with notifications on so you don't miss out on any future war zone content i'm gonna leave you now with some gameplay using the classic m4a1 and hdr from way back when during the season one meta i think it's definitely been a while since i've used this loadout but it was a lot of fun to return to
