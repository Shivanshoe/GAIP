go are you kidding me oh they go down so quick it's insane there's a mark on it but everyone can go and loot it so there's green smoke on it it's just like a loadout mark in that sense oh oh okay airstrikes on blue yeah i don't even know i killed that guy i don't think they raised him objective is to eliminate blue oh god you've got a bounty next to you uh i mean oh my god an enemy playing wraps oh yeah they're pretty close oh my god i actually just shot my own planes shadow hey go uh shoot him so dumb oh they're marked force i want yeah they're marked body out oh this is easy peasy i need to res him if you go for it see the graphics on those are wild oh i'm the one being hunted dude by then oh this guy thinks he can take off disabled vehicle he's gonna be coming up the hill here i think oh my god i can't this is ridiculous oh we're gonna put a loady they don't need loadies i have an anti-material rifle oh nothing's sick whatever it's called a pro tip if you're a passenger just in the back seat instead so you can actually see stuff oh no i can drop it there you go oh thanks a sniper let's take a look i'm not letting this go oh my gosh there's a load what's up tom who gave this thing the green light how did this make it past q a wait a year oh they've got their own plane now they're in the jeep tom right here turning around uh tom said you couldn't outrun zone so you might want to think about yeah it's tough circle's pretty fast in this it's okay once i figure out how to get in this i wanted to get back to the airport get a new plane so many people at the airport jesus i just gate keep him i'm just gonna go over my lawyer up now i'm probably gonna die because i don't want people to get the planes all right i'm off see so those question mark things uh these are they just like scavenger contracts yeah they're the top secret contracts they're random so they give you something that already exists oh looks like you gave me the most wanted to see oh this plane behind you where's the entire is he coming up for me or what yeah i think he's chasing you shoot he's going outside zone now for some reason he's still trying to me yeah yeah he's gonna hit somebody right now just jump on and take another plane if you have to or yeah or i can just type him with my sniper i don't know if he's out with his i don't see him on the map anymore he's jumping right there

sound you want to go boys there you are how do you scare the sheeshness out of me stop shooting me can they take you down with normal bullets yeah well they can't absolutely shred me if they focus fire but no one really does i like the field there he is nice i don't know where they are now it's gone for the finish on them crime rates are you guys he was right at the edge of that field on the the bleachers okay she's choosing whoever get [Music] [Music] he's still down he's still down okay i accidentally picked that up elimination that's always good somewhere around there i don't know the ammo first i need to leave these buildings or something i'm running ouch charlie he's on the field somewhere cash drop i need loot oh what's up it's all i got i'm now out of the ammos we need to move lower right follow me if you can drop that's all we need it's not where we need it though it's only two teams okay greasy auto that's a shotgun let them fly out yeah it's gonna be really hard to bring fog back in yeah i don't think you want to do that scare over that uh no i accidentally picked that up fire station's out wait for you there's no way to get them the other way it's up there on the cliff side okay i think this buy station is yeah it's center so just play for the dub two teams two full teams over there yeah so i kind of want to let them fight if it oh here it is we called it down below you actually a little bit to your right time to run give me what you have can we go hello to our corner uh possibly have you killed a team i killed a guy yeah that was the team there's the full team the guy on this roof destination here two three oh oh oh no no no oh my god dude these trees are tiny the heck is there bloom on this what is this oh i don't know what we do here oh yeah it's a 2v4 i need my loadout but i can't get it and you got the short end of this neck dudes yeah we do okay there's literally no way they got a roof and can sit up on it i'm gonna try and sneak my load out then i like what i'm seeing right here accurate down the left one outing is so lit you know personally why would he do that i had to move because they're striking me but you should be able to go now i thought they were going to do big damage now well there's finish the mission what there's four of them right that's why i was hoping you could move while i was just taking the place jesus christ what was what is that i don't even aim at him it's jordan you just started parachuting in and it also killed him yeah it's a plane chasing you corner on your ass right now pretty sure i'm just shooting that guy through the building fly up and i can i can game off your tail god he's coming towards me smoking oh he's so done dog fight turning around suck on this okay he's just nice vehicle andy's dead look at that target lock i don't even see that second guy that is crazy all this dude what the hell i love when people make argue like someone made the argument in their comments yesterday saying that well it's a plane you know how those guns hit in real life i know that's always a video game and it's about royale i don't know how you turn on this advanced flight like oh it's v not x x x yeah do not like that switch it back to normal holy crap that's gonna get me killed dude i don't know if i'm gonna crash here or not i'm gonna crash yeah i'm not doing that again oof there goes your air support lance hill those guys down right behind you there i'll nail i can't do the gas is gonna chase me yeah there's two of them i think it's not too easy to maneuver i think i'm just gonna hop out here i want you just dip on me kill confirmed [Laughter] i don't know should be another one there's one at the bottom yeah yeah i don't have anything to deal with them i need you to take care of him if you can one moment know that i mean part of me is tempted to dive into the gas i mean i do still have a gas mask it's only 200 no they got destroyed oh no you're kidding me wondered anyways i'll drop the rest of them less of the money here too oh yeah i wouldn't go miss armor box there oh yeah doing this look at all that stuff a lot of stuff there i'm a guy i killed earlier was he shooting at

rock there's another team third finding us now no they're trying to wrap around this yeah they're gonna hold us out broke the guy just behind this rock high school where's the third party frog all the way up hill to the right okay it's behind that rock bus like the guy the guy broke nice it's like all the way up here or something all right yeah we're going on the right flank yeah let's just play right flank go up high ground then he's southwest of me yeah shots yeah i beat censor the lack of recall on these vanguards and now it's all about sitting down here i think here we can have coverage jesus oh he's so low right there then if you have an angle corner i'm gonna play it up another unbelievably low okay we're missing a team this is the spot to hold right now here okay give me a sec i'll be able to get the back flank is he behind that rock yeah a big one mm-hmm one of them is here up here on the hill welcome bro there's probably a team near you rightly with a star yeah in the forest of me oh up up behind last time nice is that it oh my god one more guy i don't see where he it is i just hit the nastiest headshot on the other guy oh what a dub i can't wait to split my weapon i feel like we didn't even play that game backed up we did spend a lot of it in planes [Music] you
