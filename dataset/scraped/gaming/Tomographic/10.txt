hello hello welcome everybody to sniper elite five we're back again with another live stream hope you're all doing good uh plan for today is we're gonna well we've got another mission to play which i haven't touched yet wall factory but also want to check out axis invasion a little bit later in the stream so this might be like a one episode um campaign mission for those that are watching the play through and then later in the stream we'll do some axis invasion this is basically i mean here you go at the bottom of the screen there invade another player's campaign as the dreaded sniper jager and use special skills to hunt them down i'm out of breath just run upstairs how we doing though folks good to see you here hope you're doing well drop a like on the stream get us started definitely helps out with the algorithm and stuff you know the shiz yeah what's up yeah we're live we're live right let's go let's just get this thing started all right wall factory it's a new campaign the factory is producing materials for kraken as well as the nazi war machine destroy the furnace to grind production to a hole uh what sniper do i want to use because that area looks kind of small well it's hard to tell i wish it told you like the actual size of the map this is semi-auto i believe this is bolt action we'll try that we'll try the semi thomas got a semi starting location i haven't unlocked those spots yet i do however want to make sure that i'm actually on authentic this time because a few people pointed out in the last video that something didn't like apparently so there was like certain hud elements with a scope i was curious because i was like why is that even visible because it was telling me like what range i had to aim and stuff see it doesn't do it i want authentic authentic hardest difficulty authentic sniping that must be it still just says customer [Music] um oh that's custom that's why authentic authentic authentic hey there we go all right let's do this now now it's going to be difficult kind of the ai we just summoned it beaumont sundance way too easy in the last video that operation kraken is some kind of nazi super weapon construction and development appears to be spread over multiple sites i will be killing france there's a facility where they're conducting advanced propulsion and weapons testing its location is unknown but the resistance know the countryside better than anyone and are confident they can find it additionally the kriegs marines are preparing a field test of some kind of prototype in the english channel first we're going to strike operation kraken's key production line at a factory in marchersack i'm regrouping with the resistance in the u.s ranges there if we act quickly we have a chance to stop operation kraken before it's too late okay so we agree carl hits the factory i prep the boat to guernsey marie recons the countryside to find this research facility we agreed like hell it is our mission is complete we've done our job and paid the price we have our orders to return to england and so we promised to get it done and i expect you to honor that commitment look i'm sorry about your men but but nothing i was told your outfit was professional but fair burn who don't forget is the reason we're stuck here in the first place waltz is in with weak old intel and you drop everything to help him what chase rumors i'm not the bad guy here if you need to blame someone blame the nazis hey who the hell do you think you are just a soldier like you no not like me no sir i follow orders i go where i'm told i do what i am told operation kraken could win the nazis the war we have more information than london does and every second we waste following protocol helps the enemy every person you lose in this war should make you want to fight more not less the great carl fairburne gonna win the war single-handed even if it gets everyone else killed you're a dangerous insubordinate glory house you keep this up the whole town's going to hear you you can help or you can get out of my way your choice back up we're out of here we can't persuade you to stay and help orders our orders very well i said i'd get you back to blatant well but we'll lose the tide if we don't leave right now i'll lead the way once you've dealt with the factory meet me tomorrow night i'll get you to guernsey by hook or by crook i'll be there i'm not convinced she's actually scottish now it's a good job you like working alone mr shadow one can't cutscene that one yeah this is based in world war ii sniper league games have always kind of been uh based in world war ii it would be interesting to see a modern sniper league game and what that would actually look like so i love the gameplay loop of this but take one of these i think i'm just a bit something else i'm a bit burned out by world war ii you know it's kind of in the trend rat bomb what the hell red bombs straight out of the playbook i'll put it to good use what the hell is a rap bomb they actually use these okay i mean i'm clearly still learning stuff about world war ii they do dive quite deep into the history with these games but um yeah world war ii on world war one it's just been a trend for so many years now it's nice that we're finally getting some modern games again do i switch my shoulder again that one [Music] for weeks now erlich soe want him dead too his bad intel's finally caught up with him this carl bloke's got a voice box like a gravel slab sliding down a hill of broken marbles what the hell that's the most extra description i've ever heard let's turn the music down a little bit i'm able to hear this conversation over the river by the dam but it's exposed doesn't sound any different might have other choices you should definitely take these guys i love that that's one of my favorite moves in these types of games when there's two people stood next to each other yes but actually what is a rat bomb that's my question q oh can i not zoom in inauthentic difficulty or zoom out even i'm a bit to tunnel vision right now and this is like some sort of glitch it's got a pretty bug-free experience so far i also turned on uh ray tracing which i didn't know was in this game but it's it's disguised under obscurance fields which will which when enabled will render ray trace of shadows around the player i've never seen a game referred to as that maybe it's not nvidia technology okay i do have a suppressor on this oh wait there's no point me tagging anyone because it's authentic the attacks don't last and i can't even do the uh you know when i hold alt to see through walls i do better keep it quiet i don't want to raise the alarm just yet i don't need to kill those guys i want to just because i like to make sure everyone's dead before i leave these places but [Music] this is blocked ah rap bomb is literally a bomb and a rat yeah i mean i gather that much but hello come here mate it's fine come and have a look over this ledge i didn't work did it he fell to his death there we go [Music] that was so strange hmm okay they said something about the dam um my objectives are the furnace investigate the refinery search the shipping warehouse it's a lot of investigating find and kill matteus i've pronounced that correctly but there he is if i kill him i get a oh and lock the sdg if i do that okay and i am where i'm there mama cars patrolling in the ship in warehouses check that out go down this road [Music] stealth how long can we can we keep this up for place your bets now ah two of them [Music] kind of get through that door it's okay it's okay [Music] i would have heard the pistol shots but if i clear the area [Music] they'll lose me [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh such bad timing i didn't want to go up the ladder there i was just trying to like get to the top of it and then time to go to work got to take out the factory then find the crack and shipping manifest don't try and whistle them over nice work like i did the last guy so where am i now recon plane suggests this is a suitable infiltration point for this mission okay uh thanks for coming a member valerie hope you're well appreciate and the the britalian also became a member thank you so much um so what is this i think this is a might not be as news a move as he thinks a new uh spot for me to spawn essentially um so i've just unlocked a side objective there to kill uric using the rat bomb where is the rabbon i only see grenades a bit gory oh you've seen nothing yet okay that's him kill challenge i have to get okay i have to get the scg by killing with the rat bomb i don't understand how do i use the rat bomb there's a guy in that tower two guys in that tower he's seen me as well this was an easier difficulty i'd have like an exclamation mark above his head right now oh crap see oh this is gonna be difficult now my volt list no that's pain you can't jump in this game you can only vault that sucks this bleeding isn't slowing down and he made me bleed because i'm authentic so i have to waste one extra bandage [Music] i need to change my strategy here where's that sniper tower oh i need to find rats okay [Music] that's some light goal for you oh keeps things nice that was the guy that was the uh nothing else that was the guy i'm looking for i was supposed to kill him with a rat bomb it's fine we'll come back later so dark man i mean i don't know why i picked you up to be honest silenced what was that nambu is that thought ah plan rap bomb that's how i would do it [Music] levy [Music] jesus [Music] is that a tank okay whoever guessed one minute for me not going stealth you know what you know what we're going back in time i'm a time traveler guys do you know that yeah they call me tom the truck the time traveler this is just an alternate way go down there how would you even get there so many different ways that zipline i guess okay that's my favorite thing about these games are just so many options [Music] there's a guy around here but i don't know if he i guess he's dead let's attempt this again it's really difficult to know if they've seen you or not now there's no oh yes don't look this way don't look this way [Music] sleep well [Music] one moment [Music] first oh what is this mate why have you done that okay that's fine [Music] that's fine okay i actually can't get in this way um something about the shipments cracking shipping manifest is kept in a safe in the logistics office okay let's kill that guy with a rat bomb shall we you've not seen me oh my god it's so difficult [Music] we'll clear this area and then we can just move on and oh my god this guy's jiggling [Music] [Applause] army forgot i'm using a a fast fire rate it's not actually semi-auto it's a ball action tried to spam it but it's only going certain speed here comes the tank who is shoenami how are they landing shots it's gonna be difficult man i can't even zoom with the snipers [Music] it's really dark yeah the shadows are super black on this come on there he is as i have been playing both sides up against the middle time to put a stop to that we're not killing him with a wrap on [Music] this is how games like this should be played if you want any challenge with this game authentic is the way to play it anything less than hard will just be careful what you say here tom i've had bolt cars i think i cut through that i don't even know what my health is [Music] okay i think this area is clear anyone outside of this area weird won't be onto me no alarms have been raised so [Music] sorry it's not looking this way but i gotta be fast what the hell [Applause] how did i not kill that guy if a frag will actually kill this thing release that one a bit too soon it's still not dead oh my god oh my god what's up boys nice of you to join me and they've done me luckily i've got a medkit he doesn't have an angle there does he heel heel heel can't get in there go try something [Music] this is mental guys now this is difficult the ai are actually smarter they've adapted my fully out bandages now yeah that's complete pain isn't it this place is such a maze too is that a door yes no i think i'm bleeding wait if he has a bandage please please please yes hot tub time we're good it's such a different experience with zero hud [Music] [Applause] such an unnecessary bullet time shipping manifest should be in here that must be where they keep the crack it manifests didn't even have an angle on that guy and he's got nothing i can take and i don't even have the stuff to uh open the safe oh this is bad guys what's that no i don't want your ammo i want your heels anything i need to clear the area fully kill them or just leave come back when their investigations have died down that's the thing usually the game will tell you that when you're on the easy difficulties well i fully bleed out and die if i don't heal found shipping armory key love that no heels though yes we're going to try out the uh the axis evasion mode later as well which should be a lot of fun i've seen some gameplay of it and it seems to be what sniper elite players are sort of resonating the most with as the end game experience [Music] i have to find heels man my character is like having a rough time right now i killed a lot of people over here so hopefully someone's got something okay yeah he's not alert [Music] [Applause] which mouse i use the uh the logitech g pro wireless tyler turner hitman will never be that fast true yeah this is uh it's a sniper league tyler here man they kind of make you fully scout oh jesus scared me man where was he we'll never know [Music] i wonder if that's the thing with that invasion mode and just bad intel with him if someone joins my match will they have the same difficulty as me or are they going to get all of the assists because that would be kind of i'll be kind of bs you if i'm playing the know difficulty and they're playing on easy and they have all the assists in the world oh no gotta shut off on me [Music] nasty skull crusher ribbon i think i've grabbed all i can i need to [Music] lose this guy again though i just have the key now [Music] [Applause] download this and started playing after watching you god i suck it's tough man it's not it's not an easy game if you uh if you dive into the deep end being stealth as well is very difficult like it's a lot easier to do in um in sniper ghost warrior [Music] just because i think the ai are a bit more dumb in that game not to say these are the most smart either it's just that once you get caught they kind of don't stop coming until you wipe them all out or just leave come back later when you stopped investigating i could just try that's a still roaming around as well yeah i wonder if i've still got the key check these guys oh my gotta save my med kit if you go down when you still got medicate you can revive yourself which is good oh no no no no no you didn't see anything i need to loot that guy to have a weak spot [Music] game builder with ps4 yeah it's on the older generation consoles as well the key is on the officer you killed at the railroad where you got your ribbon gotcha thank you [Applause] [Music] i don't know my position right now if i was playing on an easy difficulty you'd basically see on the minimap that they are targeted on a certain location it like paints a red dot on the map or a triangle even uh and that is your last known location so if you reposition while they're checking that spot and you're not in it eventually they'll give up he's gonna come up this lander found the body [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] now this is my last known position no oh oh baby i think we found ourselves an ai farm guys hell yeah anyone else you oh no forgot they did that they can fight back throw tnt i do not have tnt haven't locked it yet i've got frag grenades [Music] batter up is here no [Music] try and search that railroad oh no oh boy how do you not see me this is so bad this is so bad oh my god on the railroad where i killed [Music] don't use me blade which railroad chat am i hot or cold [Music] is it down there yeah that's easy difficulty right there that little ladder farm i had instead i better check the body thank you this will come in very useful well i think we might go out that's got free they're still searching that last known spot so manifest should be in here if any luck it'll lead me straight to the crack and test site and it genuinely is such a different experience not having you know i have that ability where i hold alt and it will show me like an x-ray where they keep the crack it manifests we got the key off the guy now all the code even bingo medical's finally cracking underground hospital got to be a cover story good i know where to start on [Music] guernsey music is still mega loud man um audio music volume got the manifest but the job's not done until this factory is put out of production sick games try for myself yeah man it's it's uh definitely scratches that itch i love these games it's just simple stupid fun and i like the story just like you know it doesn't take itself take yourself too seriously it's just like here's the here's the place you're going this is the bad guy this is how to kill him here's seven different options different ways to go about the mission it's all natural discovery though like it's not super linear which i like i have a bottle where did that come from oh he actually sees that did i kill him with it posh p thanks for the 49 man appreciate it love your content do you play do you not play warzone with westy i can't see the full message i see westy and jack i think um i'm just not playing a whole lot of warzone right now i maybe play like once or twice a month and that's it um this is any new content it's not something i play on the daily anymore um but yeah i mean i'll always hop in with those guys when i can or if i feel like playing some more zone i like to play a bit just to stay i don't know um warm i guess is the word so i don't lose my uh my game knowledge and my my skill with the mouse and all that sort of stuff i'd still say it's like the fps i play most consistently but [Music] it's like one of the main games on the channel it's not something i play as regular anymore is there not a guy here a second ago sound mask i could i could mask my sound this one comes and checks out you can see the top there that's how much noise it's making so if i time it correctly if i didn't there just skip that cutscene okay we're good we need to go investing in the refinery on the car patrolling near the shipping warehouse i think that's just gonna reveal intel we're already aware of though so we'll go this way i'm gonna put on my map scene as that at least shows uh this one common graphics marker does it not show i have to do it like that okay i'll mark the entire objective you ever played war thunder yeah play some more thunder what's up with my shoe anthony room thanks for coming remember dude and paul mora i some of your videos have a wonderful day back to la it's not showing the full message for me but um that is an insane dono my friend thank you so much for the hundred dollars that that is ridiculous i don't know what to say [Music] just know i appreciate it all goes back into the channel that's the heart of the production process not for much longer who saw the uh the little announcement thing i did on twitter earlier by the way it's a very special video coming on the fourth a guy hasn't seen me thinks he's seen me it's very dark here though don't forget you can go first person too you can't go first person you can do this and aim in third or switch to your iron sights like that there's not really like a dedicated first person camera so what exactly am i doing in here i've got a lot of time and money into the video that's coming up i really hope you like it i'm like super like nervous excited see what you'll think it's very like left field for me a shame if someone messed with the furnace's safety valves a real damn shame okay ever played enlisted yeah i played a couple of times man i think there's one or two videos on the channel okay i need to get one more job done what did he say overload the furnace one more valve probably in here now so the chief logistics officer keeps the special manifest in this safe i need to find it and him where is this valve totally what it is april 6th yeah it's weird how so in the uk we put the day before the month which just makes so much more sense to me like a quick glance if you want to look at the day it's the first number smallest to largest as well in terms of date okay i've done this one i guess it's just around here though no oh hello that's crazy paul thank you man um there's another valve i'm looking for [Music] doesn't even go into slow motion now either you see that [Music] thanks jay it'll be a good one i hope um i think it's underneath would make sense when they're they wouldn't put both shot files next to each other [Music] [Applause] my brother doesn't like this game because of the kill cams do you mean how gross they are or did you just not like them in general because it slows down the gameplay you can turn them off like completely or reduce them it's just normal at the moment uh yeah fourth of june yeah 2022 exactly what the hell no more to find here shot his helmet off oh my god i missed that dude you've got a head made of concrete oh man please have a bandage no any bandages standard ammo bandage too yes you died for the cause kill cams are awesome yeah i like them i just played enough in this game i mean it depends on your age too i mean it is a it is uh i don't know i don't know actually actually if it's mature or 18 plus i imagine it'll be 18 plus one in the uk rated m for mature where's this extra valve so confused by this it'd probably just be highlighted if this was easier do not have a clue option b what am i missing turned one off at the very top check that office i think so this valve's done right yeah no i haven't shadow office i have i've been in that i'm so confused man it's going to annoy me isn't it when i find it discover that it's actually incredibly obvious um the other one is probably up top yeah we've we've been to the very top i think what's this yes i need to get the hell out of here we hadn't checked this one i mean this isn't very safe okay it was on that mid platform if this was a on a lower difficulty the game would just be like this is where it is authentic really doesn't give you anything anything to help okay next one is over there just need to go straight on this way where we came just follow the train track have a sip of my water stay hydrated chat drop a like if you're enjoying the stream here's where i roll the steel for everything from tank armor to u-boat hulls oh boy nah you didn't see anything the breathing of the character my character when he's out of breath doesn't sound like the same voice actor get out of the way the exploding building good shout crane control room is on the top floor of the steel works i'd say that door to the control room's locked i could blow it with a satchel there's got to be someone with the key around here i'm gonna guess it's a you oh there's a guy there too oh my god oh yes he's walking that way good he's gonna try and bring him this way just walk past the big box with stuff in before we went up the stairs i like the sound of that good call missing crowbar though the game won't tell me where the crowbar is because i'm on authentic difficulty it's just like uh just real life mode isn't it over there too did i loot that guy i did invasion only i think those um invasion only things are like phones and when i i'll try it later but i think basically if i join someone else's campaign it allows them to find out where i am they have like a cool down on the cooldown time on the phones and call them and then find out my location and i can do the same with them but that's what those are for um let's get up there you've got to have the key haven't you there it is going up do some crazy thing what do you want me to do control room entrance no and i've got the key what a waste oh nice it gives it your back has to be so my god check your surroundings tom same advice can be given to that guard what was he doing okay oh no production lines down should throw a wrench in the works for cracking i thought i was about to uh land on him i just think he incapacitated that guy no witnesses uh abscond thanks for coming a member hope you're doing well and paul moore as well as also becoming member thank you dude i said i could search him for a second all right we're making progress investigate the refinery it's the last objective there are a bunch of like side quests and stuff you can find two along the way if you really want to fully explore the map which i did in my last video this hasn't been so much of a a sniper mission you know more about about like intel gathering it's quite close quarters for snipes officers dropped a viable watch somewhere in the scrapyard see that's essentially like a side objective it's a panzerfaust well whoever said they want to see something crazy [Music] [Applause] keeps blowing the helmets off i'm sorry guys i'm sorry i gave up the stealth but when you find a panzerfaust you can't not fire it [Music] had a lot of uh drop though didn't it okay gamer freaking sly canceled around the corner this will come in very useful what will what did i find on him i don't want a i grenade someone hi mate doesn't know where i am um and it's almost a bit quieter actually do have sub-sonic don't i no just knocks him out basically wooden bullet oh you would he's trying to revive his friend i can't do that okay i think we're clear i don't know how alert they are though usually would tell me this guy's still alive the factory makes its own high quality steel i'm sorry mate i wanted to kill him with a bowl i'm just playing with my food now oh hello [Music] what a spot he was hiding in unbelievable oh my god i don't want to start my revive yet [Music] you should have finished me while you had the chance okay you did oh bud there's a bleed out timer when you uh when you don't play on authentic and i thought it was about to expire and i was about to just die um whoa lag yeah i didn't get to plan [Music] [Applause] took his helmet off again i didn't that's that guy from earlier well the velocity is slow on this side there's the creepy guy it literally doesn't matter holding your breath i suppose stability but you don't get the slow-mo [Music] [Applause] yeah i thought i was so smart didn't i [Music] let's revive him maybe oh my god trying to predict the lead of that is that actually a guy no it's not is it okay well the guys inside the building are gonna be aware of me um let's get this reloaded nothing else to find nothing else to find hashtag nerf kill cams i think you can even turn the gore off completely and you can turn off the x-ray mode so it doesn't go inside the body but it just shows the outside of them getting headshotted or whatever the factory makes its own high quality steel wanted to do something about that smelter why would you buy this game with that in mind it's the major selling point if you ask me um there's a guy there oh hmm is he coming game over [Music] hey what are we looking for just investigate so i don't actually know yet i've already got to find some papers or see they're not aware of me now either i love that do the old bottle trick again [Music] limping it's literally concussed oh they've left the smelting pot in its maintenance position right over the furnace smelting pot right over the furnace powerful cone not yeah look at this place [Music] i didn't see anything he's got a panzerfaust [Music] hey just die how weak is this pistol [Music] i mean for my character to have made that line of dialogue like find anything else there's obviously something i missed below smelting part directly above the furnace oh there i see it there's something i maybe shoot nah ladder here what was the guy got the key for that love it are there any free game free pc games like this um i don't think there is to be honest you can get this on game pass though it's still a bench that means i've unlocked some attachments a new suppressor my god let's give this pistol a go what's that thing anti-tank rifle oh my look at the size of it it's not what she said i killed everyone can you collab with jack on this game i don't think jack's um jack's all are interested in this game i did ask him but um don't think it's his cup of tea uh oh i see it's got to be this [Music] well that was easy moving on exactly what i expected that to do refinery done what's game pass uh xbox game pass i think it's also available on microsoft store on pc basically you pay a subscription to uh get a bunch of games that get just constantly get added to it um it's a pretty cheap cheap subscription way cheaper than buying an actual game because if you play a lot of games and you like to try a lot i think it's a really good surface service surface you know what i mean um all right just use expo now refineries out of action that'll slow down production yeah this is more of a sabotage mission [Music] i think what i want to do now what would you guys rather see at this point would you rather see another campaign mission can't go that way another campaign mission or we can do axis invasion where i essentially just go into other people's campaigns and tried to kill them i spawn as a as a german essentially and all of the ai are on my team if you're watching this as a vod as well drop a like and i will make sure to split this into time stamps as well so you can find this part of the stream easier invasion i thought you might say that i'll do another video on uh on the next campaign mission i'm glad i streamed this one though because i mean i didn't know what i was getting into when i first started it but this doesn't really feel like a youtube content kind of mission you know this one's a bit more story driven just to progress the campaign cool level though very detailed super dark though all right invasion it is ranger lieutenant sullivan reports fairburne gone rogue our u.s allies at the oss are backing sullivan's demand for fairburne's immediate recall fighter i thought it's gonna be a bit longer than that went to get some water okay oh we did all right can't be mad at that 62 kills we're somewhere in between stealth and lethal we'll call that as a success that's what we'll call it successful stealth mission okay we'll do that mission in the next video festung guernsey probably butchered it no i don't think i did that's in england english channel guernsey is a real place all right invasion so i don't know really what i'm getting into here all i know is that this is the mode that people talk most about um okay in activation you join another players campaign as the sniper jaeger an elite german sniper hunt down and kill the allied sniper to win if the other germans see the allied sniper the location will be on the map and radar check your skills for sweet this is really cool man this is really cool that's something similar in death loop if you remember that basically a uh you can turn this off if you are playing as the um as the american sniper but i mean i i have for the campaign play through i don't really want to get disturbed when i'm playing it oh we get access to these snipers too um what do i want i think i'll go armor piercing i mean do i need our piercing rounds on a sniper that subsonic right because as far as i know sniper players in the single player doesn't actually have any armor very fast aim speed poor aim stability two to one times got a three time scope i like how this is all unlocked for me too this is sweet suppressor yep faster reloads i think i want that for this only get caught my pants down you know reduces bullet drop slow rate of fire i get all this too no way quite like it without the gilly wrap oh this is gonna be fun guys this is gonna be fun strap in strap on whatever you got to do um increases damage reduces bullet drop yeah we'll go with that muzzle significantly quieter um yeah we'll do that looks crazy i sure shouldn't put that suppressor on it should i because i want an ads in first person that's probably going to ruin me it needs to be like level with the iron sights well this one's at least lowered uh receiver we'll go with the fastest one which is this one pistol because my sixer building and increase improve spread accuracy yeah i'll try that this multiplayer yeah um the game does have an actual like traditional multiplayer mode where you can play what is essentially team deathmatch which i'm definitely going to try as well um maybe in a separate video but what i do know about that mode is that it's got a peer-to-peer hosting which is a shame the multiplayer doesn't actually have uh dedicated servers so i mean it's obviously not the shining point of the game i think they know that but it does mean that you've got stuff like host migration that we thought was done and dusted you're basically running off the other whoever's got the fastest internet which also means that if you're playing in the multiplayer the person with the fastest internet obviously has the fastest reaction times and sees you sooner if they've got really quick internet um do that one all right i think we're good two grenades and the meds got it what the hell looks like something off i can't think of the name of the movie what's the animation that's set on a train orient express look at these outfits oh yeah this is where the end game stuff is get 75 kills as the axis invader get 100 that looks so sick man what the hell they're never going to see me i quite like this one though hey what's up chica i am live jay uh skills this is just max upgraded um can i wear a hat i can alright let's do it so i don't actually select the map it just i've gotta allow access it's got a security alert hey solomon good to see you man thanks for the support in the stream so far guys felix flux thanks for just uh becoming a member appreciate it polar express that's it not orient express i'm thinking of uh puero the game is on xbox right now yeah it's on all the old gen consoles hey fleming this game looks fun it is fun messy almost sorry mossy appreciate it rohil watching you since the war zone game place thanks aaron yeah i'm excited for war zone 2 man be good well i'm hoping so some leaks have come out though i'm just a bit like curious about but we'll see apparently they're gonna have like a pubg-esque uh inventory which i don't know how that's gonna work in warzone but we'll see all right here we go hardened okay so i think hard normal like you don't choose the difficulty so i am curious about that whether or not you invade another player find the allied sniper and kill them watch your radar for indicators of their position also they're on that yellow we're real we're really close to him the yellow is them right they know i'm in their match now too and they can find me by it's basically like a phone that can't have been a player oh this is gonna be fun man i can already feel it no that's a german surely i don't know man no this is ai this is ai because you can't crouch slide yeah yeah this is one of my this is on my team what how am i doing okay so the enemy sniper just throws you in like while the match is in progress he's in there or him running around that's him see the red on the map now oh this is sick enemy sniper has triggered an alarm [Music] okay these are my boys let's find some higher ground [Music] excuse me lads he's this way somewhere [Music] [Music] also i command the german team [Music] okay request rematch basically one of the ai killed the guy which is a shame but i don't know if this um i don't request rematch probably easy to just keep remaking the party that guy i'd obviously joined a session when he'd gone full alert and every single soldier was against him when i joined that one crazy the germans are your allies if you mark them you can see when they're alerted more tags better visibility good tip i'll say that thank you first time ever my name was called out on a live stream really love you tom hey man happy you uh have heard me the first that was indeed anti-climactic the atlantic wall he died to the eye yeah so there can only be one of me but i can join in on a co-op players session so basically i just got here guys i just got here please what's this so this is all stuff i can unlock oh yeah we've seen these that's the ghillie suit there's actually a progression system this is crazy i haven't had a very good first couple of matches first guy i joined he's triggered the entire lobby i guess it just it's just ongoing isn't it like he could chuck me into his match at any point right as he starts right as he's finishing rises completely overwhelmed by enemies the matchmaking seems pretty ruthless it's just like hey we don't care that you've just alerted every single enemy in this mission here's an actual player hunting you down on top of that hey john what do you think about the skin names to be in german i always wondered what it what it's like for foreign people what do you think about the skin names to be in german oh do you mean like the weapons and stuff like mpist 40 or is the name i don't actually read the names we're just looking at the images do you mean the actual outfits thanks mitch okay tag any german soldier you see if a tag soldier spots the allied sniper you will see their last known position okay let me go chill in this little tower here i like this this is cool let me move my phone out of the way i meant to do that i'm smacking my phone with my mouse what did that say enemy sniper has that's an ally that allows alerted which means he's somewhere close can you see like a sniper glenn there he is that's his last known position because the ai tag saw him he's up there somewhere that's him he's in that room come on tried to just predict his movement now he's still in this corner it's like here somewhere oh my god there is surely that's his head no missed the uh tactical reload you i hear him talking that's crazy we're close shooting that way can't still be in this room this is where i saw him right behind this invasion phones are now available for use that's him damn it i had him in my sights i can beat him here so much sway maybe it wasn't him that's not that's no position has been updated on the map it's a spinning triangle he hasn't been in this room yet and he needs to go here for the objective unless he has a key i might be able to sneak up behind him carlos having a whale over time wherever he is oh you can't you can't assassinate hey he kicked me from his game [Music] just went on a rampage killing all of the ai and i just gunned him down like that i want to snipe one of them that kill wasn't satisfying enough i couldn't even ask for a rematch he didn't want one that's crazy you can zoom in yeah i didn't i didn't realize that was a toggle scope it's good fun alex yeah yeah my heart actually did drop i think you could hear in my voice i went to just bm him and uh go for the assassination what a way that would have been to take him out but you can't you need a bayonet to melee ah you know what who needs a suppressor who needs a suppressor dropped a like for the algorithm hell yeah professor pingu appreciate that oh this is the first map to play on whoa all right i don't really want to be down here fight the ghillie suit right now this is so cool man i love that this is in the game i need to wait for the phones to become available and there one there he could be anywhere on this map he's obviously not in this area and he wouldn't just shoot me he probably knows i'm in his match but like if he cares about his own progress in this mission he's not just going to take a ranged shot out of nowhere you know well i know what his approach is like because at the moment nobody's triggered there's a phone down here what the hell well he's definitely been here look how many dead enemies there are two minutes 38 and i can find out where he is oh what's up my mouse you see any markers on the map no only when they're in my vicinity in the mini-map will i see anything he's obviously been here but he's not gone for the side objectives which are to destroy the turrets i can't go up that hill this is so interesting it reminds me of daisy he just like took a sniper into the map just to ruin someone's day imagine he also has a thing in the top left of his screen saying that he's been invaded hmm we i didn't even come here when i played this it's a spooky there's no ai around gonna go for the phone it's not him here we go there's a single player we've done some of the campaign stuff earlier in the stream we're now doing uh axis invasion which is you spawn as an enemy sniper in another person's single-player game so yes it's multiplayer um i'm gonna use this phone now to reveal his position concentration okay he is 235 meters away my location has also been revealed i don't know if he sees a glint from my binoculars like like he does with my scope you know if this guy sees him that'd be great where are you he's just disabled that turret which is it's that isn't it so it's inside there somewhere where are you hiding mr sniper this is the gun he's just disabled no one's on to him he's stealth i have to use another phone phone a friend you know hello and welcome to who wants to be he's aware of this guy the ally i actually feel like a sniper for the first time in a video game you know what i mean like actually scouting out my target this is amazing even the single player you don't really get this sort of feel because this is like me and another like i know this guy's a player you just respond differently when it's ai you're hunting the vision phone's available again he's going to use his phone so i better go use mine it's authentic uh the difficulty was authentic earlier when we did single player um okay he's in a similar location he's a little bit closer to me than he was before oh he's like down in the bunker somewhere i want to get a range snipe on him if i can try and move screw it [Music] he extracted sneaky devil look at him just on his boat oh no all that time just wanted a long-range snipe on him i didn't know the extract spots that's a shame gg well played so it's like an extraction shooter now is it same app what did i press did i press x here rematch i can't remember yeah it just put me in the same match or rifle that was the art the rsc uh i would like the khan i ate i need to get 50 kills as an invader to get that that's the ball action sneaky boy war factory this is the level we just played this is fun this is really engaging i don't always like to watch is it as intense for you as it kind of is for me this map's gonna be so difficult are you kidding me i could do um you never know how far someone is into their mission he hasn't done these yet he hasn't turned the valve it's pretty early on into his mission then it's great to watch yeah it's cool okay chat's gone pretty quiet now which means that you're obviously paying more attention can we get a one in the chat if that's the case if i mark this guy he'll hopefully spot the guy when i come back later i'm gonna try and do some scouting towards the uh the initial area what a great idea to put this in the game to add some replay value to value to the original maps two nice one has he all right i see you i see you guys being attentive i'm trying to follow that tag the starting location is over here right so so much this area this map that i didn't explore [Music] 69 time i'm late what did i miss smash that like button everyone oh yeah what dark said um you missed a campaign level this level to be exact uh we're not playing axis invasion mode where i spawn as an enemy sniper a jaeger hunter um in another person's single player game and we're hunting them down they've caused a stir this direction you can see on the minimap now someone's on to them i'll uh should i get up here it's not actually a ladder i can climb he's close he's so close they shot the kai knox females in this building that's the end of the level mission boundaries let's go this way try to be quiet because he's going to hear me for sure sprinting around like an idiot is that i don't know that's the uh that's the other target he's hunting i thought i marked him for a sec you've been tagged the enemy sniper has tagged you oh so he sees me oh i see him [Applause] that's how we do it that is how we do it oh my god the third person peaks are op they're op yeah he's ended the mission he doesn't want to rematch after that oh wow that was fun what do you unlock wow you absolutely own there uninstalled refunded the game left a negative steam review the pre-zoom oh the pre-zoom on that kill oh god him i've spawned right in it now i'm in the thick of it let's try and mark you boys this guy is on a rampage some sort of like red oh that's the thing you shoot to uh it's not there is he he's taking shots in my building there he is i see him [Applause] i love this i love this mode holy crap i love it hate me they hate me nobody wants to continue that's so funny i want to join someone's co-op game and try and take out more than one more than one sniper that'd be really cool hey what's up dynamic boys did not do a 360 before not impressed okay i'll do one next time can you even do a 360 in this game because the camera pans around you not like if i point my mouse in a certain direction the character won't follow i have to use it i have to use wasd i think it works that way on um i don't think it even went that way on controller yeah this mode is awesome there wasn't much of a hunt there though i like the hunt i really enjoy the hunt that time i just spawned in the thick of it that guy was he'd already got everyone aggroed and um yeah i just knew exactly where he was invades then deletes dude that was like a 30-second match you kidding me time i'm making everyone uninstall the game i would that's three invader kills already they're actually rage quitting too like they're just they're just not they're just ending it there and then no one wants the the rematch fight [Music] but it's cool that obviously you could just turn invasions on and then go in as an american sniper as well you don't have to queue in the axis mode if there's certain objectives you want to finish as the actual sniper there's always opportunity okay this is cool this guy's triggering an alarm these alarms how do i get in here uh ball cutters so [Music] he's inside the bunker like i was when i played this movie for the first time i'll be careful my breath because i kind of ruin my stamina and stability when i actually come to ads [Music] that's not him is it oh he's down there somewhere location has been revealed crap he's just a phone on me [Music] if i were him i'll probably peek from there if he peaks this door [Music] he's a brave boy [Music] i can't take those guns it's not in the radio thing is he what the hell are you doing man he's right there we saw his sniper it's a critical hit wait what [Applause] hello [Music] um okay i think he rage quit mid killcam he actually all f-forward like that game just ended mid huh well then yeah he actually ought if yeah he legit oh ford there's no other way around it that's actually an alt f4 damn damn feels bad yeah i didn't even get the kill for it i didn't even get the kill he'd have he like ought to afford before even before it was like registered as a match win oh come on stop putting him in stop hear me in these games if he fails the mission i shouldn't also get put in that mission we're gaming though he didn't want you to get the points for the win yeah is there a ranking system uh i don't think so be the little sailor boy fine god i'll be the little sailor boy jesus look at me i'm not gonna be able to hide by and cover with that thing on i'll see my hat peeking over any piece of cover that i actually quite like it without a hat though honestly he kind of looks more like a like he shouldn't have a sniper rifle in his hands yeah maybe some of these guys don't realize they have this mode enabled you can't just turn it off from the main menu when you uh when you queue into a single player game i get it though like i turned it off because i wanted to be able to enjoy the campaign for what it was and not you know i'll get um i mean it's a single player game of the day  you into single player then i want to play single play but uh i might if i go back and do some of the other side objectives and try and unlock some of the weapons because a lot of weapons i've just missed out on the opportunity of grabbing because you have to do certain stuff like find weapon benches um so there's definitely some replay value but yeah i'd probably keep it on for that stuff should be a ranking system so newbies don't get matched with legends like you i mean even a noob can be an elite sniper pardon the pun but when you have the assist you have in this game that's that's the one thing i'd want is if the if the player's difficulty authentic for instance no hud no assists then i think that should also be the case but i haven't figured that out yet like because i get like you know the aim assist when i hold my breath i get this which basically tells me the range the wind i like diamond crosshair when i press space and then when it's red it means i've got a kill he hasn't even been up this way yet i don't think we're right at the start of the mission i look ridiculous like i play the long game um again i like the hunt of this song let me go this way i didn't check this out when i did my single-player run yeah he did i didn't i didn't get the credit for that kill uh gusty thank you for the two pounds my man appreciate it uh i feel it's people not realizing it wasn't turned off yeah no i think you're right it does warn you i think i i think i remember it saying like you know this is a thing but how many people read every pop-up notification that comes up on their screen this is a really nice looking map isn't it smart you guys before he gets here this one looks so so weird from that perspective he just took a shot he's up there which way are you aiming yeah he is over here somewhere we get it mate you're out of breath oh shush [Applause] how many snipers triggered an alarm [Music] i think i see him [Music] my god that was brutal didn't even get a kill count for it oh boy turn on your invasion mode when your next play campaign he left the game oh god this is just rage quit simulator what am i playing right now everyone i kill is like that's enough gaming for me that's enough for me today oh this is too funny this is too funny you gotta drop a like for this just beaming smile on my face right now i know i'm actually ruining people's experiences i'm a villain i've lived long enough to become the villain oh man doesn't just match me in the same thing as it that seems to be an issue oh actual tears man i'm crying tears of elation and they're just depressed but i didn't sign up for this i mean you have to get punished the first time right to learn that it's a mechanic in the game there's even cross play on this game [Applause] oh it's kicking off got killed by a sailor boy he was a sailor boy he said see you later boy [Applause] oh wait is that him you see that guy going the stairs then no it's not if i kill him in the same spot imagine if he was just there again oh he's just down someone here incapacitate him any snipers triggered an alarm he's this way [Music] that's him isn't it oh my god i saw him gotta be fast gotta be fast this way there's a way that i can find him [Music] [Music] wait it wasn't him [Music] let's just get these guys tagged definitely faster with binoculars [Music] is that him i think he's let's go back this way [Music] drop down here quick [Music] oh actually i could see the allies on the map facing the other direction there could be two snipers yeah go call google can i see no just one yeah he's this way oh i can't get out here the allies have reached a dead end he's the only one that can open that door because it opens on the one side i don't think i should be able to do that by the way i shouldn't be able to press escape i feel like that kind of ruins the um the immersion or the uh the guessing game where's he gonna be i think he's down in that compound somewhere someone's triggered red over here yeah he's shooting that way he's finding that tower is he that's a friendly sniper he's just made noise that's his last no position crap i gotta be fast oh so where are you boy oh that's frankie look just like that them wait is that way oh no oh no help help end me i'm stuck there's literally nothing i can do there's nothing i can do i'm stuck what the hell is this this is what it feels like to be stone just infinitely falling [Applause] boy mate come kill me got myself into a bit of a predicament here with the slide yeah yeah go on i'll let you have this one dude what am i supposed to do like i can't use any of my stuff i can't get off this he lives to die another day dude i'm so ready just slide down there bam put a bullet in his brain try rotating there was an option to drop down i did see that for like a millisecond and tried to find it no cigar uh eric ruiz thanks for coming remember dude i think we will see a drastic drop to the concurrent play i can't actually read the full message um youtube is so weird man i don't understand these alerts i'm gonna guess you mean like after everyone's completed the main look like the main story um i don't know because there's always new people getting these kinds of games they kind of last you know like sniper release 4 still has a dedicated audience um we'll see i mean as more people learn about this particular mode i think they might be more interested but i think what would be a good idea is the matchmaking system needs to uh not just make you play as the enemy jaeger in another person's single player game you know you but you there should just be like one team um axis versus allies um american versus german but at least that way you'd always have an american sniper and a german sniper but if it if it just focuses on someone else's single-player mission then yeah i don't think the matchmaking is going to hold up forever they've been alerted here should probably mark these guys he's over here somewhere [Music] oh yes i forgot there was an artery in his arm request a rematch on that one nope i think when i click that it probably says would you like a rematch and it was like no f that guy he seemed to be aware of me though because he placed the landmine there i mean this is the best time to play this mode though i feel really bad if people have queued into this not knowing about axis invasion and it being a thing that's crazy uh dark savaria is that correct looks it thank you so much for the five dollars pal appreciate it buy yourself a beer your next pork haul sailor look at me this guy does not look like he drinks beer he looks like he drinks alcohol-free cider and sam with the [Music] oh just become a member thanks sam sam party is that i don't know i don't want to say the other word hey younes so just join a quick rundown of what's going on what's the game mode uh louis this is axis invasion i play as an enemy jaeger german sniper in another person's single-player game the ai that you see around are basically on my team and it's my job to hunt the enemy sniper and kill them um in the same way that they have to gather intel about the location of the targets they're assassinating i basically have to put the pieces together myself i can tap i can tag uh my friend leaves like this and then if they spot anyone um it will be revealed to me there's also a phone various phones started around the map that i can call after like a three minute countdown and uh it'll tell me the exact location uh but he can also do the same thing is optional you can't turn it off but there's been a lot of uh a lot of talk about this particular mode which i was interested to see for myself and uh yeah it's fun really fun not what i was expecting to be honest i expected to find some fun with it but like the mode itself just uh simple but ingenious you know shush i think he's just started this particular mission it can put you in any point as well could be towards the end could be the very beginning of their mission dude if i just like stop my heart rate goes down if i run i suppose it makes sense like there are skills you can upgrade to get your uh make sure your heart rate doesn't look basically you don't have a heart attack every single time you sprint for longer than 10 seconds catch later levy thanks for chilling i hope you enjoyed the stream while you're here i want to go to the the uh marked a couple of guys over there this is assassin's creed now yeah parkour aspect is definitely a bit assassin's creed like i think you can come underneath the bridge kind of you can't run down the water you can be over there where am i i'm there yeah down here you can cross a bit further on such an interesting concept though really good to implement it into this game could have easily just you know done what i've done with every other sniper elite and just have a traditional single player keep it as it is shush actually can i do this uh it doesn't matter i was gonna try and turn speech volume down the breathing is a bit too loud for my liking but i could literally shoot that hook and kill him that way but i don't think that would ever be possible no one's ever gonna be dumb enough to walk underneath it so many options for him too never really know which direction they're going to go at the start of their their match the first spawn is up there but depending on if he's played this level before um you can unlock other spots to spawn out there's one over there and one over there somewhere i think this is one spawn that's another and this is the main one nobody's been tagged in the main compound i thought a guess is probably in this area let's try and look back around try and go on the flag that i think he's on since he hasn't gone directly into the area we're definitely you know just a few minutes into this match like he's only really just started up this level i think don't run me over lastly thanks for the five man uh this game mode will be crazy when players like yourself start playing purely to hunt the hunter sod the objective and come full snipe hunt yeah i mean you can do that just in single player anyway but you're right make a fair point i think he's going to be around here somewhere he is he actually is no he got past me we walked past each other [Applause] okay sorry for the excessive breathing for a sec going full steam ahead [Applause] the binoculars glenn i don't know curious myself that him [Music] he just hit the tent [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] you know when you already know someone's about to die [Music] [Applause] that's a teammate [Music] there he is no he's actually in the tent [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wow see if he accepts a rematch got killed by ai i think when i press that it gives them a prompt on their screen would you like to face this sniper again and my guess is if he doesn't in time this will count down fully and it'll just put me in the match anyway let's find out if we can get our first person to agree got caught in a tent binoculars don't glint all right thanks dan oh thanks q that's sweet i think the guy's gonna steal from this mission yeah no he's doing well up until that point i think the vehicle spotted him because he stopped on the road though he legit ran past me though because i crossed over here okay no just just just kicks me out there yo f4 another one i think another one just couldn't stand it oh yes i've been waiting to get this in the single player it's tough to get let's try the soft point ammo increased damage can't penetrate helmets or wood fine with that i think this is the best smg you can get vertical recall fine with that that's the rate of fire [Music] yes try it can't put a muzzle on this one though has to be loud that wouldn't ruin the camo why would you do that five invaders so far i'm enjoying this a lot more than i thought i would it's just something about it's just something so satisfying about knowing you just made someone on f4 but at the same time i do feel bad but the good is outweighing the bad i i literally i've become the villain anyway that guy deserved it he deserved to hold f4 if he's gonna alt f4 purely to bm and not like obviously his plan there was to cross the road get an angle on me and kill me first i landed the shot and whilst the bullet was in mid-air in the bullet time kill cam he quit the match so i didn't get the credit so f that guy he had it coming there's more life in the old boy yet he's this direction somewhere because he's alerted someone on the map looks [Applause] [Music] oh my god he's right here [Music] foreign the sailor boy does it again oh we accepted the rematch let's go nope oh no no one wants the rematch we're six kills deep six kills deep no deaths yet yeah i'd love to try deus at some point francis um i think any of the guys have the game though oh i thought that was him that one character skin without the helmet looks exactly like the main character carl he's this way he's inside intel inside stay alert boys can hear him running around [Applause] uh [Applause] concentration [Applause] okay he is in try and predict his next move we're too good it's too good i just know how to read these people oh no run a seven kill streak request rematch of course he didn't accept no one else i'm driving people away from buying this game right now oh it's great fun um another one bites the dust guys another one bites the dust can we get ten i don't have unlocked any uh character oh yeah has to be done i could do this all day yeah we're still going richie oh my god game stop doing this you're gonna single-handedly destroy the game pass player base on the game's player base they can turn it off it's their fault i don't know about that gary holy oh we haven't done this map yet it's fine we'll give you a glimpse of what it's going to look like uh when i actually play this in the campaign oh it's not too indifferent to the first map ah i hear enemy shots he's unsuppressed that's on him like why would you not be suppressed like this is he's further into the campaign than i am he doesn't have a suppressor [Applause] where you at some of the shots were right here they are they're not this is further out oh he's this way uh let's try and blow up the car could even be in this house with me sabotage these vehicles curious if he is even in this area now that might be him that is him 110 percent this come on i think he went up that ladder oh my god he's right here just watched him slice that guy's throat oh my god oh jesus he downed me stupid trying to aim with the uh oh no i'm dead fair play we thought we finally found a crack gamer guys we finally found one that grenade placement was perfect fair play please accept this rematch please someone come on do it the second i held my throttle we both had the same idea on the same wavelength i had him in my sights for so long but like i never got the opportunity to take the shot and then i lost my patience and shot whilst he was crossing the street when i couldn't really figure out the lead that dude was a gamer though he didn't hit me he didn't get a critical shot on me so i had a chance to revive and actually win the fight there but i'm curious if he's actually going to accept this yeah the glint was was definitely a giveaway i thought i had a shot when i didn't when he was in the second floor of that window though fired twice yeah he's ended it he got his win found my soul mate let's go with that drop a like on the stream chat this is your hourly reminder to boost the algorithm same goes if you're watching as a vod if you're this deep into the vod my god appreciate you same goes if you're watching live thanks everyone for being here oh is it official is depp uh is def has depth secured the bag the depth win in the 1v1 vmwood i mean i didn't i didn't win but okay yes let's go love that for him the evidence was just too you know you could tell he spoke with truth everything that amber said like that just changed every time she tried to retell the story fake tears fake stories no witnesses he got 15 mil thanks mit thanks for being here dude thanks everyone for liking the stream i don't actually see likes my uh youtube whatever this live studio thing is it's a bit weird let's have a look just check on my phone oh we broke a thousand likes you legends there's a thousand of you watching 1 200 likes appreciate you all you guys have really been supporting these uh these sniper games the sniper league five videos the live streams the um the ghost warrior stuff definitely found a niche i think you guys really enjoy the sniper stuff on my channel so big thanks to you the quality space them out though like i don't i don't love rushing through these games otherwise i never get to show you guys like the full arsenal of weapons and stuff sometimes i'll go back replay the same mission i've played just to unlock certain stuff so that in the next video we'll live stream i'm able to show you something new each time that's definitely the approach went with the um the sniper ghost warrior videos and that definitely seemed to work in my favor there was always a new topic or weapon or something i was testing or showcasing that series will i don't think i don't know if a play-through will ever be topped um but yeah it's just crazy how well that did i think it's like 12 13 million views in seven episodes like each one of those videos just absolutely popped off so thanks for supporting those vids and yeah i hope you all uh you'll tune in on the fourth to see the video i've been working on it's been months in the making a lot of time and money has gone into it i'm pretty i'm quite proud of it but at the same time i've like i've watched it and been editing it and just the behind the scenes stuff i don't want to give everything away but it's just taking a lot of my a lot of planning and refining so it's very different it's a different video for me you'd expect i did post a little teaser on my uh my twitter earlier if you want to follow me over there or check out that video but um it's been like a 10 second announcement yeah it's funny a lot of you been like saying i've got the dates wrong because it's funny like i guess a lot of them i have a lot of uh americans who watch me or based in na canada i think that's the largest portion of my viewers but yeah we put the day in front of the month when it comes to like you know putting the date down so when i said fourth of the six you'd usually say sixth the fourth which is just weird to me i got a quick glance it just makes so much more sense to have it at the start because you need to know the day more than you need to know the month you're in because you just know that what's the origins of that anyone know i'm curious as to why that's even a thing why did that change streaming 1440p yeah man always so one thing you can't do on twitch and that's part of the reason why i've enjoyed doing the uh my location has been revealed okay he's used a phone against me i need to find a phone can i mark these no well he knows i'm in the church uh actually i know what one is i remember from my video turn right here kind of the phone should be here available in 22 seconds so how does he know where i am maybe he gets his phone sooner oh yeah i look sick now look like i belong in bf5 day month year yeah no he didn't eliot he said he wasn't interested in it i'm gonna have to do some duos with him now let's find out where this guy is oh he's he's below me how is he down there he was right there he's probably gone into the tower i predict his movements again i guess he's gonna come out of a door that's here don't be just taking a surprise shot down there eyes there he is i can't look down either i need him to move like ah that's annoying i see him he's right down there a second ago revealed again there he is it's on that staircase i don't i can't aim down though over this ledge it's so annoying it's just behind that tree and he's looking up you see him on the staircase i don't on the bridge maybe maybe i could find an angle this way oh my god this plan him no you can't jump well you can only vote where the game wants you to vote and it won't let you vote off the edge of the map so it won't let you vote that direction vol volt vote just use the word vault more times than anyone in any sentence ever it's good fun this i'm glad you guys seem to be enjoying it something just so satisfying about ruining someone's day god i've actually become the villain i'm getting enjoyment out of making people all f4 and very quick i like this one [Music] well i can be i can be quite stealthy on this map [Music] all right we know where he is [Music] uh [Music] he's blowing the store with a c4 he's in here looks climbable i could scale it and plant the charges he's going up gotta be fast gotta be fast gotta be faster there he is i'm coming your days are numbered uh he's on the ladder there is there [Applause] hell yeah blew his arm off again is he going to water for shattered his arm completely no he stayed he accepted it would you like a rematch sir nope we played gta 5 yeah of course my first ever video on this channel was a gta 5 um cinematic i think it was my first video yeah i'm pretty sure it was elder ring looks weird with all these guns yeah this is alden ring reminds me rainbow six multiplayer but world war ii really third person open maps x-ray bullet cam ai which rainbow six game are you playing i'm just thinking of siege right now but [Music] there he is oh for god's sake it's may i imagine location's been revealed oh look i'm joining you up here buddy don't like this spot it's down there foreign okay i guess i'm going back down keep spotting me isn't that sniper nest gotta be i'm getting to peak the phone's in there he's blowing that up just recently as well i told it on top [Applause] come on this third person peaks is so cheap man maybe he's on the second level it's not there is he he's been constantly using this phone i could use the phone below him i just don't want to because i kind of know he's in there he's trapped though like what is he going to do one way out with the ladder unless there is a backside but i think there is he keeps using the phone which also reveals him i might be hearing steps in this building only one phone there he's probably gonna use it now reveal me he is in here yeah that's a shoe mine from the stairs you kidding me game screw your minds screw your damn minds what's the phone for basically um if you need to know the position of the enemy the phones are on like a three minute cooldown you can call the phone and find their location encourages them to reposition but also gives you the knowledge of their location wait he actually accepted the rematch oh my god it's finally happened guys he wants to go again thinks he can take your boy we shall see my friend just pvp yeah playing the invasion game mode playing as an ai or as a german in his single player match so the german ai that here killing actually my allies osiri thanks for the ten dollars dude tom i've been a big fan for some time now shame i can't stay long got mog at the gym you feel me keep the golden content bruv thank you sir have a good workout good sesh thanks so much for the 10. appreciate you mission boundary okay what the hell is that oh it's a boat location's been revealed i think he's probably gonna be in the same sort of area he likes those lower buildings catch like you ow thanks for being there as always what was the best sniper game there's a few of them but i think this is probably up there with the most brutal i've played depends what you're after i say this one for me right now is kind of holding the most replay value [Music] this mode and then there's obviously the multiplayer modes as well you can do i think he's running around right outside my building he is god i don't like those close quarter fights even when it's ai like there's no breathing room whatsoever let's see if this guy just you know see if he wants it he does he does want it he actually wants to take me oh no he's given up accepted it and then he was like nah you know what it's not worth it i'm just gonna get slapped again um don't look at there no i kind of like this sniper you know enjoying it it's my graphic nice to catch you live again awesome to watch as always any fast squad gaming coming up soon always man always might be some war zone um might be some uh i don't know some sort of variety game it's my main squad right there though nothing's planned right now but i think warzone's the main game that sort of brings us together but a lot of us are kind of you know sort of like a take it or leave it kind of approach towards them at the moment stone and fogle are the ones most engaged with the game it's stone's main stream game it's the game that his chats seem to uh resonate the most with which is fair enough people always looking for new loadout builds and stones the guy to try something new every time he plays so kind of what you've got to do though as a warzone content creator if you use the same loadouts all the time no one's going to be interested fogle that's still enjoying it as well i think he he kind of joined the war zone train quite late though  that was in the middle of moving to america when um when warzone kind of took off oh this map looks interesting haven't played this one mission seven this is oh okay we're not going to play it play some hunt yeah do you love me someone showdown it's not co-op that was it like uh sorry it's not full player co-op can i do threes which is fine i think that's i think three's even i mean yeah i'll give you threes too much for that game i'm sure i don't works best in duo's if you ask me three just splits up the players too much since there's already like a cap of like 12. can't be quite strategic i'm gonna assume based on those shots that i find him this way mark these boys if they see anything they'll let me know mark you heard acknowledged there he is there he is there is god damn god damn rage quit simulator this is incredible incredible gameplay yeah i'd love to check out uh star citizen at some point well it's just uh i don't i don't want to like [Music] put all that weight on someone to explain the whole game to me um you know like if uh especially like content creative friend wise i'd love to play some games with jack on star citizen but i mean it might be interesting content on his part i just want to interrupt this sort of flow that jack's going with this video i've watched quite a few of his uh star citizen videos now it's just good content watching him learn the game but i feel like if there's too many people learning the game for the first time and i'm the one asking all the questions it take away from what has made jack's star citizen video so good so i think if i was to play it with him i'd probably have to learn quite a bit on my own or with another squad of friends i don't know so if me and jack do play then it just works damn two overzealous there much too overly already wasted a bandage one arm just went down there damn it i held space thinking it would just put me to slo-mo but i forget that just not going to do that in multiplayer oh fair play fair play he's more switched on for sure that's a player he's obviously not he's uh this this map i'm on right now is the very first mission so he's obviously ran through this once before i wasn't patient enough nowhere near patient enough the first couple of shots i took whiffed missed by millimeters see if he accepts the uh the rematch i've been interested in fallout 76 i don't have interested as a word i've played it and i've played the battle royale they released but that game had a horrible horrible launch i don't think it could have gone worse for him the content was there but it was in such a like it was just there for the sake of being there it wasn't a polish game it was like packed with features and mechanics but not one of them were refined i'm sure it's in a much better state now but oh my god i thought it was him this character i'm always mistaking is the actual sniper i'm hunting looks so much like carl you deft oh you're right yeah he used the uh uh alt ability he gets that and i don't my alt just makes the ai that i've marked more alert so if i press alt now look [Applause] whereas he basically gets wall hacks it's probably going to come from down this road though i'll be sure of it where i'm on the map right now okay now i'm in the middle but no phones let me try and make it to this building you know the one i ran away from oh yeah hitman would be amazing with this mechanic love to see this feature in here man follows him why are you shouting oh damn it it's a blasting we've waited to make sure it was actually an ai where are you i'll get to this compound if i can find a phone over here should be up in a second oh my god he's over here the ai killed him boring can you do get in shape please yeah i wish i could uh this is my invasion character but my invasion skills are nine out of nine hmm heart rate oh no i guess reduced heart rate isn't a thing all right here we go again axis invasion time flies play in this mode panic breathing equals mood correct pretty sure this was in a hitman absolution oh really holy any need for that our water effects cool isn't it it's pretty realistic not bad okay task at hand find enemy shoot enemy mission complete uh where's my closest phone go for that building you guys watch the uh new season stranger things binge the whole thing like i have i can't wait for part two man really enjoyed it i think it's my favorite season season one's great for the mystery season two is good for character development season three is has a different sort of style completely and dives more into the 80s pop culture and then season four i mean it's such a like it's such a good tone there's like a bunch of plot twists and it's just a really good watch like i promised myself i wouldn't binge it in one sitting and i literally spent i don't know what eight hours of my day play next play next play next like every episode ended with a cliffhanger i was like i can't i can't step away from the show i absolutely loved it i've had kate bush running up that hill living in my mind rent-free since i first heard that song in stranger things and look at me now i'm running off that road i'm running up that hill okay this is the main target he's hunting so it might be good for me to stick around this area but let's head down to the phone now of course no spoilers i haven't watched any of the um the thor love and thunder trailers like i want to but i don't know what marvel's doing lately and who's approving the trailers but there's way too many like major plot stuff in them lately and there never was before actually it's a phone i need to use because uh the doctor strange one like i just felt like i was watching an extended version of the trailer there's so many like like so many cool things that i would have loved to have been surprised by for the first time in the theater but just wasn't like not one thing jumped out at me because i'd already seen it and there was like so many leaks and even when i was avoiding leaks like there's certain like react channels and youtubers that i watched that we're just putting the biggest stuff from the trailers are getting released in the thumbnails which is the most annoying thing obi-wan is good yeah really enjoyed that ice b first couple episodes are great definitely want to see more of that soon okay phone's about to become available 17 seconds mark this guy six five hello mate because of comfort on you oh my he's miles away well not literally speaking but i've got some hunting to do summer jack is my favorite content to be honest yeah a lot of people over me and jack play i love him i always enjoy the content editing afterwards as well it's a great like duo to have when you're making content because he just gets it he's been doing it for so long now but what's great is that he he genuinely is just like such a he's such a good guy i think i was maybe at like i don't know like 100k subs when i first met him what the hell is that spot hello um he just genuinely like cares about you as a creator and once wants to see you succeed and he's always there to like give advice and it's super helpful because obviously he's been doing it for so long now um not even when it's asked for you know the same guy um off screen as he's on screen i suppose you could say we always ever laughing when we're not recording some of the funniest stuff that we've said hasn't been in videos which is a shame just the crap we say to each other in discord no i haven't seen top card i think i'm gonna go watch it solo you know i think i'm just gonna go buy a ticket go and see it cause i'm hearing really good things that's a good reminder actually i totally forgot that was out that's him he's injured i think he knows i see him too i need to reposition i think he's behind our bush nope oh my god didn't get the critical kill by incapacitating him i thought the first shot was going to kill him turns out he didn't see me i thought he might have seen my sniper glint but he probably just heard my footsteps and thought it was an ai and he's accepted the rematch use the mg would have loved to that was my plan but you can't pick up the weapons that are scattered around the map they're dedicated to the players which is a shame yeah he's he's not not wanted to stick around for that one i'm glad you're enjoying this though guys there's been a bunch of sticking around for this part of the stream which i'm surprised by it's pretty intense good fun tracking people down i think that's my favorite aspect like putting the pieces together figuring out where they're gonna be next just uh i don't know i get a feeling from it that i haven't had like a sniper game like this before how would you rate sniper really five out of 10 um i don't know man i'll probably give it like a solid seven it's not done anything that's like groundbreaking but it's more of what people love about the franchise and i think that's about as much as you can kind of ask for in this day and age because gamers demand innovation and then whenever innovation happens we uh we on it like battlefield 2042 just had i said this in my last room i think they just had to remake battlefield 4 basically with you know more of a polished futuristic type setting but instead they tried to reinvent the wheel and added new mechanics tried to innovate and we hated them for it i just got absolutely annihilated for weeks on end which is a shame because there are some aspects that if they were fleshed out more then it could have been good but i think they spent so much time trying to innovate that if they had just delivered on a on a new modern battlefield game that we could just play for years to come more of what we enjoy most about it i mean there's there's just no destruction as well that's what got me the most how does technology from all those years ago frostbite 3 look more technically advanced than anything in 2042 it's crazy i don't know if like i'll definitely play it again but it's never going to be [Music] that battlefield game that we look back on and go ah remember the turnaround that game had i think it will improve no doubt it'll get into a state where people are enjoying it and it's like their main game i mean it is for some right now but so just like it's way less than i think anyone was expecting the game sold so well then just look at the player base now um just kind of leaves a bit of taste in my mouth because i want to talk and be passionate about battlefield again but there's just nothing says a lot when like the best and the major content that does well on 2042 is literally just this is broken here it is they broke this gun here it is there's no like general like progression that people are enjoying about the game this guy's over here somewhere run past him [Applause] thanks val yeah there's no destruction it's crazy isn't it i thought it was gonna be like the most like revolutionizing destruction we've seen i don't know if you guys remember the early early like footage that i i guess you call it test footage of the engine and they showed this like full skyscraper again demolished turn to like you know reduce to atoms essentially there's nothing like that in the game the best destruction is in in battlefield portal the amount of sway i just had to fight there because i'd been sprinting for so long was insane i don't know how you'd control that with a controller like an analog stick i had to pull my mouse up so high to counter the way that my character was pulling it down insane all right we'll do one more i think i don't want to start on the stream to go on for too long otherwise youtube will just be like nope but if you enjoyed it thus far drop a like and um hopefully we'll get some uh more videos out soon and i can get some co-op games with jack since i know he asked the game now damned in the other day i was like jack you're interested in playing sniper league fives like nine already so okay get up next thing i know sniper league five it's the best game i've played in years you tried multiplayer yet i have not but i plan on doing it for a video you know what that's what i'll do now i'll show i'll give you guys since you've been in the whole stream we'll play a match of the multiplayer let's do some tdm well and play for themselves to play two teams okay that sounds cool let's do that um and we'll do that as well perks uh no skill points to spend i have to unlock attachment separately let's just let's just do it landing zone and these are all custom tdm maps i think they're not just parts to multiplayer maps as far as i'm aware well that church does look familiar now this is completely new all right this is the multiplayer wow okay i'm immediately impressed by the level design this looks almost better than some of the campaign levels but it's also been designed with pvp in mind one of my teammates on the right love that i hate the wind interesting name what's the wind ever done to you blowing your house down come on i think he's beyond that you're on that bunker so this is basically a 4v4 tdm my takeaway [Applause] grenade for you croaks ah are you kidding me what was that why did it not go where it said it was going to go oh great naked hd's in the chat guys wow sex cheaper than tinder what does that even mean we've got any mods in the chat still thank you thank you very much oh no i'm crying why oh there's quite a bit of bullet lead on this one velocity is not grey i love the active reloads it's really cool i missed that in gears of war it did more damage too didn't it after you've done after you've successfully on the reload huh panzerfaust let's go we traded we actually both got bullet cam at the same time that's insane oh it's not 4v4 oh jesus quite big teams i'm dead oh okay sure oh i joined that match really late huh they're at 40 kills when i first joined yeah they don't show ping anywhere here which is probably oh it's here i'll show it by number just by a graph so this is like a peer-to-peer multiplayer no dedicated servers so whoever's got the strongest connection basically just has the jump on everyone other hosts uh massive fan tom you're one of the main reasons i'm giving streaming a go love your content thanks or drakar i'd love to hear it man glad you joined the content tdm now my internet died for two minutes yeah i figured i'd do one of these before i mean i'll actually get in a full match now but we'll do one of these instead of uh an invasion they're cool though four before time i said yeah i just i couldn't understand the like how the match was i don't know like i seem to be spawning away from my teammates every time doesn't have like dedicated spawns i guess you just randomly spawn in line of sight of the enemy and i mean it's a sniper game which you want but it wasn't like okay enemy team spawn on this side of the map for any team spawn on this side of the map there probably was but we just spawned quite spaced out not grouped together like you'd expect in something like cod kind of makes team synergy hard i am i'm impressed that these maps are all uniquely designed with unique assets and stuff they look great peer-to-peer yeah host migration of moderator two nothing worse than mid gun fight and you see that pop up in the middle of your screen because the host left and you've you had the jump on your enemy and now all of a sudden oh yeah i love how much faster that is because it's multiplayer that's what happens when you a d strafe 360 where are you i'm ready for you son go on peep me you won't i should just do this and then i'll have the hardest time getting a head shot on me come on ads i'm right here take your shot okay good shot still won't hit kill to the chest love that it's not thrown away from me shot them in the foot i recommend this game i i really enjoy it honestly today as well as cemented like the replay value for me i really enjoyed that invasion mode multiplayer is cool especially when you're cracked because i love sniping in games and this is a sniper game which means everyone's sniping there we go i'm figuring out the flow now that's a lot of bullet drop can't change or you can't change your loadout in mid match all right let's try the m 1903 win barrel i can't put anything else on it i want more firepower unless bullet drop i thought sniper warrior contracts to his most satisfying sniper game i don't know man i mean to be fair they're both satisfying in their own right but like it depends what you want out of these games if you enjoy the bullet time and stuff and the brutal kill cans and being more have more options in terms of movement i think this game kind of takes the cake but again it's third person not everyone loves third person but for the same reasons people don't like first person games it's just great that we've got options this one for me so far has the most replay value out of the two because once i was done with the missions in in him once it's not because warrior i never revisit it shooting good shooting holy that right there was a violation personally i wouldn't have it yeah modern sniper elite would be great i'd love to see him give that a shot what the hell it's in this building somewhere foreign be careful with my breath i can actually mark people there's a guy on that roof no i just saw the glint look at him oh schwookie can you wall bang i'm not entirely sure wood you can there are there are armor piercing rounds but like i don't know if uh normal bullets will do that in this bush over here somewhere look teammate just died there it's a teammate firing he may ping that location the mg holy recoil so you can kind of tell with the ping like good frag [Applause] so jarring the bullet time because it doesn't trace the bullet now how far out is that guy downed him what tell me i didn't get that kill it's behind the building cache layer alexander so there's just heightens footsteps and stuff are you lucky son of a bee what's up absolutely love that shot him in the heart mid vault i incapacitated him so cracked surprise even myself come on take your shot i see you oh well played the uh the peakers advantage thing is going to be pretty annoying on this game like you can't stand in the open anywhere in any doorway because they've got a third person on you you can decide when they want to peek so you've always got to be aware of [Applause] the third person [Applause] we've got the mg again [Applause] cannot see someone up there i did down here somewhere got my game get out my game more shots this way it tells you on the minimum of the direction or shot yeah this mighty player's fine man i just wish that there was dedicated servers because you can feel the pain like you take a shot it takes two seconds for the enemy to pull down [Applause] yeah this is fun i'm enjoying this gets a tomo stamp a stamp of approval but it nowhere near perfect and it can be easily manipulated but i think that's kind of why i'm enjoying it him steps uh oh good shot try to throw the needle in the tree but hit the branch instead would love sniper league first person yeah i mean be good this is really cool so those roll oh my god you can roll lebron remember that ghost recon future soldier oh i i don't know what i just watched hey top of the leaderboard let's go that's not bad that is not bad at all do you wanna see another one of those before i go i feel like you're going to say yes drop a rock drop a like right now if you do come on kids jesus christ what the hell was that welcome back adam i'm gonna play one last game for you we're doing the multiplayer now tdm just unlock that character try multiple zoom no barrel unlocks no one knocks whatsoever well let's take a mine oh you can choose specialization you can spec into a certain class rank five before you can do that interesting you continue the campaign we played mission one at the start of this well we played mission four at the start of this video uh stream uh we then did some invasion and we're now doing the multiplayer mode um so yeah the stream will be live as a vod on the channel after the fact if you want to see some invasion gameplay played quite a few rounds of it oh boy definitely gonna find someone up here aren't we there's a close quarters map some movement down there this is a nasty map just looking for sniper glints everywhere i go didn't need to aim for the head there the follow-up crotch shot would finish the job kind of toxic though climb all the way up the stairs this map is are you kidding me visibility wise this map is insane if i get up there all careful about to fall through the gap in the uh no no i can't surely the game will let me do that yeah it's just there by design hmm there's one i need your spawn feels bad oh my god there was a player there uh i'm gonna kill you so many angles fatality what am i shooting oh my god he hit the shot so dark on that but if you guys can see it i've like brined it up on the stream end so you can at least see in the shadows better but not helping myself much at all mjnus thanks so much for the uh the 25 that's really generous lower your content tom your mods are the best two i would agree i'm here buddy i'm here i'm sure it's safe but i got you it's cool you can call teammates no oh i thought actual sniper glint this is just crazy this man he's dead that guy's getting sniped from behind i've just been sniped from oh there thank you teammate love you i absolutely love you for that we can be friends yeah you better run oh incapacitated from up top the breathing is annoying yeah let's see this player annihilate this guy yes sir yes sir that's a dead man there was one in that doorway but they ran away i've just seen something i'm curious about so i'm off to investigate wow you didn't even head show me what a gamer block the guy yeah we uh usually ban these accounts but they find a way so many with the same name that's so satisfying even though it's really fast incapacitated just saved my teammate's life god damn this is fun i need to zoom in more you're not building oh owie where this guy get down from ah fair play i want to get on that far side of the map but something i want to check out my ideas sense i'm fine is a little too high um i don't think i'm ever gonna get it right because it doesn't change in increments it's by five uh where am i going this way oh i know where i am i think it's this way didn't even get to see the bullet cam traded no no trade okay oh he showed me the kill for oh he's getting revived up there too uh wherever spawned game please i want to get under him [Applause] uh explosion has saved your life oh my god got pushed everyone's using smgs thanks valerie i always think the leveling is slow multiplayer i can't say i've played enough of it to figure that out um i know where i am see these reflexes a little different it actually stopped you from teabagging sauron movement there hey we won yeah there was like a satchel thing below i think you can blow him up like a satchel below it and then make a hole with the satchel that's pretty cool 17 kills though look at us thrive gaming all right that's gonna do it that's gonna do it today that was good fun good match to end on ending on a high how do i leave there we go crush the opposition dominated in axis invasion got 14 player kills today um that's 14 matches we won a good time good game no i call required as jeremy johns would say uh but thank you so much guys for enjoying and chilling and all the love thanks for dropping all the likes and the the comments and the stuffs and the youtube stuff that people always ask for goes a long way so i appreciate it uh if you want to go an extra mile when the video goes live if you can drop a comment on the video then that is just from the gods but yeah more this game soon we'll continue the campaign got this uh this mission next and hopefully now that i know jack is playing we can do some co-op with jack soon um yeah that's it for today folks june 4th big video coming up um and yeah thanks for watching as always stay safe have a good day night
