allow me to take you back to modern warfare 2019 and what i think is one of the most realistic and impactful campaign missions in video game history and when infinity wars lead developers set out to create an authentic sequence that would break down every preconception about what a typical arcadey mission looked like in a call of duty campaign this is what they came up with clean house is a night raid level that takes place in camden town london as you and a tier 1 sas team organized by captain price himself set out to clear a residence which is said to be housing the alcatar members who organized the piccadilly terrorist attacks earlier in the campaign what follows is an intense stealth mission based in the intimate confines of a london home that is unlike any mission in a call of duty game to date there is thought to be more custom animations more animated scripting in this single level for all of the possible ways that the player can interact with it the modern warfare one two and three combined and so i decided to play through this mission again for you this time on realism mode to hide as much of the ui as possible and show you just how immersive this level really is i recommend that you wear a good pair of headphones for this one and watching the highest quality that you can because without further ado this is clean house targets let's kick this off bravo six moving on the rear gun [Applause] level 6 is alpha 2 about to enter the west alley copy moving interior i'll get the petal they'll one operations in the east after the attacks trust the wall you know i do but this operation fails your dead brothers not sure of that we were supposed to have double the body count it's all over the flippin telly that's the point this is the united kingdom do you think anyone walks around worried that they're gonna get blown up well now they do alcatala is a household [ __ ] name entering through the front door [Music] six move into the first are you floor [Music] it's right down the door two x-rays down copy make sure this floor's secure first floor securely [Music] bravo 6 move into the second floor go get those rooms cleared flow secure right up the stairs bravo 6 taking the third floor i will not betray the wall shots shut the kid up secure locked try to take him alive [Music] down get down get down don't shoot don't you please then we're going to kill you come on he knocks me in here drop him i said stop clear all teams turn our secure commence ssc oh [ __ ] now she was going for a bloody detonator good job we dropped it then we made the right call sir what about your house we've got a location on a wolf you can always look at a game that you've worked on and if it was a good game if it was a game that you really had a high functioning aaa team on you can point to those things and you can say that moment in that game is something no one else has ever accomplished and we did it and that feels great [Music] [Applause] you
