that's it right that's it i've been shot again oh no behind behind one of his uh he's called his teammates back here he's got two nice oh my god the lever action is serving me well boys if you can land the shots oh yeah she slaps uh no i think we need to go further around to get in yeah redeploy here there's a redeploy it's the last guy let's push together oh they must have activated that redeploy killed him nice i think we did it hostile redeploy interrupted we're good all right listen up this gets tricky your mission here isn't about annihilating the enemy it's about securing assets specifically data drives data drives are found inside satellite pods the squad needs to retrieve as many as possible bring them to an extraction point and get the hell out the assets could be anywhere out in the open stashed in some building or hell already tucked in the enemy's pack you can grab those too but look out for the occupying forces they're dug in expecting you and they'll shoot any notepad on site the more data drives you extract with the better the reward and the better the reward the better gear you can bring next time strategize with your squad what gear do you bring are you going to play a stealthy or balls to the wall your squad will share the number of drives you extract even if only one of you makes it out even if everyone else died trying keep your eye on the time remaining in the extraction window and make damn sure you hustle when you get the call from final extraction extraction is victory people go get it oh my god boys well it has the base jump it's so beautiful screenshots okay this look this map is incredible where are we going to broken to yeah it's broken oh god i can't move very fast with my how do you move your parachute by the way i'm flying baby but what the hell just told w mate wow oh you have to look oh you have to look down in order to make it work properly you guys are so funny the shots are here up to them exactly the same thing are those those players uh they could be let's try and take uh hmm that's definitely a player squad right yeah fighting over something i'm gonna try and take the glacier behind him wow this is actually stunning i've nearly just killed myself i'll be there they don't see me they see you they see me they may see you i mean i don't know okay uh one up over here one round around the back of that glass him oh my god headshots are so satisfying one up here one up here we've got one i see it nice nice in the face this guy gave up there's guys over here another team another team coming the china yeah that's a different team guys different team okay i see you movement i see movement uh i might be screaming moving up okay hang on bragging over just behind me nice that's it that's the whole squad have we wiped them all out holy crap boys that's two yeah there's two full scores gone all right sniping is nice yeah that was such a sick bass jump yeah that was amazing just to like land into the combat okay so we need to go and get the drives yeah which one do you want to go to how far away is the one over to the east yeah it doesn't tell us the measurement the distance that one is three hundred three hundred meters you need the tracker to see that is a sick skin took me hours to unlock that now i'm gonna drive away i wonder what the unlock uh requirements are gonna be for some of these 20 days um where are we going 20 hours played consecutively where where am i going i can't hold on let me jump is the zip line turn around that goes all the way that goes all the way up yeah but let's base jump again let's just go to our next let's just base jump to our next objective i'm done how could we possibly resist you've got the wingsuit course you are oh you don't have that suit oh thank you nice pistol i'm sure you go faster you can plus this than this on the pistol just whilst on the zip i mean what are you looking at okay this this might take some time boys this is taking forever guys this is taking a really long time man this is taking a while this is taking more time than i was expecting definitely nearly there boys it's cool area imagine you get knocked off at the top someone just stands in the way oh don't give me any ideas no i can't do it and then everyone's like bye all right so extraction one is we haven't got any of the data drives we've got none let's extract we're not like there's a deploy thing here on the map somewhere here we go activate oh there's one dropping in you see that definitely needs to pick those up oh yeah in the sky look here oh yeah there's another one there's another one over to the west you want it you want to go to it oh there's loads of people over there all right we're up on the hill they're up there two thousand meters away i've got the obliques yeah let's overwatch the first extraction just snipe them all in their faces i like it yeah what's going on boys like this map is huge like all right broken i don't need to show off for your wings yeah all right parachute did you i want a wing suit man this guy clown and then dive and then pull yourself back up again it's like the real wingsuit strat will give you more yeah you can go down 360s this is very scenic isn't it there is a lot beautiful it is beautiful there's like there's a lot of open spaces there is yeah it's a bit it's a bit too much some of these maps are massive this is gonna be a vehicle map for sure i'm gonna try and drop here yeah a bit of cover over there yeah oh you hold shift westy to get the most amount of speed yeah i'm boosting now yeah i see what you mean you did because if you release you just bring your weapon out and you really like slowly descend yeah it like takes it right down interesting so it might be people left over at the extraction this fight extraction plane coming in now yeah seen it okay yeah there's a lot of people at e1 the extraction's nearly there we might be able to get some snipes here i'm hoping yeah fighting at e1 align yourself with the back of the plane if we can stop them from getting in yeah it would be nice say i fight in by the way i just landed behind oh satellite just landed behind me yeah i got one of them where are you yeah team right here nice grab it somewhere grab it oh baby am i throwing plates down for people to pick up i've secured them to drive tomorrow's gone and got the
