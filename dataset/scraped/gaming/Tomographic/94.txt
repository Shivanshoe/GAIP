it was a collateral so and yeah i've won the game jack it's a great hog day a great pond day hello everyone and welcome back to battlefield 4. what a game man it's crazy to me just how well this game still holds up today i mean you could say the same thing for battlefield 3 as well both games felt so ahead of their time and still do today and so that's exactly why i mean a few friends decided to hop on again recently myself acolyte stomach 64 and of course i had to invite jack frags i've gotten to know jack pretty well over the last year or so playing warzone and other games but we've never actually played battlefield together so it was a great opportunity to get some games in with him even though we spent the entire time memeing as we so often do we all had an absolute blast playing together and battlefield just makes for the perfect playground whenever you can get a few buddies online so that's what you're about to see just a few friends messing around on battlefield relearning the game and getting excited for the release of 2042. i'm actually starting on a brand new account so if you want to see more battlefield 4 content during the lead up to battlefield 2042 and let it be known by leaving a like on this video and subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one oh we got some movies across the road across the road it's crazy like the bullet velocity on these knives after playing war zone it's actually i think there's a lot of new players jack and everyone's trying to learn how to fly and yeah oh you just poked someone i have absolutely pogba jack it's time that's all i needed i don't need to get any more kills now just post that as your video son yeah done oh no i came in too hard i just saw two jets just driving to the ground next

cap it from underneath too there's guys on the back side boys the train again the back side of the train behind the train jack come on now oh i don't know whether we're running all this way somewhere i've killed one there's one guy running towards you guys he's hopped off the track oh there's a tank oh no ruined let's go jump right in here do i jump to the lower level where the construction site

sucks thanks dude i mean i've got nothing on that sniper than anytime scope but let's go baby he's still better than whatever that guy was using it's an srr though so you know it's it's pog the guy below you i think the tank's gone stone killed it oh oh there's this just there tell me you survived that sat next to us the entire time connor is this guy fk nope that's a fat note there's no way that vehicle lives can't allow it so i'll snipe them out pretty easy if i just do this yeah apparently really it can be pretty easy if i just uh aim him like this and just go like that i'm going for that definitely the same guy in the vehicle what do you want so fast man come on hop out he's dead hell yeah dude we've got him oh i'm getting got we've been shot at from the shot act in the building

here uh i'm good but i think you just stick to helping a guy get up i'll do it i can't do guys anymore you know what he was doing he was hovering over the enemy team like you do often in war zone tom i basically did that that's basically the problem is that's the only way to do it like once and then you're like that's always like the classic tom move i just pulled right there i can't even hop in the hell it's not like you know stone and full damage which is quite frequently classic dude what are you talking about oh ggs oh gg one yeah yeah that's what we're talking about good teamwork there's

to do is swim out lev dealt with me jack in the ocean oh yeah get him jack jack you're blowing him okay it's gonna kill me now i was trying to tom but he's used to rp on the road i was getting ruined by it but as they say it's better to be at the bottom of a ladder that you want to climb and halfway up when you don't they do say that oh my god i can't go anywhere i'm just getting ruined by both you should do the easter egg you guys know the easter eggs yeah the boat when you snipe something on this on the cargo ship right you just quick scope the bar and it just explodes yeah you yy ladder stall but it's going to be at the bottom of a ladder that you say it's time to stop though stone's trying to concentrate flying sorry all right it's gone it's gone midnight this is the time you get

never once heard it i hear it because that's who you are and i understand well oh there's a guy behind me right here because that's who you are is there a vehicle up here was it that's where jack like dice decided that instead of just having infantry gameplay they'd add vehicles to the maps spice up the gameplay a little bit right yeah that's interesting actually you'd understand that i feel like you know you know like a battlefield veteran or like you posted some battlefield videos maybe some one even there's one video there's at least one just at least one hey hey doesn't matter about the uk does it yeah where's the ucav now [Music] you
