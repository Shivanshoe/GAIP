so then with the hype surrounding battlefield 2042 running through my veins i decided to launch up battlefield 4 and play a few rounds of the fan favorite mode gun master it's actually quite similar to gun game from call of duty in this version though it's a team based game mode and you swap weapons every time you get two consecutive kills on an opponent and whoever is the first player to get a kill with a final weapon in rotation wins the match if you go on to enjoy the video drop a like for the algorithm and subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in like two seconds after this intro has played i made it awkward didn't i god damn it okay lankang dam is it yeah it is still don't know if i'm pronouncing that right after all these years look at the lighting on this map compared to warzone it's crazy how good the game looks eight years old this game is oh what did i do to you what was behind me on the stairs okay parachute off it's gonna try and yeah oh i just peeped into that shot tonight oh look now he's taking the corner people love this spot in these buildings because you can just like that guy's just done wait for people to run up and shoot him in the back someone just died here of footsteps around here rafika all right i think we're good this is a mode that i've always loved in battlefield and cod games so much fun and the end games always get really intense okay left that guy so low after those first few rounds this is a cool variety of weapons though i like it when they start out from uh basic stuff and get more advanced over time i think the first time i played gun game was in black ops one and the final kill was with the ballistic knife and the ballistic knife in that game was so sick and they've recently added it with cold war and war zone but it doesn't hit the same oh i forgot how good the magnum is in this game it's so good and the deagle two of my favorite pistols in bf4 oh oh my switched on that guy look how crucial footstep audio can be in fps games it's always done so poorly though can't beam him from this range you however a deal range for the mp7 we're gaming now forgot how much fun the gun players in this game once you understand it you can really capitalize on it it's a good time it's a dead teammate this way oh that guy was low p90 is it oh yeah all right here beautiful good shots if i do say so myself all right the software looks crazy doesn't it it's blinding but also very good looking come on god you want to die please holy oh no counter attack no oh this is so fun this mode is so fun dude oh i'm just just hitting me with nostalgia spas 12 another favorite shotgun of mine just looks great feels great the guy here he's gonna die watch this oh oh what i meant was that i was gonna die because there's someone in that corner again right it's payback time that's a teammate there he is that's a dead man i'm feeling it now i want the win and all of the kills that come with a win where is everyone oh god i was on the lower level how did i not see that guy well that's annoying back in the fight though spawned right next to a guy got him right what are we on to now this is the us maybe a shotgun oh yes this is definitely with you sass i need to pick up the pace here i'm not really finding anyone oh where are you come on there it is last bullet that's great that's great onto the acr now let's go i reckon they're going to be over there let's use the connector those guys right here jesus how'd you get over there so fast oh my god this guy is quick on his feet let's get him oh my god couldn't even see him i think he tactically shot the uh fire extinguisher on the wall to uh give himself a smoke shield and it's been so hot in the uk the past few weeks we're not built for this weather our houses are just like microwaves full insulation no air conditioning unless you buy it i actually bought a portable ac unit last year to combat the heat oh just managed to pick that guy off figuring out the uh spray patterns again are these guns now this guy's just died i think i should push that [Music] stand in that window again you love that window make sure this is clear i think we're good it's the mtar i think that's what it's called in this game right okay get back here go for the stairs oh he's going outside again jesus this guy's leading me on a wild goose chase come on okay we got him oh so nearly got that guy it is interesting to me that battlefield gun master or gun game whatever you want to call it has always been a team based mode whereas in any other game that adds this sort of mode like cod what that thought god just die please it's usually a free-for-all mode oh one bullet wonder the instant weapon switch spammed that guy sar 21 i think this is manufactured by tavor as well isn't it [Music] i mean it is full but it's battlefield isn't it i'm trying to get used to not spraying not spraying guns this isn't call of duty i think the longer you spray in battlefield 4 the more erratic your recoil pattern is and the bullets just don't go where you're looking firing like a cone formation who's that guy calling a cheater expression assist the mg's are always a favorite of mine in bf4 they're a lot of fun especially because suppression was in the game it's horrible to be on the receiving end of but you can capitalize on it it's great hopefully we don't have suppression i feel 20 42 though you can hear first steps so much better in this game i love it i forgot what it's like to actually hear footsteps in games i think about iphone 4 did it amazingly well but at least i can hear the general direction where people are coming from should be a guy up here oh jesus oh you scared the crap out of me just chilling between the uh i don't know what you call those things mri scanners we're back here [Music] i thought i saw a dorito out the corner of my eye the guy just got absolutely decimated i think this is the l86 a2 which is the lmg uh version it's also an l85 on the assault class which i actually used to have an airsoft variant of many years ago and i love using it in games but it's not very practical in the real world it's a uh it's a bullpup weapon so the magazine is actually behind the trigger but it's really finicky to like reload and this difficult gun to maintain here we go oh you would oh jesus i lost him in the in the suppression really wanted to assassinate that guy he had a sniper so he's definitely in the lead or he's up there for sure yeah basically if you assassinate someone in this mode they go back by one weapon anyone else so i'm actually recording this video um shortly after the battlefield portal reveal from ea play i'm really excited about that mode but i hope that we actually get gun master uh somehow i mean someone's going to be able to make it surely in battlefield portal it'll be insane going through all the different eras hopefully dice make their own version of it and really like flesh it out because i think uh it's a fan favorite mode for sure it's a lot of fun in this game come here you have that oh god that's not a teammate what is that guy's feet doing but be careful now because i'm a couple of kills away from catching up okay that's one onto the sniper now see if we can get someone quick i don't know there's gonna be someone in the lab up here yep wait for the counter what the hell how did i lose that did i hit v too soon i've been demoted now right there's a couple of guys just ahead of me come on where is everyone this one all right we're back to the sniper it's definitely gonna be someone up here that was not good sign someone's got the m320 hey that corner's clear bingo it's one that's two now i've got the m320 let's put it to work this is a really annoying gun to get kills with come on where is everyone i hit him directly in the face with it he just took it on the head like a champ i've got the most kills in this lobby but i'm falling behind come on he was around there somewhere oh no his grenades no hit marker no it's so bad no my tummy back on him oh you idiot tom what have you done that for you idiot you turned away from him and gave him a free assassination i can't believe it i've thrown it at the end please die oh my god i couldn't even see him i can't waste any time now if i want this win there's one that's a hit come on no he's [ __ ] he's going for it he's going for the knife stop this man please don't let him do it no oh i ruined it i ruined it for myself you're just ruining it you're rooting my lips you're ruining it gg god's sake that was so fun that was so fun that was my first game back on that mode in years honestly they've got to add this mode in 2042 or at least someone's got to make it in battlefield portal god it just brings back so much nostalgia for me playing battlefield 4. even just like the base game but the fact that i'm playing gun master which was a mode that when it first got added i just played for hours and hours and hours i just remember it being a great way to uh rank up the weapons at the time and it is for me now really because i'm playing on a new account on this uh on this profile i mean we actually had the most amount of kills in that lobby but we got set back a couple of times just my own stupid mistakes but yeah i hope you enjoyed that leave a like if you did and
