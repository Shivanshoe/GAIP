all right so it's now been revealed that call of duty war zone and black ops cold war season 4 will go live on june 17th now the season 4 trailer released yesterday mainly seems to focus on the overarching story of war zone and cold war introducing jackal who looks to be the main operator for season four probably at the very start or end of the battle pass but some of the teased content included a new point of interest a new gulag and what looks to be the addition of the motorcycle vehicle from black ops cold war which i always thought would be a great addition to war zone we haven't really had any new vehicles added to warzone either so this is definitely a welcome change also revealed today in the extended cinematic four season four we have a first glimpse at three brand new weapons we've got the amelie light machine gun the caparis smg and the cet c-e-t-m-e rifle probably butchered some names there but we've got some really exciting weapons to get our hands on here definitely looking forward to trying these ones out for sure all right so season three of war zones certainly held us over for a little while after the dance got nuked and players were sent back in time to 1984 but i think most of us are already kind of over it right like don't get me wrong some of the changes were cool and help to improve the overall quality of life of vedansk but my initial concerns about some of the changes like the new summit area formerly known as dam being so far up north that players just won't be fighting there all that often thankfully nakatomi plaza came along and has been a big enough point of interest to at least give us somewhere new to land and it's proven to be very popular i do realize a lot of work and development probably went into the dansk84 and you know sending that map back in time but some players will call it lazy and this deep into the game's life cycle you can't really blame those players i mean if the changes to the dance came a few seasons earlier maybe people wouldn't have as much of a problem with it but the game has been out for way over a year now and aside from rebirth island and the resurgence game mode there haven't really been any truly refreshing map changes in a very long time i also imagine that this version of a dance will probably stick around for a while too so don't expect any major changes this season hopefully we'll learn more during the mid-season update about the potential of a new map perhaps in season five or six but i wouldn't get your hopes up about any sort of map teas coming this season i have no doubt that the war zone dev teams are cooking up something big behind the scenes but it really is a race against time now because war zone doesn't have any serious competitors until battlefield 2042 comes along which i know myself my friends and many of you guys are very excited about and though the core gameplay in warzone is still very fun for me personally the game just feels a bit dry at the moment you know season three made some huge changes in terms of weapon balance so it's been awesome playing with a bunch of weapons and not feeling completely useless but i don't know i just can't help but crave something more so as for what's coming in season four we don't really know too much about the contents of the update on the whole activision doesn't typically reveal too many details until closer to the season's launch or sometimes on the day that the update goes live but what we do know as with every new season that there will be a shiny new battle pass as well as new operators weapons new limited time modes and perhaps in-game events the season 4 trailer did give us a small look at the updated gu lag for the new period of content featuring the fan favorite map hijacked from black ops 2 or at least a small portion of it will be playable which is cool hijacked is also returning in cold war for those interested and it also looks like we're getting cold war's version of the desert eagle where the scope attachment looks kind of fun but they really have put themselves in a box with some of these cold war guns haven't they i mean at least when it comes to war zone content it seems that all we're getting is duplicates of existing weapons are already in modern warfare but i suppose there is this which only showed up for a brief second in the trailer yep that is a nail gun and i really hope that this is something that we can use in a loadout and customize it's not a weird pickup weapon from a chest or something and if we can't utilize it at all then yeah maybe it should just stick to putting ikea furniture together as fast as possible i don't know we also got a look at our first new point of interest that will be added to the dansk84 in season four which appears to be multiple crashed satellites from space one of which has landed in farmland and the other split above and below the bridge crossing the canal it looks like that's near hospital and you do hear the warzone announcer at one point in the trailer say this now this tells me that there is definitely going to be some sort of limited time mode or event based around these new points of interest the satellites and also one thing worth mentioning i don't know if any of you have heard about this but a little while ago activision reportedly sent out a survey asking about players satisfaction with the dansk84 and it did in fact mention the red door travel system pointing to the possibility of their inclusion within season four you know nothing is confirmed but prior to the cold war integration with warzone if you remember we were able to use the subway system to get around for dansk but that system just wasn't very popular was it i think it was a bit easier for players to understand and we would have utilized it a lot more but it was literally like catching a train in real life and if you didn't know which direction the train was heading or you weren't paying attention to the zone the train could often teleport you outside of the gas so yeah inevitably the subway system was shut down and it sounds like these new red doors will take their place and hopefully be a bit more streamlined as for the rest of season four i mean time will tell but i really hope that this season can keep players engaged this is a teaser trailer so hopefully there is more to come later in the season but if this is it i think a lot of players will be disappointed i'm hopeful that warzone can deliver in future seasons you know season three was definitely a step in the right direction for the game and communication has been a lot better from raven software which is great but there is still so much that needs to be done i know that console players are screaming for an fov slider i see that all the time on social media and in the replies to raven's tweets and i hope that they can deliver for those players but it's likely more of a performance limitation especially on platforms like the ps4 and xbox one you know the reason console games are often at a lower field of view is for performance the more that you scale up your ffv the more the game has to render within your view which you know on those older consoles i just don't see it being a possibility maybe for those lucky enough to own a ps5 or xbox series x i can see a high fov being a thing but there are still so many trying to get their hands on one of the current generation of consoles so we'll have to wait and see on that one as for cheating i think there also needs to be a better antique software implemented just yesterday i was playing some solos and i was put in a cheetah lobby now i wasn't killed by the cheetah i was actually killed by a guy called average dad who is a fellow streamer oh my god i've just killed tomographic checked his stream and realized that he'd noticed me too so i went back to say hello and tried to get his attention but i mean he was simply too cracked with his car 98 and mistook my love bullets as a sign for aggression and owned me a second time who's tomographic someone who i massively look up to as a content creator and as a human being anyway i dropped in on his stream to say hi and he said some very nice things about me and i hung out for a little bit in this chat but then soon after he did in fact get absolutely beamed by a player clearly cheating and went on to win the game with 38 kills and then he proceeded to let everyone know in the post match comes that they deserved it you know he seems like a really nice guy but average dad actually noticed that his party was open so joined his session and then this happened just to be further down there he is what's up how you doing better you're good yeah you always leave your party open after after the lobby just to see whether or not there's always someone who joins my session yeah so are they actually getting like through bad waves and stuff and everything now right yeah no i never got banned only shadow band you want to get a shadow band how long does it last eight days eight days and that's it you might be asking why you hack i don't know because i can because you can so have you got like an account where you play where you don't have hacks on oh dude this is not an interview no i just want i i genuinely just want to know just because i'm streaming at the minute and like yep average dad got kicked and blocked by a chat he's blocked me he was down here on the left i did pass his details onto raven so hopefully something gets done but it shouldn't be on people like myself providing this information for any real action to be taken how is this guy not being permabanned after playing like that who is reviewing these accounts when they get put into the shadow band lobbies doesn't seem like anyone and this guy waited out the full eight days i believe he said and then got released from shadow band jail cheating in war zone used to be a lot worse and much more frequent for sure but i mean it doesn't excuse the fact that it's still happening and more countermeasures need to be put in place to address them props to average dad by the way seems like a great dude and i'll be sure to link his stream below but with that being said that's all i've got for you today i just want to let you know what's happening in warzone season 4 and talk about the future of the game a little bit and my thoughts but be sure to let me know what you think in the comments below and leave a like if you enjoyed the video and a quick plug at the end here just a reminder that
