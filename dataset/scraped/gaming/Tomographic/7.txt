oh oh my god it's huge isn't it welcome everyone to battlefield 2042 you in i'm in okay we're finally in it's happening where have i spawned the best one on the top of it i can't believe it i've been sat here just for anybody watching the vod after this got it actually it's 64 v64 players yeah so 128 on this huge map huge uh we've been waiting for two hours for this uh this update to go live so we can't use the new weapons and um i started yourself um but we can play the map that's kids you know basically nobody could log into the game and uh apparently the fix was for them to remove the new guns from the game hello hello you should you should go uh sundance i guess i'm just i'm just explaining the fun you know the new content well you know the new content it's just the map well i mean the characters in right working uh no because the character needs unlocking that's right i don't think you can unlock it yet nice not to see one oh nice some nice comments in the chat in a in a game i'm not reading this remember guys it'll be less toxic in the uh team chat yeah yeah that's can i just say thanks to uh everybody who's been waiting for this stream to start we've had some fun in the uh in the chat while we're waiting but this update was supposed to go live at 1pm and it's now 3pm and i've just got in my first match um so yeah we can't use the new guns unfortunately there's a new crossbow and i played sundance right so i could what is this lead this guy must be so scared yeah so uh yeah my first time playing 2042 in a while i forgot you need about 100 meters to pull your shoe effectively and nobody will send that clip to stomach 64. i'm sure nice my first death let's make up for shall we with this snipe there we go teamwork make the dream work there's an enemy around here somewhere let's cover teammate excuse me imagine if every map had been like this on launch i mean it does it does seem there's a lot more cover you know seems to be a good size map well as long as like for instance we're having like a massive infantry fight in these tunnels even with 128 players no i'm using a dm7 i just picked it it's pretty good i didn't know this is cool though it is cool yeah like the uh the tunnel it feels a bit metroid god might be i've not actually been to this part of the map yet this is new for me this isn't in breakthrough this bar where are you where you are now this is like only in conquest this part uh where do i find that there we go you're here you're you're you're on me yeah yeah yeah protectors repelling hostiles very nice just looking for the slider because the fov slider is like yeah that's mad 133 so i put it to 79. that's something that's lower than mine i think yeah i see my 112 is not 79. they'll take every sector what's the best thing uh yeah that's it as long as you got long barrel um so come here come on we'll go this city together i need to uh switch to sundance when i spawn yeah it's a bit the server's a little less likely what's going on with that whenever you call a lag spike i see it yeah we might get beamed by these guys shooting from the cliff side if you've got sniper yeah yeah so they're shooting from the other side of the cliff from their spawn okay can you get up so earmarks behind us you mean oh great just throw me off you can throw a medkit and it actually heals you mid-air now nice russians have lost strength the cracks are being killed dude you have a second to react to that okay um did you get me i got i got minced by the the heli our system's changed a bit as well isn't it yeah yeah and is the deal oh the excel might be good for this map actually just because of the speed where are you our forces control most sectors for some reason i thought this was for auto [Music] i've got the you know the mp28 yes yeah it's not for it's not yeah okay with the res we love that not clear that's crazy why is it so way too high yeah yeah like um okay bring up that are we doing chat can actually speak to you now yeah so uh season one we've got a new map we've got two new guns and we've got a new um saying the dxr is probably a better choice on this map just for the the no bullet drop essentially oh yeah maybe there are a lot of long angles we're dropping down people dropping down from the top oh no they're dead they're mine oh no you're right let's go up here and then jump from the top i guess was with sundance you being beamed i don't know i'm just shooting [Music] run away take this yeah i love this man yes great feels quintessentially battlefield so is sundance about as loud as she sounds when you're in first person yeah you can it is okay definitely wouldn't die from that impact are you not here yeah so you have to restart the game to get it today [Music] switch misses me well the twitch that's crazy i didn't think they cared and the game feels good there's some lag on the server though for sure get him stored what have they removed the new helis as well and they're they're part of the battle pass so you can't get them oh my god what they're just skins yeah no there's something you have to unlock look at the moves on that guy i'm gonna get b charlie it's way too many dude that was pain what's that well i clearly had shot with that person because i died the shot didn't count oh yeah they it deletes the bullet midair yeah we've shaken them up best guess we're halfway home so they spawn at f2 side the man rolling in the boots an angel does it again do the helis i want the new character just so i can i love sundance man well yeah and they've nerfed there but she's still really good yeah it's not really a nerf the audio thing the game's so naturally loud anyway damn twitch without tomo is like pizza without cheese the 128 player conquest actually plays okay it's not too bad it depends on the content i'm making like i was worried that it was going to be 64 player and i think that would be quite quiet i'll probably do some the fact that it's actually right now i'm just playing so much like variety and stuff that requires me to play offline for hours for content it's just not sort of stuff i'd stream when i was playing writer's republic for content then that's like a time where i was i'm surprised that the possibilities feels better yeah how is this not landing i don't know youtube's been great though for uh just getting the content out there when it's new [Music] people care about it you put your thumbs up when you do it thank you don't worry don't worry next gen put it in the thumbnail game changer yeah it's actually i'm not that'd be great for thumbnails the new map is thumbs up from me [Music] oh it's the fight see what oh this will be it this would be scared to see one time this would be some hot infantry action yeah yeah it's like below two massive infantry teams fighting each other and at that moment he knew ah angel does it again uh someone's playing the new character uh yeah i don't know how they manage that someone's playing the new guys maybe they unlock them i did not think it was possible come on i think there's an invinci there's an invisible wall here where medics yes yes yes yes yes come on man it's done there's so many elements this game that are cool but yeah let down by so many other things that's it it's just a big playground it's great yes it feels sandboxy more sandboxing and stuff but also with like separate areas that i feel are all yeah i see the new uh rocket the new roster fired oh you just seen it so far man i need to get on another zippy yeah but can you stream at 1440p on twitch exactly that's the question it really is up a bit right they're right in quality settings they're just so behind you can stream at 4k on youtube if you want it's definitely more me me val but i think youtube uh chat is just more engaged in the content itself you know i think twitch is more of a good uh good community it's more about the uh the streamer than the gameplay i suppose thanks tuning in everyone hope you're doing well excited for some uh new battlefield content big or small it's a shame the only way to fix this issue though for logins is uh i wasn't gonna survive that remove the new weapons they're only unlockable in the battle pass as well which i didn't think would be a thing always above and you're right there's stud up top [Music] medic there are more up there though got another one another one up there i'm going to be i'm going to get zippy's ipcc where's the zipping zippy nice go here yes there's no way we might have liz unlocks after this round i think maybe we'll oh they're just giving free handouts now well done uh dropped a quaver and found my wedding ring bonus what the hell and there it is that was actually that was lovely yeah i mean russians are retreating out there now maybe well maybe we can just need to unlock it because that person already had it i saw someone i saw someone with the new character okay thanks missy someone said that the rocket was hard to control so the obviously you do too thomas voice is so soothing it can make you go to sleep yeah i don't know if that's a good thing let's see if it works [Applause] will it transition us effectively i unlocked i didn't understand that before all right hold on i think we can advance tears because i want to get all the weapons if i can i'm sure that guy just paid just paid to advance his tears maybe i don't know if you can though weirdly i can't do i need the origin overlay to buy coins is that a thing i feel like um maybe yeah that's annoying so it's like an apex anyway i think i unlocked her yeah i did you ruin it what how have i not unlocked her you got more i think did i get more points um i think this skin's part of the storm surge bundle crazy well how do you have the storm surge bundle no but i hovered over there and it says it about 50 times on my screen okay well i'm are you you're in my lobby yeah i mean you'll love me automatically reveal nearby enemy vehicles are damaged or hacked the problem is i can't leave the game in case i can't get back in again so yeah i can't buy this stuff i'll get the specialists in like a couple of a game level 10 and 11 the new hurley's huh right we're in another lobby i mean the map is good especially with 100 million players i actually felt like there was a ton of [ __ ] around like there was people everywhere not too many vehicles i didn't i think it would killed my vehicles like once doesn't nice nice hype for modern warfare 2 tomorrow absolutely limited it to one helicopter per team i think i don't know whether that's the same for 128 like one smaller yeah that makes sense so the game is playable now question mark um it's playable i mean my fps is better on this map as well for some reason i don't know why and it was i mean yeah it feels good i think it's probably because so many different parts of the level the russians wrongly allege that this has revealed a military weapon and are deploying forces on the canadian soil to secure it not on my watch let's send ivan home so i can't spawn on anything or anyone oh that looks cool yeah a little uh desk hologram thing i appreciate that megazanti i want someone accurate to do an audio book together yeah it is a cool map all right liz let's see what you're a bad he obviously can't stack rockets can you secure russians have sucked a fast drive fella is attacking let's try this rock out shall we oh yeah servers are definitely laggy that was an enemy i missed him rocket oh my god are you kidding me yeah i was in the rocket i'm the only one on c1 need help human i'm gilman like the spice just a normal man it's an innocent man okay they're taking c1 that's good didn't land a shot there we love that there's actually a bit of recall in this game oh yeah after playing war zone i'm just glad that that's the thing oh yeah they tried all right let's go around all right careful careful there's more on am i already out of ammo with like one last yeah that's mental that's holy we'll get used to this i'm used to firing guns and that was a control recoil you think it's enjoyable i mean there's was a lot of spread as well to be fair i like about recording the games it's just been so long since i played 2042 the last battlefield i played was ef1 and i used the uh the martini henry the hot the whole time oh martina was great a direct impact today guys here they're going for the no are they gonna go for the res hell yeah you can definitely notice the lag uh when you fly the rocket around escapes there's been so many players that just abused this rocket oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i imagine being a streamer somewhere everyone's target the stream i don't know where he is [Music] that was fast i think they're up there got to start securing sectors enemy has majority control my nike air shot what does that mean because it's in the air that's big brain objective captured healing [Music] there's health there as well if you need it anyone down here yeah i died completely around the corner like okay i mean i could be more around the corner [Music] this air is cool i actually love this yeah match revives the f3 vibe layout that's the damn thing outside there that's quite bright hey thanks for coming to member appreciate you oh yeah we got some lag on the servers this teammate can't see his name they are now clapping cheeks here yeah thanks for that nice name let's see the mouth all over again the server that's so weird it's like yeah making the full auto of my mp7 stutter imagine in real life i'll have to bring the sniper back out just so i have ammo to use [Applause] wonder thanks for the 10 yeah it took took me a while to get in update was supposed to go live at 1pm and then it went live at 3pm instead i had to remove the new guns in order to fix it half the content gone off the constant done new guns who needs them these guys coming from they're just dropping in just scrape the underbelly of that heli ally dodge this you okay okay i can't even wink soon now on c1 get him can you restock hammer with the no you can't you can't reach the rocket man excuse you mister my head all the things you said all the things you said running through my there's head so many people using this rocket i don't know how you didn't unlock the character i'm just bad i guess so sucks to suck oh i found the boost a boost was crazy you definitely cheese it to look around like areas to make sure it's safe first yeah i mean you can do i guess if you're in conquest it's quiet wow that's mental have you hit someone yet um yeah i've direct impacted them one on you yeah i mean you're stop them they'll take every sector they're ahead of me [Music] nice one nice one i'm more down there though i've got healing here nice yeah hey they just gotta team it down it was on the right side somewhere here that's right one corridor too what i definitely just got around the corner then are you kidding oh my god dude yeah the whole time are people still struggling to get in yeah well maxine said half an hour ago remember you now can i play liz yeah no i think you have to finish the match yeah the infantry combat is great yeah it feels good yeah just zoomed past him the first time is this fun allowed are we having fun you have to do something to unlock liz i think it's just level four in the battle pass right what's up it's all i agree guys sorry i'm popping off thomas what can i say i'm popping off yeah that's fair that's fair i just i just headshot clad two guys running at me with the revolver yeah um it's level four in the battle pass i think sorry i should say valerie when i've got two two vowels in the chat um you don't have to pay for the battle pass you get the unlocks just by playing this is battlefield this right here is cosmetics are also paid yeah it does feel like a battlefield game this map design is really good you can tell they spent some time on making it so there's so many areas that i enjoy oh my god that angel care package just saved that come on guy's life again i know you've got a little peeky hole there you can play your game if that's what you want to play oh he's going up that's it come on come on come on oh he's dead where are you you are i'm uh just next to d1 yeah there's people around you oh yeah view and stuff yeah they're right up here time you see that mark love you love you yeah see the mark i got i was just driving off the edge pick it oh that's a lot of snipers do you not like being called val valerie too many snipers i don't know if i'd say it's worth picking up in this state henry i mean the game still has a way to go before i mean you can definitely find some enjoyment but i don't think it will hold your attention for too long i think the uh what's it called the pass the ea play pass thing is a good idea if you want to play a bunch of games do you want them i won't fly a little bit yeah you you you don't get the crossbow to level 29 or whatever it is do i dare restart my game i don't know it's not worth it we'll take every sector is interesting [Applause] without dying actually tried crushing him tried to run him over that's been so long since i've flown that thing i was i was so good when 2042 first launched that felt so alien so alien only use the new helis man level 10 and 11 in the past it's definitely a good update i mean this this map alone they have like a 24 7 playlist for it which i appreciate it's the best map in the game 100 no questions asked watch out for the lmg lads above you time oh yeah they start there like they're ready above the tunnels yeah i told you i'll just i guess i'll just go on this zippy i then see him on that little strafe i did most sectors are now under our control support no i think i think oh there's one there's one marking oh the powersheet hey nice drop down [Music] let me kill you you're securing echo oh here we go oh so funny thread the needle with a rocket when i hit boost it's just like turned into a slideshow with a rocket i think i'm only dying around corners [Applause] out russians have control of most sectors we have down sector bravo echo one is being secured shoot me from down here somewhere it objective captured and secure our forces control most sectors damn so satisfying looks beautiful all right oh i need the melee what's the hell what happened just rockets oh yeah someone's gonna do oh yeah oh you would stop running when you i did the thing where you press a button but then i pressed another button and then it picked that even though i'd already you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah yeah i have a clue it's not the foggiest basically if you press if you press one thing and press click if not if it's too fast it's still through the other okay yeah yeah it's pretty sick if oh my god um and that's that's fine then just landed on me of this woof how can you play i played one match and they forced me out um i don't know man i guess we were lucky enough we were sat here for like two hours before we got in um and we've played two or three matches so far without any uh disconnects just some lag here in the match itself oh that would have been so easy they're making their final push had to meet my mic and i meet my mic with page down but look at this if i use my arrow keys most sectors are now under occurrence i can look around in the game who the hell wants that yeah i don't want to be able to see to be honest i'll escape the clear i don't get up here but it's horrible what the hell's escape why is that also up stop shoot me ow um is c1 then the vss is open you can't use the vss sss you can i think if you pay money right that does mean that i have to turn on the origin overlay to spend money in the game yes i'll try this watch this before you have and you get some credits for just having the ultimate edition no no right [Applause] i just don't want to leave and then it looks like ash from siege don't you think well this whole game is done yes this is sir [Music] [Applause] i've so you've unlocked the specialist but i haven't and i don't really know why you still don't have it no so i think something's broken for me so it worked last round and i got unlocked did you get any unlocks this time um hang on it works for the first game we played i just click return to menu that's not gonna make me leave the party is it uh no okay um yeah i don't know i just got it for getting level four in the battle pass what level are you oh i see i could do i could do some levels right i've got to get kills to stop regret it got it got it god i got it so i need to kill things with assault rifles and stuff oh there's actual requirements yeah there's like there's missions right i know you can't advance tears okay if i want a new gun you're gonna have to do i need to skip to that tier all right maybe i'll do that after this after this match oh oh no we got in the game and that is brighton it's by brighton he's brighton mate you're only supposed to blow the bloody servers off i'm sorry mustard i blew the blood you trusted me and i still blew the bloody doors oh blew the bloody service out what does it cost to advance 22 tiers can't even buy currency but the overlap bring that up oh the lady music's good oh yeah no it's my favorite part [Music] no study [Music] assistance there yeah we're needed let's move yeah sponsored or just trying to help no no not sponsored just want to try i haven't played battlefield in uh why does the game window go so tiny when you minimize that hang on just fixing my discord over there just seeing what it's all about but right now we can only play the new map i don't know if i mean i think you have to buy the buy the weapons i don't think you can unlock them right now i'm not sure at least that's what i was told because we couldn't get in for two hours nobody could um and apparently was because the weapons were causing some sort of issue so they removed them and then people would start playing and here we go again we're stuck in q limbo yeah it's a shame we got like two good games in there don't be sad this is just how it works out sometimes let's move don't be sad it's angel in reverse [Music] exposure canada i hear stuff yeah i know i was hearing stuff but and it still happened we might do it again don't be dice ah well there's your gameplay song you want a gameplay you got it oh this is that's her only there was a way that these issues could be solved if only sorry it's only been three hours since the patch went live i think i well i mean everyone had a great time watching the loading screen for a while yo look who's in the chat uh naked hd we have more cheap sex than tinder oh my god tommo is that your that's one of your biggest fans isn't it i'm one of their biggest fans they want boots on the ground wow there's almost as many tears in this battle pass as there were shed for the game when it hmm what do i say well a lot of the skins aren't ideal what do you mean ideal like snow and well you know i mean it's fine good ones i don't mind some of them they suit the tone better than you know santa boris for example santa boris was a good one yeah i love how she's just called liz liz you've got did you did you hear the emphasis i put on liz when i said no please like the queen new specialist lizzie philippe i've got the grayscale but not on my penis oh no that's a quality meme stud it is a good one it's a classic off the top of the dome here we go you could be there if you would liz gameplay just sounds so weird the other uh characters have like such unique names well yeah mckay angel um so memorable um john when do we start liz does it again dozer sundance i mean i suppose there is boris big blue buses casper the friendly ghost ral wait oh is people reading them out now and then liz nah i was just looking through the collection of my own specialists all right yeah here we go here we go here we go we're definitely going to get into this match definite gameplay definitely not getting your beard definitely not playing the song if we get the best no oh damn it you got you got your baited you can't play the game that's enough of that yes there's donkey head and brad [Music] adande there is boris badonde is his form another another hour of this and then uh that'd be dinner reckon yeah another lobby simulator among us she's got one of those slings on her on her right leg i mean we can try and do solo joins but i feel like it's the same [ __ ] uh yeah i think everyone's probably going through the same thing right now have you tried playing jack have you been in the endless queue at all are you just not fussed i think they have to remove the guns in order to get it working jack to at least allow people into the game oh no oh no who needs a gambling stream when you could just join into service and see if you get it i just i forgot how loud the uh the other don't be sad sample was and i played it with the cooks a lot muted blasted my eardrums out don't be sad this is just how it works out sometimes have they uh they tweeted again i don't know i've not looked as well let's have a look it's avaganda oh man blb all right they want boots on the ground do you want boots on the ground i just want boots actually yeah i do want boots on the ground no she's right she asked a fathered question there here's some um here's some vss gameplay for you guys yo that was sick this gun feels so good to fire let me try the burst mode fires four rounds in a burst that's crazy can't see down the scope though which is a bit weird must be a bug they're experiencing right now you're a poor pie man just shot you chat how's that feel uh sorry are you a pork pie man my pork pie man i like a pool pie you're having all the uh i mean i'm eating again because i think maybe if i ate a pork buy yeah you're having all these savory delicacies today carbohydrates yeah this is the zero recall build of the uh only 500 calories the bsvm guys sounds a bit weird probably not the sort of sound i would expect from dice but it's all right in it if the poor boy gets me in you're done oh let's go yeah no [Laughter] no am i in they want boots on the ground can we play the um single player yeah i mean yeah you can try price the enemies are in for densk they're targeting their own we need to find out why send fighters i can trust ghost out do we just test and see if we can rock it right he's got a hand on his arm as well huh tesla what this is discarded oh my god oh god just discard this man oh still getting persistent anyway oh great it is indeed irish too yeah what's my favorite breakfast cereal um probably crunchy nut what's your favorite breakfast cereal stud favorite breakfast deal um could be cinnamon cinnamon toast crunch oh wow i opted for um crunchy nut oh crunchy not corn flakes or the shreddies the cornflakes i don't know if i've had the shreddies before what they do crunchy nut shreddies oh they do crunchy not shredded wheat i think it is or is it crap okay i think they do just ready like weetabix yeah no no no no shredded wheat is different crunchy nut clusters yeah yeah did you have to did you used to say never eat shredded wheat to remember the orientation of a compass i mean i still do yeah yeah but do you know how i actually say it and say never east shredded waste because it's just way then i remember even quicker right because then north and south is easy it's the east and west that i get ruined the senpai is i can trust like liz i can't believe they just ripped off ghosts that's so funny someone just said this new content goes crazy because hard man goes hard it's hard to get into sick i mean this screams it's uh it's great three three hours and ten minutes thirty minutes of gameplay is youtube better than twitch for streaming uh youtube has more discoverability if you're if you're trying to grow stop people masturbating you won't really get any discoverability on uh on twitch so like if you're a new streamer i'd probably recommend trying something other than twitch or if you care about content it's a good idea to build up a an audience before you start streaming on twitch if that is the preferred platform view there's definitely more of a community vibe over on twitch and there's a lot of memers over there which is enjoyable um but you don't get like you know you've got really high qualities on on youtube you can stream at insanely high bit rates 1440p 4k if you want and have the internet that can do so switch your only limited to 1080p and really low bitrate like i can't really watch twitch streams anymore i've just been to my eyes are being too blessed you know i watch people that do like just chatting stuff mainly now i watched tio stream on twitch i watch stodd and like i don't know people like moist critical and some of those guys we've got a lot of naked hd clones in the chat today is it just one man with like 20 accounts come on mate try them all so we'll just ban them we'll ban them all at once get out of the way shall we yes it's bad now we can't get into games i appreciate you guys sticking with me it's we we had some fun for the out for the first hour of the stream we actually got some some good games i still i still don't feel like warmed up enough yet though it's been so long since i played this game i need to dial in my snipes a bit more but i don't really think i'm gonna get the opportunity i might have to make a separate video on this but the bottle probably stay up would you guys want to see a um a full let's play of uh modern warfare 2019 if i just stream the whole thing in one stint [Music] so i've highlighted a mission or two from that campaign but i've never actually i never put i did i did like a twitch stream for the player of that so i might just do a a nice uh campaign play through the youtube channel for anyone that hasn't seen it and wants to be refreshed all wants to be refreshed before but i'm all fair the second hey excel how you doing man thank you for the five the five uh this is the season one experience right here yeah i mean it's a struggle it's a struggle before you even finish your sentence yes i want that okay what do you guys think of the modern warfare 2 trailer i feel like it was just enough because they always do this they show the campaign trailer first it's like a teaser and then we get the multiplayer trailer and then like an in-depth multiplayer thing and all the in-depth stuff about the game i feel like it was a good first trailer just confirm what we already knew showed the direction of the story the graphics showed like the the scar or the h acr whatever that was in the first like second of the video ghost looks very weird though doesn't he i don't know i think that's just maybe just one of his outfits but he's got like this really crazy looking sort of gilly sue type thing like a uh what do you call it like a shmong i'm not sure what that neck thing is kind of like a neck scarf it's like the ghost mouth mask just looks like really elongated stretched out when you reckon beta will be out my guess is probably august under assassinations can't wait yeah that'll be cool not good for the content creators that i'll agree with yeah there wasn't much to break down but if you're in the um you know the details it did get revealed sounds really cool and it gives me hope too because there's a lot of stuff and there's a lot of modes which makes me think they're so happy with the the base game modes they've decided that they can branch out and make uh bring some new stuff to the table that siege mode sounds pretty interesting for content we'll see what that's like and then obviously we'll have warzone and uh dmz whatever it's called magic site you consider what happened to act man it can happen to any youtubers yeah i mean i haven't i need to watch like a full breakdown of it all i really like about man's content i love his videos he's so like honest and raw but yeah like i know what you mean like just getting silenced new developer tweets still working on it all right let's check the twitter battlefield we're needed let's move i'll show you some more um some more as well gameplay that's the full auto mode uh peter van thank you for the 2.99 man appreciate it have a coffee while you wait a bad shot you know i've got my water though i haven't eaten much today and i don't think it's a good idea to have um coffee on an empty stomach i do have my g fuel though code tomo heyo oh man stud yeah good gameplay right well yeah i'm getting some good stuff here um i've started eating a muffin to see if i can get him jesus how much food do you have on hand actually i've damn it i bought in some uh he's gone some some salami makes well if you've got the camera on make sure to squeeze it very slowly so that everyone can see what you're eating no no it's not like a

the last sort of 20 30 minutes we've been having these issues i did i was originally in the main menu but um we were queuing into matches so much that it bugged out and gave me a black screen so had to relaunch and now we're stuck in this again it's really really bad man it's not what you want i'm sure they're absolutely i'm like like crazy at dice studios right now let me check the steam charts for the game there are currently 6 581 people in the game trying to get in right now and when i checked when the servers first went live they had like 11 000 which means that initial interest has already died off which is unfortunate die but weird the one that's like it's a first person shooter rpg open world multiplayer what the barca making no not embark something else who was it nobody knows what the player counts account is for origin you can't track it i'm doing good preston thanks for asking how are you man it's now it's now getting a different error message oh is it i've been paying attention so the game broke right or the game was broken on launch and then they got it working again and then they added some stuff in and now it's not working again yeah look at what they did to our boy oh is it working no oh my god uh you can't play that one that was too loud minecraft you're doing who can do the best roblox death sound roblox i need to look out that was close sounds like an eight-year-old well that's the point yeah are we doing well i mean look what you made us do dice i'm actually having to be interesting god our stream is entertaining geez is why we have gameplay god yeah but you could you could do stuff on camera stud you could like a bit of a like a burlesque show maybe you could like get a little yeah little cane and swing it around your scotch egg just pick up the cat my most popular content was me eating as chegger yeah it wasn't my most popular con it was me in a cat earlier what's the check it's got a scotch egg it's just a chag isn't it sorry yeah but well you need the s don't you no but you know what i mean i've literally never heard that no he's taken the end of you know scotch egg a check just got rid of the skull egg it's just a check isn't it the jag i like it i quite like it i'm surprised it hasn't taken off by storm yeah but jack do you like do you like scotch eggs yeah i do love scotch right you might go to esco and get the soft serve ones because they're actually insane like ice cream no no no no it's not stuffed it's the the scotch egg 99. is that right it's a scotch egg but it's got a um a soft boiled egg in it instead of a hard boiled so like the the yolk is a little bit like cream you have to cook it no you just eat it they're they're they're literally the best they can explode in your mouth though if you put it in the microwave it will maybe scotch egg is the next isn't it gross no it's delicious i don't you don't you don't like runny eggs dude no i do but i don't know if i want to run any egg in my scotch but it's not it's no but it's not runny it's like it's still set but it's soft-serve set check i don't want to bite into it then it just explodes it's not gonna it like it stays the yolk isn't right that's like the yolk isn't runny there it is oh but just a little bit not it's not too much that it would actually like sound it hasn't yet solidified yes it's soft serve right not an ice cream though i don't know this is a good idea it's jack it's just basically like a warm scotch egg jack no it's not warm though yeah i do warm up though i put it in the microwave for 20 seconds not even warm dude what you want to take it home tesco doesn't expect to be warm straight out of the packet you've got a microwave greg's i mean you have to okay i'm gonna buy one then greg should do scotch

scotch greg please yeah would you like that [Laughter] you ordered me did you you know what's funny like the thing is is that scott with scottish greg's foxy greg's sausage rolls are actually good i

chicken bake the sausage bean bake is good are you just thinking about food now yeah just think about what i'm gonna eat after this uh thrilling and thawing um addictive gameplay loop cycle yeah at least we got an hour stored not many people can say that we did get an hour well people can ask about our experience with some light lag yeah yeah would you like to ask about our experience chat any questions from today's uh gameplay in the play tests obviously you haven't played battlefield 2042 so we've got the inside scoop for you chicken it's got like cheese in it tom doesn't it i don't know

like a white sauce bechamel yeah greg's here we go yeah it's special isn't it yeah chicken breast pieces and a creamy white sauce wrapped in puff pastry hmm that's their description a creamy white sauce made by greg it's not very his own white specific you know but you want to know exactly what's in the source um egg it can have a scrag please yeah would you like to try the new white sauce with that there's a recipe here give us a second got the pictures on your phone ah cream cheese and double cream there you go that was in it yep it is that's why that's what you're right whether you like the donuts or anything do they put donuts in there just definitely don't definitely don't try greg's cream fight oh the shop right i went in there last time and they wouldn't give it me oh that's crazy but then it was great great all the customers were like oh you made it scottish greg wasn't there yeah greg wasn't into the time they had none left they actually revealed the exact recipe during lockdown so people could create hd joins the chat oh naked you always say like videos all the time yeah they're really what's up naked hd are you sure such a great supporter he's actually got four different accounts with a different like a little bit of blurb at the end look over price tender isn't tinder free yeah no no no no do you have you not heard the mess on tinder now there's a meta right see in order and they'll refuse to get you literally have to pay to get matches now the colossal suppressor is the one yeah yes so basically if you want to be actually shown to more people you have to literally pay for advertising on tinder not kidding not kidding actually how it works i'm still not going so you're actually paying for a service well yeah wow at least you're in the main menu store and you can collect stuff yeah i know guys this is i mean you know everyone's loving this i can't bypass the satellite so i think what's happened is they've they fixed it somehow with multiple things and then they re-enabled something and now they don't know what they really they forgot which what it was yeah they don't know what button to play press play now play now play now someone's saying play now tomorrow play now oh oh you want to oh you wanted to play the game oh why are you sitting on the menu screen tommy that's so stupid obviously you're supposed to go and play the game oh if i'd have known [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i can't wait to watch jeff keeley later on yeah me too do they allow you to restream it i assume so he's usually pretty creative friendly but there might be content id problems or music or something yeah uh erico the game isn't playable they have some absolutely diabolical server issues and have done since the update first went live at 1pm it's now uh almost 5 p.m we had one hour of being able to play the game which is more than a lot of people were able to say because they couldn't bypass this screen connecting to online services and then eventually you get which is probably about to pop up now error code unable to load persistence data and you just constantly have to press ok and hope that the service gets fixed but evidently they have not yeah next can we have to stream up on on our own streams can we restream it can we restream it you slide into the dms all right jeffy can we restream it the thing you're doing tonight thing no they haven't tweeted since the last update have they tonight i think you would just unfollow me like straight away no no just do something normal okay all right no i'm not right jeffy um this is the last update chat they said we've seen a return of data persistent errors that are providing folks from playing again our teams had many of you back in and playing over the last hour which is what happened with me instead and our attempts to restore services have resurfaced the error we're now reverting these changes to get you back in so i imagine that we'll be playing again maybe within the next 10 minutes if it's just us like a revert for whatever changes they try to make at least did you see the last update um have they done it well they basically said that uh um they applied some sort of fix which obviously enabled us to play the first time and then as we were playing they implemented a new uh fix for server stability but that broke it so now they're reverting that change to get us back in and that was 20 or 30 minutes ago right because whatever they did the first time obviously worked but well this is basically just a podcast at this point it is yeah yeah what's our next topic um airline food airline food whilst you're on the plane or before yeah whilst you're on the plane obviously okay and i have a confession to make i actually like the scrambled eggs that are literally just microwaved i'm learning a lot about you and eggs it's today lot it's very i love it i love the weird weirdness of it yeah that was a good topic what's the next about how and how about that broccoli so you need to buy the extra dlc to play this all right gotcha next type of conversation why are adults not allowed on play equipment in the park i think you're allowed on if you've got a kid right yeah it's just a bit frowned upon isn't it to just walk by and see a 40 year old man trying to fit down a slide get his butt stuck i mean how big is the slide what's the hell well they're usually made for kids todd yeah but i i i mean it's usually like quite a wide slide you'd be able to get in yeah but some people can't get out you know when it's just a random turn they get stuck there you're allowed on but you also get added to a list there you go i'll see you joseph best new feature of modern warfare 2. i'll see you no need to spam probably swimming yeah of course you are valerie yeah yeah i've tweeted to him oh if you don't um i need to like and subscribe what's the largest animal you could kill with your bare hands hold on i wouldn't dare it's jeff yeah he's like hello westy said can he join i've just replied yeah but you can't play well he wants to join in uh the disco yeah yeah you come in why can't i see it welcome we're inviting a new guest to the podcast mr pro westy right welcome yourself let us know how you like your eggs it's very important don't think he's here yet max definitely i i went to click on somebody to just play jacket full volume onto it it's the way thank you very much for the 4.99 man appreciate it hey tom can you talk about the creative process of making the music video um i suppose i can i mean obviously you already have that stream yeah i already had that ghost cosplay um i've had it for quite a while and i did buy a few extra bits for the video um like the headset and some more like accessories whatever a lot of people don't actually think that is me but it is me uh shot against green screen um but in terms of the process it sort of just came to me as i was editing it i was looking through a lot of like warzone trailers and stuff to get footage uh and i don't know certain clips just work quite well like when i'm in the uh when price is obviously diffusing that nuke thing i was able to like match the lighting i've got like a various colored lights because i used to do photography so i've got a lot of photography equipment that helps a lot um i've also got a canon 5d which is definitely on the higher end for cameras but um i am quite into it so uh it helped it was able to look as professional as possible i was really really proud of that video probably more so than the song itself um just because it took so much time to put together and just it turned out better than i envisioned it's hard to really describe that process because it kind of just when you're in the creative flow it just uh just came to me and uh people seem to really enjoy it so thanks for all your support on that i mean i know it's not i'm not trying to be the next big rapper but um the important thing is is that the message seemed to resonate with people which was really nice and i wasn't expecting that sort of response in terms of the way it made people feel which is really cool you can stream on spotify now by the way if you were one of those people who were asking to stream the audio only so also sounds a bit better than youtube jack's on the phone you've been tempted to wear the ghost cosplay to shops no way absolutely not can you imagine walking around with like military gear definitely get get uh stopped by the popo a lot of people don't understand that i'm kind of trying to do like i'm trying to imitate a ghost voice in that as well you know like modern warfare 2019 ghosts they think i'm i'm like rapping too aggressively but yeah it's like kind of had had to be done for me to sort of sound like him it was supposed to be like i'm rapping from the perspective of ghost but i'm quite happy with it it took it took a few months to put together there was a few versions that were scrapped as well and it was all all produced by me like i did everything video editing lyrics um i had to make the beat sort of custom a lot of different samples and obviously make it so it wouldn't get copyright str copyright strike from uh marshall mothers himself can't talk this is bad guys i mean this is not a good look for them just gotta play the waiting game until they revert these changes i guess gameplay is so fantastic yeah it's great satellite gameplay space man simulator yeah that's it um let's move that around i'm back you make music allen i saw the uh amazing oh did you jeff said it was uh oh yeah oh he hasn't if someone said that apparently you can according to the twist or whatever it is oh right there's tos oh yeah if you look below the tweet there's the thing that says uh someone's linked it yeah yeah that's quite a nice skin actually for the k30 that's right it's one one out of a hundred can i co-stream it yes okay i mean it's going to be full content id music in there yeah yeah yeah just make sure you've got um on backgrounds in case to replace yeah yeah the game's still not working no no it's a really uh intense live stream going through the battle pass thank you very much tommy and everyone loving it can't even get to that late i don't know you're on like stage two of the boss dodd yeah yeah that's what i'm saying we were like thomas already back i'm just killing mobs it's like we're playing um what's it called uh what's the word i said what's the game getting over it getting over it i mean it was in the preview ball but the only thing i looked at was a stupid gnome oh and there was a skin at the end the liz skin it looks like something out of district 9 or elysium i remember that that's a cool helmet for uh what's his name uh thank you very much for the turn man field forward appreciate it i'm a truck driver and i had a ton of down time uh hang on youtube isn't showing me the full message let me scroll up a bit gotcha stuck in the truck board last week heard you talking about strain of things so decided to watch it all four seasons holy surprise that's not in the content id system you must have enjoyed man if you were if you stream that many seasons in one go wasn't too long ago tweeted about it but yeah man one of my favorite shows so good season four feels like the best season so far we've got two more episodes to come so it's not over yet they're releasing it in two parts so uh the first bulk of episodes you've watched for season season four on yet over there's two more to come and i think the finale itself is said to be like two hours and something minutes long so yeah it should be an interesting finale and then there's one more season to come after this and then that will be really good though 12 weeks we get kaleidoscope at the end of it no everyone's everyone's going through the same thing so 9th of september is when season 2 starts error field as arthur says error field is correct that's what we're playing right now did they say when in august or was it just one end of august end of august okay and then and then season two will begin and we might get another map that poor dude in the server room at dice trying to put out fires while dodging shots from ea execs legit probably not too far from the truth red doing the same on ps5 yeah it's for everyone it's just the servers in general everyone plays on the same servers because cross play why can't people get into a game um do you think they'll whip up any surprises for this season they're just having server issues right apparently they haven't whip up some servers they haven't talked about the problem yet apparently it had something to do with the new weapons and then they're going to put the poor guns in well that would be nice yeah no it would have been good for this season yeah hello hello he's found us austie all right westy how do you like your eggs um erid do you think about scotch egg i'm i'm not really a fan what if the egg inside was the podcast um if it was soft boiled jack and a bit runny would that change your mind you said that so it's a check is it is it warm it's not like you've let it get cold well you can put it in the microwave if you want call ourselves the chagans i mean actually i'm just i'm just not really a fan i knew it oh that's [Laughter] so for the last 15 minutes on my stream i literally blew up the word error on my stream uh found the battlefield 2042 theme song put it to 100 volume and just blasted it on my stream put my chat on the screen and just told them to spam and and that gave me a chat right up let's go baby we hit 2400 chat rate wow yeah so that was great and i'll probably make a little video later put it on twitter and that's my experience everyone spam dice please in the chat let's go here's the way thank you for becoming a member man i appreciate it and winter summer thank you dude what would you rate the uh what would you rate this update out of five what would i rate it out of five i'm asking your chat channel those are well i'm in the chat from this side i'm in the chat one two three i'll give it a one point four five eight nine three four five divided by sixty three there you go that's what i give it equals pain yeah the chat is now minus 1700 apparently square root of dog just came from westy's stream between your error messages now a little bit yeah i i wonder what's happened have you have you gone through the stages of absolute incredulity or have you just been simmering at the top of it yeah we've been sort of riding the wave um they did they did tweet did you see about 30 minutes or so ago yeah that's what was that the one saying they're going to revert something yeah basically they had the fix that enabled us to play the first time then they tried to implement a new fix that would work for most for like everyone else and that one that one brought back the persistence data issue so now they're averting that change but in reverting that change it seems to be taking them longer to get back to the position that they should have been in basically panic patching and it's breaking the game further i mean at this point i said this on when i was with broken i think i'd just be in favor of them you know pulling the plug i think it might be worth it i genuinely think it might just be worth it i mean even to what end well it will allow people to heal move on emotionally repair well okay what so refunds then wow i mean that's up to you to decide but i'll tell you what i'm i'm gonna with i i feel like i'll just withdraw myself after this because it's just it's not it's [Laughter] [Music] naked hd we have more cheap sex and tinders just join the chat let's go [Music] my chat is just filled with people saying the word error we have more cheap sex than tinder what does that even know what tinder is did you know that tinder's pay to win now is it really pay to win yeah it's got meta and everything it's paid to play jax pay to play hate to play yeah i paid to win actually really okay to survive did you see they came out and refuted the claims that there's a skeleton crew by the way well i mean um but i think they i think they might have made a mistake responding to that yeah they needed to chuck more devs at this game like three months ago well this is the whole thing they're they're literally caught between a rock a hard place a stinging nettle bush and a giant hornet's nest giant egg a giant that is the best part about playing the cycle is there is literally a giant egg a giant egg can you ask jack if he's having a good day we asked him earlier and he's been sat staring at this screen the same way we hurt her all have since 1pm so i don't really think i need to ask um you know first of all problems chat you know first world problems we can complain about this but ultimately it is sad because we all enjoy battlefield but um bigger problems at least we're here we're vibing we're chilling got the boys in the chat you're listening to an unscheduled podcast and i'm playing error simulator and what i expected to do today but um i've had the worst days forever okay i think i'd go simple like a bacon and egg sandwich or something sorry what we're talking about every day are we talking about every day an egg sandwich uh we're doing come diamondly one one meal or one item a food store one is one one meal food that you have to eat the rest of your life on this island right okay um that's actually quite a difficult one too i'm saying yeah i think maybe like a jambalaya or something why why so specifically you've got because you've got your like your chorizo in there you've got your rice and your spices and your you know something it's a bit more of a balanced meal than a can i just every day that's a bit bland not really protein you've got protein you've got bread yeah what else jack i mean you just described it you've just developed you've just deserved an analogy to gluten i mean it would keep you going wasn't it for the day until then you get a little bit later in the day you're like oh can't wait until that next bacon and egg sandwich kill a bacon egg sandwich my chat's coming out with some good ones cheesesteak billy cheesesteak sub what you'd want what you'd want is a meal that you can sort of deduct items from when you crave a certain part of that meal more than the rest i mean why would you not have a fry up if you would give if you're given this option jack you just get really fat won't you but you can you can pick and choose is my point i i'm really you don't have to consume the whole meal couldn't you just say i want i want a subway sandwich with everyone in it there would be a lot of empty empty plates on the island though i mean i didn't guarantee a plate but then eventually oh no you have to eat it without a plate but with a plate just in yeah and you have to catch it with your hands and then eventually you know a few years ago underneath the spawn point of the bacon egg sandwich every day yes mouth wide open ready for it to no but what no i think it's that you're trapped on a desert island and the only thing they're giving you is they're dropping it out of a helicopter why can't the helicopter come down and pick you up no because i'm saying it's true they don't like you yeah all the paper plates just woven together into a fabric yeah they're just yeah right i'm out of it yeah that's right that's what i do how about you you have a piece of food that has a seed in it that you could grow on the island i if they're delivering you a meal every day then i'd like a bag of seeds give me a massive bag of seeds for my meal yeah all the different types of seeds i want barley in there maize i want apple pips so i can grow an apple tree oh you know what maybe you'd ask for something like that expands in water i was gonna suggest like puffer fish for breakfast please that's some prawn crackers [Laughter] if you put prawn crackers in water do they get all mushy just disintegrating yeah you could like could mix them all in and like create like a little soup a soup of a prawn cracker soup that does not sound good imagine cold water as well cold salty water because you're on a desert island i'll see ya oh chuck we're really stuck in limbo now how long is it going to take them to implement this fix right i'm streaming until every single viewer is left i'm getting more viewers why yeah because because people are coming in they're just like oh wow oh you're playing i mean my title i went for a sarcastic title battlefield 2042 is amazing news should have put amazing in quotations people won't understand it though cameron i know but to be fair most of the people that didn't understand it got curb stomped by the rest of my chat that did understand it yeah so it's fine i just let it happen they should blow up last night they won of their own accord that's all i'm going to say you guys have you how have you not been able to get into a game at all i know you still played for an hour or so okay so yeah same as me i managed to get two matches in and then they flicked a switch click flick and it worked and it ruined it didn't it yeah yeah and then poor jack he's just been there just like knocking at the door i'm just existing today you've been you've been knocking at the door now for over four hours jack i remind him he's out he's had a long few days connecting to online services it's fine we've got mw2 soon guys come on come on the story is of this by the way i've got night like why is there a telescope in the sky because this is if you watch the first ever cutscene that plays when you first launch battlefield 2042 it shows this part of the cutscene and then all they've done is add when you zoom in on the telus on the telescope thing uh it just shows the map so that's the only real like new part of that cutscene that's been added but i really usually commentate over this uh no well there should have been but they didn't name all of that didn't they they literally stopped posting those tweets about all the lore and everything because everyone's screaming because then angel gave [ __ ] and you came in and ruined it for everyone don't be sad angel doesn't get it that's gone now though they've they've removed them haven't they still remember disabled the voices yeah they're disabled temporarily yeah because there's no way we'll get it back every record yeah but that's what i mean why bother just leave them off who cares who cares i can wait oh do you know what they should they they should sell us as specialists [Applause] i won't buy any of you you go you go what um what would be your voice line actually they've already added me hang on my name is wish from wish ghost i'd be hang on that would be me yeah jack if you were a specialist what voice would your quip be a giant egg yeah it would be that i don't think i'd have one you'd you'd be like masked up the entire time jack not a giant egg john no because only you know that's a meme for us doesn't it no no no no no no no no no no no no no everyone knows now i don't ever put that in one of my videos ever you haven't put it in what come on no i don't think giant egg's ever been there no he needs no it has it has time it was in it was in i remember the video because i was playing we played the some sort of modern uh war zone thing and there was like a bunker and there was like a golden egg in the middle of it and then we just kept saying giant egg i think you live streamed it yeah right and tommy what would what would be your uh specialist voice sign um something from your recent something from your recent song [Laughter] i will catch you legends in the next one ah there it could just be dice please jack that would be good yeah that's a good idea but you don't you don't say it you can just hold it up on a piece of paper it's like it could be an emote like dice please and you can just stand next to the ensuing chaos behind you you know the smoldering game that you're playing you see all the new ones check whenever he throws an aid up check out oh god the camaros has got like little animations now for the hands do you say that yeah we we tried it if you say thanks you give a little thumbs up wow that's definitely a feature that i care about meanwhile we got one map let's get stuck in it's so sick uh what about that hey what's up the free to play experience someone pulled up a tweet of mine from january 2020. i'm not sure about that we'll try again says feels good going into this next battlefield game knowing it can't possibly be worse than the last one did you say right right right yeah did you say that the tweet's literally right there from january may yeah and then i just quote tweeted it and put oh dear i did it and i don't even care i don't even care anymore i don't even care that i look like a complete [ __ ] because at this point i can point to dice standing next to me and be like he looks worse at least has his zone was good [Music] right i'm literally not kidding i'm going to start making a pie ella at my desk [Laughter] i want to bring this up i want to see this how do you make a pie ella how many viewers have you got three and a half thousand if you've watched this deep into the vod not the stream the vod what are you doing you're to move the camera stud you're going to let us show why you've got a piler well no i might as well we're just waiting aren't we you're just going to chop them i got them in oh my god i'm in i'm ready take the ingredients back back in the fridge this study's got work to do wait you're gonna make it from scratch i was gonna come here i mean i mean it's working yes yes guys it was all the way is over i'm in a queue to join my god yes well that's such a shame i think people genuinely wanted uh i really wanted the point next time you're gonna save it you have to save us at the end of the stream right okay uh yeah i've got a chat i've actually got a chat thing in the corner so i can see that oh wait this isn't good my mad dog squad and i'm not in the squad the people in the chat are like impossible impossible in the in-game chat oh five seconds i mean i'm in i'm into i'm getting the voice comment everything [Applause] oh my god we're actually in a video game right jack how are you doing i can't believe they added rainbow six yeah okay okay okay i'm with stodd i'm with start in the middle yeah hello i'm actually in a match they disabled it because it would be a really really really bad look right all of my memeing with the chat was worth it flashing up big susan's face on stream as well put big shoes on yeah big zeus flashes up on the screen sometimes you know just a little jump scare my favorite ceo no we don't want a board mission yeah you do tommy no no i almost just playing poser who am i playing oh yes so am i that must be the default character oh god it is a bit laggy though lads uh it's not for me that's fine it's fine it's fine my shade of cash is fine because i played the map twice yeah the uh the intro cutscene thing was yes we're in boys we did it we survived the onslaught i run out of fuel fuel [Music] is it like the operation metro looking place yeah it's where all the servers are yeah oh yeah where is that where they're on fire when i went in there maybe they looked at you and they were like wow there we go yeah this is the server room they're all red let's go oh the heli pretty cool isn't it there's a guy in the left on that guy on the left go on the left charlie no wait when he must have gone he must have despawned he's been kicked by have a wonderful time it's a little bit laggy this feeling i get how long does that summer game fest show go on for tonight do you know it's usually a couple of hours at least just be on twitch chat um you gonna stream on twitch or youtube what i don't know i'm thinking about doing that on youtube oh it's you definitely should do it on twitch yeah you could try did that copyright straight uh left there yeah i saw it nice [ __ ] man yeah that's crazy got wrecked by the automated system did you just copyright trolls uh on my video yesterday oh what that sucks but how what is that is that because yours was a highly watched video and so they thought ah i'll cash in we'll capitalize on this man's work i understand why it's an automated process to review this stuff but at the same time like i think you've got to look at it at like certain channels with certain stature like your channel's probably never had a copyright strike well maybe if it has it's probably going to be like thank you thanks for coming a member man nine months in a row that's crazy i appreciate it now you can't just make it fly says nine months for me not seven no thank you man that'd be too easy a little bit sweaty there is a um there's a trailer for the last of us we make on ps5 no way come in september on ps5 and then later on pc it looks really good i don't know if that's leaked oh there's a car you see one they're taking c1 oh no we must get it back turn the wings against us gameplay an gamepl stressful amount [Music] you're lucky that ends on e2 or i don't know where the men are start i need to round christopher yeah you do have zip lines and stuff that's the best thing yeah i like the fact that in this game you can just get on the zip line and like there's no animation like where you have to like lock yourself in or anything there's no one up here direct impacted that sob i managed to crash my own mods um youtube app on their phone because there was so many chats going through that he was trying to deal with it couldn't handle even being into let's go and so i call that a major victory royale wow that sounds disgusting same game so i can't like react i tried to react to your call out oh he's gone upside down and he's killed himself oh no a boost man so quick you can't really like readjust okay there are many men in there what was that it's just one shot right jakku you're not in the same lobby no well we can just on the menu is now secure i want to buy the i want to buy bones before i play you want to give dice your money is it like is it going to let you there no like if the show is only like a couple hours i'll just stream about after after the show you know hopefully it'll be a stable then angel did it again and he killed me you get a ea play member discount as well i don't know how much though uh come on probably probably ten yeah anyone fancy playing you know get their numbers up right no one's actually seen the rocket maybe oh i can't unlock it i am do you think it will be on steam [Music] when you say tonight jack it's already five o'clock you know people start to come home so they have to have it fixed by this evening because otherwise you know it would have been mega terrible yeah but the americans won't really be up yet will they he used the basic group the heavy the guinea pigs why is this got kaleidoscope written on it i don't say that this bus thing here that i'm looking at it's got kaleidoscope written on it kaleidoscope is the name of a company oh so part of the law that we don't know anything about yeah we know nothing about fantastic oh let me add that to my journal oh you're gonna keep track of that here yeah air booking is empty at least we're playing chat at least we're playing i should kill myself with the c4 i'm installed i'm holding the tunnel so you haven't actually unlocked the rocket gal yet she's on the battle pass yeah but still has been having it for some reason it's because they disabled the actual unlocking uh and for some people it like it broke for me it's working i can actually unlock stuff i'm allowed to you know play the game and enjoy the content the little amount of it that they could you added if each of the maps that launched this game played a little bit more like this well yeah i mean that's what i said even if specialists have been in at that point that's a good launch map hasn't this been the launch round yeah why is it that all dlc maps seem to be more memorable than the base map because they've learned what people want this would have been such a good beta map but then it would have over promised when they say they've learned what they want by that point battlefield has had previous games that they could you know use yeah fortnight we bout to get down get down get damn oh and rocketed up the anus i smashed that heli so hard oh i need to get in a helicopter and go two kilometers that's how you unlock the characters by using the battle pass names might be our government watcher scorch egg oh god there's loads of men oh god now being shot i'm being shot in the ass yeah we'll say that have your ammo as well just no scope someone on the zipline oh baby let's go huge hoggers in the chat need a helicopter tonight i forgot it's a brutal expectation to expect a decent launch map i guess i should reel it back in you know when talking about triple a development studios i didn't realize it was difficult any more men here right there [Music] i need this isn't a helicopter it depends does it look like a helicopter no it's a condor but it does have propellers she's literally in the side of the mountain she's prone in the mountains [Music] do we still not have we still don't have damage indicators for how much damage you've done to stuff no we still don't have that for vehicles or infantry see i would have preferred that rather than stupid flourishing animations on the coma rose that nobody uses imagine that how is that not hitting i'd love to know how far away my marksman headshot was who can play that game love love all right guess not hell yeah spawn on c1 let me know if you see let me know if you see a helicopter as well but that's not what i want i see a helicopter but it's an enemy helicopter you see yes but i need a friend he's in the sky it was on that no we got a condor we're in a different game in the sky all in different games oh that is so cool playing a sundance in this map by the way yes yeah it's a good sign that's man sure being beamed by a hind i think you're cool sundance doing your flips on the side of a mountain i got an idea boys let's use the rocket what's a fail [Laughter] [Music] you threw it no it was like a javelin it just dragged me across the map as i was trying to get off we're just normal man normal man normie all this streaming today and i've got like less than an hour left before i've got like stop now because i've got stuff to do dice please you've ruined my dive i'ma have to do like the uh the video like you do it i think it creates a different video timeline i think it stops it being alive then it breaks yeah it depends if it's processed or not if it's processed it can save and it's the same video but if if it's not processed it will save it as a new video right okay so if you leave it for a while and then come back to it epic i might do that because it's a lot it's a different ui as well cam it's really weird yeah okay in the dashboard we were gaming then a few kills on the tower though just like ping pong kills on the board right now yeah just walked out to mailtown all on my own pulled out tomorrow nobody help me i'm liking this map have you seen have you looked at any of the new um cosmetics and stuff like there's a couple that are fully unlocked already like i've got an m5a1 skin that's got like leaves all over it yeah i saw that leaves i am leaf this is called it fighting for c1 by the way when you're in the little conference room really cool such a cool area such a cool area holy crap everyone's having 1v1 rockets there's not as much of that going on in our server it's more strategic strategic in the wrong place don't you dare delete the podcast tom okay i'll just uh i'll do time stamps for the people watching afterwards then shall i like gameplay podcast gameplay oh there's a man there there's about seven men on that objective oh the rock in the way that boost is so fast it's the same the hud is a lot better i don't know what they've done they've changed where the loadout stuff is at the bottom jack on the right a dark coloring behind the icons so you can see it yeah that's good contrast i will say that the hud on the bottom right and the hud on the bottom left they don't look similar enough they look like they're two completely different styles but again that's just a real nitpick because it doesn't actually matter that much better than not being able to read it yeah holy that ain't gonna work yeah i like this map it's cool just wish there was more of it and more like it yes we'll just have to wait for the next game what about the next season in august what about it will we do this oh yeah we're going to do this all over again boys just have to hold it nobody if nobody only one map next season then i don't know what's there well i didn't know what to say when it was one this season thank you thanks thank you thanks thanks for delivering the content you promised i'm actually getting it right this mini flank around onto the platform is pretty cool pushed him out angel sang hell do it again angel i dare you do it again angel angel does it again oh angel does it again angel does it again there's people in my chat saying that there won't be a season two like i think they're legally obligated to do the full season they won't do any more than four you can absolutely guarantee that there is no way they will do more than that they'll do exactly what they did with bf5 but maybe in season four people are like oh look you fixed everything and then they go right plug pull see you later bye have a great time see you in the next game right now we go back to the main menu and hope that we get four seasons oh i should have been a trade there that's annoying right tomorrow if you want to you can evacuate into our lobby yeah we're going back into the lobby in precisely okay two seconds if i get my leaving game i'm leaving game that's a walk back towards us stop we were the best squad we were great hug nice to see the kill cards still not working properly the tender menu oh wow they've added a round of applause when you finish the game now it's crazy wow how patronizing right we're in the lobby yes yes i've unlocked it all right nice send us some send us an invest there you go i can do it uh tom o'graphic invites smash hold on hold on angel does it's it's not unlike the character have you done the helicopters yeah i did that it's lit now when i go to the battle pass the character's gone is there to be no one there is there no one on it there's no one there it's just nothing after my uninstall reinstall start do it now oh my god liz more like left right uh are we ready to uh i was muted this is really awkward how do you unlock liz more like left how did you unlock no no no no no no no no we're not restarting again they didn't they didn't even get at the second time maybe maybe it's not enough maybe i'm only a little yeah i'm only level three maybe or something i don't know hey no no it's fine fine we'll just we'll just play another round these are my friends right so you can't buy did you realize guys that in the store you can actually buy indiv individual items instead of whole things yeah jack said it cost like 200 and something on quid to buy it all including the uh yeah yeah but then you could look at modern warfare store and be like that customer am i going yeah the leader right follow the leader so if i bought in the store if i bought the pack that had the crossbow in it yeah that's only a skin so is it locked until i unlock probably the same way as well no come on surely not i do that don't you right look if i but you can oh i suppose if you buy the blueprint you can use it yeah yeah but you can't like here it just says it's a weapon skin because it's overlaying on top of the the crossbow because if that's the case and people buy it and then they can't use it that's gonna be really really bad quite that's quite confusing right isn't it oh no no no no no your thanks uh alessandra yeah i needed that i needed that what's the new meta gun then uh the valve probably reporting in well now has anyone got it yet probably not no none no no can't buy it can't unlock it paint in the canadian facility

that's crazy come on sorry he's a bit late no message and an insane donut you got it you wonder yeah you got it one like i won the game from mike ryan thank you mike honest opinion on caesar passing gameplay people are going to carry on playing 2042 as of right now we're going to enjoy it it'll be enough to hold them a little bit longer as well but i think season two is september right so i don't know man for the wider baffled audience who were hoping this would be more they said they're going to add the portal guns over so i might if they're if they're quick with that and we get all the guns from previous battlefield games that are in portal um at least the modern ones you know i think that could help bring some people back just because people want more guns but uh yeah they should definitely keep this 24 7 playlist really fun this map flows so well you rank up can you play now money no not yet no you can't yeah no that's what i mean like i want to but it's great i want to give you money dice please i want to make a video i've got 50 people apparently ultimate ultimate edition owners don't get the battle battle pass the battle pass the better you get the pass i just don't think you get the ultimate battle pass what yeah uh i know maybe you do because i've got those rewards no you must do yeah that's what i was thinking and like i've got i've got like the green burst um assault rifle yeah cool skin guys yeah i must have it's just um that's what i thought well do you not have that well let me have a look i go because you guys have the ea play thing yeah but ea play pro and the ultimate i've got both of them because i got given a code so i just put it on my origin account squad reporting in ash from rainbow six siege reporting in so if you get you get those the four battle passes one per season three epic skin battle and three epic skin bundles yeah you do get the battle pass yeah you do like that's yeah you do get the premium battle boss that's really confusing yeah anki you're right there are a lot of people all right we're in who full cent on the game we're in for more fun some people will like the fact that it's just not played by many people you know because it allows them to cut like you can just literally live your life on that little platform bit and just fight around there which is great it feels a bit like locker but with outside like you know you can move between yeah no i think locker is the best comparison right not dama van peek mixed with locker yeah yeah a little bit with the diving because you can jump off stuff yeah all right my fps is insanely low now uh okay yeah what the hell's happening hey where are you guys you're 18. uh yeah yeah yeah i mean looking at some not one person captured here just looking for a

that's a little spicy yeah some kind of avalanche would have been sweet on this yeah like a rock fall yeah that would be so good i think it might have been too much with 128 you know yeah no vehicles oh nice one where are the vehicles to kill i've got a challenge see if you can get it all the way through the inside of the tunnel and spoon it into c1 like a heli flying challenge yeah give it a go i'll give that a shot i've done that a few times looking down [Music] i just they're on the right side of the back back of the thunderbolt he's dead another one to the right ah they're all dead oh god

right oh yeah all right yeah yeah yeah okay i'm going outside i'm going across the zip boys let's go you're mine be careful oh man that was messy more people down there careful down there i'm gonna i didn't realize they put more beats in the game yeah it's a movie easter egg oh there's so many here guys yeah i'm gonna throw out a little revealer push right push there's literally bodies everywhere there's more are they in the other tunnel further along yeah i think so no no yeah the close right side as well maybe so where he is yes there's like 10 people oh my god [Applause] actual fun so basically the 24 7 playlist needs to stay up 20 forever yeah basically this is the only map they deleted all the other maps this would be fine i mean imagine if every map was like this yeah it would be a different experience entirely a bit different imagine there's running around in the open kills again no crapping no crapping no crapping right spots on maps i got time for one more as long as it's fine [Applause] two games two games and they tried to change it again [Music] it's not down oh god okay how about we deploy the same fix it didn't work let's do it how many hours do you have in this game one one hour i have zero hour 125 hours all right okay so you do all the missions right you guys give you loads of yeah i've probably done loads of that vehicles destroyed i need to do distance in helicopters need to revive some teammates i need um to piss okay yeah i need to get something for you guys before the uh the show starts done i'm gonna dip out yeah that was really fun though thank you i'll be on tomorrow [Music] world premiere [Music] okay yeah i can do one more all right hopefully it'll let us in so um if the screen goes if it's done then i'm and then i'm done i think that i think that's how i'll i'll put it i think they're they're just like poking the bear to see if the bear will attack and it has yeah it's just standing by for me this is uh yeah like unable to load persistence data i can error again well i think it's safe to say maybe just maybe they should just not do whatever they've just done i think the whole point is uh stodd that they can't um there's loads of people who haven't even been able to play and so those people have just like they've not even been able to get in at all i think susan did it big sus in the chat era yeah stodd i think this is done ggs i'm going to make a pile oh great on stream we wait for tommy to come back from a piss otherwise we'll just yeah he might want to do some more i don't know if he does it's not working don't worry i'm going to try a couple more times yeah okay you never know you never know with this steve okay so today i've been streaming for three hours 15 minutes and i have played precisely four games i played three was it or was it four i think we both about four stars before okay i've now my game's hard crashed my game just hard crashed directx error yay i think i'm done guys i am a direct sex sarah please help me thanks for sticking with us today chat i do appreciate it and get to the error because it's all being here oh my god it's been uh an interesting day half of this stream has basically been a place you officially made the worst performing update you've ever made i think wesley said i've been streaming for three hours i've been streaming for oh yeah three hours and eighteen minutes i'm gonna load back in just so that i can i don't i don't think it's working somewhere with battlefield in the background we're calling it there then yeah now zero are we ending it there yeah i'm gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna see and see if we can get another one and then if i can get one more if he can get one more one just one more and i'll uh all right i'll uh i'll i'll stick it out with you yeah if i can't get back in because my game just crashed i'll know that it's broken so and i'm just gonna you know i think so hanky yeah i think so one more time of like smashing keyboards well apparently you might get in if you restart westy allegedly the advice was to restart your game if you get the persistence error if you restart your game you get the persistence error oh you can't even log in now this is unable to load persistence data we are stuck in the me in the limbo and i think that means that i can play music yeah on my stream right guys i'm gonna call it but thank you so much we had some fun love you bye bye bye all right chat well um i think we'll play this one more time because it's uh it's just uh quite a good example of today's experience but we had fun fun was hard [Music] when we actually were able to play the game it's a good update but um there's not a whole lot of content we didn't get to use the new guns so apparently there was a problem with those that was part of the issue why uh the game wasn't working they had to like disable them temporarily but regardless they're pretty deep in the battle pass so you have to uh spend money if you want to advance that uh you actually can't buy anything right now you can't even buy the battle points to buy the to advance the battle pass which gets confusing and i've got this endless black screen now so we're gonna end it here uh but yeah i do appreciate you all watching um shame about the issues today i was literally waiting two hours before i could even start the stream and then we had about an hour or so of downtime in the middle of it but there was some good content some good memes good uh good chats with the guys as always that's a good banter you excited called metal warfare too absolutely man it's gonna be a beer game on the channel what i like too is that we're not getting war zones straight away i'm glad we're gonna have like some time to just enjoy the base multiplayer for a bit play through the campaign definitely be doing that and uh if you weren't here earlier i'll probably be playing through the modern warfare 2019 campaign um some point in the next sort of week or two um might be a good idea to get that up and uh yeah just re-experience it again refresh my memory of the campaign for that so i'm ready for model for two story and you know stream it for those who haven't played it and don't want to install more space for modern warfare in that game because it's already so massive uh but yeah have a good day guys whatever you're up to good day good morning good evening whatever it is and uh yeah
