running animations a bit oh there's a guy just [ __ ] camping there waiting with a heavy watch you get domed when you come around that corner i'm coming he's no no don't peek him no no i'm gonna take him on i'm gonna run straight down this train and drill him get him somewhere he's he's peeking me he's dead he's dead he's dead correct idiot silly billy fan i mean it looks better than battle bit but there's only there he's only maximum 32 players right i think that works for this game the size of the maps like this isn't full metro is it it's like this is a part of manchester united i think they should focus all their maps on close range you've got this actual player i thought it was you you melee can you melee what are you doing what did i just witness dude i don't think he ran around in circles shooting the floor so this my friends is polygon a free-to-play game on steam that just got a new update and is guaranteed to give you at least an hour or two of fun the most unique thing about this game as you can probably tell is the art style is very similar to that of battle bit remastered but the lighting and models are a bit more detailed and shiny we've seen quite a few low poly shooters pop up over the years and i don't actually mind it i think it allows smaller dev teams to put more time into refining gameplay instead of favoring style over substance which is happening way too often lately you know good graphics and next-gen features doesn't necessarily mean good game so polygon said scroll of that and they put all of their time into refining the gun play making it a fun experience for everyone and it's free the gunplay itself even rivals some aaa games that i've played it's actually really satisfying there is a little bit of a grind to unlock new weapons and attachments but i don't really consider that a bad thing it gives you something to play for and there's no paid progression or any of that bs i personally like to keep games like this in my rotation especially now when first-person shooters aren't exactly dominating the gaming space i've got some gameplay to show you now playing with my friend stoddy so leave a like if you enjoy the video subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one here we go five four three two one i refuse to play money look at that throw animation oh god what have you done this i wasn't sure it was gonna kill me you've taken the meme too far nobody gets to kill me for myself down there they're down there yeah yeah that's where they spawn stud it's kind of how this works oh is that the is that the map yeah one team spawns for the south one i think we're supposed to kill the bad guys yeah apparently red glow sticks mean bad and green means good yes if you didn't know like everything you know the bad guys wear the red glow sticks and the good guys wear the green clothes in real life are we pushing all this i don't know oh god that guy's jumping around like a maniac i think the map needs to be a bit longer it's too easy to do the whole spawn trap thing you know yeah guitars delete us i missed i think that one went in yesterday i killed him i'm not just staming her again oh he didn't expect the flank did he no he did not oh god reload reload reload you guys need to stop pushing that doorway i'll tell you what hello welcome to it was the big oh my goodness it's like chris parent sounds a little bit like goofy sounds like one of those uh you know those like sticks ago i think i think you could do a good cross between chris tarrant and goofy like oh look there's a there's a good mid ground there hello and welcome to it was to me oh doing that with me chris started [Music] uh oh i thought it was so hard to get through that without laughing me oh chris i feel like wrong with this so i mean he sounds like i've got like cold you know sticks you turn upside down i mean it just sounds exactly like hey wait if that was a voice effect sorry that's what i said chris harrison oh my god dude i killed two i died though to a frag grenade after a frag right as i died no no no okay i'm waiting i'm on you know that guy nice nice they're coming up down the stairs soon okay i'm taking this uh right flank it's like a delay to sprinting it's horrible i'm gonna try and wait at the bottom of the stairs here yeah just killed hog rider oh god i made a big mistake jeez man they're all going to start flooding down the staircase now i'm dead oh this spot's nasty you're actually dead yeah okay i'm gonna wait for you oh oh god i'm behind there did you spawn he's on the left still behind the column hog rider right side another one they both leaked at the same time yeah i was there too long i killed like five of them and they were like yeah we're not having it now piss off mate you need to reposition a lot but like it's hard to do that in the ttk so fast beaming from downtown it's left side flank so flank though it's really good to get right into the spawn wow yeah absolutely host very satisfying like it's very it's very smart the combat does feel good and rewarding beaming someone like across the map as well with an m4 yeah how many maps does this game have you know um it feels like scene two or five all right well i mean i want to play another one soon i mean this is a good way of leveling up our guns quickly because as i said the other maps are quite open you know what is missing when you run through this gate and it goes yeah you know what that would make the game at least guy in the little in between bit another one on the stairs i'm dead wow the most flawless running animation you've ever seen oh nice i got those stairs oh yeah yeah yeah let's go this they can run out of this spawn moving moving checking left being shot by our own chicken wing nice shots nice shots got the other one there we go can we get further back here kind of he's so i mean he's coming around the corner i spawned in time perfect he's pushing now pushing now should be able to spawn item inside okay you dead on the right nice ella's a third oh damn it oh god the whole spawn's just coming in waves i don't see anyone with an mg i've not seen one yet there's a lot of scars obviously seems a bit more uh you want to know how i got these scars my level this guy in the doorway on the doorway left side frog out okay good you can't sprint straight away annoys me yeah behind his mind just find his finest mind okay i'm facing forwards wait yeah you just cover me there you go you got him you got him no no no he's still there he's on my body you said there you go no no he's just jump around the corner there you go sounds like you killed him i spawned outside oh good oh you died again you need to get away from the wall that's weird i think we met like outside like outside metro beamed from the other side of the rail track i'm beaming there's a beaming of my own oh yeah keep coming you good to get him yeah i'm fine i died for another night oh my god oh my god it's popping off where i am i'm coming absolutely you're in a fight you're in a fight you're in a fight yeah hang on because my health's not back there you go it's crazy just killed eight of them nine ten of this is them corridor here's mentos there's another one in the corridor you're live on the left now i'm dead he got me he's pushing down now on the corridor right there there you go oh the last three shots of that oh i died oh frag grenade dude what spray i just had that was sick it is worth the download yeah i mean yeah i don't i don't know if i've played this before i don't know what the all the game is but it feels very nostalgic when did this release though um like a year ago i think it's quite old this is just a new update that they've got this like yeah more metro was added with this um the gunplay is fun though yeah no real other gunplay is this allowed i mean we were saying that like a problem they fully they've probably made a section of it that's playable just coffee bastard metro from battlefield everything's fine until it's not you know i was kind of why they didn't try to hide it with the name of the map oh well alpha has a map called operation metro maybe we should call it metro just to you know to avoid any infringement why didn't they just call it train that would be silly subway they knew exactly what they were doing why didn't they call it eat fresh yeah and then everyone would know that it's obviously a subway yeah and it's pretty fresh but what about um i'm loving it and just doing mcdonald's yeah i think you run faster diagonally for some reason they run diagonally what do you mean like oh yeah maybe yeah strafing is a bit quicker all right fully pushed up now i'm gonna try and tell that corridor we were in before a minute killed him i was the guy he killed his body he was on our flank i've made a mistake and i regret it oh god i'm dead attack protect he attacked most of all he got your back he's where is that guy spraying from on the left side all the spawn protection please please ladies and gentlemen come on down to the spawn to the metro oh yeah oh yeah he's got he's he's still got it he's got it he did have it but now he's no longer got it look at his body he's a honey i i had to finish that and make sure you got it right yeah yeah that's obviously what i was gonna say the final lyric yes there's a guy standing in front of another guy obviously they all look the same how many real team kills do you think they've been in real life a lot yeah probably that stuff doesn't get documented does it several hundred thousands probably tens of thousands yeah i should have bought the get battle pass apparently i would already be level 10 because i'd get more points yeah you get vip xp oh my goodness sake [Music] you
