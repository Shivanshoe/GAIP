well it's certainly been a while since i played this game welcome back everyone to modern warfare 2019 it's been a while for me it really has i don't even think i've played this map as a grandma map before and i haven't played ground war since i don't know maybe before even war zone came out which is crazy but i do know this map because i've played so much warzone and all of the grandma maps take place within the dansk which is warzone we're taking delta and even that's weird because you can't even play the dansk anymore i kind of miss it you know looking at this now i think we're gonna miss the dance gonna in a few months time maybe do already but caldera is the new war zone so unless the dance comes back in a future update i can't really do much about it i'll just go down here pistol there i don't know why i've got like an smg m4 but i wanted to john wick someone real quick oh baby i'm also a bit faster with my pistol i think there we go oh he died no there's more in here nice well i love the movement in this game and i just like using modern warfare weapons i don't know they just just feel so much different [ __ ] i think the uh the vanguard and cold war guns just felt a bit too floaty to me whereas these ones feel more grounded there we go the work team oh my well i haven't missed the shotguns i can tell you that much yeah i don't really have a goal for today's video i just wanted to show you guys some classic ground wall gameplay allow you to reminisce of this great game i think modern warfare safe lobby bro oh my god whoa run out of space in my mouse pad there yeah i think uh this this game this game kind of saved call of duty for me to be honest i wasn't really interested for a long time until modern warfare got this reboot i suppose there's so many people in this building just trying to find a way in oh saves your life teammate now you gotta save mine ready to try and get b here oh oh there's another one i had to go for it yeah so we just got confirmation a tweet from infinity ward a few days ago that the next generation of call of duty is coming soon which if rumors are true that game will be modern warfare 2 which i'm really excited about easy double there they had no clue oh my god that was messy with a drop shot over here i heard a sniper somewhere reloading so many footsteps [Applause] oh we're gaming oh we're gaming [Applause] there was another guy on that roof right next to me the whole time that ladder hatch is so annoying come on teammates get b you can do it oh they got it what is hitting me oh white phosphorus i forgot i was in this game i kind of wish i had to equip some kill streaks now because i'm just using specialists at the moment i don't know why i thought i could get a nuke in this game i haven't played in so long it does seem there's a lot of new players online though which is probably good to see they might be like maybe they got modern warfare 2019 for christmas or something i don't know i've seen a lot of like default skins trying to push a oh my god it was shot in the back wait stay there teammate can i spawn on you king lenny yes where was that from we already have three flags win this game super early friendly precision airstrike inbound there's a few people around me that's one okay with that where'd this guy go shoot me from behind and i'm dead oh my god that was a hell of a spray down yeah i've got high hopes for modern warfare 2. black ops cold war and vanguard didn't really do much for me i'm in restricted area can i get around here predator missile that was that was cool it's kind of sad to say but i think this game actually has more atmosphere than 2042 is that bad for me to say is that wrong i don't know oh my god i'm sorry teammate oh the beam on that one love this m4 that's where an optic will come in handy i'm using a very close quarters build right now oh that headshot sound effect is so good too i got ghost oh i just got ghost he's gonna try and push up there again i was on his heartbeat sensor for a second too and then i must have appeared on it right as i got ghost i don't know i'm having fun i'm able to go on little streaks at the moment i'm not really going for the nuke i'm also just trying to commentate and play at the same time which is harder than it looks it takes a lot of years of practice before you can commentate your every there's one on move hill can i beam from this distance ah not really that guy had armor you can get armor modern warfare could you i'm so confused unless it's spawn protection oh it might be spawn protection that area is blocked off with a couch used to be able to get up there in warzone i suppose it makes sense you don't want too for hiding places just launched a javelin get turned on kill that other go in my semtex as well love that all right trying to get a again seems to be a lot of people coming for this flag it's one of the few they have left let's try and get on the point i could use some backup for my team here but we'll try i'm reloading friendly wilson on station beginning sweet looks like a fear of him on b at least i think if you capture all points in this game as well you go into like a defcon state which if you hold the flags long enough it basically just calls in a nuke that ends the match oh my god snapped on him oh did they get b hog we've capped all the points so unless they cap something in the next 35 seconds we win the game okay i've got a teammate here now oh no hopefully they can hold it long enough oh they've already capped it they've already stopped the timer come on let me spawn let me spawn no the teammate died oh we were so close to getting it too all right we can push again i don't know if we're gonna have time to even call in the news like we're scoring a lot of points here i might just end the game naturally reloading to the assassination oh okay what happened there i think the teammate took the kill out of my hands and then i got killed by the enemy that was next to the teammate that's great maybe a little too cocky on my part one come on come on i haven't heard any talk this whole game let's go boys let's go boys move in moving nobody spoke this whole game i thought had people muted and then this guy just chimes in at the very end with the team encouragement i love it oh [ __ ] what the hell was that chemistry my teammate just wiped the entire team [ __ ] you whoa dude language it's fine all right 35 seconds actually we're 244 points if we get 250 we win have we done it there's an ac 130 need to be careful of here come on we've got there surely no yes let's go boys we did it that was sick i actually had really had a lot of fun there had a really good time model warfare 2019 who'd have thought still fun in 2022. 36 kills i got there that one teammate just got so many kills with the uh i think it was a white phosphorus it took out like 12 people with it well there is a bit of a chill video for you today guys but i hope you enjoyed that still so if my voice sounds a bit strained in this video i've been feeling a bit under the weather the past couple of days but i'm feeling a bit better today so i figured i'd jump on and record something i've said it before i think that modern warfare 2019 definitely deserve more than just a one-year release cycle i think compared to modern warfare 2019 cold war and vanguard felt pretty underdeveloped by comparison so it's clear there was a lot more passion and let's be honest money injected into this franchise you've also got modes like ground war and warzone of course which took off and became a whole new thing for call of duty so i'm really hoping with modern warfare 2 that that game is really strong but also maybe they make war zone 2 which hopefully is better optimized and has all the features that console players demanding like an ffv slider gonna be really interesting too to see how microsoft buying activision blizzard is gonna affect the call of duty franchise from here on out but yeah i think that's one of the talking points i wanted to hit today i hope you enjoyed the gameplay and are looking forward to modern warfare 2 let me know your thoughts in the comments below what do you want from that game do you care about war zone 2 would you rather just have a solid modern warfare game leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it
