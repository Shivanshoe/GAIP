so just put it in the middle tommy okay so put the ammo box on the star yeah and then yeah try and place them then just try and put it on them you just have to keep doing it i think so yeah to my knowledge you just put the muni down and then you just try and keep spamming clicking the things there you go okay see this oh what the hell get in here jack dude what is like it's like i mean looney tunes or something whoa whoa what the hell well they obviously haven't fixed it okay so today i'm putting myself through even more unnecessary pain in warzone and using an iron sight swiss build in quads and i'm playing with acolyte jack frags and stone 64. so some good times ahead now i've had success using iron sight snipers in warzone before my favorite being the spr which is actually super effective at dealing high damage and one shot head shots at close range you know if you can flick shot accurately enough it can be very powerful the problem with using the swiss though is that the iron sight actually takes up an attachment slot since the zoom scope is fixed to the gun by default and for some reason it feels like the iron sights actually have a slower ads time which makes absolutely no sense anyway i've got some pretty entertaining gameplay for you today using this loadout while memeing with the guys as usual and today we are once again playing on the new alienware m15 r5 ryzen edition gaming laptop which has been crushing warzone for me over the last couple of weeks with high fps on a 240hz 1440p display the alienware m1505 combines an 8 core amd ryzen 9 5 900 hx cpu with an nvidia rtx 3070 laptop gpu enabling you to make the most of features like the lss and nvidia reflex which helps to give you the advantage in competitive games like warzone by reducing your overall system latency it's actually a really well optimized bit of kit and even outperforms my main desktop rig at times especially when fps just seems to be getting lower and lower with every patch that gets added to warzone so frame rates like these are very hard to come by so if you want to check out the alienware m15r5 for yourself there will be a link in the description below and a big thank you again to alienware for sponsoring this one now without further ado let's get into the swiss sniper ironsight gameplay if you do want to enjoy the video don't forget to leave a like subscribe and turn on the notification bell all that boring youtube stuff it really helps me out your support doesn't go unnoticed and i appreciate it so much so thank you for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one that guy's got a gun he's got a gun oh there he is [Music] what a shot man in sight for a shot i'm hit once for you nice so far all of my snipes with this gun are at long

literally the worst guys is slower with sights oh i know i know i picked yours up before when you were trying to make a nice looking irons i don't like that tom nah yeah that's not okay no i just i like pain and tom you're using iron we're using that yeah swiss okay nice dude let's see what it looks like you guys got you got any plates yeah i'll drop you a couple nope okay absolutely none of that there you go why don't you just use a regular optic though um it's not it's not as uh attractive in a title oh yeah you get more views that's true though yeah i just want to see you go through pain now yeah i do like that it does uh yeah no that's true i played warzone but every time i got a kill i stepped on a lego i'd actually watch that too that's a genius idea how do you think i got this one right there oh don't have your legs you stepped on a like you stepped on a lego parts of the caribbean don't do the joke again pirates of the caribbean yeah he just keeps going until he gets a laugh even see if these actually had a pirates or caribbean update see ya thieves yeah yeah yeah yeah they've got a new update coming out soon see if thieves nuts fit in your mouth oh he's so good he's just a natural the pain's not just about playing the game it's about playing with tom hey jack yeah that's the that's my challenge for today no guys in there oh scanners oh there's no one in there no they're like sometimes they're you know what they're like no not again can't confirm there's no one in there it's kind of like a wall hack yeah that's good if you use that you can tell if they're inside people would say that on the youtube titles it couldn't be me they need to reduce the recoil on this thing oh yeah no the dragon off's horrible recoil my plan is just to shoot at people but get no kills headshot right what happened with you and the dragon of uh tom what do you think about the dragon off the dragon off um yeah it's too busy trying to make come on dragon these but come on you can do this [Laughter] oh i didn't even see that one coming wow so you buy me new ears too yeah i'm yeah a new graphics card nope not soon enough he's the only one on this roof everyone results is on the other ones maybe you can finish him good job yeah yeah uh bank roof vancouver i hit him once it did no damage oh there's another squad lying no no why is this always the case of course you do be like that sometimes changing my plan knocked one on and i've saved you from seeing that kind of two on my bank from singapore because i could get my gear yeah you can land back there just are you serious uh i'm in this area i don't know where the other team was that killed you he freaked out he's there tom right there he's running into the my bank that is like a wall hack the way that

me with the inside with the irons you don't need an optic you're nuts shotgun swiss let's go shotgun swiss it's like slow grounds but better in warzone a better or mozart full title let's find a good title for tom i used to swiss with iron sights it was not worth it and now i'm questioning reality the secret shotgun doors are open is incredible oh my god now we know that there's no one there tom yeah yep yep is it like a wall huh of course jack standing sort them out nine targets remain standing sort them out all right that's what i want to throw them out let's line them up first and then we can knock them down from there ultimately time you're making a video and i'm gonna watch it i need to know is it like a wall hack jack yeah that's a good question jack you're really considering a lot of options there three running through the woods on the left there it's really one option and that option is yes oh [Music] you seem good no that was so close honestly we nearly did resin we nearly didn't resin 360 masks i reckon they're gonna be honest any stunners let's be patient here broke him i'm going i'm going for the 360 knots what a game like you know what i'm gonna run outside into the
