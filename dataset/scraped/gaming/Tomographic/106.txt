guys there over there stone keep moving if you didn't knock those guys i was dead that was it they gave me no choice my guy was about to let my boy die my hero that's what thomas for all right guys so today i've got an absolute banger of a match for you using the recently buffed lw3 tundra sniper rifle now with increased aim stability and making it a truly versatile option for ranged engagements in war zone now at first i hated the cold war snipers in warzone because of the ridiculous amount of scope sway and the lack of flinch resistance that came with them but these recent balance changes have really helped to bring them in line with the modern warfare sniper rifles and for that reason i'm really enjoying sniping at the moment the new balance changes made to the 5mw laser 2 means that you can now aim down sight much faster which allows you to compete at the mid-range where necessary and again making the lw3 feel like a much more versatile weapon i recently added the full time scope to this sniper rifle as well which has proven to be a perfect option for most engagements there are plenty of kills and long range snipes for you in today's gameplay though playing quads with my boys jack frags acolyte and stone mouth 64. but if you do enjoy the video make sure to leave a like for the algorithm it really helps me out subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the
