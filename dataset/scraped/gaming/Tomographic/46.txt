secret you just got to get tattoos i closed that door behind us when we came in okay i didn't know if we would get flanked i used a tubes hands up above your head there you go jeez dude who is that [Music] seems like it's the only thing you need you get more points for not killing them well because you get the arrest bonus gotcha you still get a decent bonus for kills but like it's more of a reaction to kill someone oh boy something's going on behind that door for sure it's a lot of rooms in this building oh my god [Music] yeah i know you thought you could tank them last game but it's not possible for god's sake stone i was just about to say that i didn't see it did you check yeah it's a grenade you know what it looks like now i told jesus i can tank it i'm wearing heavy armor guys
