secondary is a car 98 oh hell yeah switch my weapon i just heard you say hell yeah switching muffin what how are you switching weapon i said you like just traded a blueberry muffin for a dorby's and creamer yeah it's okay fine they're very passive players these hello there oh god oh goodness that's what we're looking for jack someone get some aloe vera for that burn we hit those that's right you guessed it we're back on model warfare 2019 today and this time we're playing on gunfight which i think is the mode that first got people talking before war zone was even announced i convinced jack to play a few rounds yesterday and we had an absolute blast with this surprisingly the queue times are still really fast for this mode which is awesome to see now annoyingly i lost some of the footage but there are some really good rounds in here which should scratch that nostalgic itch of yours and if you do enjoy this then make sure to drop a like and i'm sure we can play some more soon appreciate the support as always and i will catch you legends in the next one oh he's lit he's absolutely lit tom you got this yeah back right yeah right there right there yes dawn well played we'll end in style come on what a game that's good look at this i didn't know what hit him oh baby this is the og that's the deal before the gulag even existed then spawn pushing straight down the middle there flashed in push yes teamwork make a dream work i threw a flashbang you got the calling you flashed him oh yeah no he had no clue look at that he hated that look the gun flying and spinning out of his arms are so cool remember a little jump spot here joe yeah yeah there's a cheeky little thing away from the tacticals they got the pistol that tom oh i nearly died the flash i killed one of myself you got them both no way yeah you got them both come on let me see both of them yes yeah it's fine dude don't worry oh if he pushes this oh it's the emmet it's the m80 you never even realized something good question before they can yes oh my god oh that's brutal that push this it was almost perfectly in sync no it was that was good okay i'm going to yes some of this you want some ted no right in the face as well saw the bolts sticking on your forehead oh my god on his game he saw so much more yeah yeah and he saw the nameplate long before you'd actually fully peeked hey max oh baby tv one now that song yeah he's gonna be too scared to peak isn't he running right and pushing no tags we're kind of feel bad that they've only got one guy yeah he's got a bad skin as well no no he's doing that that's one of the most highly paid skins most coveted in the game oh he's ruining me he's got teammate jesus joined shoot him in the jablet in the traveling what have we had on his back i don't know no way do we get a javelin as a secondary i forgot as well you got the uh in the roof there it's the part from the missioning model for two hold it now fires up i'll do it on the right side oh my god it worked just like backed off just as i gave up he walked away look oh bad go on just do it to me then end it and it's it's over and my suffering rust no way no i changed thomas i've played this one before it's it's very small this one okay you can almost peek and nade and get kill straight away i do not recognize this no i'm thinking of a different one no this i've not played this does not come to mind uh you go left or go right remember yeah the stuff off walls and stuff i hated that yeah it's just one again it was two i'd leave two if i saw us on the other team yeah all right here we go stay frosty i hear him middle somewhere the nice guy look at him i love that follow-up oh yeah i think he was in season four who oh four yeah whenever stadium blew up shadow company isn't it based off a real person isn't he that operator yeah hey outside oh yeah he got me different guy i think wait i've got two now i wish it would have said that yeah i mean it does but it's like the most faint thing in the bottom left oh he shot the vital organ in your foot what i'm a little tough look at this scope i don't like that song it's kind of clean what did that miss i didn't i just shot the shoot it's a gas one doesn't have an explosive on it does it oh gasps i'm dead i want you to hit that forget that round let's try it before switching we can't lose though i mean so there's just like no footsteps in this game unless they're full sprint yeah i don't understand classic cod oh we've got this again i'm just gonna peek right in here for the best probably walks into it oh my god did he actually walk into it um well i i saw him and i said i'm not here he's not right you got him get out of here get out of here [Laughter] no way this camera looks horrible this is going to be rng dude oh yeah completely or an iphone dude well played no i went for the second throw knife because i picked up off him he's on the stairs left shoulder i'll throw a knife actually probably got more like with a thorough knife than you have a kimbo deagles the jump shot throwing knife you got another one [Laughter] you gotta go for it look at this how cool would this have been that is a six thumbnail if you can find that up a bit that's a perfect thumbnail holy that was good your commitment there was incredible i barely won that one my side damn it these deagles suck dude yeah throw a knife in it's in here isn't he yeah that's what we wanted you're really good with those knives it's like they throw pretty quick don't they so oh oh my god in the eye that was like the uh we hit general shepherd what all fences oh yeah it's the same thing isn't it getting in the eye i'm unloading pushing right oh no i need to do the full reload middle bridge he's gonna push this not the full reload we have a secondary what's my back there that's just my axe pistol okay bear trap pistol i'm gonna hang back a little bit i thought we had the 150 mag so just mag dumped on the left side all right kill me right side with the pistol should be a good frag yes that's what i call them jack frags there it is that was beautiful get out of here where that came from well cognate as well oh this game there it is good fun oh no this that should be all right i'm going to push mid and hide first of all isn't it oh it's the sr rounds jack single fighters your side we killed each other we actually traded that counts match point would have been a draw if it's just me versus him it must be rare to trade kill when this bullets are so close right in the left nut yeah i mean these rounds dude i guess they probably do a lot of damage in the multiplayer the wall penetration used to be insane on this thing in war zone i didn't left what's he doing oh my god what frag he just threw it's a decoy one's put one's up there as well tom i think you kill him you're one yeah the naked dude no idea where he is he's on the right staircase here looking up a little bit my side oh i smashed him in the face dude what's this let's see it i don't even know you were there oh no aim assist don't need any of that the ragdoll physics is so good in this that was better it's more of a close game yeah it was sb mem's kicked in jack told you this is nice bmw [Music] you
