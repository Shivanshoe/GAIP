all right guys so today we're taking a trip down memory lane and using the classic m4a1 and hdr loadout in warzone it's been a while since i've paired these two weapons together but they do go hand in hand really nicely and i'm also using the variable zoom scope on the hdr today as you should definitely be playing for positioning when you use this sniper rifle having the extra zoom feels great for those extreme ranges and it was really nice to mix up the way that i usually snipe with the car 98k where i'm usually running and gunning so gameplay today is with the british boys westy study and jackfrags but with that being said thank you very much for watching leave a like for the algorithm and subscribe for more warzone content and i will catch you legends in the next one factory yes okay let's go just don't try to think too much about how they got the plane there they built the buildings around it didn't they the buildings were on rails yeah the the plane was uh defunct so they just went oh this would be nice in the factory right maybe they did build the plane in it to test the plane in it and it just stays there and it will never take off it'll just be there for testing a testing plane i need uh some plates please if you've got money with me but i bought some stuff i'll buy an armored box that keeps on giving i found a king let's murder him there's no shot no shot no
