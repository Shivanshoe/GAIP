[Music] even though caldera looks pretty great with palm trees and waterfalls it reminds me that it's not very dance i miss your dance my dreams online [Music] [Music] with palm trees and waterfalls [Music] dear friends do you remember modern war zone before vanguard and cold war when the dmr was broken well now the world is too but there's this game i find some hope in see god just dropped this new battle royale game called warzone and it's so sick sometimes i wonder where we'd all be now without it would i have quit my job or would my boss just not allow it look holder isn't bad it just doesn't hit the same the dance was like a playground we just couldn't wait to play in see brotherhoods were made in this war-torn foreign land we watched each other die and then we spent a couple grand because we had each other's backs and that will never be forgotten just bring an extra shoot or you my friend will die by falling it was more than just a game because the game became our home when our lives were so uncertain and we all felt so alone so to every single soldier who helped serve in the dance we were part of something special only you will understand [Music] [Music] i really miss the classic well we drop it i know we say it now but it just don't feel as nostalgic when it ain't you i don't mean to complain too much about it but that golden phrase no longer has the same ring when you shout it it's a different time 2020 warzone was a classic and i don't know if anything could match it the vanguard situation that we're facing just ain't the same and it's tragic a slap in the face to warzone fanatics i miss dropping a superstore i miss the og gulag calgary don't have half of the amazing things that you've got nothing beats dropping in and grabbing a trusty m4a1 but now my hindsight's getting blinded by these world war ii guns an era i'm just not too fond of wish that we could go back but you remember all the memories and times that we had through all the events like opening the stadium and maybe someday we can replay it but until then i just miss you for dance [Music] empty streets outside my window but my lobby is looks pretty great with palm trees and waterfalls it reminds me that it's not very dance for dance my teams online [Music]
