give it a second to load up i'm playing on geforce now today basically a pc i do not own i'm streaming the game from and this is a great way for maybe you don't have the maybe not the tech but you can play all these great games on a really high-end system and just stream it from you know maybe you don't have a pc maybe you know these g-force cards hard to come by they sell fast and um these guys are trying to get my attention playing with westie's start as you can see today we're going to be doing some co-op and uh yeah so i'm playing on at 1440p uh on a geforce 3080 graphics card um and there's a link in the description links you to the rtx site you can find out all right these guys did if you press the button no yeah we pressed the button but now we have to do something else right now talk to the guy no we have to all come here don't we have to we will have to touch the button yeah sorry oh wow okay yeah i'm right i'm turning on carlos i can heal you okay right off to the ground we've just killed a goat let me finish my sponsored talk before i'd go i'll press this guy uh yeah so click that link and you'll find out all the information you need i don't understand what but um there's three tiers essentially you can try the game for free everything all right uh you can try geforce now for free sorry uh basically it if you own the game i'm such an expert just see this cutscene what happened it goes been grilled over calculated the voltage a chaotic start i'm sorry kept the guys away oh how i could get it so wrong i told you it would be a waste of time so enough of the option yeah i'll change my heavy a bit i think you're right this is very very that it has big huge you're saying it has potential potential tell me the guy on the left doesn't look like tom holland it could be he doesn't look like tom holland it does look like tomorrow if he doesn't science there's dinner for everyone dinner for everyone i take you as uh and pronounce you uh uh hey ah crap master really wait if i skip this you just get reviews thank you it does yeah thank you what i've realized is sometimes it's easier to just get the gist of what they're saying yeah i like how the skip thing works here take this yeah there's a lot of like pausing sometimes and breathing come around and then my favorite thing is they workshop sure thanks sorry sorry it's okay he's giving us a mod or you a mod i don't know if it will apply for me and wesley because it's yours we're doing this all for me this is your experience you're seeing this yeah are you got the parts maybe did you get the parts i don't think it would have given us you just so you get nothing dude inventory i can i've got a spa mod will improve the um the durability of your weapon yeah yeah it's a spark uncommon tip mod you see i can't upgrade because i've already got a tip where do i where do i put the tip in um so you you go to your weapons your menu i forgot you hold c modify on it oh yeah yeah and then and then and then and then you put you put it on the tip it's not just the tip not the top charm oh yeah it's a charm i'm glad it um applies yes i can i can apply things to my shoulder that you get which is nice and the shaft right anyway uh sponsored by nvidia geforce now yeah uh there's lots of three free tiers isn't there guys yeah three different tiers the the one tier is free and you can play for an entire hour and you can do that as many times as you want once the hour expires you can just go again but it's great i mean tommy i've literally got it on my stream right now i've put up the three tiers on my stream so you can just try it for free to see whether you think you'd want to pay for it in the future you press ctrl n like this oh hang on my overlay is actually hiding it yeah let me move the geforce now thing down a bit or maybe and we just discovered this and i didn't know this you can actually record your gameplay as well which is insane so if you can do control g control n there we go yeah well control n brings up your stats mine obviously look insane yeah but we're playing 120 fps yeah i'm pretty sure this feels better than my actual rig yeah it's okay we all know your rigs are potato i mean it's good it's just like i have a i have a rent like an editing cpu you know so it's like oh yeah you need to why have you not upgraded thomas it cost me so much i'm trying to like make myself feel better about that yeah i you don't even need a powerful pc you can literally just use like a chromebook and you could do the same as what we're doing right now streaming it's cool that we can access that at any point let's move this right okay so which which one do we want to do which uh what stod lead the way what about this one i don't know if you can see my marker there you go start the side quests for us but have i not started it hold on uh journal we're going to do missing person does it come up for you now mine says you have your main objective well my story questions your story no i just did the look back thing when you press yeah we're doing this we're doing this it's it's on the menu if you look at the mini map it will say a and then it will have a marker and that's where we're going oh we're going over there towards houndfield is that correct let's follow scott then right we i don't know what wesley's immunity is going to be like or if he has stuff to it's right oh yeah yeah no no it's fine we can yeah well we do we want to sleep a little bit maybe we should sleep all day yeah we should sleep today it's just midway tonight as well it's very very honest west is starting to chase the screamers get back to where we started because the uv won't get run back the uv will save us you've started a bloody chase okay right um let's go to sleep yeah let's go to sleep what favorite part what a great [Music] rest go to sleep okay i'm waiting for you guys to come to sleep with me yeah we're all sleeping in this lovely sleep oh we're actually seeing oh oh we're literally just a sandwich i like sandwiches there we go okay so we've had a sleep it's now eight o'clock in the morning guys sandwiches with the boys are even better who doesn't share stephen burke with the boys a sausage and the opportunity arriving right so what's what's this mission stud um so we're going to find a missing supplier okay um and here is this way we have to go this way here we're going we're going and we're going nitrate can i trade westy shrooms what in the game oh yeah um i could do i'm really impressed by how responsive it feels yeah yeah it's actually insane and considering this is a game that's about movement and parkour like this is actually a pretty good test to the streaming service because there is there is some inherent latency isn't it so yeah there's a lot of fast movement yeah this top tier we're using though um it's got less than 60 milliseconds of latency from the the pc that you're playing on at nvidia's center whatever it's called okay i think nice i think it's here by the way you guys haven't you guys also have really great internet so you're seeing like constant like smooth bitrate you know you want it do you want to do the lock pick guys i can do the lock picking on it man there's a lot of people i didn't know maybe turn your flashlights on boys yeah i was going to say it's been a bit dark i was inside you then westie and i did not like it inside the core right i've opened it i've opened it right there we go oh there's zombies in there zombies melee take down well you don't need to you don't need to don't don't wake him up [Applause] i don't want to use this weapon oh god oh god are they on fire stop kill them all okay is that it i'm just i'm just looting so there's one more [Applause] oh god right loot every single body everything good flower lovely oh my god um hello guys this is the pc we're streaming from oh yeah look ultra wide yes you could literally play yeah these are interesting underwear on this princess on this printer you could play gfn 145 look at this gaming chair wow now that's better than my one at home wow are you sure bye we can't stream a gaming chair though should we do it hey hang on hang on i've been done the objective guys wait i need to be up there come back you're the only one that sees the objective it's the only one um where is it you have to you have to keep us informed of who we need to talk to gosh oh we can go up on the roof here i think it is on the on the higher roof i think if it's already clear this is our first time playing co-op we've already had a telephone oh you have to go down there i'm dropping now you could say there's [Music] come on [Music] it like spluttered up the walls and everything could he kick his head around can you see me kicking his head around wait can you see me kicking this guys it's so graphic um it's to find a missing supplier right so it's going to be on the roof then oh is it going to be on the ride that makes a lot of sense actually oh everyone come up there come out this window there you go you're not very good as a leader well he's not in this roof is he oh dude you can you can literally assassin's creed off the roof here this is great i've got no indication of where this is that's even started yeah i've started it i mean in the journal it says there's no yellow objective i hear him listen that's him here's someone he's a missing person he's probably been stored in the attic hasn't he ego door knock oh have you found it yeah okay i'm knocking on the store you that's a bit of an ominous door well he's a missing person he's just hidden in there is he responding do you need to knock dodd no we all need to knock so he's not there we need to find another there's another door here the door there uh there's a window here yeah okay so right that's it there's no entrance on the roof right so has this has it gone wrong right no because maybe because i knocked yeah it's just like because now it's telling me what's it saying stop now it's saying meet the group offering a job okay stop mine says oh no you're doing the ball oh this is a different one yeah you're looking at the your story objective find a way inside hubert's hideout right we need to get in need to get inside here inside the core we need to find a way inside here we've been in this level yeah yeah now we need to find a way inside how do we made we couldn't get upstairs okay yes yes yes yes yes this is where i went earlier what are you doing i mean you started and then you didn't finish no yeah exactly we started on you but he just didn't all players required let's go hello hubert can you talk please thank you cuber so there is zombies in this you call that a secret it was supposed to be you're out of luck though buddy i still don't know anything about anything the dodger sent me he's on dodge who am i playing with i'm playing with uh study and westy he told me to say sayonara that help okay [ __ ] you should have started there dodgers looking for the order you owe him i'm not bad i see that busted leg that's why i don't have dodger's order you need help nah wait don't go back to him he finds out i bought the job i'm done around here then what should i tell him don't matter he won't give a [ __ ] he'll think i'm [ __ ] him over hi he's gonna say that cause me cross the fence right in front of the massage parlor well hey slow down first what would i be looking for if i did this for you gee there was a military installation here and where there's military hasn't done that usually a healthy state i mean if he went to if he went to supercar supplies and they did that to him he'd be very the finest for the military i'm just speed running anything speed run the text once you've read the sentence oh wait i'll be back oh you make the decision for everyone yes stop thanks for the tip well thanks there you go that didn't take too long yeah sometimes they do like to waffle don't they they're like well i saw donnie down by the water and i love donnie dunn is my best friend he's like gosh i can't wait to die that is my best friend you should see him he's got grey hair is that okay dude you know we get it oh i've got a skill point to spend on combat point i suppose power attack harry perfect i would go have you got a windmill yes did i see you swinging like doing the full no no i was three six i was just doing that on my own oh with my mouse swinging around i'm going for the power attack yeah the power attack's quite fun but be careful because they can interrupt it if they hit you when you're doing it is that the yeah yeah i've been doing the whole one oh god oh have you got the windmill now yeah yeah watch oh my god wait where are you all right give give me your windmill ready yeah wait you hold your weapon out for longer so how do i do the power attack hold on you have to hold on hold on test on hold and let go there you go there you go another good bit a big smack all right where two lads um we are going right where's where's he wants to go he wants us to go pogba oh there we go it's literally two well i'll mark it there you go there's my marker this way this way this way we can't can i see that mark you should be able to on the map yes if you open the map it says like a and then a marker the thing is you're all right okay so your a do you want to do this side side question we could rescue this man can we help you want to rescue him okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to get the guy with the i can land on their heads and then you guys want to jump in afterwards right i'm on the ground yeah have you got the e attack i thought i've got the year yeah i've got the egg hopefully it works it didn't work i'm bleeding out you hit the floor i did it earlier don't worry i have died to fall damage i am in severe pain what the hell dude might not work on the guy oh i smashed him in there where i have that skill air kick no wait oh blimey i didn't block that one come on mate you want sam you want some in the head well in the air look look down on an enemy and hold either yeah i did that i'm low on health run away can you hack it oh i'm down again guys i tried to win him this is not going well i've fallen i'm bleeding out yeah i'm not one right i'm going to die quick it's someone westy are you fighting get him i'll get him i'll get him okay there we go oh my god i told my just survive survive go get someone get one of those that's not done well we do we do have hard on nobody sending that clip to stone that would be great we do we do have hard splat mounted 64 would be proud says my chat we want to know are we in this guys we're in this i'm in this guy's room yeah yeah it spawned you at your last like objective like can we is it is there anything i can knick for a minute no no no yeah i think i think it's well you can loot it you can open the door you can loot it you can lose funny all right all right where's the giant uh mattress down here i'm landing on you hello uh we unfortunately failed that man he's now dead oh tomorrow we could just kill this guy really quick you can't even like military convoy you do just believe oh do you want to try and do that westy yeah let's try it what are you doing military some good leader oh yeah you get some cigarettes from that there might be a big lad though we can deal with him i think after our lives is he there i might have killed him already not here yeah i think i killed him you guys should be able to loot this stuff i'm gonna pick this yeah yeah these guys have a lot of health i think it because it's hard and we have extra people yeah you've got combat skill yes your weapon is almost bolted bludgeon west usb west you should yeah you should be able to this stuff as well there's one here as well guys i'll do it then i'll do this i'll do this i was versus picking the lock still it's got this one so we we get our own individual loot i haven't stolen that from you oh i don't know how so the lock pick you use your mouse to go one way yeah and you'll use a to go the other tell me to do it basically no no no you basically just keep tacking it you keep tapping it until you basically get some leverage yeah until you feel it okay i don't have any objects left i need to craft some i need to cross some health it's a it's a hard lock pick as well like there's different difficulties for him crafting some heels that's the sweet spot right there that's it right here there it is we're in we're in oh thomas love it what have you found uh some batteries a vest so the best a dust filter can i do this todd um yeah you dropped it you dropped it i can see it you can have them if you haven't done any legendary gloves i've i've i've got yeah i've got laser gloves right legendary gloves yeah right now guys guys guys you've gotten the most important bit we've just come up here right and there's you see the buildings in this direction there's some military buildings oh yeah hello come this way i could have sold that for a lot of money but i decided to give it to my friend no i'm pretty sure you can't sell them for a lot but there's there should be some stuff in here that i'm standing on as well for gloves surely legendary gloves yeah they sell for like 10. it's not it's not yes you get nothing can you not break things down in this game i don't think you can just launch that guy into the orbit there this one is sick of purple bludgeon that's got insane durability all right come on come this way come this way pick up a spear and smash him right come on come this way right this is where i found the legendary axe okay and they and there's every military base you use it sorry you do it in case it breaks well i need some more pressure go in there and use that access key yeah and he goes there he goes now is there any loot in here for you guys is there any loot in here no no it's all gone it's been moving ah you see so maybe because i've already looted it it's i'll just i'll just loot the spin guys anyway in your own playthroughs definitely come to these usually would this be occupied by enemies because if so that makes sense because that'd be a really easy way to farm because like i could come into your server grab that loot and then drop it for you yeah yeah well to be honest the fact that we could all go into each other's servers and just get those all three of those tanks anyway the point is that in your own playthroughs you'll probably have a room there and there'll be really good loot there so just keep going uh right let's go for yeah that's fine when you're ready just follow me how do i get out there awkward fight we're in but determined to kick him off the roof coming over so here's what happens i think i think only i get progression on the quests but you guys still get the rewards i think yes but you have you will then have so so it's literally i need help defeating this man who is now running away just stealing all the chamomile do you do you see this stuff question or is it yeah it should be it should be there for westie as well we should be able to all get it so you need help todd uh yeah i'm chasing a man streaming the game while streaming in people are watching a stream of my stream guys i caught i caught a bandit you guys should come and loot him yeah you caught abandoned in the metaverse yeah yeah i mean i don't i expect in maybe five to ten years we might just be streaming everything from central things and you'll be on your like your phone in the middle of bloody warm yeah and you'll just be like playing in the bahamas yeah we didn't feel that fail at mission by the way i don't think this guy you can still loot down here can we yeah yeah what's he have i thought i must have already lured him so you've got somebody i mean maybe we failed it and i just looted his corpse can i mark things is there nobody supposed to protect him won't we yeah yeah so he's dead so he's so he's dead and i and i looted his weapon dude the amount of stuff that you can do like you can just get onto so many little ledges to get yourself up somewhere yeah the parts are really cool it's really well done can i not can you not mark things in 3d there must be a way anyway he's not there for me [Music] oh yeah they probably have like a despawn radius okay so this is roughly where this is roughly where the mission is in this area i'm just gonna find it have we no i think it's i think it's oh here you go in this military area here you see where that military truck is in this compound oh yeah yeah is it in there this is this is where so there's gonna be zombies oh yeah yeah there's zombies there i like zombies um we need a windmill immediately thomas okay i'll do away get into that crowd get in that crowd just do a windmill i'm gonna get amongst it all right go on guys let me let me just let me just heal let me let me just let me just just use this medkit all right charging up windmill time watch out wesley oh my god it worked so well they went into the fire as well because i set one on fire oh god the brutality he's biting me stop that come on stop it stop it come on i'll kick him kick him give me a money this guy's like died standing up for me that's funny that was cool that was a great little windmill that was an awesome window i mean these guys i can do that i can do the helicopter as well if you want is that a different move yeah yeah yeah yeah you guys need help we'll be fine thanks what happened we heard a rumor thanks for tuning in everyone appreciate you being here you drop a like on the stream as well it really does help we were wrong dumb asses hey can i put the dying and dying light at least we got far enough down to start up the old military generator and juice up some uv lights hello dwight further down the underground parking is [ __ ] swarming with infected well you won't mind if i give it a try do you knock yourself out but it's probably not worth it unless you want to end up like me or worse yeah i gotta make good on a promise here if you manage not to die maybe you'll find use for these we sure ain't going back not that way at least well thanks hey what's up valerie thank you for the five months appreciate you magic mushroom oh they've just given me lots of noises downstairs yeah i've got some uv shrooms yeah yeah just make sure they're on your hot bar i guess yeah i've got them on my they don't know we wearing the same outfit um kind of not really one trick and a word not really all right all right i thought i've got that [ __ ] yeah now we are i seem to start on my inventory sorry look at that axe dude yeah what my legendary well i mean you know we'll take a shortcut next to themselves i can do the helicopter okay i'm giving myself some dirt yes and i'll just read your i've just read your ability my axe oh my god look at it now hang on not even more that you've got yes it's so it cuts everything in my way that's great any moment this weapon was about to break and i just added two mods and now it's not really yeah i love that but to have the mods you need to have picked up a year right yeah well i made these mods because i talked to the quartermaster guy and he gave me some blueprints and that's how i got it oh so you just you used your influence with the caller that's right i am an influencer and i said on that one i said have you tried geforce now and he said i have not and then he said and you said well you can you can try it for free you can try for absolutely exclamation mark gfn you can literally try what we're doing right in description link in description comment description oh we're down here is it say that i don't think we're in a very safe place boys there's screamers i think they want us to um sneak oh okay i think they want us to sneak i think i'm not sure zombie on your right going to borrow your axe but we have to go this way and we have to create problems we gotta go all the way yeah you can stand up occasionally and it'll give you like a crouch boost like you kind of slide back into crouch yeah also um you'll want to grab these mushrooms as well are they magic where are they they are actually um well i don't think again so we need to go past these ones if it says white like take down yeah if it's red you can't i know if we take the one out patrol we'll be all right there's one on your left be careful sd press q remember you can uh um guys go this way come this way you'll start waking them up if you get close if you get too close yeah and your flashlight will bait them when you're in proximity absolutely oh we can loot everything here i'm gonna try and take take the walking guy out oh god i'm moving i'm moving i'm moving nice one nice one in front right um guys if we do actually end up um thingamajigging and setting them off i don't think we'll win the fight so we probably need to run back to the left oh god there's a there's a patrolling one what's going on yeah come back this way you can go underneath the screen no no no no no no no no no underneath the tail go underneath the tables and that's what the the eye things are yeah i've taken out the one that was walking around so we're good look at all this loot boys it's like a loot issue i didn't realize i was taking one down there so what there's a patrolling one coming towards me and westy now wait so just stay here stay safe stay prone say friend i think he's gonna walk past us oh no he saw it he clocked he clocked i think i woke up like four of them right no oh god for some reason you see it you see there's so you can see it wait wait wait wait he can't if you turn your light off and hide i just oh there's another one here oh god we've launched him we've launched it let's just go ham i need to use my shroom yeah use this room good one as long as we don't wake the screecher we'll be over no we haven't waited the screech we haven't cleared the future there's more coming though keep bringing them out this way bring them back towards westy keep bringing them back oh god we've launched him uh try not to launch them don't wake dad oh my god hey q how are you doing welcome to the stream i am unable to resist a pun you are damn right unity is low using him i don't have one okay let me drop you one hold on i wonder if i can drop it yeah i don't oh god there's another walker that's right he's right there next to stone kill it then i'll go kill it kill it get it bring it back bring it back because we don't want it to get set up bring it back we'll just keep it here that's good ignore me just keep hearing it i'm sure we'll wake him up if i you know okay i'm gonna drop but as long as they don't die in the like the zombies have like a one person radius before they start to wake up okay i'm dropping i'm dropping wesley this oh yeah okay there you go so now if you take that that should reset you can do the whole thing yeah [Music] you can cycle them with two westy the the healing bit yeah uh shrooms do the same thing okay i've got low health so i need to actually heal that's cool i've got bandage or i can heal you oh baby well maybe we can give you the muni booster i gave him money because you can walk up to a player and probably literally shrinks right here if you haven't yeah just eat loads of streams you can press r to heal you're going nuts so if i walk up to you with the booster will it boost you did we kill the howler where's the halogen so let me try and boost you no i'm fine i'm good okay we don't want to waste it they're actually quite wet rare well no it's weird boost with shrooms where we're gonna boost with a full thing that's fine i've looted everything i i don't know what happened to the howler the house gone maybe we killed him um yeah yeah we we killed him we killed him before he did the house he was that weird looking like naked zombie that came around the corner first is there what was our objective again what are we doing now can you tell us uh let me have a look i'll kill all zombies i'll find the gre containers so i don't think that's that's going to be definitely further in yeah well there's more stuff blue remember you have you have coins that you can throw debate them i mean has everyone got plenty of um shrooms i've got plenty oh yeah i've got none i'm none well can we just keep giving wesley them huh like wesley's rooms no i can't i keep hearing that noise from your blades yeah i know it's certainly on edge it's like okay yes i'm gonna drop westy a few streams you can only hear when you've got the bandages in your hand you can't do it otherwise i'm just addicted to you know shrooms i dropped three points he's taking his tiny cutter yeah i don't know how many of you got stud i've got five okay i've got eighteen oh yeah give me some blood yeah right uh so they're up here so how do you how do you split them oh hello there um you you go to your inventory press r and then it will say drop and then it will give you a number you can drop okay i'm going to drop uh four of each okay oh yeah yeah it's a drop they're so tiny all right they're good uh there's more streams down here come on i'm just looking at it [Laughter] [Music] where are these gre containers oh there's loads of gear in here oh i'll open the bin guys i'll just check that i'm worried that we we don't have enough gre or we've gone past them or something scrappy it'll scan on it you'll hear the bb what's that that's that yeah you hear it go it ticks up doesn't it yeah i don't think we need to crawl too much anymore hello people keep asking me if hards on and hard is on guys hard on always hard on always rtx on everything yes and xmm check in the description um like and subscribe like like and subscribe just come through here lads and there's a lot of zombies about and i'm gonna come back very scared i'm very scared oh god i think i've just i've made is he alerted yeah yeah we can get towards us uh we can get him get him i've gone back away back away from the door away from the door what are you doing everyone away oh cheeky cheeky and then hang on hang on i'm gonna eat a decoy far side decoy has been muted they're all tackles now anyway it's essentially a monkey bomb they've got they're going for the decoy let's move run run run run that's where we need to go just sprint for it i've just killed them all oh they're coming once running zombies running zombies kill him kill him kill him oh they're all running they're just all running no no i fight freeze the objective is right side everybody run everybody zombies you can make it okay they are jumping over just fine everything's trying to get me there oh god hang on no no i might need help no guys i'm nowhere near you are you back at the start yeah it's put me at the start no you're next to us no yeah but wait hang on oh you can't i was he is i don't even know if this is where we need to be westie might be in the right place no i'm at the i'm at the bit of the start there's a thing oh these are the gre containers anyway so if we can just get this done oh my god my west is right money deal i can't heal it oh it will help me he'll know he'll let me heal i've run away from the zombies so i mean is this not the gre containers yeah i'm looking i'm not picking one you need a thing i know i've i've used a couple how many you got you got seven all right okay i almost got this i get the other one there's probably another one now there's another one yeah there's another one in there tomorrow i think oh i can't get to it though it's blocked i can get it through the top though i think oh my god this one's hard this one's easy apparently damn um all right i got a bottle of whiskey and some cigarettes i mean these aren't the gre there you go there you go i found it i found it and some cigars cubans boxes did you guys get that voice there yes i think that's the quest right i'm coming to you guys now wait we still need three more we've only found two of five oh my god bestie how are you doing immunity levels uh half you have you got more to use though yeah all right just sprint through westy don't crouch just sprint and then you'll find it i'll stand next to the gate sprint around that right side probably kill them if we just killing them we'll probably be fine there's a lot of them stodd he's fine he's fine come through hang on hang on there's also loads of loot in there right and then check both of these containers because we still just open these there's one here okay hang on right so we need to find we need to find bloody yeah there is a dust fill uh but on any equipment you you get sod how did you get in this one through the top you have to get shrooms there's like there's a hole in the top there's no loot for me here i can't drop down really maybe you've already done this one no i did the other uh didn't maybe you did it in your play through me it's like one three did you

there's one here's one his one here's another one by the way let me drop you one of these is there a zombie next to my head just so you use that as a last resort we got there open one here i think this is a gre as well there's a hole maker epic hammer oh nice you've received a new weapon i've got a tin wear machete i think we're gonna have to kill these guys by the way i don't think we can just um yeah there's only a few we can't creep through them you know if you're familiar with takedown yeah here you go guys i've got a i got here you just backhanded him i think we are going to run out we need to be able to be all right i didn't do my spin so this is where we started so where's the next part then can you mark the next bit no i can't that's the there's no way we actually i think we go this way i think we go yes there was a way over here the whole time oh no no this is the way back wasn't my steel on this side yeah but yeah i was literally on the stuck on that side yes but all this i don't know where objectives are here you see this what does it know you're in no that's different that's that's for my my [Music] there must be more than somewhere in here so we're looking for more of the vehicles live apparently more of the vehicles immunity live keeps getting low i'm picking up more shrooms as i go along should we just kill all of the zombies wait hang on i can move this wait wait i can move this oh you could get i got through it i'm back in your area now i've moved a bit of wood out of the way of the door there is something okay so there's obviously somewhere else we can go that has more i think there's more i don't oh yeah it's this bit well maybe luke i've got the bit now i don't see him i'm on the second floor you know where we had where we just ran away yeah there must be some in this area i'm doing a little search found and up the stairs yes i've only seen one more gre so there must be another one somewhere in it oh you might want to use that immunity booster wesley that we got in the box well he's got the shrooms to keep him up for now yeah the stream the shirt i've run out of shrooms now okay yeah so how what's your timer at uh like two and a half minutes okay so wait for it to get to about well wait for it to get to one minute and then use the boost four minutes it doesn't max out every time all right did you find did you loot this one yeah it was what the world was here on me oh nice there ain't no unity based in there no i've got plain hoodie okay so now we go this way i think i don't know i don't know where else to go now this way i'll let it get down to it okay we've got we've got two left we have to be here we weren't in this area oh no we were were we because we dropped down i don't but is there a way to get into this area here on the left i don't know it doesn't seem like it you can't just fall off of that the gre containers inside military depot so that's the military they've got all be there in there maybe they're just not in the vehicles there's something here but i can see something in there it says 10 meters in front of me yeah yeah so let's go around the left side again i just will be in that one tiny area we got one up here saying there was one up here right okay hang on let's have a look around it says inhibitor container detected as well there might be another one oh there's gear in here yeah oh right yeah we've done that one that'll explain why i haven't it was showing up for me i'm a bit lost now i don't know there's supposed to be two more a nice night outside as well right looks like i got everything of value time to head out of here oh okay that was like a did you see that voice line yeah it was a co-op thing uh i i just took an item off this bench that i didn't see before yeah and i think that maybe is what okay so there might be two more outside as well because i've still got three of five that's the other thing weird okay yeah so so maybe there'll be two outside in that area yeah maybe oh no we've done it oh that's weird yeah we've got we've got it i think it was that orange thing all right okay yeah like file yeah that's fine and now he wants us to go back this way right yep is that the way we came yeah i just didn't fully lose that area i guess i thought it would just be the container that i could lose well good job guys good job we did it we did it that's right we

was i don't know if you guys see that actually no i don't think you do cause my overlays over it um i'm getting 120 fps plus jesus um streaming it from a pc the nvidia own essentially they have their own servers yeah and uh you can try it for free there's three tiers one you can pay for to get um 3080 play at 1440p 120. and the the first one the free trial i believe is 1080p uh 60. uh but it's it's just so good i i keep forgetting that i'm even playing on another pc obviously at distances like you can see the pixelation and it kind of reminds you that oh yeah there's definitely some streaming going on and the quality for you guys might not look uh as sharp as you're used to um but regardless of that it's a pretty incredible thing um and we're all doing that as well myself starting westy we're all streaming the game uh using geforce now so yeah check out that link if you're interested basically if you don't have a pc that can handle some of these games you can

this truck that you're next careful about guys wesley behind you if you can kill him without turning him off i think you can hit his container and he yeah but then yeah but then he'll send it'll send loads of zombies what's that yeah oh what's triggered hello you sword oh uh that looks like it's under the ground zombies i don't know that was what was happening i don't know some there was zombies in the under hey matt thank you for the five months you can hit this guy's container on his back yeah yeah yeah but as i said it was a membership i should say and next as well thank you man there's a cross is there a crossbow in this game yes my streams are so rare you're already at five months hey we want to get in the back of these two vans yeah wrong yeah so we need to kill the zombies right now i'm just doing some levels up so hold on some levels up i've been more crafting i don't make any promises because uh hey youtube streams are pretty rare i tend to do them for new releases and stuff skills i haven't got no this is this is gonna be hard because there's just so many of them they're gonna be okay i'm gonna win mill you're gonna i'm gonna oh my god behind you tomorrow behind you there's two of them take that three oh yeah we could just let's train them let's farm them just run around we have it i am your windmill do you ever want you have a molly no no no oh wait there's

roof my guy's on fire over here [Applause] oh no no no no no no no no yeah we're nearly done this guy's dead now fine all right i'm gonna oh my god [Applause] we did it lads that gas container actually took out so many of them done this one done this one as well what we got here uh leather guards uh some shoes and some rags nothing major braces yeah we need to maybe find ourselves away from [Music] there's so much stuff got to drop me some goodies oh babe less armor but this is probably way better than that isn't it okay um um all right let me where are we going next um i don't i need a hand in these guys i think i've also got a side mission right here i feel like harry potter there's a side mission up here apparently how would you just die i would die would you oh come on harry potter is dead these aren't even zombies his head's on the floor now his head is actually on the floor searching these bodies can stop mad oh yeah well i'm sick of it right where do you want to go stop you wanna on the roof there's a side mission where i think this guy wants us to chase them in a second if you're typing i like that emotion oh another one out of stamina by the way half of the enemies that you didn't search are all probably drop a like on the stream it helps thank you um i appreciate it how's it going any zombies on the roof my favorite part of the first one was sly kicking them off the roof yeah absolutely there's zombies all over the shop right i've left him come on study stop coming after this man yeah yeah i haven't touched the man hey slowpoke what's your problem maybe i'm wrong maybe maybe you're faster than a rocket let's find out see these things are so sharp oh the bush is on the right hand side yeah like each individual like leaf you can actually see it's quite good it loses some quality when you're removing wait wait so what do we have to do we have to i think we have to race this guy in a parkour but i think um i refuse some extra cash that's the spirit slow poke ready to show me what's going on i think it's going to set us on a course run the race enter the dark we have to go there and then do the race okay it's just okay it's at the uh old gre dark zone the group do we want to do the race or do we want to do one more just kill things let's let's let's do a race all right the thing i will say about the parkour is you start off like super basic and you have to unlock a lot of the cool stuff yeah yeah of course because there's some really cool abilities yeah i'm going to look at the safe landing landing jump yeah i i got safe landing because i wanted to there's something you upgrade to like 180 degrees during a jump wow yeah wow that's pretty good speed boost oh zombie hit um honey honey there's some honey oh honey crazy for parkour that's more of a combat move oh do you kill that jump just gonna collect some run on walls with tic-tac combo bounce off walls stop there's another man that's fine you got him dude got his arm off cut his arm off yeah some of this stuff's gonna be crazy helpful yeah i'm just gonna do a quick bit of heat one's at the bottom of uh i need to get slide next the ones at the bottom of the parkour points is crazy slide jump [Music] double maze fast climb's gonna help as well i can't do any of that yeah i haven't got any of this yeah no i've got i need space you've got points for days i've only got like four unlocks okay take some doing do i need to go and we going can we go in here oh no oh we we need to go down in this building can we go in this building oh there's a door over here oh oh is this it i think but it told me this was there was a door way out that's the way out i think oh right okay so we need to oh look we can drop down here and go in goodbye all right i'm inside the core i'm here yeah i'm inside the core too i'm here apparently i can teleport you let's just let's test that out all players record okay it says come back at night it says come back at night when the invitation we can still do it though we can still do these side quests you have to do this i think that's the point you're supposed to parkour your way through the building regardless you good and then you get stuck on all the zombies as you're running are you with us yeah go run i need help i need help no i've died too trying to rest it's two left so we're getting off okay so i didn't realize we just had to parkour right through the building oh wow man touch me uh i'm 180 meters away from you okay i'm gonna have to make my way back oh for god's sake you feel like i missed the life oh god can [Applause] wait i think you can just come back to us i think look if we do this ready fast travel teleporting in eight seconds die he's are literally like mirroring each other as i fight them right there you go tommy can you teleport to us yeah yeah you've got me too all right and then you can do this yeah i think that works yeah how did you do that so i didn't even complete it and then i pulled myself up the gutter but hey why should i tell you trade secrets wait till the next leg of the race that's where the rubber really meets the road wait but what meets what i okay take some time and when you're ready meet me on the roof of the building across from the old military base on mill street mill street yellow street yep got it right remember that guys look out for mill street falls away uh in fact we can go and do another cycle these ones having more halo content planned we have to go we might do something in the future when they get that's fine the water supply find hans pick up more right let's go baby let's go baby let's go 300 meters away god study [Laughter] slide now yeah let's go baby nice that's my next unlock noise for now i shall just jump through for now i will simply jump through this crowd sliding you can still get a bit of momentum when you go into crouch yeah sorry it does put you into like a little mini slide but you don't really slide on your butt yeah searching through these things snatching i've got and i've made it and i've simply made it we should try one of like the gre um the loot buildings when night falls next time yeah well i've already done yeah you're getting really high tier loot you know what i mean so the three different levels and you use a key to get into each level yeah i've already done the ones in this area though i think okay yeah that's how i got on my high tier my legendaries that's the problem though the problem is that all three of us trying to do stealth no no no i think i really um [Music] then it glitched in front of me i think they're because we're on sodo's connection and he's got terrible internet you know let's catch up what you doing here somebody's coming someone's kind of smacked me just run away from him there's a robber yes screw him i don't want to screw him don't do that but he's here that's cool with the wood that moves like that or something everyone put a hand on the door everyone go at once we're here stop don't drink that water water water this isn't water oh that [ __ ] must have taken the wrong bottle it's not a mainline quest don't forget his own head of it weren't stuck on his shoulders requests no this is not good he always done this little rocket fuel with him when he goes hunting but the booze is right here that means he's got water where is he and what business is that of yours the water he got from julian it might be contaminated all right charles cheers at this uh the military tower uh a few hundred meters west of here unless he's at the courts i'll go to the tower you check the courts fast wait wait take the booze with you in case he's already drunk some of the water i bet what's in this bottle will kill whatever's in that one all right yeah chris don't judge the uh the graphics based on this stream if you haven't played it yourself um watch my last video for the closest like comparison i might normally i'll just be so western give me that um yeah watch my last video if you want an actual comparison to how close it can be but there's like there's no better way than seeing it like yourself but obviously i'm playing i'm streaming the game from another computer right now we're playing on geforce now so it's obviously not gonna look anywhere is near as good as it would if you're playing on like a you know a local pc but it might look bad for people who maybe don't have the tech i don't have the good specs to run a game like this well i'm playing um i think the pc we're streaming from is a 3080 playing at 40p 120 fps like the fps for me is the best thing because it just runs really well you're playing on like the high-end pcs at nvidia's hq so no complaints there but yeah regardless i see where siri coming from it's not like the most breathtaking looking game but the lighting's really nice and um you know like open world games these days usually the sacrifice is performance over graphics and i'll take performance any day of the week it's good chris yeah this is my first time using geforce now regardless of the sponsored messaging and stuff like it's great that i've been sponsored by them but um i've never used a service like this before and there's been times in the stream where i've just been like fully immersed and felt like i'm like i forget that i'm not playing on my pc which is a weird thing to get your mind around can you tweak the individual graphics settings yeah so when i press pause and stuff and i go into the graphics like these are for press advanced video settings these are the settings on the pc and video like i'm not this these aren't my pc settings you can change all the graphics and stuff and you can why did i die oh did you fall off something i got attacked by a guy yeah i was in my mind i was ready oh my god what ability is that that's the jump down whatever smash the jump down whatever smash dude i like that one it's the air kick it's the first one on the right on the combat oh sorry could you not do this next bit without me no that's fine we found hans he's uh roof camping yeah oh no this area looks cool look at this area this is insane i'm wrong what is this that is the edge of the map as well so like i'm glad it isn't just a wall you know i wonder if that would be i wonder if that'll be part of dlc or something you go in there yeah maybe they'll expand it but you don't want to touch that stuff i'll tell you that [Music] here i am i'm going to touch the man we can all touch him together you told me i had to heal you're not wrong dude what do you want i got sidetracked you drink any of that water god damn right i did tasted like piss it's all right jeremy oh no give him the booze give him the [ __ ] take it your wife said chug drink it already so chug it down what my wife said that my anna she doesn't love me i'm all strong enough to burn the poison out of your system my woman she does love me after all here for making my day and maybe saving my life but you need me back nah i'm good [Laughter] that's supposed to be a heartfelt story well the music is suggesting that it's just you skip you skip the part where you could ask him about their love about their life binoculars above his head on my screen now we need to destroy oh we've got we've got a mission an encounter right here so we might as well do it do we encounter them someone said where are they apparently right here where are they where's the encounter there you go jeremy i got you i'll encounter you in a minute this way oh here we go nice westy all right guys i'm gonna loot this and they're gonna they're gonna oh i see them they're in it look look guys there's there's creep creek creep they're in here look look rescue you'll see them one on there are we looking for hello go around the back around the back dude try this [ __ ] i was looking for a spike wall but there isn't one jump up and sometimes you can kick him into stuff remember the kick do a perfect parry and then bounce off kick the other guy oh god they just did the power move on me i'm down do you like that okay is that is wait wait you've got the same legendary thing i got yeah this guy oh my god his leg that just absolutely destroyed them there this is fun co-op oh yeah good hello all games are great this is this one like one was my favorite game um co-op zombie fps shooter game play with ella yeah i played with that we actually played it off stream recently finally one yeah i'll play through it twice the first game so it's dying light two down like twice yes do this uh i think it's the squares you want do you wanna activate this windmill stuff oh why not actually oh yeah well who can do it first come on then is it faster you'd run the windmill activation thanks guys see you later oh that you have to time it with the the one behind you there you go stud all right guys grab it there you go the stamina oh god make that i don't know if i can make this that yeah you should be able to just push and hold on your spacebar this is like far cry in it there we go yeah we did it i'm going to pee whilst it's going on go go yeah but the tower mechanic is actually cooler so what do what does this tower do tommy so explain it residents will move in and you can use the traders and all that sort of you'll see it changing right okay so it turns it into a habitable area yeah so this is going to update people will start to move oh i got a car a parkour point i don't know if it changes for us though maybe stud screen yes todd hasn't set a faction to it so he needs to set like the peacekeepers or okay i think i put something in that before my access leave it there for now i thought i've got parkour points there you go oh yeah i want to turn my five up a bit oh no i don't have a parkour point i just i just leveled up a bit more what's your referee out then uh 110 or whatever plus 10 minus mine's plus 20. that's 20. i think oh that's so much better dude oh ella you're hanging in the castle [Music]

of there no they're stamina the stamina it's crying every time i do he's just constantly he's constantly tugging his thing and i can't get what he's talking he's tugging the bell i can't stop him why is there a man up here oh and he's falling down he's simply and he's killed himself no i'm i'm doing this thing there's many there's just too many we could pick him off one by one stud i guarantee you we can i don't know someone slapped me and now i mean where are you i'm coming back to you i'm sorry you're dead can i get you i died ages ago i died oh you died okay yeah there's like six million men here oh it's because we're doing both the encounters at once and there's like eight men my god let's just get out of here do you want to fight do we want to fight i don't know is that you with me i mean i'm around hold on we can fight these guys why am i 400 meters away from where i need to be i did the encounter you did that entire encounter oh god they're on me though then i i did the meme and untied him but i don't know if we won we've not won we certainly don't you're right there are a million men and i don't want to waste the durability on these guys yeah yeah that's something that's something that's themselves i'm out of there so i got out of it and so i left i'm gonna follow my just follow me just follow me i'm going to i can even meme um the waypoint for you i'm surrounded by six men with hard on that's correct it's on steam and maybe epic games six men a half so it's it's gonna be very difficult to take on six man it's too hard for stop i thought you knew how to do that no i don't i do it's just you know it's it's just a lot harder you're usually the guy i call well when when you've got six men you're just too many to handle yeah i phone a friend just run through him you're with us okay what i gave one a little tickle yeah i'm with you we'll just like when he go mate have a slap take the honey take the honey it's waiting for my bit rates catch up when i'm here honey honey honey love the honey give me all the honey other than let me heal let me heal i would like to heal i would like to heal give me all the stuff a double mace um we need to appear i don't think you can go hancock a reasonable height maybe i can't do like full damage is what you're saying almost fell off and died ratio oh god i think fell off time i get near stone i can just hear the gas coming off of that axe let's go baby oh it's this one yeah that's his name oh call pete oh calm down calm down it's a race in fact hey i'm walking up the say five to one what do you say okay what do you say yeah sure bro hey hey this is too much money for me i can't all right you're on and we're off we're done it's another dark color thing so we need to go and run through zombies again don't fight the nice d right all right okay all right no fighting no remember no fight stop fighting arthur saw me don't worry are you fighting it all right okay oh here we go here we go okay we're going right run run run run run go go go go go run run run run the stairs don't go up normally yeah what [Music] [Music] straight in the ass right oh there's one more apparently in where is it oh yeah he's inside of course yeah can we are we can we get him oh my god it's a spitter yeah that's fine that's fine and he simply died he's simply blown away right there we go this player is required to f him that was a cool little sequence actually on the punk the court memes are nostalgia loving this i'm glad tom thank you for the 49 man it's very well [ __ ] me the two of you are twins no wonder you kept winning when i started a race with one of you the other was already at the finish line no way is that they didn't get here you can tell who's who because one has clusters on the left and one has them on the right stop do you wait we're not bad people okay i mean we're probably not all that good either but my point is everyone does what they do best right we try to do other things seriously so you scam people nobody gets hurt listen what if we gave you back your wage in surely my silence is worth more all right all right this is all we have okay oh yeah that was the right decision race again yeah we got more money numbskull you had to let those biters catch you didn't you hey what you think i did that on purpose hey give me a break come on i'm walking here hey wait where they go hey i'm running here hey they walked off the edge of the roof here hey there's walkers here that right guy literally just bye so what did they give us inventory i got nothing no combat point no check your uh your gear oh no i'm gonna die yeah i've got like a mask i need help please hurry i'm in here i did throw myself off but i landed on the barbed wire which broke my fall but also injured me well it's you know the lesser two evil is this one yeah here we go we're going baggy pants we'll go this way all right okay we're off are we just i was just changing hello dyslexic puffing you can if you want i mean i can teleport remember how are you doing it's cool it's all good it's all good i've now got some nicer clothes that do nicer things yeah basically more the same if you like this one you'll probably understand the last one you like this one pretty much yeah just builds on what the first game did but like it's a really solid game like it's just so nice yesterday you fell off plus ratio it's so nice to play a triple a title that works after all the crap we've been given recently yeah from triple a games like there's just i think this is the way no complaints did you use the zip line yeah where was it it wasn't there for me well it's not there for you a zipline that i don't have so i just saw your character like floating why don't you have this zip line that's weird maybe it's you're like a certain part of the story where that's added ow i just broke my phone with my face still telling me to go this way there's a zip line where's the zip lock it's just not there oh so so basically should be between the premium version of the game it's not just like jankily like skeeted across the open like area between the two buildings and there wasn't even a zip there for me and then there's us peasants i was like other stars got speed hacks or like there's no way you could have parked over there in time i mean that's what the foot pedal's for i'm just saying like it's like finally a triple a that works and it's still just like teleporting finally oh oh and it is good like it for how few bugs there are in this game well i think that's why they decided to go with a um a delay yeah yeah apparently there are like bugs that people are having that i just haven't forgotten i keep falling down i need to help with these lads yeah all right helicopters you need help with these men try and do the the perfect parry start and then bounce off him i've already done that oh i mean oh i'm inside my other one back i'm healing i'm healing hitting someone into the zombies oh there's more zombies in there alright where are we going i don't really know what we're doing what's the plan stud um it's around here somewhere what we're looking for though on the right in this what's up here's someone oh what are we looking for i don't know is it a side quest or are you looking for like a geo recreate or something i could talk let's kill these on me it's this place this way okay let's go it's somewhere hello what would that even look like actually just a helicopter called missing persons meet the group oh is this is this the one we had before where we got okay hey ray lost a man who pronounced that correctly welcome to the stream looking for a missing person and if they're another missing person don't see anything about missing person or should he should he be around here somewhere should be yeah i hear a baba you're a baba dog i'm looking for a man it says it's in this building yes somewhere in this building that we're standing on or around right now where's the gre the city opposite me [Music] i think it's this building i'm at right i'm i am tracking it now and it's saying 36 meters can you guys see that track yeah yeah so it's in there yeah because look this this shoot thing here is something you slide from the side maybe yeah cause this this shoot here on the left that is when once you're on the third floor you can exit through it i think we have to parkour this [ __ ] no no no no no i think it's made it's here it's here guys i found it it's coming around the outside i teleport you no that's fine we'll be there just off the edge of oh i fell here and hit my face i didn't see the door behind me i fell here and i hit my face let me in knock knock knock hello anybody there damian sent me hello what do you want damian sent me he said you have work here actually thanks for the 49.99 talk to him damian he sent me here but i just thought you were alone that's incredibly generous man thank you just me and my two friends yeah i'm alone you'd better be don't worry about those hey you're alone hey uh do we get through this oh we getting it right so what yeah what's our objective we go through this door here right do everything loot everything loot their kitchen come on i have an interview for the job what's the job oh god i'm aiden damien sent me i'm uh here for the job what's his voice going to sound like right right so tell me you're new around here damien asked that too just be a game that the difference doesn't make we just want to be any lower we have to imitate their voice before they start speaking whenever we run into a new character right i lie and say i'm local i'm still trying to figure out why i'm here yeah you're the one dancing around the subject okay okay let's talk about the job talk about the job then you're ready to do it it's best that you're not all that well known around the bazaar oh yeah i don't know any one of them i wouldn't say i'm all that well known that's good that's very good because i've never heard of it looks like we finally found a missing person wait what are you talking about what what do you want from me let's just say we work for someone that's dying to meet you dying i'm the one the name of the game think call him in boys he's better than me spin coming it's been coming it's been coming oh god i am in severe face oh no oh oh you need to raise guys did they throw a grenade or something bestie what i didn't okay yeah it doesn't spawn us until you spawn we've got a oh he's coming through oh no oh no we broke it by dying excuse me oh these guys hit so hard i'm just in this room okay nice nice never mind is he dead westy run to me i'm safe unless your necks are stored yeah good i'll go i'll go and restart oh this is hard there's five now oh my question oh no i can't tell i've literally got nothing left i've got nothing left i'm running for start i'm gonna start packing [ __ ] off okay maybe i don't know why they started attacking us there before he's like a [ __ ] door dude i don't even know the health of the press quick skip it skip skip skip choose different options choose different no no no no no no it's fine hopefully they don't attack because i'm well yeah we have to kill anyone all right everyone make sure you've crafted max health before we go in yeah well the thing is i don't know if i can oh they're oh no i can't even open the door guys uh wait wait no because you need us to do it i'm just dropping westie somehow some men's thanks babe i've got grenades guys wait wait first first thing i'm going to do is chuck three grenades i'm gonna check three grenades that's gonna start the fight thanks dumbledore okay not not right yeah but we have to initiate the conversation first we can't get in we're stuck i can't open the door is nobody prompt now and we leave yeah just get out i guess we can't he's here he's blocking our way no is this ruined we ruined well you can teleport us no no because we're in a mission we're in a mission so oh well how do we fail it oh no this is the first actual bug we've had this is the first bug we've had wait so i'm thinking get on the fire you no no well no because if we die get on the fire it doesn't really work yeah that doesn't work it's just visual um parkour into the corner wait a minute i got a grenade myself but i can't i can't do anything drop a grenade each we'll all throw up we can't we can't have grenades we can't use a grenade oh we can't use weapons right now so we're going to have to end the game and then restart me and westie can drop out stodd can restart um and hopefully he'll put us a waypoint instead of right so online menu all right i'm going to drop it i'm going game master has disconnected connection failed right and i can join one of your guys game sessions maybe and that might fix it because i feel like i'm stuck here no you're not you're not the game will put you your like nearest uh like last save yeah put me back in the middle of the yeah i quit actually no it's it's put me on the roof next to the gre building okay you better be bad are you back in stock i'm just here i'm i'm just gonna i'm gonna go back into the game all right so i mean to redo you only have to reduce things if you restart you guys play with health bars on by the way yeah i do yeah i have an offer infected i mean it does look good i just don't like when you're done yeah but fighting's fighting a zombie horde i don't like knowing how close i am it's also nice yeah it's more immersive i have that for the humans the who man oh i found a part i got a parkour skill yay all right parkour skill let's go on death stud please study study oh i can just click resume my line it's instant wow i could have at least walked around i didn't know how do i how do i resume just pressed resume where's that i was in the main menu when i press drop out oh online menu i haven't i haven't got that this don't have to send me a message he's just gone death on us how rude i believe he's done this no no no no no no no no no the anointing is that he doesn't do it through discord yes he can he just does it with goex glass we don't know if we're like no no because i just there you go shift tab play game play game am i with you i just had to quickly explain why we're here doing gfm oh right well i'm going to explain we aren't doing the same spot why didn't you

on tune up what is gfn don't mind what what the hell is gff well gfn stands for g-force now and geforce now enables you to essentially play on a pc that is sometimes better than your own with the limited uh supply of graphics cards of the 38 variety you can play on 3080 at 4040p 120fps play for free if you want to at 1080p 60fps one hour and you can keep milking that one hour if you really want but it might be q times but if you want to have it this is great it's a great way to test it out it's a great way to play the game yeah you can literally play on your mum's ipad literally i'm not even kidding you literally can't so many devices now g-force now now what are we doing now right objective i guess fight those lads oh are we you want to avoid this one i feel like it's gonna hold knuckle on well as long as we win or we could do the let's do the gf gfn let's do the uh the dark thing to your right unless you've done it already i've already done that one yeah have you yeah easy easy for the gre kill the ball to kill the walter get him get him tomorrow get it going nice nice nice easy parkour exploder easy yes sir um right we'll maybe try to sleep through tonight yeah no we should try a different mission i think just in case yeah otherwise it might have the same thing again then we're stuck yeah i think they just don't expect you to fail so they're just like oh wow you guys actually failed that yeah yeah we did got our asses under us where's the bed here uh we have to talk about this i have to talk to him yeah this is a come up let's do this student here was curious

comply was quite quite severe oh they want us to read through the law here i think you go another investigation those are just dead people yeah yep that are so disrespectful the one the one time you shouldn't skip these people anyway are you licking a tree i don't know we're investigating it sure [ __ ] sure is it light the candle screamer my candle come on guys saying that pratt made a bad call taking people's guns away hard to know for sure but it didn't end well for anyone in fact the main irony this guy sounds like soon run out of ammunition and jigsaw firearms believed to have happened now you'll hear some folks claim that pratt kept the secret but it is wow that was a great message guys can i assassinate this howler don't run swimming you're crazy you don't sprint up something like that you got mad right um i've got another side mission watch out do you need his hand in the side we need to go back question okay run run we need to run back to the no no we just stay here i've i've lost the option to even assassinate him now because wes is matter just try to have a conversation with them you'll be like and then you'll be like everything's fine everything is fine he's burning on the right look we have no safe houses between us anything but there is a we can grab us or can you not do like uh can you not activate one sword um no we have to just go back to the bazaar okay let's play this way yeah come this man i'm coming senior oh i'm fine everyone is like everything's great oh my god how is it fine and it's fine for me howlers screamers spitters your mum [Applause] [Music]

[Music] what can i buy they're expensive but that was clutch yeah hold on somewhere later no you didn't always work on hard modes so if we played this on easy you're telling me i wouldn't have died once so difficult to find probably not but the whole fun of this game is yeah of course you know i love being challenged with i love having a hard on i love them you know any any opportunity to have a hard oh yeah yeah yeah yeah jesus low hanging fruit oh i've got upgrades available inhibitors is the zip line there for me why is that the case it looks so janky oh it was a double inhibitor let's go baby you've definitely activated like zip lines or something in your world that just don't exist and he's open the command console oh yeah yeah why don't you start installed mods already could find westie it's an easy one there's no inhibitor there all right you've already you've already taken that one i guess oh okay yeah you may have taken it yeah right now i can actually do this room's there little container here on the tree somebody's help someone needs help they're screaming i don't see that'll be fine yeah i'm sure he's someone um i would like to die i almost fell oh fell off my channel fell off it's january february warzone isn't it the same war zone two save me you're a musician by the way that's why that's why they've called it call for help and not proper co-op because then they really because obviously you guys don't get progression so it's like yeah you're just helping me in a sense you do get protect progression but you can get good character stuff yeah yeah you technically haven't completed those yeah you have to do them in your own play session but regardless that's why you don't really do story missions because then yeah and then it's like oh but you could if you don't care about getting achievements you're still doing it you're just not getting the progress in your own story but you could still play it and get the full experience out of doing that right i'm reporting the water man stuff okay mr waterman you sell step right up my boy hey what's up hanky how are you doing man i am oh you got a bow yet a bar yeah we need to talk to this guy because this is their dude that hurt the water before where is it just here and then oh here yeah yeah yeah that guy on the left by the way yeah my way what's going on bebe's husband is dead julian's been accused of murdering him by poisoning his water badminton please melbourne tell them it wasn't me julian is innocent of the guy drunkenly sold julian contaminated water it wasn't a murder you'd swear to that before the bizarre council yeah where's that supplier he's going to stand trial marco is dead i i killed him and my job here is done it's okay i forgive you that scum marco got what he deserved thank you aiden half of my flower is yours okay the flour mixed with plaster huh um no where'd you hear that oh yeah so once but yeah you know egg keep the plaster okay we'll be even i'll tell babin what happened hey babin all right cool epic right um i'm going to go to the craft i got him he's got he's got a couple of tips but and one shaft for me i'll buy one of these minecraft and carry only what what do we do here you can buy blueprints wesley yeah on the weapon mod you buy them in that guy and then you then you're gonna supply them to your weapons but if you have the ingredients okay make sure you sell all your valuables as well when you come to this quartermaster so yeah wait so valuables you don't use for crafting do you they're only stuff you can say you just you did you just tell me okay so i've got what 8 460. nice so [Music] can just sell everything yeah three thousand coins i just got here you buy a really thousand four hundred and sixty coins and so now i can go and buy a weapon from that guy you can buy a weapon i've got a legendary here [Music] well he's selling a legendary for you yeah he's selling lettering right what the hell you must buy now i don't know what have we got he's not selling he's not selling a legendary for me i've just bought two doesn't let me buy it i bought something i've got no space oh no i need to sell loads of my weapons yeah so exactly that's how it sounds right yeah but like i know you can't you still like your character still progresses it just doesn't apply to your version of the the game i guess right like if you were to play solo it picks up from if you would you were to invite your friends it picks up from that point whereas if they continue to play with you and they go back to their own world it's obviously going to be not at that stage so basically you can't play you can't resume where you left off at least that's my understanding of it you still unlock character levels and get the rewards [Music] all right maybe i'll explain that wrong yeah no in an ideal world that would be great if it was transferred [Music] you can it's only showing me like oh there you go i can sell this but in my weapons i just have nothing it only shows me the first line of my weapons which is really weird hmm [Music] let's see if i've got anything i can drop for westie giving you some gloves haven't i how do i why have i got so many of these weapons and yeah you just light them all up you can just pick them all up yeah but but they're not i can't sell them like they're not in my list so he won't even buy them because they're so cheap i've just dropped some stuff oh yeah i've just got a bloody big old sword long sword and septic you dropped some antiseptic stuff yeah no i dropped the

surviving what are you talking about want to find out just close your eyes want to find out it's four person co-op right not three uh he is up to four yeah yeah up to four something stinks why is it just a black screen exactly the smell we've closed our eyes well i didn't see the animation well that smells like [ __ ] too much information sorry so basically we've just smelled [ __ ] and that's a winner i sure hope you don't mean smelling like [ __ ] the essence of survival of course not people are going to pay a fortune for just a whiff i called it turn me off i call it turn me on turn me on the new fragrance by rick fragrance oh yes metal scraps ah so turn me on will be an aphrodisiac for robots then what is going on what have we picked up this is some weird side mission that doesn't use

fire one i have the fire one and the poison one okay you said to buy it yeah oh my god that's a big jump um there's a mattress there's a mattress no i don't have i'll fall on it now okay so is it we're going inside the core um no no i'm just following just follow me this is the way we're going we need to find we need to find hooby booby-hooby-hooby-hooby i was just about to do that there's an encounter here where is it got my wave jesus we will now i can't be honest we're just getting this jesus this is the military compound that we've already loaded if you guys remember yes yeah that's very kind i don't know the m16 yeah just teleport me to you stop just teleport me i do i'd rather not parkour i simply can't be bothered whilst you've uh got some time somewhere why don't you explain the amazing effect of gfn yes i've just i've done mine it's westie's turn okay so do you like playing games but can't afford a graphics card well good for you gfn exists oh these are friendlies yikes you like games yeah do you like video games but you don't want to spend lots of money on a computer don't worry gfn exists for you steal someone else's with pfm a little bit of money to use all of the computer am i invisible where are you tommy no you're over there i'm pretty sure these guys are enemies it's a mission i think no i've just diluted a container someone's screaming now two enemies regarding i think i don't know if they're friendly or not you're on the building with you i've just forgotten oh seriously there's men there's men in here [Music] i know zombies zombies but we need to find hubie's house where is it forgotten where it is again okay i'll hop over up on this roof you're on and then i'll come here over here oh yeah yeah thomas around it's nice the secret hideout [Music] something wrong i had a chance to meet the bandits you mentioned before base yeah i guess i could sorry chad where is uh we'll try that where do i find dlss i thought just this once i pretend maybe get a little ahead for once i figured an ambush story better yeah after we start the game i'll leave it for now being greedy i wasn't being greedy yeah technically anyone could need dlss what happened to them anyway no they tried to kill me but i got everything i'm begging you don't tell doc please take what you have to him tell him the quality of the dlss textures though is actually really nice in this game yeah i can see the texture of the bedford it's almost it's been made with dlss in mind yeah not added in later i learned miley we'll see usually when you put it on the texture um to it obviously boosts the performance to the max yeah you can see the difference but i i've toggled it in this game and it's really hard to see you toggle i toggle where we can only tell god where's the orange one yeah i've just got to go back to that oh this is an encounter let's encounter them between those bins there's no way this is the encounter that you was doing stop why are you flying oh i've got a zip line yeah so yeah look these guys are now these guys should be rendered in for you now tonight where there yeah so they were here before though and i i looted them you yeah i looted that box in front of them if it's open for you now it's because i walked through them and looted the box there's obviously something right you can't i mean you can't you can't you can't so these are bad guys i mean it's a great thumbnail opportunity you know what does it look like this guy's doing when you're just stood on his body let's go again right we did it gg nice job i spent that skill born yet tommy doesn't want to spend his points well good for you not me if you even care to ask well that was a great mission we love that um do we want to try and do that the one in the building yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [Music] i don't even know where that one was this way you haven't just come this way you should even go to the door and i can just put but you need to be really prepared like i'm gonna nade three three times i think that's the plan i don't think tomorrow's very well prepared hurt guys i aim for the mattress and hit the side of the skip a crack of the back the way this is the way this is the way and this is the hawaii way yeah you're really not far off unlocking fast travel stores you're like a mission or two away what i don't spoilers what how's that spoilers you're telling me that i'm gonna get a mission well if you press m you can see the fast travels anyway it's the subway uh train symbol do you not want to do the bi oh can we not can we not just do that over there we've got a gre quarantine no because that'll take a more that's going to be like half an my mind hour spent the night where we going um we need it's this building this is remember this one where we got it bugged and we had to do it again is this the building this is yeah i can't remember i can't remember how you get in there it's here there you go yeah um well we get we get an opportunity to move before maybe because i skipped that's what breaks it up just just do it anyway yeah is this gonna break it come on restart our game so maybe it would be fine all right everyone get your i've got grenades and stuff i'm gonna i'm gonna chuck down a molly yeah i can't craft any more meds i haven't i don't have any more grenades i've got a molly no health i can use in the fight i've got no nades i can use i've only got two bandages that's it i can drop you one healing meme i'll have a healing meme if you can a healer beam you go dropping one straight right is this going to work though okay it's gonna wait wait wait wait wait not yet uh is everyone ready right so you got healing you've got big things and i'm i'm gonna throw a molly down as soon as we start the fight so okay everyone at the door i've left the door i'll lift this wasted on that big guy yeah right come on right ready ready ready what's the job no i'm still well looks like ready fight with us anyway get ready i'm gonna throw the the yeah i'm gonna fall back and just throw an eight of them oh god what have you done um could i get a rails don't worry i can heal that was actually the perfect way to do it guys we've actually succeeded whatever i mean that was good that was a good opener [Music] look at these guys they're just charcoal now the molly plus the grenades what the hell get opportunity weapons this will be really hard on your own yeah fight five people at once the box is here don't forget it's harder because you're playing on hard and you're playing yeah i'm gonna open this door oh savage bludgeon did you get a legendary that's there for me too my inventory is full yeah well i mean big thing yeah i assume it's gonna be weaker than that surely oh my god i've got so many weapons and that that you can't sell half of them i don't know why that's what confused me okay lots of throwing knives okay so we did it yeah we did it yay yeah yeah okay so now now basically we go back to this man right i'm lefting the door i'm effing the door are we willing to have the door at the same time yeah we all have to eff the door together do we have the effort yep am i okay hanky today's stream is sponsored by another chest oh no you guys always miss this it's sponsored by geforce now so i'm actually streaming the game someone just canceled it on a different pc so if the bit rate looks less than usual i'm not actually on my pc how is a radiator like that in in here with that toilet oh rice i got a weapon called gangrene usually i stream at 12 000 right though and i am still but there we go all right obviously i'm streaming the game all good we've left the door it's been really good so far i think my fps is better on this pc than it is on my own how did you die oh you [ __ ] you set me up what no no i i swear i would never i was just doing my job scouting it's my job do you think it is his job guys yeah i think it might be his job latency feels extremely minimal i'm really impressed i keep forgetting i'm playing on a different pc terrible but so you've sent others before i didn't know at first it's actually pretty crazy how many people have you said to their death they have my brother i'm glad short round hopefully more soon cooperate with damian brother i talked they took him and threatened to kill him i just figured if i did good they'd have it i'm being played and i'm tired of skipping through the sent me to the slaughter and now i'm supposed to forget that you're mad i get it but look at it this way if he could tell you wouldn't you want to find him you can repair four shots yeah we're gonna help it's been different in this game no way do you have enough time to read this yes i'll search the area around devil's bridge yeah i was reading that hey you serious you do that jesus yeah you know speed reader he was about he was about to walk straight through into the door exactly yeah so repairing in this game works differently doesn't it you can't disassemble weapons anymore but um weapons that because some weapons have insane durability but you can't put mods on them correct but this weapon you can see when i add a mod it goes from 166 durability to 210 so it repairs the rest of it so you just have to find or buy you want to do this you want to do this one still this one this side mission yeah let's do it okay let us go that doesn't sound good but you're not here like screaming zombies it's fine why are they stars on the zip [Music] you wanting to kill these guys stud i guess so did you just immediately catch the bandit yeah i jumped on his head oh i got two more men here two more men oh my god it's almost out of nowhere wednesdays i have the legibility so as soon as i vault i can do a kick well he touched it oh i kind of bat [Music] what he did he just dodged it this way [Music] death destruction no no no no no no no i don't like that i'm getting out of here goodbye goodbye bye have a great time i just like the way westy's last hit is just an instant one shot across the map and then tomorrow coming out of nowhere flying kick that was a proper yeet as well [Music] there's someone singing near me i

light sweatpants we got here or check this out can i get the gun out here i've got a turbine look at all that is that quest complete is quest complete how am i that was fun it was fun wasn't it nice bit of co-op with the boys you know yeah that was that was honestly great that was awesome and you would and you genuinely wouldn't you bet your brain doesn't realize that you're playing on a stream yeah yeah it's the fps i think of anything because you don't here we go guys everyone like this is definitely a stream this is not just me playing on my pc yeah we are no don't fight them they'll fight you i'll fight him yeah we're not actually playing on our pcs this is a stream yeah it's a stream of a their room is not absolutely boiling because their pc is not being utilized instead it's we're just streaming from somewhere else so you literally i could play this exactly i could play at this exact quality yeah i'll come get you on on a on an ipad and it would all be the same go go go blimey oh bloody hell this turbine i've had games streaming to me before when we've had like access from developers but i've never used a service like this before so it's like a really good like positive experience yeah it's been good and the uh what's called the mouse feel is like one to one if you have the internet to like max out a bit right too it's like hard to even tell that you're not you know visually you get all the benefits i'm so bad at this game and if you're not sure if your internet's good enough you can literally try it for free for free completely for free i'm just going to respawn i was like i was like parkouring and stuff and let's just say it was not sticking the landing well you got you guys can just piss off now oh i mean i mean you can keep playing if you want you wanna keep playing i'm i mean i'm gonna get i've gotta add on stuff i'm gonna keep playing if you wanna carry on but yeah i'm carrying on i'm carrying on if you wanna solo i won't be offended no no no i'm carrying on i'll catch you guys later have a good one all right cheers bestie good game let me uh let me just explain to chat what's going on real quick all right well i'm going to call it their store but i'll i'll play for a bit longer but um yeah in the stream there all right chat that's it for the sponsor stream i do hope you enjoyed that um dying light 2 is a lot of fun and the co-op's really i mean it works you know it is a shame that you can't um progress on the same story regardless at least your character still levels up and you keep all the gear which is great you just joined misfit well i mean do i end it here chat or do i do a little after after show i mean i feel like that's a good spot to end but if you want to carry on watching if you have been watching live um i'm gonna go get some food before i carry on anyway but stodd is uh playing on his stream we've all been streaming with geforce now so big thanks to them for sponsoring as a group as well it's really cool and we can do stuff together but um yeah it's a it's it's very clever i've never used a service like this before so it's awesome that um it works so seamlessly obviously graphically you're not going to see huge improvements if you already play on a high-end pc but for people who have a low end pc and can't afford to buy the latest graphics cards or can't even get them notice like with these 3080s they're impossible to grab um then you can play on a system that has one and play 120fps 1440p there's a link in the description we'll find out all the details you can play for free if you just want to test it and see you know how how much how how it works for you at least um but the free trial is only 1080p at 60fpfps i believe and then if you want to stream that to you at these qualities then you need to pay for the uh subscription but it you know in the long run it's cheaper than cheaper than uh getting your hands on one of the latest cards but yeah that's gonna do it for this stream guys hope you enjoyed it again link is in the description thanks again to geforce now for sponsoring this one appreciate nvidia always really great to work with and i've supported the channel for years now even when i was a little lad in this youtube game uh but yeah hopefully more dynamite to content coming soon as well and uh with that being said have yourselves a good day and i will catch you legends in the next one bye-bye
