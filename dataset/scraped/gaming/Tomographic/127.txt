so i know i just recently posted a video on the pkm and warzone but i'm a sucker for lmgs in video games and typically when it comes to first-person shooters fully automatic weapons are never really my go-to i'm a sniper at heart and sometimes i find a gun like the pkm that just speaks to me you put a vlk three times optic on this thing and you have yourself an absolute beamer that still packs a punch at most ranges equip the mac 10 or an smg of your choosing for whenever you need the movement speed increase or you suddenly get caught out reloading then this class setup becomes a force to be reckoned with so if you fancy trying something new amidst the current org ffar meta then give this loadout a try it's pretty sweet talking of sweet today's video is sponsored by honey now if for some
