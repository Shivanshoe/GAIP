so i'm finally returning to solos in warzone back by popular demand it's definitely been a while since my last solo video and that's not because i don't enjoy playing solo i guess i'm just lucky that most of the time i'm able to get some friends together and form a squad the solo experience is also a very different one in warzone and i forget just how intense solos can be the following gameplay was actually captured during a recent live stream of mine so if you'd like to come watch me play warzone live then there will be a link to my twitch channel in the description below this video so today i'm going to be using one of my favorite weapon combinations in warzone and that is the august mg with the 556 nato conversion which turns the org into a very competitive assault rifle at close to medium range and of course i'm also using my trusted karna ak for any medium to long range engagements now i've been using the org on and off since day one of warzone's release but it does have one major downfall so for whatever reason when you add the 60 round drum mag to the org the ads time takes a rather significant hit and adds a whopping 45 milliseconds to the ads speed as well as in this six percent reduction to your overall movement speed i actually use the merc four grip on this build for this very reason as you might already be aware but the merc full grip has a hidden stat which adds an extra four percent increase to your movement speed as well as helping to reduce the weapons vertical recoil and hip fire spread now when you compare the ads and movement speed penalties of the org 60 round mag to those of the m4s for instance you can see that the org is very unfairly balanced with the m4 having a mere six millisecond ads time with only a three percent reduction to your movement speed so for that reason alone i'm really hoping to see a buff for the org in the not so distant future believe it or not there are many hidden stats that call of duty doesn't tell you for instance did you know that the monolithic suppressor actually adds a 15 increase to your weapons bullet velocity why this information isn't readily available within the game's gunsmith i guess we'll never know but thanks to trusted websites like cod gundata.com we can easily access this information and compare attachments to discover the best class setups for warzone and modern warfare with that said here is one final look at my org loadout for warzone this is by far the best class setup for the org in my opinion as well as my car 98 these two weapons work incredibly well together so i highly recommend that you try this loadout for yourself and let me know what you think if you want to see me play more solo warzone in the future then you can let me know by leaving a like on this video and be sure to subscribe with notifications on thank you for watching as always and hopefully i'll see you next time let's do eat nope nope yeah this chance there we go uh our first shot was a whiff that's funny no [Music] satisfaction yeah it does i love it man like and it looks so sexy you know it's part of the reason why i'm a big fan of the x50 as well i don't know if it's just me but the looks of a weapon they almost always make me feel like i'm better with the weapon you know maybe that's just me maybe it's placebo maybe it's maybelline hey where are you is that you that's you lovely we're getting somewhere now that just landed right there feels bad i feel like i add so much pressure to myself because of how i play royal games you know i'm dead good job mate that's the same guy that i could have killed so easily before and he just ruins me like that what a beast i kind of like that heartbeat solos are so weird people come out the woodworks man this einstein ain't great is it i'll get used to it holy moly footsteps oh need to be quick close enough oh you started yourself resilient you could be up in no time that was a nice car now you sure like that one that's one for my montage it's a jurassic park theme tune why did that come into my head i don't like this spot whatsoever solos is freaking scary dude onwards hmm oh there's a guy damn i'll drive oh sure let's go get him great can't get that contract did i just see his weapon stick out of that or not was it just an optical illusion what a spot capping a flag out there is there a way i can get on that building it definitely makes more sense in this moment to just hit hit up a normal buy station they tend to put these there's a guy in that roof of apartments there okay scratch that uh there was a guy there maybe my eyes were deceiving me i played too fast pace to bring up my map and actually select a a decent spot this is high risk going down here i'm just going to buy my own loadout yeah ghost it's more beneficial for solos i guess um by armor place when i inevitably get shot at grabbing this loader [Applause] oh who's camping i don't like it i hate it i hate solos i decided give me yeah that's it that's what i want no it's not that's a smoke yep there we go wow no one sniped in me okay um i did hear shots this way very faint is this the play though to you know go around a quad like a madman i just want to play for kills but you can't really do that because there's not many fights going on oh my threat's going up there [Music] like an hdr i'm gonna repeat that oh yeah maybe doesn't have a sniper hmm you're safe ah but i haven't lost track of them oh i hate it he's just gonna sit there i've legit scared him now it's gone to fire stations to choose a different tower or looks of it no my one tower wasn't high enough i didn't feel safe so [Music] wait surely you're not still up there no well i guess i'm going up wow was very risky move oh a growl oh people use the growl in this game i mean i challenged it i really didn't have to like i said i'm playing for kills if i can eliminate a camper in that situation hell yeah i'm actually if i win this gu lag i'm just going to land directly on that guy yeah stop in power with a growl mental are you even going to get anyone to fight in here i'm just going to full send on this guy like i said he's disgusting and i am disgusted although that's probably the smarter option but there he is okay i can grab my old load out here it's not all bad oh how the turns have tabled off you know give me that no screw you dude it's definitely him i know how it feels to be here by growl zone is hot on my tail i need to keep moving f this guy he really wants me dead i should have killed him also the chance some extra place there where are you i guess i kept moving fun enemy uav overhead hmm sorry for not talking much so this is actual horror territory you're losing ground where do i go now enemy uav overhead where do i want to be ideally i want to go over there [Applause] we got recon online right animation [Applause] should have taken those other place first and see those we're in the end game now five remains is the bus stop as cover this one where you coming out there probably there's another one in that car park he's pretty far out there it's another one dead there's one this way come on oh my god now my aim goes to [ __ ] that's the 1v1 easy i want to see the ggs already because we got this let's bring it home he's coughing [Music] gas is moving i even die outside his own this guy oh no fps oh we got it good work oh right right then is when i get the encoding overloaded all right ggs guys we got the solo in of course i lose all my frames in that last gunfight hell yeah g freaking g that guy with a growl caused us so much trouble thankfully he didn't kill me twice aged a few years watching that ending yeah i've just i just knocked a couple of years off my life as well mate don't worry don't worry 13 not too bad it's been a while since we've returned to solos [Music] you
