[Music] there's a bunch of guys around here i got these guys down nice good stuff actually i couldn't tell if they were where they were hello everyone and welcome back to more warzone and a special thanks to nvidia and scan computers for sponsoring today's video and you can check out the link in the description below to view scans range of geforce rtx 30 series products so then with the launch of season three warzone now supports nvidia's dlss and the results are very impressive if you haven't enabled dlss in your games before essentially dlss or deep learning super sampling uses ai to boost your in-game frame rates whilst generating sharp and detailed images and it works by reconstructing the image from a lower resolution to the output resolution of your monitor using nvidia's ai tensor cores it's so easy to enable in warzone 2. all you have to do is go to the graphics menu scroll down a little bit until you see dlss now i play on a 1440p monitor myself and so the quality setting works best for me and strikes a nice balance between visual fidelity and performance so just like that with a few easy clicks my frames have now been boosted thanks to dlss warzone also supports nvidia's reflex technology which is nvidia's new system latency reduction feature lowering the time it takes from a mouse click to an action taking place on screen this is measured in milliseconds and it makes all the difference in competitive games like warzone where as we all know every movement and shot matters things like tracking taking precise shots and reacting to different in-game situations all benefit from having lower system latency and faster input simply turn nvidia reflects on in the in-game menus and your system latency will be optimized now actually seems like the perfect time to show you the rest of my in-game settings for warzone as i do get asked quite a lot and i've used these settings for quite some time now but here's a new updated look since some of these new options have been added with that said i've got some gameplay to show you now playing with acolyte fogler and stone mountain 64 using the ram 7 and new swiss k31 sniper rifle fps counter is in the top left hand corner of your screen and loadouts are in the description as well as at the end of the video thank you guys so much for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one how did they get this plane here and how did they intend to get the plane out yeah i know people have been saying that in my comments wow yeah but i mean it's a hovercraft it's not what are they doing there's not a hovercraft though it's a hurry oh boy it's batman's i think superstore is still the spot that you drop at and then you move to this next area because it doesn't seem to be a lot of start elite that's the question right how much loot is there whole team first building they peeled off to the smaller building thug oh just shot them a little bit oh heck i got sniped down this game might be sketchy this game might be sketchy yeah that's a little i think we might need to find a different drop spot honestly what did you just oh my goodness you got some long arms better save my life now stone he's down here i'm coming god i got it so mad at me team wipe no no i did not he just didn't die to fall down it just cracks me up for some reason i got a uav they are fighting two teams fighting iran i was listening but someone is disgusting absolutely oh my god oh my god right side right side understand though let's get him started this guy was literally under the bed he was literally under the bed i couldn't see him i couldn't see i could not see him when he came if he didn't stand up i would have just walked past him you guys called him right here he was deep in here like i don't know how deep he went ahead deep in there dude oh yeah yeah that's lowered by like a floor oh yeah yes not quite as high is it okay i put a suppressor on this time and now i don't know the lead i aim just like there are people on this one body his teammates down in the purple top of purple across the street yeah it's just like the long building across i've got a hit marker on the oh geez nice tom dude this guy's cover is beyond belief get somebody on your team like tom those are definitely gonna sell i've down two on purple now they have we have somebody on our team like tom yeah i'm telling everybody else who's watching back at home stop it guys oh god right there hit him broken stop feeding my ego knock one frog oh no the one's pushing the other one's pushing i don't have knocked him knocked out are the one falling down now what are we looking at here what are you shooting oh there's a guy really far out and down i've got the loadout top roof yep they're in second floor trying to get it through the window downward fell off in the window in the walls i'm gonna push over well there's no point as being over here it's not like we can do anything right yeah i'm gonna go and take this route all right just head over it's too bad we can't wallbang it's a bit too full sound for my liking i think there's guys to the left of you as well rotating over oh come on hit one on roof on this one in the window as well broke his arm there in there live mark to target broke one bottom floor bend him through the wall one going jumped out like one outside nice one bottom right floor one on roof i think it went down though yeah i think he's behind the loadout uh i'm probably gonna go down here yeah it's behind the loadout i needed him he's jumped off question connor inside inside below could possibly be on the roof yeah there it is it's horrible for me broken broken i'm in i don't see him lying down on top sorry man there's some more dang dude there was one inside hospital bottom floor closest building i thought focus said he got him nothing oh dude look at the buy stations over here now too yeah i might have to flag my content for sexualized content after hearing that guy oh nice oh shoot there goes the ad rev but here comes the views not made for kids well this game was definitely not made for kids airstrike green roof do it oh we don't have one all right let's see airstrike i choose you nothing you know i'm just hitting the i don't even know why i'm shooting i'm honestly i'm not even in the fight you know why not exactly there's a full team over here somewhere boys i'm looking uphill up hill jesus i'm very dead broke one of them wait did i collateral break him let me just play it real quick in this window that one guy's still uphill yeah i think there's two up there one just went back to res knocked we traded dude please push this phone i'll get you i'll get you all right go go go thank you still really above me here i'm with you tom that was weird bro just cut out for some reason stop a bathroom right right right right give me the left oh wow throw that guy up here swear i saw flash come from in here i threw the stun knock the guy up knocked the guy up around right both are in here well they're uphill we saw him before yeah it's covered yeah that's his team lacrosse burger uh broken broken burgers wrecked me the zone's coming in yeah yeah i gotta check out you we got time let's just hop i'm just gonna hop i got a gas mask so i'm gonna hold this plate there is one here burger joint these guys are cracked ass snipers where from still those things just outside the window i'm fine don't don't buy plates don't play plates here oh actually i have a box out hilltop i have a box they don't have zone over there do we want to i'm trying to do a little cheating don't step on him right i think we should stick as a team yeah i think yeah i think we just pushed again get somebody on your team like tom uh yeah he's just tired of the flight anymore uh you need two pleats thank you we need one of these buildings we've covered this one before but yeah we need to get cover now someone in it snipe right right of the left buildings i'm clear i'm clear somewhere here wait frank it's purple we can make it we can make it it's a king you want to play the high there we're going to still be weak to the green building though yeah he's trying to get his teammates in clearly shouldn't we take that place then we can try and push it if you want if we all push together if it's wrong got it uh i think we need to push that so he doesn't wrestle for the team too we can try and he's all alone then we get that building too right there could be guys like in this second half i mean we have the best building that much on it yeah i thought so but you don't think this building is better well if the zone pulls off of that tallest building then you're going to be screwed because everyone's just going to beam you all right foreshadowing soldier this building's fine i don't know knocked one you have a spare plate or two uh i can give you one i have a box but i'm not with you guys i have a box tom oh my god please i am so silly but everyone's forgetting their boxes you're so silly stone i have a feeling he's gonna pick the room just to the door open below us folks careful [Applause] [Music] warming i have a feeling one's on this side of the building one's below me still i think down low knock the left was shooting me as well behind the truck yeah the truck cracking sounds broken pushing down nice knock very sick we gotta be careful below a stone copy uh so three teams that means that that guy had a teammate you just killed so his team was probably in that building that he pushed too yeah he just ran out of this building here so i'm guessing there's still one i don't know why he would run out in the open though i'm getting precision i'm coming on this side oh i couldn't see anything yes run run run around the air hold on i need to cross to you guys i'm gonna die i'm dead that is exactly what i thought was going to happen i'm not did a little bit of damage that timing was unreal come on get me down thank you he's on the roof i think just hold it just hold it there's a guy flanking outside you have a trophy in there you can put down two if you need to oh never mind you gotta thank you stone one is right here on purple ping outside nice 1v1 it should be around purple paint connor crossing into the zone well this is not good because i don't have armor he has to go in as well see your left chicabee still here still standing well [Music] yeah yeah yeah you're kind of completely forced he's already across the street there he gets to hold you yeah yeah that was a good game that was good
