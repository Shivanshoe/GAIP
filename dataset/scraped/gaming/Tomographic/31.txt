i'm on the ground commencing recon those canyons are riddled with hostiles proceed with caution zarza's exact location is unclear he normally patrols with a close protection detail and volkova will be close to a lab equipment eliminate them in whatever order you see fit all right let's do this welcome back everyone to sniper ghost warrior contracts 2. it's been a little while since i last played this game that would be an understatement i have been in its return to play through this dlc level which i believe is the only dlc they actually added to the game oh wow some sort of mining or control bombing explosions do you have other operatives in the area negative raven they may be testing ordinance or it's a training exercise yes i've been meaning to come back uh the reason i haven't come back sooner is because i didn't want these videos to feel too samey two enemies here yeah for my enjoyment and yours i don't want to keep using the same snipers and equipment in each video and that stuff takes a while to grind for so yeah we're going to showcase some of that stuff today take these guys out love that little combo i've done it so many times now in this game feels really satisfying to do all right let's interrogate this guy the rest of the patrol where are they coming to kill you not if i kill him first wrong answer buddy oh the knife flips did you see that that was cool the takedown animations are great in this game absolutely brutal all right let's keep moving i do know how long this uh mission is gonna be so it's gonna take me a while to get through i think it's about an hour long so uh i think i probably just upload the full thing instead of breaking into parts and keeping you guys waiting for more of this game i think you'll appreciate that what's this some sort of cutscene look at this very often i'm at the oasis your intel was right confirmed that's zarza's current supply hub our spy uploaded some tracking code onto volkova's laptop it's pinging from that location do you have exact coordinates  i have company need to move one drop on your skin and you're done that's what man they're right i mean they're asking to be shot by a gas arrow right what the hell i don't think the character was supposed to say that as he died got big chungus over there how do you know if you've been exposed to it i think it was a bit too late to be asking that question don't you okay let's keep moving yeah so i'm really showing off the uh the different arrow types before you do have some options which is nice oh god there's two guys here i've left those bodies at the bottom of the stairs as well can't let these guys see him let's try the sneak attack that guy just slid all the way down nothing okay let's take the high ground see what we can spot from this elevation no one's up here we're good oh yeah perfect there's two targets we've got to take out today zaza and volkova i think can't quite spot that guy the officer there i have positive id on an officer he may have intel on your objectives okay there's activity by that waterfall oh ahead of waterfall i want to take a closer look i will i don't think i need to take out this entire area just focus on the enemies in my way well i will show you is this little toy which is if we place it down there we go this is a remote sniper which i can tag enemies with like that and then if i line up an enemy fire the turret and then take the shot at the same time there we go clean head shot back of the cranium and that guy's dead as well how cool is that oh let's not forget my sniper bot good boy all right stop down so apparently this guy has information i need for my objectives don't turn around i need to interrogate you there we go volkova's lab where is it it's at the back of the temple excavations in a room that won't cover uses thanks for the tip could have knocked him out but last thing we need is this entire base on our asses oh here we go eyes up yes love the bow that was a regular arrow wasn't it i think so yeah would have known otherwise stumped this guy in the bush yeah there's gas arrows and explosive arrows and the regular ones of course careful of this sniper i want to get spotted by you just want to check out this waterfall there was a guy that walked in here earlier so i don't know what to expect i do love a secret waterfall entrance though i'll climb up here yeah i can need to remember whenever i see those ropes i can climb let's go right here bless you oh what a throw the strength i must have to throw a knife at that speed insane all right we're clear i need to take care of cameras though this looks like the place take that out is this the laptop oh this is the laptop hack so this is the logistics data the volkova house control i have the data from volkova's laptop exit points on your map should you choose to exfiltrate now cheeky knife to the face okay yeah apparently volkova has uh poisoned the local water supply so i'm here take that camera come on there we go i'm here to collect samples and kill volkova take her off the radar a few enemies out here it's going to sneak past going to be in this area now yeah so volkov is the first target i'm hunting and then i need to eliminate zaza who's an arms dealer careful of this guy let's just uh sneak up behind and nice to meet you you're dead let's hide this body it's a bit precarious just dump him in the tent it's good enough i could have put them in a box to be there it's fine let's take out this uh juggernaut looking fella big chungus as i like to call him come on guys over there but got the armor piercing rounds now so i can deal with him this scope's interesting it's got a weird sort of crosshair i like it that's a clean kill though oh yeah that bullet is so massive by the way looks really cool okay don't need to loot that guy let's get the hell out of here on to the next objective which is volkova herself i'm happy your return to clean up those loose ends raven well the pay is good after all and i do enjoy working with you oh easy now am i tear up big softy i always knew there was an underlying bromance between these two said the zip line down raven i have a new target for you head to the mark location for more information okay uh a random bounty has just started without any evidence guys right there i didn't even see him all you ever do is complain take him out with the gas arrow again shall we yes i wonder where those missing bodies are outside the village if we're lucky you can harvest their tissue samples more safely oh my god die quieter all right no saves from this point on it just said so gotta try and do this in one go i guess there's a lot of enemies those guys running good tag five enemies in less than three seconds without interrogation all right i mean i'll take the xp it's fine well that's everyone i can see oh control they're burning the bodies oh and destroying any evidence get a tissue sample before it's too late i need a sample of their tissue lovely all right let's take these guys out go for this one first upper mass this is so extra i do love it that's a dead man right there this sniper by the way is the mssr-10 which has an integral sound suppressor looks awesome there we go got the enemy sniper getting into position go for the headshot just for wind speed just listen to that sound so good the sniping is so satisfying in this game big trungus what are you doing you're not just gonna stand there are you the whole time let's see what he does ah yes inside the building what does he do next stand still nice that's what i wanted beauty oh he just died on the window silver hopefully no one sees him another enemy there switch back to normal rounds that's a secondary guy down low see what these guys do the other two over there as well that could line up for a collateral i mean it doesn't get more brutal than that in this game send his hairdo into a freaking watermelon baby no way he was about to dive through that window not a chance oh that was a close one i just thought why haven't i put my sniper bot down so we're really handy here zarza's men are sweeping the village check these guys out raven they're on clean up making sure they haven't missed any bodies yeah we love that i think this is the best opportunity i'm gonna get to take these guys out don't know how i'm gonna do it though can't really get the collateral there can i um oh i could have done it there it's okay it's too risky i mark the one guy with my bot take him out that is so satisfying dude what the hell look at that i love it that was worth the investment good job this thing's awesome feels like a cheat code just makes me want to play this game with like a buddy like if this was a duo co-op game or something i would be sick okay it's time to take the plunge this is deep enough right yeah yeah we're good 10 out of 10 entry call me tom daley well i've seen the rocks tumble down the canyon that's really cool okay that's a vehicle of some sort what was that go this way there's a rope there climb up if i can yeah i don't know how many enemies are left because i couldn't mark everyone from up there wait did i check this left side oh there's two there try and lurl them with a decoy trap i've upgraded this as well so if i do that yeah who you running to who you run into boys stay down so overkill that's the that's the charm of this game that's why i love it so much getting all the new unlocks and testing out new weapons and gadgets it's awesome okay there's a lot of people here and there's one there as well i missed how am i gonna do this let's go come around the corner okay you're an easy kill almost made the mistake of shooting him whilst i was zeroed at 100 meters guy however is 100 meters and his life has come to an end oh no he heard that oh how did i get away with that that was that was way too close where are you going now inside he's not leaving though so and try and kill him through this window there we go oh no some of them don't die on the first shot when it's up a mass must be the caliber of this gun i'm not sure it's not making a big enough hole i've got the armor piercing rounds in i'm gonna try and get the collateral i knew i heard steps how long have you been there and how many people have i not marked all right let's try and find an angle this looks good enough no one else nearby let's go prone back of the neck no way you survived okay that was messy i just had to use all of my armor piercing rounds and that's gonna be expensive no way is there more two uh okay that worked [Music] yeah have that almost got blasted by a shotgun sweet all right let's get these uh tissue samples damn that's never a pretty sight no it's not control all tissue samples are secured solid copy exit the area raven move on to the field lab it's near the river roger that i'll locate the water samples precisely all right off to the field lab just this way those are all the bodies of the people that lived in that small village their water supply was sadly poisoned there's another vehicle i've got time to investigate got enough jobs to do how do i climb this i don't i go through this look how cool this bow is man it's just so cool looking isn't it let's change back to my normal arrows lots of rocks falling off these canyons i don't want to take a rock to the head that'd be a sad way to go out where's that enemy looking at me i don't even know if i'm going the right way right now i'm supposed to go up or to the weekend off in right i know please there are enemies nearby it's a bit clunky to parkour but i guess the job done don't go through there oh i guess this way because there's enemies i'm not sure hitting with a gas such a good way of taking out a couple of guys at once damn i'll just die already we got nothing no loot one decoy trap there we go let's go down there and knife i kind of want that back now there's mine's everywhere here what have i stumbled across here we go oh i see them these things have caught me up before if i scan you can see them oh wait you can disarm them can't you i forgot there we go walk through these ones nice now what's over here secret cave perhaps honor why is valkova slumming it with zarza apparently a research methodology was too extreme for the russians in what way she's in here live subject testing even the gru has its limits inside this body i don't think it should be this easy for me probably should have been out there somewhere i guess i found a secret way see what she has to say yes of course but your men need to be more careful no i cannot conduct proper research under these conditions no no these are dangerous and volatile compounds tell them to stop before i there's a brief phone call the last one you'll ever make damn what a way to go volkova won't be running anymore tests come here that's another name crossed off you see that boys safely now check him out i snuck past you and killed your boss how do you feel about that she needed better protection and you failed i found a bush i'm hiding in the bush because there might be snipers about let's take these dudes out i'm going to try and get the back guy and as his buddy reacts shoot him in the back lovely jubbly thank you absolutely no loot on them whatsoever but i have the high ground now is there anyone with higher ground yes there is a sniper who doesn't look very friendly how far away is he 150 meters you shoot him 100 then that's a normal round right yeah no i killed him with a luring bullet it's gone just rolling down the cliff i love that switch back to my normal rounds then i need to remember to show you those there's no near me is there no okay sniper bot is set up so tag one of these actually there's a few more who might see that there's a jammer somewhere oh right in front of me kill that you're not gonna hear it are you that's done the job now i can mark these guys without it being interfered this one's gonna be tricky there's a lot of enemies here in such a small space and big chungus of course is the lab in there no it can't be must be one of the tents there down there all right then i'm gonna take out this guy where's he going stand still okay okay good i'll take this guy out with the remote sniper and i'll kill this dude 100 meters that is so sick now these two hopefully don't see the body you can have a chat okay good game in the shoulder there we go that's a kill shot oh it gets pretty intense this game you know because you're so far away from it all that one wrong move i'll put the whole base on alert there's a go binoculars there needs to be careful of him how am i going to do this let's move from bush to bush maybe let's go for it it's the law i'd say just dunk my head under the water okay we made it yeah tunnel vision how close are they oh no okay thankfully i've got this convenient moat that i can use to slip by all right what are these guys up to looking right at me oh my god there's a guy there as well i didn't mark don't see me don't see me don't see me going to put an arrow in his neck there we go oh i got my arrows back too cool i didn't see that before okay i don't really need to deal with these guys i can just try and slip by all these two up to we're just facing that way so i can't even sneak past if i kill them there then everyone's gonna see it so uh i'm just gonna have to go for it go go go go go go go stay prone no you don't oh my god i made it i need to grab his body this guy up here too saw nothing you saw nothing put my knee to your face okay hide the evidence he's just chilling dumping back here where no one can see this looks like a lab doesn't it it has to be the other ten i can't find the samples that's a collectible so he's going to spot me if i'm not careful i'll throw a rocket in see if he gets baited by that yeah he's coming he's coming all right wait till he gets to 15 meters he's in the tent and he's dead i don't use those rocks as much as i should i don't know how i'm gonna get past these guys didn't mean to throw that i'm not gonna lie oh no he's gonna die in the open i have to kill him oh my god are we good you didn't see anything where's the samples there they are control oh no samples are secured let's get the hell out of here careful you don't break them i'd hate to lose my best operative copy that exfiltrate when you're ready locations marked on your map should be safe i don't think they found me out i'm 000 meters again why do i keep doing that i haven't adjusted for the distance just die big chungus switching to armor piercing i think he's the last one and he's dead a sigh of relief i mean i definitely could have done that a lot cleaner probably killed everyone before i even entered but i got the samples i got out of there and then brought the fight to me instead of bringing it to them i'm not mad about it i guess i need to go up here because i see it there's a crashed helicopter regardless i want to check it out uh over there so i mean the particle's just a bit janky isn't it like the animations aren't very clean i think dynalite 2 spoiled me i'm going to make a parkour video on that game soon so that should be fun this is cool black hawk down someone's been there before me i set up these ropes i guess this is a bit sketchy isn't it i don't want to fall down a canyon okay this is the next area yes it is that entry point is well defended the surrounding hills are honeycombed with old tunnels there might be an easier way in that must be zarza what's over there zarza is tearing one off his man down there this could get interesting is he killing his own guys wow he executed him seems you don't get to fail zaza twice okay big man with a big gun i see how it is this looks like a good elevation oh my god this guy's right there almost ran straight into him all right let's move into position i need to make sure this tower is clear where's my relief sit tight probably not a good idea to uh throw a knife in the back of someone's head whilst they're on the phone to someone it's a bit suspicious isn't it c4 decoys stun grenades all the supplies okay two below me to here oh there's a jammer again where is that there there's a man right next to it but he's leaving however i can't shoot that until i've killed him so it's time for bullet time bang and your head is gone okay jammer down anyone else near that dude that might see him i really don't want him to get spotted two guys there one up there so everyone one here one out there as well radio and then these two that i can mark earlier what are they guarding those the tunnels ah big chunkus is having a conversation and i can't mark that guy there we go one there too he might find the body it's just exposed in the middle there there's one that i missed okay we'll take these guys out first make sure i'm using the right rounds is he gonna stand still beauty oh what a lovely picture that was hope nobody's eating while watching this oh my god like i fell in the hole love that okay sniper bot i choose you help me out but before that drop in on this guy say hello take out his body real quick give him the pat down and uh throw him in the bush i wanted to chuck him off the cliff but it's too far away i'm lazy okay that's him dealt with let's go back into my hideout where i can assess the situation and take out bad guys getting dizzy spinning around this staircase let's go up a level yeah having this sniper tower it just makes me want to play this game in co-op like imagine having someone who like scouts with you like ghost recon where you like both take an enemy out at the same time it used to be so much fun but i'll do it myself oh that's so handy just gotta trust this doing its job you see the guy that i killed look at him through the arm damn right we'll take this guy out he's in the open he's a lot more easily seen so let's switch to the luring bullets i was talking about earlier okay he's gonna stop there will he go down there is the question yes he will back to the normal rounds not ap thank you what's down here just your body got him that right there was a violation personally i wouldn't have it this guy should be easy enough to take out lovely the watermelon effect i like to call that now for you two i don't really know what to do there's a sniper up there as well didn't even see him and he didn't see me somehow after all this time you are doing a terrible job my friend you should be fired how have you not seen half of your men just disappear i suppose i'm the one to blame i couldn't even see him all right there's not much else i could do from that elevation so let's see what these tunnels are all about up down here oh there we go the safe way down oh this is perfect it's a great way to close the gap i love the level design in this game it's really well done there's the butcher zaza let's get a good look at him oh he's a beefy lad look at the size of that machete machete is an understatement turrets there as well okay let's get a move on i need to find an angle to try and collapse those two guys that i saw having a chat on the far left side so anyway i can take them both out at once oh no you don't no company here anyone hear that so many guys i miss that are just like hiding behind cover what are you doing would you like a throwing knife i can't stand up when i have it in my hands i'll do right gonna thread the needle not here not here either unless he leans into the shot which is not going to come on lean into the shot lean into the shot yes no oh that's so annoying come on yes there it is oh that sound that gave me tingles and the butcher's none the wiser he's a big lad isn't he he's putting big chunks to shame and spot me don't spot me i'm going in for the kill i'm gonna humiliate him he's got all this armor this massive machete on his back no no no no no no no one's safe to a knife in the throat take that butcher i see the enemy you see nothing sorry exfiltration location it's got bars there's another guy on my left that i didn't know about hey where is he i swear i heard someone oh he's on the radar over here gotcha turn around big boy look at me this way come on show me about there it is shot the grenade on his belt that's how we deal with uh with the last guy there's no concern to make noise after everyone's dead don't need to worry about the turrets they're no problem need to go and check up top here because can i make this yeah that's a bit risky and go through here parkour up the other side yeah i killed a sniper up here so i'm thinking since this is accessible probably another way in instead of going past the turrets there we go go down here through this hole in the wall oh my god your primary objective is the data contained on the informant's phone understood avoid enemy engagement if possible i want our spy alive for a debrief later look at this place this is so cool something like the bond movies it's like a villain's lair okay i'm gonna deal with these i'm gonna set the sniper tower up just in case put that there but steps to my left oh god he's up top that's the informant so i need to keep him safe this guy will switch to luring rounds shoot there it's too late for you mate that worked he's none the wiser dude those luring rounds are sick i barely use those who are you oh that's the officer uh okay let's tag you tag you as well second target i don't have to kill these guys but i don't see another way to keep the informant alive i'm coming over the bridge that guy to his right is still tagged as number one so if i kill you as soon as that guy's inside the office okay he's in you see what i did there kill this guy i shot the guy with the arrow and then the turret killed the guy to the right of him these two are marked by the turret so this is zipline no should be that'd be cool i need to wait for him to leave the office now come on i'll just go this way there we go he's moving kill him when it's safe now what's up next snap that's so satisfying kill that guy with a turret who's this oh that's that's the informant why are you running what's that's phone yeah i have a cell phone let's go oh my god there's more there we go let's get out of here inform us the last one alive oh my god i didn't think i was gonna make that yeah he's the last one that was awesome performance will be safe in there until someone picks him up it's time for me to extract though that was so much fun i love this game it really has its moments i can't believe i pulled that off [Music] you
