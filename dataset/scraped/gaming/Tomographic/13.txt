hello everyone and welcome to sniper elite five baby i'm very very very very excited for this i hope you guys are too if you are make sure to smash like that's what the youtubers say smash like on the stream um are we live we're live right we're live on the youtubes yeah okay youtube's lying to me um let's try this again welcome to the stream we're playing sniper league five today special thanks to rebellion for giving me this early press code so uncover this view this game isn't out until the 25th so uh marky calendars if it's one you're excited for um hit a like on the stream i'm gonna get gonna get right into this the last series i did for was a sniper ghost warrior contracts two you guys showed insane support for completely blew me away and i did the maths the other day and it i think it amassed like 13 million views across seven episodes which yeah really blew my expectations away so if you want to see more of this let it be known and uh yeah i'll get right on it what my plan is for today i think the uh the mission length is probably like an hour average um i've been given permission to play three missions um first three essentially let me know if the volume's okay by the way the music might be a bit loud um so i've got three missions that i can play but i think i'm gonna do the first two in this live stream i don't wanna rush through it um i do like the stealth aspect of these games i've always been a fan of these ones but this is the first one i've covered on the channel so i'm excited i haven't done so much as far a bullet yet so let's see how this goes i've only jumped in a game to get my sensitivity right i thought i figured that'd be important before i attempt to do that in game just gets a bit messy doesn't it but let's do this new campaign what difficulty let's do let's do hard what's this oh that's cool okay so you can change the um the difficulty will also change the the hud and the elements that are appeared the live on the hud i guess i'll do medium hud just so i can talk over the mechanics and stuff okay let's do it otherwise a lot of elements will be off screen it's not as easily readable for you guys but i appreciate you all tuning in hope you're all having a good day let's get into this this game is set in 1944 by the way set in france and there's a bit of a story here as well captain says we'll be surfacing in five clear on your orders we wait for air cover from our boys in the raf once they start their raid we use the distraction break on the beach your team destroys the coastal defenses to the west i neutralize the defenses here and proceed inland to rendezvous with blue viper at the safe house in town as quietly as possible i don't want to come back to the beach and find the place crawling with germans if they spot the sub before you blow those guns me and my team will be stuck here i can do quiet you'd better oh baby look at that sub all right that's our cue okay fair burn there are the searchlights show me what you can do hey let's do this those search lights up take them out look at that basically to eliminate the searchlights should scout the shoreline binoculars spot my targets oh they're actually being operated by some men right click to aim your weapon okay you can also do this as well which is cool obviously it's a third person game i might need to change my sensitivity a little bit it feels really high um show you guys the graphics settings over here too so it's kind of bare bones on the advanced uh scale but you can do all of the hud and stuff which i think is pretty unique for this game there is also like a multiplayer element too where like i mean the game will have like a traditional multiplayer like tdm i guess style mode um but it also has this thing similar to what's that game i played recently um basically another player can join your session and try and kill you you can disable that i've disabled it for the first episode crossplay is honest to as well that's also new with this game um let's do 15 i guess you can't scale in increments was a shame space for active empty lung even okay let's just hold breath essentially we've got the bullet cam which we love [Music] holy it's loud that was sick one left take him down yeah and you obviously have the uh the x-ray vision too which is awesome how's the volume guys i feel like it might be a bit on the loud end huh speech volume will do a little bit down sound effects that should be good hopefully less pausing from now on right same again old space boom oh you poor guy yeah that's a dead man that's a dead man i'll get my man you secure the beach and we'll follow when everyone's clean badass all right see you on the other side sullivan there's also some close quarter stuff in this as well you obviously have your smgs and pistols you get a full loadout which is sick got to secure the beach head the louder the better safe for the rangers better get to it nice we love that the water looks pretty good prone to get ahead see the ground hold c to go prone that's weird not used to having that on the same key but should be able to climb my way up there it's a good vantage point down on the beach a bandage i'm not gonna get hit what are you talking about climbing vines oh i killed you didn't i search i think i've grabbed all i can it's got such a deep voice you guys say i have a deep voice this is something else it sounds like uh i can't give away my kratos should take him down quietly hide in the bushes apparently if you listen to the dialogue the enemies say too you can get intel from them pacify or kill she go he'll be part of a patrol should keep to the shadows knocked him unconscious do i want that mp40 is that what the p stands for in in mp40 i'm pissed all right here we go i sprint too slight jog i can do all right we'll throw you in there eat can we keep moving oh someone's up there look bottles i think i can mark people with a scope too but it doesn't last as long what are you doing taking some pills on the job clear on that side i do have a uh a gadget wheel too this is all the stuff that's on me my heels whistle make a sound or draw near nearby enemies towards you okay that's equipped in the bottom right now i can do it whilst on this i have to check i have to see if there's a ledge take down oh god there is i punched him in the dick live sensors i always get questions about that i've got a go xlr that allows me to censor whilst i'm live uh no usable items booby trap i don't wanna waste a grenade on that no one's gonna come over here already amazing what's this it felt like a loot box or something oh it's one of these high body there we go it only started like only lit up when i uh when i picked up the body another thing to climb here but hello script officer is likely to have something important on him should check the body imagine if you had third person view in real life oh house key military this is live should have a look see what's going on here according to this yes good resistance cell in the town last week it must be blue vipers network leads the same way subsonic ammo nazis must have found it and put this to good use keep my shots quiet how do i change my ammo type okay subsonic ammo you can still get weapon attachments and stuff like suppressors but this will be interesting got two guys up to no good [Music] brutal i can also control the speed of the uh what's it got there no i can control the speed of the bullet cam i don't like that look out there but it's fine keep on moving got to secure my contact can't just leave them to die if they've been captured how's the volume guys we're good the batter balanced now can't find anything else can't find anything else yeah through the year we love that um it's a photo mode too look we love that that'll be great for my thumbnails um sorry just let's check something on my second screen getting some uh some donations and members hello welcome big ben thank you for two dollars man glad you're enjoying the content uh margie miller just became a member and sweatpant as well thank you guys appreciate you volume's all good sweet i love immersing myself in games like this so um i'm hoping it'll be a good playthrough i figured i'd do a live one since my sniper ghost warrior series went down so well and a lot of people are asking for me to do it live so starting this out with maybe the first two missions oh no there's x-ray cam for that too i did the whistle i pressed after whistle right before i killed him so toxic oh man all right what's this bigger compound here where they're holding the resistance got to get past these nazis and get inside it's got mocked oh hi mark okay um oh i can shoot that engine huh how do i draw attention to something if i do this will they go towards it or they see me i don't know okay so much stealth i thought the explosion at least take one of them out you just shoot me oh my god this game is brutal no scope you i tried it i had to try it you know moment i saw that you could blow that up useful i don't think there's like stones that you can throw so how was that one my command thing come on got to get in there before it's too late charlie thanks i just needed a distraction oh she's scottish whether or not is better this time of year but france has better food you're my contact you're the desert ghost i should have known good to see you blue viper yeah leo cho is that code name not me but they found us anyway in spite of all the codes betrayed maybe i think so i can't be sure they tried to make us talk and when we wouldn't my god they killed the whole town everyone all thanks to our bastard named muller they split us up some of my men might still be alive somewhere in this place we have to i'll find him you're in no shape to fight where can we meet all right you win the safe house is blown there's a farmhouse just north of the town i'll find it uh one more thing one of my men marcel he had information in a loose panel under his bed the key for it was sewn into the hem of his trousers they may not have found him yet look for the house with the yellow brick work ugliest thing in the village you can't miss it got it [Music] as good to see you again you two old friend it's good they've got like a native scots do the voice acting usually like a lot of games just get someone who can do a scottish accent um bolt cutters can hear voices through those walls i can see him do i focus um left all there we go nice hang on i can use the ball cards i just found to break that instead of pick locking that's cool armory this would be a good place to check my weapons before hitting the field stuck up on supplies as well did it tell me how to focus what did i just not read that but i missed the hint for it can't get in there some nades m1903 oh look she tells me there starts in the bottom right that's cool all right workbench so this way you do the attachments uh change one of your weapons select it okay keep what we've got several look low uh multiple zoom uptake yeah i want that one don't care about recoil it's a sniper rifle so supposed to be noticeable on the uh the semi-autos on it reduce recoil rigid vehicle recoil i do not care for recoil prevent stability slower reloads short travel trigger faster rate of fire put that on oh got some weapon camos too light elm looks nice isn't it i kind of just want a suppressor for my pistol my gear at any other workbenches i find that's wrong with you keep an eye out keep my loadout on point for the job on the road again bomb do a scottish accent that's it it's terrible isn't it it's kind of whack when they fake accents yeah definitely uh georgie thanks for coming remember new trunks as well appreciate it oh the slo-mo shell cam okay oh no rip the boys that's the sub i was just on nazi bastards tom we've got to get some people to like your stream all right everyone that radar tower is still operational your mission if you choose to accept it is to like the stream there's the radar looks like the air raid didn't take it out it's a vehicle coming down the road to do this the old-fashioned way have to do this the old-fashioned way what what is that you didn't tell me yeah they're gonna see me if i just stand there the how was that just walked into the tree and my camera faced like did a 180 oh there's an explosive barrel there sorry boys my bit too close sheesh well if anyone's nearby they're never gonna hear that aren't they oh god oh jesus i didn't even take any damage it was just like get away from this fire let's hope no one comes a looking it's fine um let's look at the map oh my god is that me jesus it's just this one mission too i think um okay so that's where i'm going and i need to kill someone here objectives find and kill stefan beckendorf rewards mp40 and walked over like six of those so i don't really want it although i guess it actually gives it me doesn't it whereas if i just see it on the ground it temporarily gives it me find the radar's power source i thought i was dropped oh i picked up the sniper in that room oh god that was such a sick animation that's what i take down oh they're walking away yeah they've completely split up so bullet time with the pistols what oh look i can control the speed that's how you do it w and s maybe trap the vehicle with a grenade that was so overkill satchel charge objective update is well placed actual charges should weaken the pillars okay so i need to get up there it is indeed 95 comes out on a 25th this isn't sponsored but i did get a press key early which is very kind of them you guys seem to enjoy these playthroughs so if you want more it's entirely dependent on you gotta let it be known let the algorithm notice engage engage with the stream if you're watching the vaude engage with the video you've seen me i know i've got myself stuck i don't know if i can jump actually i've tried it like space doesn't actually do anything i wonder if it's on a different key where's that guy that saw me it's not in range okay i need to use the trenches i think is he in the battlement there has to be there there's another one next to him so i need to act fast just blew out both of his eyeballs there we go fired while still still in the slo-mo oh no i think they discovered body over the houses [Music] you hold your breath in this game yeah it's called empty lung um hold space to do it there is an active reload system in this game too with some of the weapons which is cool leveled up and earned a skill point skill points what combat equipment body i'll give you in focus longer it takes for the effects to wear off medkit can be used to revive yourself when incapacitated i mean yeah that one's equipped so we'll buy this one then heck yeah mgm placements deal extremely high damage capture them to use their firepower for yourself that's what saw me i don't know how far away these guys are they're investigating cause they found a body tell me on the map new medicine there wasn't it no it's not okay just facing the wrong way but plant explosives on the radar's pillars i should be able to bring it trenches should keep me out of sight get me closer to the radar sorry to call you over quarters though better stay alert nothing else [Music] sheesh yeah active reload so um see this so if i which i just did there i got the active reload um if you've played gears of war essentially you get a faster reload if you time the reload so there's like a window of opportunity for you to press the reload key again you said that reminder do not move whilst trying to aim because you get a widened crosshair see i missed the reload there so it took a little longer for me to complete it it's a cool mechanic i love it when we add it to games i don't know if a first person shooter has done it before though i'm very loud when i run too so i'll be wary of that maybe i should make an effort to at least conceal the body somewhere the guards seem to actually patrol the trenches i'll just stay in one position silenced oh my god it's between stg isn't it so if i take this it doesn't unlock it for me i just carry it so when i swatch switch weapon it just drops on the ground so i actually need to unlock it by completing some sort of objective or task i guess later in the game i need to climb that plant satchels it's a bit too massive that gun to be wandering around here silenced mp400 oh yeah you're right star wars battlefront did have reload shot his helmet off so they're aware of me in the vicinity but no one's able to like they're hearing stuff but they don't know that there's an actual target they're just investigating so i'm doing all right so far nice balance of stealth and action give me that before you back where was it this one could be careful switching weapons otherwise i drop it maybe if i can find the generators i can disable the radar sounds like they're in here oh sugar limb shot something tells me this body is worth searching okay they heard that you see on the map now that some red bubbles weapons empty out of ammo damn it they raise them all they run to the alarm no [Music] screw your alarm just shot it and destroyed it love that what's this oh that's for a multiplayer aspect a crowbar just what i need for sabotaging nazi installations here foreign [Music] hell yeah officers command and coordinate the axis enemies target them first to weaken enemy resolve noted all right we're a bit messy right now would have been difficult to pick all of these guys off with a sniper rifle since he said i had to go close quarters so let's say we're doing all right trench networks connected to the radar control bunker that's one way in what's this plan satchel charge light fuse quick or slow let's do quick it's a big charge isn't it look at that explosion to be pretty big i hear the generators no goodies in here no oh i needed that crowbar that i found gotta find a breaker switch so i can fry the whole system cables will lead to the circuit breaker um this isn't part of my objective but we'll do it [Music] the map of the area is anti-air defenses okay i should pay these a visit you can aim down machine guns now love that got a slow reload that sucks oh god i have to whip the camera out of oh they're on to me now guys i'm okay with this let's heal up it's just so close quarters now so like being third person isn't really helping me oh [Music] stay down it's all good when i aim over this like left shoulder because the character is obviously always aiming with the right so the aim doesn't always feel completely accurate what is that [Music] another charge [Applause] okay that's got very wide spread i can't actually loot him from there it's fine all clear there we go thank god for that all right how do i get up there there's a ladder you sent your body you find ammo intel or items oh so claustrophobic what did i need to follow the cables for some sort of circuit breaker at least the cables looks the same doesn't it oh yeah okay it's literally marked for me generators destroyed the radar is just an expensive hunk of scrap that should keep our boys in the bombing oh okay so i could have blown up with the charges but if i found the intel first by going in that's cool so there's like multiple different ways you can do certain objectives i like the openness of the map too i wasn't really expecting this it's a good size um yes we're completing this area now these are the side objectives that got marked destroy those on the way just mark them so i know where i'm going no they're already bright blue gotta cut the lights yeah yeah we gucci oh yeah my heart rate make some beautiful cover so my heart rate's in the bottom right there which impacts all sorts of things my stability i guess reload time movement probably my breath too how long i can hold my breath for that sounds like a big gun must be what hit the submarine i need to find it and take it out it's a bit of a crouch slide how fast gonna go prone from full sprint nice okay anyone around now what's this fella god i got subsonic yeah [Music] so satisfying that's funny like a cartoon character doesn't make it any less brutal though oh sick that's a nice little animation if you can't get up something so there's a noise meter at the top there that you can see whenever there's a loud noise it basically covers my shots oh god the more you fire the wider the spread no point using my subsonics right now is there what's that one i'm up here soon [Applause] i like how it comes back to me too this bullet cam it's really smooth just stuck that one didn't you right [Music] an enemy can hear you yeah okay um who's the guy that i sniped you can actually use the mg look at that holy you're just gonna hand wield this only got one bullet left can't go prone with it either no ammo weapons empty yo that's sick that's crazy guys you won't believe this mg 42 build in warzone okay so we'll blow these quick views get the hell out of here cool guys don't look at explosions any second now there we go get a cut scene anyway phoebe thanks for coming to member appreciate you happy saturday and g maritz with the membership as well thanks guys hey tommo thanks to you i got sniper ghost warrior contracts i've been loving it so far keep it up hell yeah man love to hear it it's crazy how well that series did i mean considering the game wasn't exactly it's hardly a triple a shooter is it but just insane i know this is quite different in terms of i mean there will be some long shot opportunities no doubt this part of the mission so far is just pretty close quarters but i hope you're enjoying it nonetheless decoy no way so will they just shoot that oh this thing over there how do i jump space doesn't jump ah it's just automatic when you have a ledge to jump towards gotcha i mean it makes sense otherwise you'd have like face members jumping around corners and no scoping people i've done that one what does i mean there's an eye on my minimap look sabotage your vehicle to create a loud area okay ah more in tow nice animations gotta say they're really impressive so far atlantic wall building all that to keep the british out good luck i'll keep those on screen temporarily so you can pause and read them if you're watching it as a vod or you can even pause the live stream on youtube which is great can i get over this doesn't look like i can phase trick shot is playing sniper elite five you know it should post full campaign gameplay vids on youtube two sniper league five seems like a game for you after all yeah i mean that's the plan if the series does well i mean this is the technically the first episode i'm gonna put parts one and two in this uh live stream i think depending on how long this one is how many enemies we've got here my barely seeing that there we go sorry mate that's disgusting no dentist will fix that jesus christ oh get dunked on someone else to see me this way i think oh i don't need to leave much tonight right he's doing it okay let's just plant the satchel oh boy there's a lot of them around here [ __ ] grenade oh my god a weft my descent is slightly too high change that in a bit anyone else one bullet left since the last time i used this oh is that everyone there's two red circles between me right now what the crouch slide so there is a guy over here enemies in a loud area the hearing is reduced i said where are you [Music] is there anyone i guess not all right we've cleared it right what was this thing break open some ammo back i've just wasted and we keep on going how do i actually get through this a rest in the heart right back i didn't loot that safe tonight i don't want that still marked on my map oh it's down this road isn't it it's a yellow marker on my map that shows the that must be the gun that took out the submarine that's where he can land shells in dover this will come in very useful [Music] [Music] silence general oh [Music] oh yes [Music] just a bit off the top barber what is that what's the pistol okay last one i mean we literally can't really stealth this because i'm just blowing stuff up everywhere as soon as it blows they hear it and come running should make things easier for us and harder for the nazis the radar is on the bottom left screen shows the preview amount the radar shows approximate locations of enemies and a white circle that displays the distance you're visible from oh i see okay it's good to know um what's this that's fair for them all right let's do some sniping shall we let's heal up a bit as well how can i deal with these guys without alerting the other okay i wasn't really like fully in the bush there just go for it and he's caught in buds [Applause] um not really the place for a mine is it [Music] no barry we went to school together he was like a son to me i think i've grabbed all i can yoink oh right between them i'll make them stop though i'll blow the engine it's on a weak spot so wildly inaccurate this thing cut power alarms [Music] no way he sees me my first death caught in the open feels bad almost a thousand likes already jesus there's a lot of enemies in that compound he did not see that coming oh no as if you've made that joke i'll have to kill everyone again do i actually this might work out in my favor because now i know a vehicle comes down this road oh but it's coming sooner than it did before telemine pressure mine i think they just go up and down maybe they're very good at spotting aren't they [Music] [Applause] another vehicle oh god there's a guy right there not again [Music] heal heal heal okay i think what i want to do is take the tower that they're in if i can stealth past these vehicles are ruining me though coming soon and they did in the first time around you see nothing you see nothing fully bandaged i don't know how you're supposed to take both of these guys out okay we've got one right on me here which i didn't know before i'm not going to set the mind because it's going to be too loud brought too much attention [Music] come on we must have done it oh my god are you telling me the shrapnel of the shell itself killed the second guy very careful tom oh damn it i saw me am i shooting the fence there we go i need cover okay this is pain this is pain this is complete pain i can't i can't go in those bushes anymore i'm running too direct i need to be over here again do exactly what i did last time it was worth it for the collateral i underestimated the ability of the enemies and they've proved to me that they're not to be messed with so let's take a breath slow it right down we know where they're coming from now too certain enemies have alerted themselves and ran from certain areas okay subsonic rounds check you first that's a youtube short that's a tick tock right there okay get a go behind him first these two are collateral again nobody on the mg right now holy these guys are on a fight it's cute oh they see me in this grass don't they yeah go and keep driving oh my god he dug the shot thought that was my pistol i thought that was my pistol i know i've gone really loud and pain is about to be caused you're gonna spark me in that grass i'm just gonna chill just gonna chill there we go they're just looking for me now it's a difficult area i double tapped all there by mistake and skip the active reload do me a favor run him over does he think he sees me yeah he does another one there what do i have whistle for whistle they're all gonna hear me what please don't oh my god it didn't give me the melee prompt are you kidding me i could have pulled him into the grass it could have i could have pulled them into the grass [Music] if they won it they got it [Music] [Applause] hmm they've triggered the alarm okay it's on like donkey kong need his armor usable items [Music] [Music] [Applause] i really wanted to stealth that but this area just does not bode well for stealth that guy's running for the vehicle on the left [Music] this helmet off [Music] sniper ammo now that sucks that really sucks [Music] damn einstein cannot yeah this isn't the one [Music] i wonder what they were carrying [Music] well that was messy but they're just hunting for me now can't find anything else can't always go your way but it shows you there's multiple ways that you can play this game definitely i just let my uh my in-game heart rate go down as well as my irl heart rate got some sniper hammer back which we love you've got to use cannon fire to cover your shots yeah and then you're right i just didn't really have much of an option after they'd noticed me it's not going to stop them from searching for me even if i do take them out almost like endlessly reloading this oh no is it bugged i think it's bugged still have a landmine over there and i fixed it okay cool make sure to pass that on not that i know how i triggered it okay let's get mine under that as well try this again [Applause] i'm doing well patrick thanks for asking i'll be good okay they're still in that same spot am i hitting the fence i don't get it [Music] i ran out of subsonic didn't i so like kind of uh of options for the ammo [Music] let's skip it too just cool i do have ear shot there's a guy there i'll figure out where this dude sees me [Music] i need to start using my binoculars more before i approach a compound like this because that is not how i wanted that to go that was so messy fun but messy stressful but fun my time to take a sip i thought it was gonna be a slow animation for the crouch sliders absolutely maniacs [Music] adolf's got an endless supply of enemies [Music] i think i can get around this way anyway okay [Music] not the way i came back the way i came back there's too many there's too many men too many many men he's got an endless supply i don't know where i found the subsonic ammo before but it was super useful okay all of these guys are still alive good to know i wasn't sure where it saved me it was right where i just died [Music] just so you're aware guys this game definitely punishes you on the harder difficulties i can confirm [Music] my bushes i can hide in here just trying to wait for him to come out of combat uh scottish vet thanks for coming remember matt matt as well uh blanco well long with the ten dollars so far for this game love the content as well thank you man yeah this game is it's really good but it's freaking it's tough if you get spotted you've got to be on it you've got to be on it uh evan keel as well with a membership just waiting for these guys to uh stop actively looking for me if they'll even do that there's a red spinning icon on on me on the bottom left i don't know what that means i really want to go loud [Music] hmm [Music] you wanna see me you don't see me there has to be a way there we go yes [Music] fully out of meds now what mission this is satchel thing on that door voice no he spoiled me goodbye generals looks good yeah it's fun as hell man plays really well a couple of bugs so far but nothing is completely impeded gameplay jesus i'll need to deal with that no that's the alarm system i need to deal with that invader did he just say that's a player [Music] they definitely expect you to go loud on this one surely like this must be a really tough one too so actually uh stealth missing satchel tnt silence conveyor mg42 yeah i think i think he said something about an invader there i think the invasion thing is like an enemy player can enter your game try and kill you you can't turn it off i thought i turned it off i'm not sure where's this guy [Music] where are you at okay nothing for me here [Music] both cutters evasion only guess not what's my objective here uh destroy the gun battery okay this is feeding shells through to the gun battery putting an explosive in here will do some damage everything's in collision next time this gun fires it'll tear itself apart okay time to leave then of that less visible and darker areas okay good to know satchel charge that's what we need what's that i guess bottles like a distraction similar to the whistle keep going [Applause] that's crazy hang the helmet off get out of here fast any goodies a map of the nazis artillery bunkers okay taking these out we'll punch a hole in their defenses no no no no i don't need to do that anymore that's just another side quest so just give me luke but it appears to give you more quests so if you want more quests from these levels like destroying more things you can't do that i find in the safes um i want to collateral you two somehow thanks for all the support on the stream so far guys hope you're enjoying it do leave a like if you are helps out the uh the algorithm very much so oh there's a workbench as well that i wanted to use see if i can upgrade this sniper rifle anymore uh iron sights oh let's try it significantly quieter limited einstein visibility slower rate of fire i mean i'm not using no insight so try it easy control slow as movement sure let's make it look absolutely crazy faster while aiming slow to equip prove same stupid and i'll leave that whilst his name i've got a new pistol a well rod no way crazy there's a lot of unlocks it's just the weapons that you can unlock too not the ones that you find uh yeah i haven't done anything for this night but that's fine all the ammo i need which is the main thing bandage the jumper came back punctures lung sorry mate pretty sorry i have to do that to you you have like three skills let's go uh yeah two school points to spend good show longer in focus longer it takes for the effects to wear off okay reduce the heart rate increase caused by sprinting i wouldn't mind that you know scope shape from taking damage is drastically reduced yeah flange cut which does get pretty annoying i tend to play the second nah don't do this you're cool on that all right last objective yeah so you could do this way faster if you just went from the first objective to the second main objective but i mean that was just a side quest and look how many enemies are in that compound more than the main objective so the way to fully stealth this would literally just to be to run from point a to point b and just not get involved with these guys as i've quickly discovered helmet went poof yeah i did yeah the new bullet cam is really cool i like that you can increase the speed and reduce it hello hey boy come by [Music] you has fallen for my trap hands oh jesus oh you just got whacked that's all straight for the jugular and flip them over fancy very fancy all right guys we did it we got through it sorry if you wanted to see more stealth from me there that was my ins that was my intention for sure just shows how quickly it can all go wrong okay what's my fastest way through this compound i am here i don't really want to go down the road do we oh crap i'm out of sonic round so that kind of sucks evan keel thanks for coming remember man no worries uh georgie catch you later thanks tuning in i need to get in the house this must be the farmhouse charlie told me about but i'm here too early still got work to do oh i have the well rod equipped i didn't mean to do that here too early still got work to do so i need to go on this road if this guy fully comes out to investigate me then might as well kill him now he's gonna stop where he is he's walking down some stairs at the moment that's why i didn't want to equip the well rod it's like having a bolt action sniper rifle as a pistol all right we'll come back later guess we're going straight down the road oh this is cool careful of enemy patrols big fan of the level design so far has been really good oh wow look at this [Music] oh all this propaganda on the walls isn't it like his signature pistol yeah i think so hey rancho jason what's up everyone tuning in just had such a brawl on our hands there's a target down here i need to kill as a side objective [Music] hmm i see him oh it's just the area he's in i think a big red circle on the mini map heaven now because i can only go loud with that folio pistol had locked on the other side okay find and kill stefan beckendorf we're closer to him in the main objective let's look [Music] where are you gonna be two guards there i love how i actually do the irl head tilt no i mean to look around corners as if it's gonna have some sort of effect in game stephan there he is the butcher of the local resistance you're on my list beckendorf you're around my list beckendorf it's going right where i need to be too you can come up this road huh the timing the timing oh the freaking timing all right sorry buddy going loud horrible horrible timing there's a guy just stood down here in the house i was just in and i thought i've been able to open the door that was in the basement down there i would have found him are we caught in this vicious trap again where's this guy that's how you shoot bud i really want those subsonic rounds back but i don't even have a suppressor attachment which uh doesn't give you many options to go stealth right now unless i was to assassinate everyone or kill them all with this well rod which i definitely don't want to do i'm just gonna hide for a bit i can move the mouse around like that look at different parts that's crazy a bit trippy but i like it for castle [Music] [Music] anyone don't see him the eyeballs yeah i know show you an x-ray vision whenever you kill him and you can literally like pop the eyeballs or blow their teeth out there we go enemy hunting that's what we wanted this first mission definitely throws you into the game love it really enjoying this nothing else [Music] mm-hmm that's how we do every time it goes into bullet camera take a sip of my water it just comes back too quick i'm never ready i think i need to go well there's enemies hunting down there aren't they big old church too i'd love to explore that actually let's try this guy time to go full punisher you know it this looks so damn good glad you think so the last i i only played like i came very late to this franchise but i think i played three and four but this feels like a completely fresh experience to me even though i'm sure there's a lot of features about this game that carried over from previous titles the gamers today don't really know what they want look at battlefield 2042 they tried to reinvent the wheel and didn't work out for him and all of us were asking oh we just wanted to basically make remake battlefield 4 but if they did that then everyone be like oh what did you just remake battlefield 4 you know i feel like similarities or what maker make a game unique take his hip out anyway what was i no more to find here so i needed i need to disable our alarm resistance documents have got to be in here charlie said the safe is under the floorboards trail stops here i'm just flying into the attic the safes under the floorboards just like charlie said now to find marcel in the key he's in the attic hello how do i get up there must be another way [Music] oh you just moved your eye didn't you yeah caught play too there's co-op in this game cross play it's that on xbox and playstation um sorry xbox one and playstation 4 too so you wouldn't expect to see massive like next-gen improvements [Applause] disaster also run well on those old platforms which is sometimes uh sometimes a shame with games that you want to see more from but how much bigger can this game really go always throwing a grenade on me [Music] how many bodies there are here is he behind that i hear him he's like here [Music] there you are nice keep forgetting what the melee key is so i press f e v it's uh e to kill them and v to pacify which is just incapacitate i think you get more xp for just knocking them out that's boring oh here we go i had to kill those guys behind me been shot then ass right on main street [Music] okay oh no didn't get to young time hope you still got the key to that safe if i zoom in too far he just disappears oh yes the key that's what i was looking for marcel was storing resistance equipment sonic for non-lethal this would be a good time to re-arm he's got so much gear in here can only carry one medkit so i might as well use this one this is one there these melee kills never get old yeah they're awesome tnt were full on armor-piercing rifle rounds [Music] i want my subsonic [Music] swap sub sonic 4 non-lethal confused regular ammo non-lethal i'm a piercing it's not even taking away some sonic camera because i don't have it a macho confused oh yes this is what we needed the world was actually pretty fun there i'm not gonna lie like it was fun to use but i can't take on many enemies slower aim time faster recovery slow rate fire but reduces recoil doesn't tell me the d4 rate of fire i'll try though actually does it do that oh it does oh my god that's sick god got all the info if you want to dive into the stats love that i'm quite happy with the sniper i just want a suppressor for her now because like there's a lot of times where i need to attack a range that's cool [Music] the safe just like charlie said [Music] can't complain about the mission length this is cool uh where do i go the fact that i can make it as long as i'm wait that's us the fact that i can do a bunch of side objectives if i want and just increase the overall mission length and the time that i'm spending in the area that's really cool oh no rod i'm missing shots now [Music] [Applause] i would like iron sights for the pistols oh that's on me all that time i've been struggling like this i could have just done that and got an accurate shot there's like another key where you can essentially go from this to that and i haven't really been using it that's pain [Music] didn't change the world rod yeah i mean i don't mind now because i've got a suppressor on the scorpion scorpion what am i talking about it looks a bit like a scorpion doesn't it it's the well gun smg just added that to wars aren't they um i don't know my fruits one's pistol ammo the other's rifle ammo okay it doesn't tell me in the bottom right but i'll take your word for it four out of 20. i guess that makes sense okay what's this town bunker i just climbed all this way there's gotta be one here right yes let's go you picked up a satchel charge you satchel charges destroy key objectives or blast open heavy doors ah there we go i charge i fuse oh god drop down drop oh my the building is crumbled on top of me that's one bunker taken care of probably should have done the slow charge for that one all right we're good that was fun i gotta be really careful too because i sprint around a lot when i get into those bigger engagements let's look in here you see my heart rate in the bottom right beautiful oh love a stained glass window um hello sora's hearing steps there weird this is someone in the tower there not sure maybe not i think it looks accessible we did some gaming true very true cue rest rest now tommy disappointed with the graphics um not really i mean i suppose because it's on the older platforms playstation 4 and xbox one they can't really go all out but i'll take performance and gameplay of a graphics any day of the week i mean i'm running this at 180 fps right now and this is on you told me about it oh she got here okay like it's probably not looking as graphically beautiful for you guys i mean i'm streaming at 40p but i'm not playing all maxed graphics like you can put on ray tracing and all that stuff but i've got on ultra textures ultra anti-aliasing motion blur off of course just the basic stuff that i'd i'd put on when i want performance over again other graphics carl you made it we lost this sub did you see any survivors we lost some good men i'm sorry did you get the intel this is marie she's part of a resistance network that operates further up the coast if it wasn't for her i'd be dead already nice to meet you did you get the intel told you he doesn't do things by halves there you're done i'd say to take it easy for a bit but but you've met me yeah i wondered if i'd run into you been in france long almost from the start moved around a lot staying one step ahead of jerry more than once i've thought it would have been good to have you on my network a native german speaker could have opened many doors oh didn't i tell you this one was born and raised in deutschland at least for a few years i chose my side you chose well right we need to go they will be looking for you this tells us where to go next that butcher moller has a chateau not far from here look after this one she reminds me a little of you i will take care charlie she sounds like she's speaking into a shoebox compared to him i think this was probably made during the pandemic and they probably have to like get different people recording from all over the world mission fulfilled atlantic war targets neutralized primary exvil compromised multiple u.s rangers kia lieutenant sullivan and surviving rangers regrouping with the resistance contact extraction status of lieutenant fairburne and blue viper unknown bleshee park have intercepted the following thing [Music] okay the first mission complete and see i was basically full of saltwater that wasn't my intention i wanted to be more down here didn't really feel like the mission for though did it i got kicked off so much when i tried to do that secondary objective absolutely insane um you can spend skill points yeah yeah got one left to spend let's put it into i carry an extra bandage or something yeah i definitely need that we'll do that one okay i could definitely play a bit more stealth you know i'm unlocking these suppressors i just want them from a sniper rifle really the uh subsonic rounds are cool but i just can't seem to find enough of them shoe mine we play more ready or not yeah definitely if you want my uh my opinions after the first little mission with that we've done there um obviously i didn't really get to do much stealth but we're gonna do the second mission anyway um we'll keep the difficulty the same playing on hard right now and it is difficult but definitely fun switch out the roll roll back to the m19 and go with the world gonna smg which has the suppressor on right yep that pistol looks insane now look at that that's a 1911. all right let's do it yeah um i mean i'm impressed it's it's got a lot of features that you'll remember from the previous games battery but it's more of what people want i'd say and now i'm stuck behind enemy lines my contacts will be called me and jack butcher behind the local atrocities mueller seized chateau de berengar and turned it into his personal nazi stronghold i'm going to pay him a visit let's get this bastard molar he's not here what molar and his entourage are gone charlie tells me that in italy you are known as the shadow we need an infiltrator the intel you recovered it has confirmed our suspicions muller is in charge of some special project top secret if there is a lead anywhere it will be here this looks like more of what i won just love woodland scenery who must be our infiltrator they've relaxed security and motor substance but they still have guard posts on all the river crossings we've scouted the area and made a few notes hopefully they are useful appreciated thanks for the intel chance bonus okay yeah i'll show you what graphics i'm running right now um graphic detail oh wait it's changed oh no it hasn't yeah no so the texture details on high i put all this on high water details high um yeah there's no like advanced tab so you can't really change you know the small stuff but again there's a there's basically everything you need for pc this is basically ray tracing right or is this because this is the amd one isn't it hang on move a quick read okay no this is basically um nvidia dlss hello uh martonic catch later man thanks tune in yeah 3am in australia crazy i mean this looks good to me i think the nighttime scenery doesn't really do do much justice let's see what these nazis are up to the previous one we just played doesn't really aid the game much and a lot of people just see god rays and sunflower like this and like oh my god it's the most beautiful game i've ever seen i think if there was more of that over here then the game would look probably a lot more um beautiful be careful on approach here was another route oh god some objectives for this one find muller's office find and kill not even going to try and pronounce these names because i will just i will just butcher them i see the accents and i just determined something that is always wrong i love the doves it's cool right slow on approach thanks yoshi glad you're enjoying the man our crowbar might come in handy later okay this is what i need to do more marking with the binoculars because i'm marked for longer hmm don't have some sewing rounds there's no audio to cover vehicle on the road i think i need to be out of their audible range since i don't have a suppressor so many vehicles though what do i really do here us [Music] [Applause] well he's got an underbite for life call me potato maya you're a potato oh sugar sugar honey iced tea [Music] who see me that way the bloody farmer reinforcements i'm in danger of getting out here oh i thought he was going to carry on at the same speed that's annoying um [Music] [Music] where's that guy yeah shot his helmet off ouch charlie see the stealth went well yeah you're right stealth is optional range i'm just not that was really bad timing though with the vehicle coming down the road grabbed everything useful it's too many coming around i tried to hide it so if another vehicle did come we wouldn't see the bodies what's that sound i mean how would you even stealth this without a suppressor [Applause] look what i have to go through without being spoiled i mean i suppose you could like oh when he's kill this guy otherwise he'll be seeing that guy otherwise he'll be seen but i'm kind of out of options without subsonic or espresso attachment [Applause] chris thanks for the uh the one pound man appreciate it eric rose with a ten dollars as well thank you so much all that fighting and your hair is still perfect yes love the content thanks buddy yeah you're right he does have perfect hair [Music] okay arm's disabled this guy [Music] i think you're just gonna have to play until rapid fire car 98 oh boy now definitely aware of my presence would this be an audible range do you think i suppose they just hear the um go up there look oh my god what have i done i've made him a new man that's a new face i just gave him [Applause] where's bullet drop and bullet like if there's like wind and you have to zero most of the time i haven't really needed to do that this is a range i've been looking to fight at which i love can't find anything else [Music] made him a new man yeah where did that even hit through i don't know i was reading chat when the bullet first impacted he came someone said uh tomo and sniper games go together like team crumpets i like that this is what it's all about um ammo i need four more days four more days till you get your copy oh yeah man friedrich coombler he's on the list [Music] [Applause] jesus christ that's so crazy oh god this guy right here oh my that's my last bullet too another scope on this pistol yep that works all right sniper ammo you got any for me oh you do oh yeah actually done ah jesus that hurts man oh yowie it shot his helmet went all the way down all the way down there my bullet just ricocheted off his gun did you see that slid along the barrel and hit him that is crazy insane get back in this towel quick got some off that guy which is good [Music] it's the first shot corrected with a second that's not a bad idea to stagger him with that first shot make him stand still follow up with the acura bullet jouses that guy's brain is leaking all right let's close the gap you know what right rapid fire i ate let's go using a scope still useful oh didn't drop down maybe there's like an alternate route right or left i don't know would be better for stealth whereas this one's made for aggression you saw me there all right time to find mueller's office see what i can find about this special project hello oh that's that's that's not what i wanted i didn't want to aim down a reticle like that [Music] where is that guy i need to remember i can do this though especially with a pistol window old chateau like this ledges and railing should let me travel around the outside i pick this it's almost as boom [Music] had to lean so far into my monitor what are you doing lunatic [Music] oh damn it feeling [Applause] just stood up in the middle there definitely not what i intended to do no he killed me oh wait i have a medkit don't finish me off he dare finish me off okay glad i got to use that for the first time that's really cool lovely just watches me though so when you bm someone in uh warzone really had a bullet damn it that guy's got my bullets oh okay i'm back with this mg guys [Applause] hell yeah show me your face [Applause] tomorrow a stream thanks for the quality videos you put out and all the laughs you've helped my mental health a lot especially through lockdown look after yourself and make a cuppa thank you man love to hear it hope you're doing well i think i've grabbed all i can oh god he actually need to kill me with that shot i'd get i should save that if i uh if i go down again [Music] i love the active reloads too all right time to find mueller's office see what i can find about this special project shooting the wall in front of me oh god hello i know well it's her don't they all right mueller's office let's try open this got the crowbar from earlier any ammo for me random selection of items nice any bandages hell yeah i'll keep my eyes for those out for those chests then all right let's try and uh other enemies have calmed down a bit [Music] if i get back on the stealth wave and i've immediately been spotted [Applause] oh no gum was still shaking from the reload [Applause] wait how many there one two three four i got a reposition and the stealth wave is over i could get over run if i'm not careful um gotta be smart about this trying to figure out [Applause] figure out a smarter way to clear these enemies trying to say i gotta be shot i'm actually being shot at oh god that almost killed me oh no [Music] [Music] this is insane guys [Music] rifle missing a scope still useful [Music] this will come in very useful [Music] [Music] i mean the aggressive gameplay is fun too but if you mess up once it's so difficult to reset they're all full alert alarms stop though which is good old intel already know about this i quite like this though is this cool constantly like rotating to uh take out all these enemies getting used to the third person now i haven't played like a third person shooter in a while i was done crouched it's like why am i going up the stairs so slow here we go another one of these what exactly triggers the cinematic shots um basically kill shots there's also a uh set getting the wrist interesting so if i go game options it's in here game bullet kill cameras set the frequency with which you see kill cams for weapon attacks so you can do minimal none if you don't like them all frequently every single kill but normal is a good balance um you can turn off x-rays too so you don't see the inside of their body as you shoot them right i quite like that it's pretty unique to this game so uh find the stolen antiques there's gonna be some antiques around the house just another side quest you can do that's the guy that's molar right don't know i need a good chokepoint oh my god there's so many i didn't kill him except a helmet [Music] [Applause] oh his eye exploded i can control the speed though like in the bottom left 100 speed move camera if i want oh my god whoa oh god get up get up get up get up now he's pushing me i need more bullets no there's another one i failed the reload panic strong helmets back then yep that's it awaiting response what do you mean q did i miss something where is it we should stealth kill me he's about to assassinate me oh my god i missed it again trash so that wasn't the guy i need to find his office yeah it's so fun really enjoying it [Applause] oh that's satisfying that sound is so good blew that guy's leg off i didn't even aim for him [Applause] it's not supposed to be a stealth mission i've just been spotted too early and everyone's after me the alarms went off there wasn't really much i could do it's all because i tried so because to tried to be stealth and i uh i picked up a body and tried to dump it in a bush my character just wouldn't let go and a truck drove down the road saw me doing it i was like hang on a minute man right looks like it's part of the set getting the rest out of here to the resistance keeps them away from the nazis like a little crouch side that he does sorry buddy that's really bad kind of sucks for you let's get this door open missing bulkhouse repairs sounds like my way into moulder's office is here what else can i use [Music] [Music] oh oh we just moved how about play stealth tomorrow because the yeah i'm i'm i'm figuring that out i've realized basically if you want to go stealth you don't snipe but i'm playing a sniper game i love sniper games it's all about the sniper shots for me and without having a suppressor or subsonic rounds which i don't have i feel like people will be expecting snipes tuning for snipes and the last thing we want to see is smg gameplay now i think if i want to play stealth with a sniper that isn't suppressed i need to be like miles away even then i'm not gonna be able to kill all the enemies that clearly around where is that shot coming from quite like the chase though right now it's cool i'm able to reposition find windows it's all about the sniping for me in these games but right now i just haven't had the opportunity to stealth snipe you know i mean they gave me the option earlier but i just ran out of the ammo that i needed what's this yeah only got armor piercing uh bandages don't wanna use the medkit heal up with this is the multiplayer yeah there'll be a uh an actual multiplayer um you know like quick play essentially i guess that will have maybe multiple modes um oh god [Music] damn it almost out of ammo yeah there's also a infiltrator thing that basically uh like an enemy player can join your game and try and assassinate you like a single enemy player assassinate you for a reward or xp or whatever this must be the damaged attic space can make my way into moulder's office through here i'm in time to find this top secret project a hidden room which one was that nazi repairs maybe crafty bastard opening mechanism must be in here somewhere not here hmm it's not my nose the clock [Music] is i'm right there too [Music] you saw me the globe nothing statue [Music] yes false wall panel sneaky bastard friends in japan just how many connections in the axis does moeller have it's basically the same pistol house lol that's the mine i faced earlier i love that it shows you that that's really cool operation crack let's see krieg's marine austland sd meeting at beaumont sundini sounds big something like this would explain the crackdown on the resistance got what i came for time to link up with the resistance and get out of here uh what did i see it was glowing this [Music] [Applause] when it glows red you shoot it oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] very close that's all the core sniper elite community they're gonna be cringing at me so hard where's my stealth i'm sorry core sniper elite community i failed you i was just bleeding out on the ground first i'm about to finish someone on the ground aaron steps below me too there he goes it too [Music] there we go perfect shot oh the little went right through in that one there we go i could zero these which would help tom i'm trying to eat a burger this probably isn't the best game to watch if you're eating i hear that um okay just killed him where's this guy hiding got the alarm killed him i put in a sniper in sniper elite all right not the smg running law and ammo last no i've got three bullets left look at the crouch slide on him [Applause] oh that 100 speed is insane what the hell wow it's like following the bullet it's actual trajectory um there's a question mark here i'm curious about damn i can't aim at you oh good [Music] that's a good grenade yeah yeah yeah lovely search you [Applause] big shot not many enemies hunting now well maybe there are just let them know where i am you know oh you lucky that would be risky i don't want to try it yeah it's good throw wasn't it oh god they're everywhere oh damn don't don't don't execute on stairs what i'm trying to say i almost went so wrong just because i was trying to be a badass tried to john wick him god damn i guess i grabbed everything useful so spicy the ai are having trouble on stairs sliding down missed the fast reload is it in waves is that is that correct rifle do you mean they're just endlessly spawn until i complete the objectives [Music] okay i mean [Music] it's just the one i hang out before is yeah literally the same window one more level oh yeah savage not that one either awkward no dangerous speak it big it oh you the nazis have raised the alarm yeah i think you're right you know i think the more oh oh yeah shoot explosive barrel behind him [Music] we love that [Music] [Music] just having too much fun sniping people i'm bleeding now that's not good first time that's happened still bleeding i gotta patch myself up it's a cool mechanic what if that's in the normal version [Music] that's an actual sniper god damn that's not very nice mate i just healed am i still being shot out or am i bleeding still this sniper made me bleed so i have to use this now yeah [Music] [Music] shoot the alarm tommy yeah it's this one over here now isn't it they haven't quite figured out like are they just coming in waves like endless enemies or am i clearing out whoever's here i thought that's what i was doing but i guess not yeah there's bloody millions of them his wig flew off [Music] god damn god damn yeah so uh again yeah there is there is a co-op system as well so you can play with a buddy um it's not just all like pvp i think me and jack are gonna try and do co-op at some point once the game's fully out i really want to unlock a suppressor but i just don't know how it's like certain certain tasks you have to complete to get them it's pretty vague just have to get lucky i gotta look at the uh the character from bf5 forget his name okay this is just like a secondary area you can clear disable never seen bone fragments fly out of bodies yeah well these snipers will do that [Music] do you mind seeing this more aggressive gameplay guys are you expecting full stealth with this game [Music] some of this like mission layouts just don't really like bode well for stealth i think there's gonna be a lot of like stealth later in the game when they expect that you have suppressors but these first couple of missions just feel more like hey have some fun here's a bunch of enemies and go wild because you're going to run out of subsonic rounds fast they don't carry over to missions which i was surprised by i thought it would uh i'd get like a refill you just have to get lucky and find them okay there's a secondary objective this could make some useful cover straight through the noggin exactly disabled that one little d nice and quick nice and quick okay rest my heart rate come back i mean the waves have definitely died down if that was the case i've killed a lot of enemies is it just this tent i could use the sniper rifle [Music] why is this objective oh right just need to find a stolen antiques you don't need to though we shall skip that helps you rank up early then do stealth yeah you're right i spent all my time getting kills with pistols and smg's to find i wouldn't really get many attachments all levels uh where's this [Music] guy what is this sniper whoa the faces they pull as they get shot check for crates yeah i need to find a weapon bench as well supposed to be a weapon bench on this map somewhere drop that kind of looks like these um that's the sniper i killed earlier interesting i can take advantage of this good plan let's do it don't know the curfer's safe but i do know he keeps a note of it in his quarters behind a painting hmm oh it tells me no doesn't tell me got my objective updated this estate is massive looks like hogwarts doesn't it instant brain smoothie yeah that's so inaccurate where's this weapon bench gonna be i was hoping i'd say that turn around and it would be there saj had to take a shot to fire a shot he's got me bleeding again this guy oh [Music] yeah it feels that way office you can play like so many different play styles um looking forward to some of the stealth missions later because i feel like that's definitely going to be a thing using the cover of sound to mask your bullets and stuff it's just one of those levels where there's nothing going on in terms of you know it's not like a massive turret being fired somewhere that masks my shots it's a cool mechanic of that love some more of it um i need that where's this weapon bench gonna be bottles don't need those i'm re-spotted old intel already know this old tunnel's key missing armory key missing satchel charge okay that's the boundary of the mission oh cool staging area secured this will be a good place to start from for other operations love that oh man i thought he's about to move into it didn't [Applause] sheesh no as if as if do again almost missed the second time the uh the chevron wasn't accurate or his head actually peeked that's funny oh my god i bet you could just oh that's a missed opportunity maybe there is a way to just dump it on them ah what is this what is this oh baby oh baby sniper rifle looks good so if i can climb it here too it looks like you should be able to do that doesn't it like why is this window open like that there has to be something you can do with this i kind of want to jump onto it but i don't think the game's gonna let me that was cool oh yeah see it's just another way in well [Music] shoot the hook not the rope you got it remember that for next time okay let's go blow the uh the door really fun game so far though if this is your like kind of thing just ending people cool ways this is the game i wish i know about that sooner because there's a big like group of them just stood there let's blow this door is this where the world bench is boom armory nazis won't mind me borrowing munitions no way yes this is the workbench it's a stan intel um just looks like more law uh swap match grade for soft point i don't have stags it doesn't actually tell me i have it ah is it for the pistol maybe yes it is 25 pistol it says okay workbench um fixed frame that's cool looks really cool improve accuracy but slower movement larger magazine slowest movement increases vertical recoil sure quieter easy to control stealth conversion reduces damage though that's fine yeah see down here i can't actually hover over it without selecting something else but you see in the bottom right it basically tells me what i need to do in order to unlock certain guns and attachments of them come quite late look how sick that is i had the armory key oh it was on i did have the key but i also had a satchel guys i mean come on yeah i forgot i looted that off the guy that's funny i mean explosions are cooler than keys guys am i right come on that distance from the explosion someone's been playing insurgency or talk of man with a satchel with a charge that looks that big can never be too sure any goodies in these tents i'm missing [Music] that'll be unlocked for future runs i guess explosions over keys exactly see i know you guys i know you prefer explosions over keys anyone would all right well i'd say that was a great stealth run what about you what we say 100 stealth completion yes stealth oh sorry did that get your attention wow great shot just wanted to give him the uh the opportunity to shoot back you know that's all excuse me i see you so much stealth watch this guy he's not gonna know what hit him see him there oh we should evolve that all right i'm gonna stealth kill this guy guys that's what you wanted right don't you dare spot me that was over there someone in the spot it was just that look [Music] [Music] yo stealth whoa whoa that was insane hit every shot as well that was sick whoa ain't no one doing it like me stealth baby all right let's get out of here i don't really care about the uh the random artifacts are littered around the house uh buster boris thanks very much for coming remember dude appreciate you wait till i tell these guys about what just went down won't believe me i just killed a thousand men someone over here oh i think he was just waving at me oh yeah oh it's a gym lad [Music] in a bigger brain than i thought all right exfiltrate yeah don't don't don't ask me if i uh did the stealth run let's just say it wasn't a quiet run boys take me home [Music] stealth was never an option just waiting for the comments on the videos will be great [Music] good joke good one yeah those guys had no idea absolutely clueless to my being oh no they killed him so i foreign why is jimmy kimber in this game update received from blue viper fairburne continuing to investigate overgroup and fuhrer abellard muller intel recovered at chateau de bruyne references operation kraken we also have details of a number of high-ranking nazi individuals linked to the operation of the south shore suggest continued pursued high risk if not impossible basically my motto for this game this is supposed to be a stealth mission [Music] just ignore this pretend that isn't even that isn't even a thing non-lethal i did lethal assault 11 11 alarms are kind of speak 11 alarms raised 76 bodies discovered don't know what that means 120 kills though who's getting that many kills on a stealth run you know i gave you guys the entertainment 57 minute completion time look we'll i'll dedicate a video to stealth gameplay hopefully the next like mission is uh is more well laid out for stealth it looks like it is because that last one was basically like this is where you spawn here's a massive like um castle um and i had to just go straight towards it so how am i going to do that stealth cross a bridge in the middle of the open when they've got mgs and snipers looking out of windows it's just not doable this looks crazy this does look crazy there are a total of 10 missions this one took me just over an hour this one took maybe actually it was almost two hours this one this one was an hour i did do a lot of uh side quests with this though got stuck on that one but there's some uh there's a decent amount of levels so i'd say if i was to guess maybe like 12 hour completion time uh but yeah we're going to call it there today the live stream is wrapping up we've been live for over three hours now so i don't want to leave it too long because people just never watched this far into the vault otherwise uh but i'll split the vod um into chapters so it's easy to navigate to the second mission um if you've been watching live appreciate the heck out of you thank you so much for being here hope you enjoyed the gameplay uh the stealth gameplay um and yeah i'll try and dedicate this next mission to stealth we'll see how that goes um and if you want to see more remember to like the video like the stream and i'll do my best to get that video out probably on the 25th or the 26th which is the 26th is when the game comes out but i might just do a video um just before that because i'm allowed to post or live stream uh the first three missions but um that was a really good time i really enjoyed that it was like not much of a break not not much of a break after the uh the aggression really kicked up but i still had fun it's just hard to go back to stealth after you've uh alerted all the enemies but yeah here's all the options available so you've got the campaign host co-op so you can do the corp run with a friend i think it's only two player um invasion which i could click this now and basically go into another person's single player story um an attempt to assassinate them they will be alerted and they'll be able to assassinate me for xp but you can just turn this off if you want to have a completely single player play through just fair enough uh survival i guess would just be like wave based co-op and then the multiplayer which is just as you can see it looks like a traditional maybe like free-for-all team deathmatch style um yeah maybe we'll check this out for a video as well just uh let me know if your response to this stream and this game is um you know as crazy as it has been with the uh sniper ghost warrior series we'll see um but yeah i'd be happy to do a full playthrough for you guys but with that being said thank you so much for watching appreciate all the support on all the videos lately i'm working on a uh a behemoth of a video at the moment which is going to surprise a lot
