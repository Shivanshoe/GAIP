would you like to hear my ghost impression Jeff inspired by you more than anything let me hear I've gotta do my my walkie talkie voiceover okay okay send fighters I can trust gusto what do you think that sounds you do a better impression of me than I do yes you actually sound pretty good to me you sound more like og ghost actually you sound more like quake Fairbrass in a sensor you're more calm website right something's wrong before disk so we flight is I can trust you know what it's doing thanks to me gentlemen are like makes me tingle hey guys it's Tom here and welcome back to more war zone so I recently had the pleasure of playing with Jeff leech who is the voice actor for ghosting call of gee modern warfare and it turns out that Jeff is actually a big fan of war zone so I invited him to join myself Jack frags and study to play a few games and learn more about the man behind the voice of ghosts like many of you I'm sure ghost is one of my favorite characters in the call of G franchise and one of the most iconic characters in gaming so I figure this would be a really cool opportunity to ask Jeff some questions about his new role and to try and get a win in war zone you know not many people can say that they've worn a game of war zone with the real ghost on that team and we actually get a pretty solid win in this video so make sure to stick around if you want to see more games with Jeff in the future then make sure to leave a like on this video and drop a comment below with any questions you might have for him if you want to know more about Jeff I'm gonna leave links to his socials in the description below as well as a link to his YouTube channel he's a super nice guy very talented and highly deserving of the role of ghost and are personally really excited to see what Jeff does with this character in the future so with that said thank you very much for watching consider subscribing for more videos like this one and I will see you next time non so far but I will be doing in future parts of future games I mean I nothing's been hard for confirmed but the the narrative director did say that there's gonna be a lot more story for son and Reilly love it and it will involve motion capture so I'm excited about that and actually I've been trying to get double in size because ghost is obviously a big boy I mean I'm 64 I'm definitely not I'm definitely not as muscular as he is yeah all right I need to ask you your thoughts on RPGs the non lock-on RPGs do they need to go they just need a massive rework I've been using EOD lately and it's been saving my life in so many situations but it's still so frustrating it's the spam that's the problem for me the fact that you can carry so many Rockets and then resupply so easily I think your voice your natural voice is sort of it's got a perforated stirrer where you get you've got the gravel at the back of your throat but you can still bring out like the high pitch stuff absolutely and what the communities started to notice is that when I get angry like when I'm you know if someone's camping in a corner of an upstairs building with an RPG in a riot shield and I walk in and three of them off load their RPGs on me I'll lose my flip in mind and start smashing it this that's when ghost comes out angry and that's normal that's my voice that's great but I think I feel like ghost is a - separates two versions of ghost there's - what is - two characters goes to two characters in my opinion one is the character goes to one of the characters Simon Reilly you know he's really um he's he's like a broken individual anyone who wants to run around with a skull mask over his face effectively a dead man walking yeah hasn't got it all saw it in his head you know I mean he's a little bit broke you know the finesse that's gonna be fun exploring that as time goes on ghosts in like the original trilogy's really chill yeah WestEd exactly what I mean this is this is who years I think I think he's um definitely suffered some serious abuse has some major PTSD and his we're dealing it was to make himself inhuman you know to go all right I will when I'm out in the war zone I'm not gonna be myself I'm not gonna be son and Riley I'm gonna be ghost and I'm gonna be full violence full aggression fully focused on the job at hand which is killing the other hundred and forty-six people on this map you know mm-hmm it wants a guy out of here then I might have a little chance to be Simon but he's only barely Simon Rider with price anyway you know let alone anyone else which is pretty sad it was a huge character change it took me a like a couple of weeks to really like full with the new design be honest did you hate first and did you have first cuz I asked not my book not my ghost pure look is that like a really emotional see anymore or fair - yeah yeah and now he's my ghost you could get I'm glad I won you over a little bit oh are you did Jeff where'd you want to go chaps handed okay I start was horrible triangle sight with my karna here they're fighting another drama room 106 another the window in this job one team's been wiped one guy close actually yeah it's in the river oh he's a he's cool again it's cool egging once I've been here from the left Jesus I like it not close left like 150 South have you got like a really accurate paying stud left of orange I can give you an exact thing where a cue thing on orange I want to get one of them down there Lotus down one there are Marwan found the other one down the other one table one are they moving they're moving boys that they're moving left I pushed all the way down there Roger that much they've gotta come this and although they just gonna try an edges all the way out he's really hit got him no third one third one ed ones on the left want it right here sometimes I'm just gonna I'm just gonna hold on this edge so they have come for this number Elmen Wow and now we can't get now we can't get him because he's what he's out the zone great I'll tell you what I got a gas mask I'll try and dodge by caring for the if you can I see Farsi Farsi [ __ ] yeah I mean the vehicle grab it and get out again I don't know no I don't think I have enough time it takes to go on a Jeff oh cool I think you can't if you believe in this - Jeff okay lads doing a mission over there survive any money all right here on me stop okay I just see one currently none a fourteen fourteen Paco made about position get in the building running I don't know boys know that he's not there anymore that move left move that one move left

RS thank you good stuff guys we need his plates to go sighs Jeff come around the corner come to me if you can I can't they're peeking I've sonic on top of the rocks in front to ten and the tower here okay and I sure I've been shot from the left now son lucky boys solid effort a fire station battle went on a little too long just a warm-up still a warm-up Roger there copy that I'll copy there see that's weird when I actually in my voice say something that I've already just said yeah Roger that and then my boys kicks into our copy there Oh Drive I'll Drive exactly exactly I'm curious Jeff what was the do you know about the word count for how many lines of dialogue you had to say for ghosts yeah when I went in and did that first the well the first session when I did all the battle in all the war zone battle cries that was about 350 or so Lions it's a lot and you have to repeat some of those lines of dialogue oh yeah you do each one at least like five or six times you normally give like three to five reads of each one that's not the same sounding line every time I said again exactly yeah so do you like three to five although they simply use a lot of similar internation even though I'd give them like you know frag out or unique takes a kragle now you know give me like a high or a lower register they tend to just go for the high-octane yeah full forced versions I guess that's that's also the ghost that they wanted to portray with the new the new rendition of the character absolutely mate he's this it's like outside of obviously gave me some direction and some idea of look this is how we've written him and this is how we we see him being um he's he's bigger he's perlier he's more intimidating looking the mask is modern it's you know he's he's definitely screwing the head if you read the comics or any of the old-school law yeah there's you know badly abused by his family and I've got to check the comics out I'm really intrigued by not just ghosts Simon Reilly story did you get to put any Easter eggs in yeah I will be nice you do some great ones not as of yet maybe in future games you know no use code goes to check out use the code Epic's door goes Oh store
