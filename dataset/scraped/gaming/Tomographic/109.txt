oh no there's too many people going for it it's got a gun and you're broken oh there's someone up here there he is now we just need to sneak up behind him nice and oh slow no way you heard me ah oh come on man okay looks like we've made a great mistake coming here no he's gonna mellow me he's gonna i can't then get away with that [Music] send me back i'm finishing that fight properly he's on the roof to the right he's distracted i wanted to execute him it's all over pal you mellowed the wrong man [Music] all right good morning everyone it's currently 9 00 am at the time i'm recording this video we're gonna play some solos and try and have some fun let's do this thing i'm not the only one coming here what's that i need to race into this contract oh oh you wouldn't you god damn it man i'm so sick of melee i just wanna have gunfights with people it really too much to ask for to actually have a gunfight with someone in a first person shooter hope that now i can win this gu lag prime regain freak six let's go [Music] that was a quick one okay we're back in the fight but it looks like we're gonna have to go here if we want to do another surge contract because we've spawned thousands of miles away from our original landing spot i hate using my goo lager early oh well oh go away why are you up there this early in the match oh wait you're an idiot why would you give up the high ground rookie mistake is he going to come up nah he knows way better than that all right i've got a contract to complete so almost of full damage there um we'll leave him to his own devices for a bit i didn't see him anywhere so i wonder if he's back in the tower now oh you my friend are absolutely fearless i had a street sweeper no wonder could have had me there if i didn't get the drop on him right let's get that contract complete that guy's just chilling and uh yeah we'll try and get our loadout gonna be using the khan a8k and the vector today it's been a while since i've used the vector but i don't think i've ever used it in combination with a sniper rifle before so it could be good fun the vector absolutely decimates the solos as well it's a really competitive smg it's just i don't know it's uh it's let down by the 40 round magazine i think in trios and quads but duos and solos it's an absolute beast hold on sell for us nice contract complete and now we can get our loadout and a uav as well that's my free loadout 180 meters away might as well buy my own though one man might be more with a ghost get another uav all right that's where the match really begins vector khan ak let's put this loadout to work i'm still going to call it the vector by the way i know it's called the fennec in game but that name's never going to stick with me oh what's that i'll be able to pick someone off here oh he's in the truck look at him top of the hill just chilling there were two people i saw though on the uav oh he's coming this way i swear if he runs me over just flopped my c4 in front of him oh no counter stun he's right there oh baby thank god you didn't see me [Applause] someone else shooting at me oh my god i just triggered my c4 that i put down earlier you're an idiot i spammed after getting the truck and triggered the c4 here i am double threat someone's hunting me nearby enemy supply trying on the sniper how did you not die on the first shot no way i'm dead oh my god i'm not dead what the hell dude was that his airstrike must have been right that's why he didn't shoot at me my life just flashed before my eyes i was like adamant that that airstrike was gonna kill me the second strafe so close man all right i think he's got everything i need i wanna stand in the open too long all right i've outwaited the zone long enough just need to get right in there full send oh my god [Applause] [Music] oh my god i didn't even need to go prone there well i did i thought i'd take cover if i went prone then i'd have some hill cover but all i did was go prone in the middle of the road and make myself the easiest shot possible luckily i'm cracked with the car 98 because that was not the ideal range for the vector not at all this build as well has got no foregrip and a no stock attachment so it's great for close to medium but i was stretching it for sure enemy uav overhead let's do this fast get another uav requesting oh god i knew that was gonna happen please don't kill me i am better humble man ow come on fight me like a man there he is be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply it's not gonna repeat is he he's obviously ghosted actually i think we're better off on average why it's in this house no i'm trying to take the fight from range if i can i just don't know where he is i'm gonna leave the vehicle now it's too late in the game i don't understand what oh no no you don't you sneaky devil you where were you this whole time huh there he is now he's got the advantage trophy system oh um yeah i mean the vector he died to the gas there but the vector just minces people at that range it's great that's semtex by the way oh my god almost stuck me in the face it's almost game over for me there and then even set up a trophy system in his little bush what a gamer i don't really know what i'm going to do now because there is so much cover in quarry sorry i mean soul minds ah i guess we're playing the slow game now that door is open hostile dropping into the area watch the skies it's on my roof how did he know i was there what the hell that's the same guy just killed isn't it it's literally the same dude i just killed okay makes a bit more sense then i gotta move just don't know how i'm gonna cover all of this terrain without getting spied time to put pedal to the metal get my ass in this next zone i do not like the angle i'm approaching from right now just so open just moving between cover there's a guy didn't see me and a vehicle how do i play this i think i need to fight this guy oh man pop daddy pop daddy and run where is he relocating didn't have a clue clinical head shot there oh the solo shakes have uh started i'll tell you that much this is where it just becomes a stalemate really intense our vehicle's coming back i've got c4 with his name on it oh well okay then did he see me just got scared of my c4 i don't know he's clear these buildings are yeah we're good okay it's the final dash for getting this zone we're good dude what is this circle it's the worst end zone ever i'm gonna have to shut up now and focus up the hell is that gun my dead silence i don't trust that house shots over here just not sure what gun it was a12 or something correct also get wrecked i told you that c4 had your name on it it's the last guy where we did it that'll do nicely that was uh that was an intense one 10 kills on the board right now just wiped out tomato town oh damn solos is just uh it's really it's really become very intense um i mean that match felt pretty good a nice balance of players there i think but we did catch a lot of players by surprise there which was good i think that was very well played in terms of a solo match all things considered uh yeah we're gonna leave it there for today but um i hope you enjoyed that some vector khan 98 gameplay and uh thank you for all of your support on these solo videos you guys seem to be really enjoying them so if you did enjoy the video leave a
