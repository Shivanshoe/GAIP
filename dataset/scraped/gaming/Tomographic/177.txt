i can't grab it grab your ghost load out and then you can pick up okay you lager in the air at once twice it's ridiculous it's ridiculous is it this one here is this yours tom uh yeah yeah yeah yeah that i guess it's his scan isn't it it's safe to say that warzone season six is off to an interesting start i spent most of the day yesterday ranking up both of the new weapons the as val and the new r700 sniper rifle or spr208 sniper as it's called in game i'm a big fan of both weapons this video is more focused on the r700 but you will see a little bit of as well gameplay in here as well but man that r700 sniper rifle it's insane i mean you saw from the first clip there is zero bullet velocity this thing is basically hit scan i've got some highlights to show you today playing with jack frags acolyte and study but before that i need to say a quick thank you to today's sponsor nvidia as some of you may know they recently provided me with their new rtx 3080 gpu and i've been using this card for a couple of weeks now playing warzone at high settings in 1440p and it's been a real game changer for me i mean you can see my fps in the top left just remember that i do stream and record from the same pc which does have an impact on my fps so the fact that i'm still able to hover around 150 fps at 1440p is pretty amazing it's a really feature packed gpu including ray tracing dlss and with the release of season six nvidia reflex is now available in warzone which is a really cool feature it basically reduces system latency and improves responsiveness in game and this can be enabled in the game options and these features will of course be coming to black ops cold war very soon as well which i'm really excited about with that said we're going to jump into the gameplay now but thank you very much for watching leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it and subscribe for more like this and i'll catch you guys in the next one still behind the truck get some elevation here i'm going to push a little bit nice it sounds really good too you got a monolithic on that tom i do yeah i like the inspect animation that's a unique animal that's the thing jack they haven't they haven't done one what what that is is like when you get into a match for the first time in the multiplayer your character does that and inspects like oh yeah that's true checks the uh the bolt action and does that stuff that's still amazing yeah i love it yeah it's unique it makes it a bit more interesting do you guys hear this yeah i know i heard that it was a crying baby or something it's not like a tire it's

but what if they just kept it in for like just a few days and they're going to keep it in for weeks this is what they do right like they release it in a statement it'll be really bad fun and encourages people to buy the battle pass and then i'll nerf it think about how of how we thought the hdr was yeah there's gotta be an oversight i hit it through the trees i'm trying to yeah yeah this
