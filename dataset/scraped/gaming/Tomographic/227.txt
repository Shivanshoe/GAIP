SB mm or skill based matchmaking I'm sure you've all heard of it by now but does it exist in call of duty war zone let's just say it's been a hot topic amongst the community for a while now and the data collected by players so far indicates that there are clear signs of SB mm in war zone so my self-study and Jack frags decided to team up and do our own personal testing by creating brand new accounts at level one and playing several matches and trios to find out if there was a noticeable difference in the skill level of the players or we were being matched up against I'm not going to bore you with this science I'm just gonna show you some gameplay from our first couple of matches and leave you to be the judge let me know your thoughts in the comments below and don't forget to subscribe for more warzone content like this thank you for watching and enjoy we going for that contract straight away that's the plan yeah okay if you guys play any video games today oh no I don't think I've ever played a video in my life you're like I got the 100 round key look oh it's a beast let's go down you got lasered I'm paying armored he's out of the lobby thumbs out his job lobby he's jumped he's bailed over to the bank my thing I'm not done with him yet okay now I'm Oh cheeky sag I think he's put on my back on the mid mid mid air armor I think you can do that actually yeah are we up against there it has to be highly skilled players crash I think it's the crash yeah God me and you had Mel Gear Solid one enemy selected as our skins that's correct yeah I'm female Mario Thomas female Mario Marie yet are we ignoring that scavenger then I guess so yeah yeah no yeah I mean I've not heard a shark jack on to the next one I'm not seeing anyone my gun setup at the moment is terrible well I'm using there's no point even gopher Gus and loadouts releases there is what we gonna get no but there is actually do get ten set ones with the free accounts Todd yeah I know they're not bad one of them's got a nice m4 I think we're probably gonna have better luck with the weapons that are on the ground than the the loadout marker well what is more see we'll see but there's somebody there somebody there's someone in this building yeah I have the worst close-range weapon I've got a car 98 yeah me too okay and one here on the bottom look on m13 oh snap shrine to me in front of me stud ones low are we all in yeah there's two in here Thunder one he's done oh yeah bulletproof windows in the bank suppose it makes sense but I've actually gone to the effort you could shoot through the wood here though my helpers getting hit more gas through the wood will not do the glass all right it's counterintuitive just picked this guy's gonna be she's got green trees around yeah that's the that's the RAM seven st.

yeah I'm green pang okay so it's 3b one minute buck stop he's laid-back farming don't a say Alvin okay there was a lot of running in the open didn't get alert what's the first what what are our first first impressions on the first wind that we got their brand new account yeah I ran in the building no when we were flying the people in the building the first time yeah ran in the back smashed open the door he looked the other day for at least maybe a second and a half binturong mm-hmm maybe he doesn't have headphones so right one jacket let's assume let's assume that this has happened because we are literally brand new ik all three of us have never played a game of awesome so now it's got some stats it has got some stats so the next game technically hopefully it's looked at those stats and it will be quite different it's realized that we've won our first match on new accounts it probably thinks look at these smurfing idiots I'm gonna throw them in the high skill bracket I hope they die from the Mesa okay Bishan the back let's go down to finished I got one down to finish there and I heard his teammate running around a pro sure oh yeah how did he go down a dad see my pleasure avi

the wall and the house moving guys those moving it's coach nuts you faster it's a we land on you know like a weapon yo need a weapon I need or weapon we are the West right they're gonna come towards us now from orange remember the banjo me me since they made me I was chaotic feel like I'm sorry it's the car feed cheese isn't there the end game made the call we did we did find that low is three how many are Fiji's is that yeah definitely Felton what is the solution yeah we did actually deal with a lot of RPGs today well I mean I almost got up you dude right the end as well yeah I think for that like I don't think the load house you get but its its parents perspective for me what it feels like to start off as a fresh warzone player yeah having never played the multiplayer and the loadouts you get given I feel I feel like we were doing better just grabbing floor Lee than we were getting our load outs we're just getting a load of the perks really yeah maybe we had a full load outs in these lobbies we would have performed better yeah definitely that's where custom to them now we have our favorites we're using weapons that were not typically used to I think the RPG is a good go-to for most of new players yeah let's keep it till the end games and they find so many rockets around as well mm-hmm carry so many of them interesting observations gents indeed I'll see you all in the laboratory tomorrow absolutely specked you on time 9:00 a.m. sharp what did that see you there [Music] you
