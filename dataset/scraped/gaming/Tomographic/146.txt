today's video is brought to you by omaze stick around for your chance to win a twenty thousand dollar pc setup and support some great causes so then many of you have been asking about my ak-74u loadout that i've been using in some of my more recent videos and for whatever reason i've been getting a ton of requests to use this gun in warzone i don't know why i don't know where the hype's coming from for the ak74u but it's definitely there now the reason i haven't shown you my class setup until now is because to be honest i have absolutely no clue how to build the cold war guns in war zone the attachments are stupid and they just don't do what they say they do in game it's actually doodoo and so instead we're relying on people like jay god and true game data to find out these statistics for us seriously credit to those guys i mean it's not easy work that they're doing so with that in mind i've built my ak-74u based on what feels good to me personally and so with this setup i'm using the agency suppressor for damage range and bullet velocity the liberator barrel for a further increase to bullet velocity although i think you'd probably be better off using the task force barrel here because the damage drop off at range is pretty extreme with the ak74u so that damage range increase is sure to come in handy next up we're using the spec snazz grip to help out with the recall control the 50 round drum mag for added i don't know it's more bullets what do you want from me and then finally the optic of your choosing i do recommend that you use an optic for this gun because the headshot multiplier with the ak74u is actually one of the best in class when it comes to the smg category so it definitely pays to be accurate i decided to go with the diamondback reflex for a nice middle ground option at close to medium range but it's really up to you now then before we get into today's gameplay i need to tell you about today's sponsor omaze amaze if you didn't know
