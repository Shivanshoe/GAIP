can you compliment me on my outfit please oh you've got the mesh it's called the scrimner i learned that today how do you see through that who said that said that hello oh he died definitely on me you can throw as many nades as you want are you trying to hit me one that's two i've got the third there he's gonna peak that window let's get in there so what's up people and welcome back to insurgency sandstorm and somehow it's been three months since i last posted a video on this game how the heck did i let that happen but we're back today because they've just added a new update which brings with it a new map and two new shotguns as part of the operation glass house update first of all we've got the ks23 4 gauge shotgun which fires 23 millimeter rounds nice your throat killing skills are remarkable no kidding these guns actually exist and they're made using aircraft gun barrels look at that thing they also added the bullpup ksg shotgun which is a personal favorite of mine it definitely comes in handy for concealing your weapon around corners but check out this reload time you may want to grab a snack for this one yeah i'm still here don't worry how was your day um did you have a good bowel movement this morning oh we're done thank god for that and i wish i'd known this sooner but the ksg even has a point shooting grip that allows you to aim with the laser which is so awesome oh this is sick how did i miss this oh and if you're part of the notification squad here on youtube then allow me to provide you with a couple of steam codes now if that isn't enough reason to subscribe then i don't know what else to do i'm not trying to make you guys jump through hoops for giveaways but if you do want to follow me on twitter that's usually the place i do them so they also added some new dlc cosmetics to fit the whole prison vibe i guess but i usually prefer to mix and match these outfits these ones are pretty clean though i can't lie you know what if you already own insurgency then boom there's some codes for the cosmetics i think that's all i can do oh yeah and there's some new weapon skins as well they've added a woodland camo and carbon fiber camera which looks crazy here's some codes for those as well you're welcome that's right i'm single-handedly trying to boost the player numbers for insurgency sandstorm it's a great game what can i say i almost have 100 hours playtime now so that should tell you how much i enjoy it anyway that's the foundation for the video laid so let's jump into some gameplay drop a like for the algorithm and subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one there's a bunch of them down there but i'm gonna be able to do much we'll say as well he just rpg himself he's dead does this enemy not realize i hear him [Music] you know we hear your voice comes right shut the [ __ ] up okay let's go reload if you're gay hey i'm gonna load should up got about seven people to reload oh this is awesome what the hell look at this place oh my ears anyone else yeah he might be they might be sending uh prone in the crates that you're going to get that's why i was hiding and it was like [Applause] you're in my home yeah this is my house someone protect me for 10 minutes while i reload my shut ksg all right reload if you're gay i need to reload every single one notice i didn't reload because i'm [ __ ] just nobody nobody move if you're gay you're so straight sick mission failed we'll get them next time yo tom can i get a kiss yeah man dude check out my arms i'm huge no it's huge as me dude i mean come on look at these biceps i don't know man mine are pretty big um oh i mean yeah it's like looking at my own reflection all right we finally got the ksg everyone fights for it as soon as the match starts but luckily i've got a faster ssd wait i sniped someone at that range probably could i've got the shirt round so hello trying to push me i think not oh that's another one get back here there's another one there what i said get back in here i'm gonna [ __ ] you i'm in the room you were just in so many in there what the hell just killed his friend with a pistol so jesus oh no run teammate this reminds me so much of operation locker from battlefield it's already one of my like new favorite maps love the focus on close quarter gameplay i get in here yes i thought that was a teammate the worst thing about these chevrons on jesus christ so loud in here got that guy no that's the worst thing about hip fire guns in this game you don't have a crosshair try this again i've got two here my team push up now oh look at this so many routes into the same area good map design actually it's too far ahead here going there with an rpg dead blew his arm off let's go back under here i'm not sure where the enemies are spawning hello and goodbye anybody else oh my god this is so satisfying absolutely brutal this shotgun takes a lifetime to reload though i can get up there as well can they look like it was scripted from a campaign or something it's just something about the uh immersive nature of it all minimal hud elements and the sound design for like a title that isn't a triple a studio it's kind of crazy where are you going oh my from that range you kidding me more steps outside here that guy's body the fact i got most head shots with a shotgun clearly built different no one doesn't let me all right we're on the insurgents team now he's the ass val since oh this is always risky but try and go in the restricted area holy crap my last bullet that's a teammate and that guy definitely had heavy armor on like just hosting with bullets clear the enemy team all right i'm dead it's so painful yet so fun at the same time oh my god no i wanted to see that fight we're losing hard right now we've got two waves left and they've got 19. we need to capture eight big time i'm trying to secure the second floor here probably stairs without dying he was on the southwest corner southwest corner jesus what's happening down there oh there's one killed one on thee says val is so rapid but it lacks in damage it absolutely makes up for a rate of fire recall control too it's surprisingly low on recoil sounds like he's on point with a shotgun let's get b i don't know how we turn that one around but we've got waves back somehow stalemate we're capturing [ __ ] you like shower this place oh man this map is so good it just flows really well let's go gamers okay we've got b let me go check go out outside this game has like a restricted area where you can go in it like i am now but you only get like three seconds where you can actually use your gun like i can't shoot now but what i can do is flank the enemy and then bring my weapon out once and behind them like this now i've got the high ground you got this window i can't i don't know where i'm spawning some cheeky angles here you know my character running out of breath there too makes a lot harder to aim damn just saw him in the container there landed the shots before i did holding down c right now holy crap barely saw that guy careful teammate [Applause] oh [ __ ] watch out tristan oh i'm alive i couldn't see where it was that's such a fail we do the grenade launcher in here this place is such a maze isn't it map knowledge is so key in this game so many steps i've just spawned i think we got him yep i need to reload oh god the timing there oh no they've come to the point what no risky business i need to find a flag somewhere [Music] oh we need to get to e right now we actually have more waves in them [Applause] holding down the uh the main area there let's go team oh my god look at him prone looking through the railings with a ksg shotgun this is so sick man i love it he's not dead he's not dead i killed a different man it doesn't mean they're all dead up here i'm getting shot from somewhere what the hell is going on oh my god this is crazy [Music] i need to get to e i don't know who has the uh the ied to blow that up oh no i've been flashbanged and i've just released the grenade i hope i don't kill that teammate okay he's fine i think it rolled down sorry there's too much going on here everyone's just getting caught in the line of fire let's get on that point killed one [Applause] they could literally be anywhere they should be very weak so many prison cells in hiding spots let's move out all right [Music] okay i'm dead run away run away sorry come oh on god this is sick what did i just witness yeah there's one dude hey guys tommy here why did he say that hey guys it's tomographic here hey guys don't forget to smash like and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so you don't miss out on any future videos i i don't sound british
