so then today i'm using the brand new black tracer m4a1 in warzone alongside my deadly acura spr sniper build a slight change of pace since my last m4 video as i'm still trying to figure out which barrel i like best on this gun the corvus custom marksman barrel feels like a much better option for those close to medium ranges but that grenadier barrel is a really solid pick for beaming at range so i've got a couple of matches to show you today playing with acolyte and thugler we had some pretty tough games in this one but it's an accurate representation of what 90 of our matches really look like so i think you're going to enjoy just watching us suffer for a bit i don't know probably a lot more relatable than some of the highlight gameplay that you see on the channel regularly but yeah i'm going to leave you to enjoy the gameplay so leave a like if you do subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one it does seem a little bit too quiet without tom that's not like this talking pain in my ears it's alright that's muted what oh hello okay dude that doesn't make any sense i was muted so i couldn't hear you yeah that works for me what what i completely felt my jump see you in an hour you do people not like training trios nevermind never mind i'll find someone like you oh my god the shogun's bad he says wells for downing i'm in it's the m80 it takes a lifetime to fire oh my god i just own this guy and the shotgun is so bad there's a guy up here not anymore so not anymore i won the fight oh my god is this what it feels like to be good at the game wait okay he's gonna lose now then i report back to me and like hope that's me when we win the game oh my god guys i guess i want to fight i'm so proud of you thanks man dude has been so long we need more money though that's train station did you pick mine up yeah try the roof on the roof how are we looking we got a that's perfect i got 10k i don't have any plates so can someone drop a plate by any chance i've got no plates well i didn't hack you who did talents hey somebody dropped it off for the buy station that's awesome oh fuggy it's gone isn't it oh oh yeah oh yeah i grabbed that bouncy i need some plates i need a little more oh you need place any plates anybody in your plates on your plates disney plates party photos holy crap this sniper's ugly why don't you say so earlier yeah uh anybody got plates no no even if i did i wouldn't give you any i know my god i still like asking you so i feel part of the conversation you created the conversation anybody in there i wouldn't talk to you otherwise hey would you like extra yikes with those yikes toxic i could give you plates but i don't want to thanks i'll set this up okay all right there were two on orange marker last scene watch i'm gonna die going up now it's about time for something like that to happen because i'm always the one following you off the zip or like into a room and being the one to die oh oh did you first shot my guy broke armor what are you using spr it's insane oh okay heck you damned tundra focus his teammates just parachuted onto the same bit you're a hard bastard all right anybody can place just good wanna push if we knock one i might push it yeah he's put his peeking is peeking oh i just actually jumped off let's go welcome there's two two on one live oh okay i thought they were deeper in the building they're just both on that side ledge no they were all featured that was a sick actually no i'm good he's back trying to myself wait yeah yeah you're good you're good i somehow killed both yeah they were both on the outside ledge that i landed on the right side they're just lined up on the way in i got ruined i didn't even see the other guy i'm gonna flank on this right side they're gonna have no idea aren't they yeah they were expecting that oh guys behind us right behind oh sorry let's get in this building here they're not getting this building right he's not getting this bullying he's gone he's going nuts is that bouncy coming towards you i can't even see him he just sniped me with no glint are you safe though yeah i'm gonna try to snipe him as i'll watch they're gonna be pushing i'm watching don't see anyone pushing this one find the truck the last guy is in the far background like my i hope this is up to them [Music] in ihub oh it was done yeah we're in there and in the room one uh behind the counter the other team might push you all right back down on my loadout i guess i should just get go so i'm glad i didn't decide to push on that because that stun ruined me but i was just close enough to get into cover yeah i'm done pushing yeah i'm not doing it anymore i lose everything we shouldn't even push with the m4 like no it's so pushy medium range close if you build it like an smg any plates i can buy a play box yeah we can just buy stuff actually i think it's worth it it's cheaper if i just buy what about a kill contract like that because we don't have satchels yeah they're fighting up here oh shoot on my way i'm running up there i have a red key card there's a team we can fight here we could get satchels from that but but yeah we can find it we can find it in action but also the thing is there so we can't need to do it now whenever all right she's never building again it was like right here just beyond this point oh [Music] oh dude every time i'm gonna be [Applause] how did he survive vehicle incoming words you yep i'm standing still man it just fell out attack one they felt wait time yes my new one nice good follow-up teammates got an easy result in there very easy [Applause] oh should be an easy push there for you connor okay got him all right you might be back again sure i can't believe you are freaking missing

thought it was like it's going up so sorry about it oh  oh my god i take a plate too if you can that i can do this is crazy [Music] crazy absolutely crazy pomographic all right i'll set it up i'll be debate drop headed your way do you know i'm not dead do you guys want to stick down left kind of i hate fine oh someone see me don't wanna get the lord yeah because every time you go to the roof we just die it's getting short from here moving i do agree come down with me oh i just fell off oh i meant to fall off yeah wait wait it's almost beaming from fire i guess all right up here no visual 24 enemies uh do we have enough for uav um my money i buy a station tom there's definitely guys still on the roof somewhere oh yeah requesting kind of out in the open here next roof not this one got three people over here that's gonna be pushing the open in a second they could peek that way we're on the edge of the gas i see them running over i just got me oh dude he pushed up here why oh nice dude you have good money i don't understand this game today yep i can't believe you've got to jump on us like that it's diamond lobbies for you [Applause] guys there heading this way dude there's no good areas here get on the ground get on the ground get on the ground you know here is our only option we need to use the tunnel if we can because they're gonna have to cross over us in a second up on the roof above us to our right yeah did they see did they see i don't know i don't know i just realized i bought a uav at the buy station but i left the cluster straight behind no i picked it up good i picked it up do i do it now um when the zone pushes them put it in front of us like just put on that building moving he's he's running he's jumping i think yeah there's definitely three up there can we go all the way come on shake it off no uh dude we're gonna have to i'm clustering the roof be careful of your right side because those snipers are on it oh yeah we can't shoot we have the this game's nuts did you see the guy at you from across the river actually yeah he's like here he's like here he is he should be shot oh he's down oh it was done don't peek from behind because there's a sniper behind us he has to come towards us shoot i should save us a cluster then they'll be able to be seen by the other sniper surely right it's getting shining yeah jump left not the same guy behind you guys not the same guy that initially jumped off the roof yeah there's one towards the polluter one directly ahead west towards the green mark yeah i'm above all righty okay stuff quit i still three teams man what nothing on herpe anymore you gotta won a quick sniper deal i think such a horrible end zone go on now you want to run it oh he sees us on the right side like the lowdown where's the loadouts yeah yeah okay behind us i walked into it didn't i that's right i guess wow i must have walked right into it i would lock today dude i actually walked right into it we have to like have eyes everywhere yeah that whole game for me was just being bullied over and over and over welcome to my lobbies guys sometimes war zone is just pain gg i guess i mean it was decent teamwork we did what we could we survived quite a bit positioning was as good as it could be why don't we buy special routers and vpn like everyone else guys god no at least our content is real [Music] uh
