now you listen here gamers this may not be news to you but the gallows shotgun is perfect for rebirth island do i even need to explain why close range map plus close range shotgun equals plenty of kills and i was looking through the copious amounts of warzone footage that i've acquired recently and it's not often that i post any rebirth gameplay at all despite getting hundreds of comments from people that want to see more rebirth island gameplay so when i stumbled across this recording from a recent game i thought why have i not posted this yet look at this by the way i killed this cheater who clearly couldn't use his cheats correctly and he was using a dark matter a max which you can't even get on modern warfare guns he even had a matching car 98k which i managed to wipe another team with anyway i've got a high kill round playing alongside stoddy and wesley foy today as we run around the map like headless chickens but with that being said let's just jump into the gameplay leave a like for the algorithm subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one oh my god dude this game teammates to the left of him it could be me yeah i say right here somewhere he was downstairs downstairs yeah if you can get downstairs yeah clear steps jumping jumping nothing go go go i've got a recon drone here flown off i'll play [Music] phrase cheeky boy the beam one above us
