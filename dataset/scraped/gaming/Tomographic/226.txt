scopes and scatter guns aka snipers or shotguns only this is war zones first ever limited time mode and though me my friends were skeptical at first especially because the new mode fully replaced the trio's playlist we've actually been having a lot of fun there are no vehicles in this mode and the lack of RPGs is a welcome change I think we can all agree that the RPG spam has been getting a little out of hand recently so it's been nice to play a mode that focuses purely on the gunplay anyway I hope you enjoyed today's gameplay and trust me you're going to want to stick around because there are some crazy matches in this one make sure you subscribe for more warzone content like this and I will see you next time I need to I need a guy Oh where's this lab oh no it's over here somewhere oh how
