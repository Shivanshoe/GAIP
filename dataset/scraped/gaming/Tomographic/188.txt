all right so what's up guys and welcome back to apex legends this video is sponsored by ea and today we're going to be checking out season 6 boosted and discovering some of the new content alongside my friends acula and noah j456 so we have a new legend rampart who is a 21 year old british indian and brings her modded shields and knowledge of heavy weapons including sheila at least that's what she calls her minigun don't worry she bites rampart's passive grants her increased magazine capacity as well as faster reloads with lmgs and her minigun the tactical ability allows her to build a crouch cover wall which deploys an amped wall that blocks incoming shots and amps outgoing shots increasing damage for you and your teammates and you can put five of these walls down at one time last but by no means least we have her ultimate which is a mounted machine gun that anyone can use and well this thing absolutely shreds probably one of the most satisfying stationary turrets that i've ever used in a video game it's a lot of fun and allows you to put a buttload of firepower downrange and just look at this reload animation too the animators have really outdone themselves here there's even a different reload and inspect animation when you're using any legend that isn't rampart and seeing as she built sheila herself it makes sense that she knows the ins and outs of her own engineering and this allows her to reload the mini gun much faster than the other legends we also have new skins new holo sprays new map changes a new crafting system and a new energy based smg the vault which looks sounds and feels amazing to use in battle there is seriously so much going on in the new season 6 update so check out the link in the description below if you want to find out more information it also really helps to support the channel so yeah without further ado i'm going to show you some gameplay now using rampart but be sure to leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it and
