take the hell if you need it somewhere yeah i'm getting it nice on that team so much better oh my god well the velocity makes a huge impact yeah it's not so much the damage range that one down one down one there down one there all bullets it's so good it's so overwhelming with all the the different changes and the fact that those changes won't actually apply oh my god this yes this grip gives me slide speed that sounds crazy and then they put it on barrel gives me 20 damage it doesn't yeah no effect but they do work you know they might not be as good but they work it could have been much worse yes i mean that's the thing at least they are usable at close range because then you're like right it just needs a little bit a little bit of fine tuning finesse a bit of finesse and one i have downed one i hear footage left he's going to his res there are footsteps on me oh i am dead oh i didn't even hear the shots no i didn't even ruined it it's a cold war gun i bet it doesn't work properly i didn't hear it at all i heard nothing oh you're right you're just like going off on a tear over there well they're coming at me like zombies so might as well you know there's two guys on that level hey yeah watch out westy i'm just on the roof children yeah i hear him one believe me yeah just self-rest think he's coming up not sure sounds like he's running upstairs watch the skies go there live yeah probably okay another one as well just find him oh he's gonna see me my dad oh yeah pg'ed me come on why didn't i hear anything [Applause] should have shaved off some time i i got shot by two different people from two different angles at the exact same time without realizing no after being not intentional no game no game okay there's a guy here marking marking behind you westy no it's too late it's too late we're in we're in the absolute god tier of sweats mode basically plus third and how am i alive zod's in his safe space i'm one of the cluster in my safe space yeah there's a meme i'm dropping in live hostile three on the roof three on the roof right now i reckon i could sneak up on him just need a gun man you might push me [Applause] down whoa okay did not have any idea that was coming in did you yes nice teamwork is that you up on the roof tommy i'm absolutely frying right now i'm pogging oh you are yeah and i never say that yeah you're actually frightened eight kills at the moment no death yeah yeah oh death you've just been running around i think i've wiped three or four squads there's a meme at the bottom of the garden and i can't believe i didn't realize we'll just buy your loadout it's not worth running over there and getting killed right should we oh the inaccuracy is real loadout's down here you bought it thank you oh there ah the edge the edge lord all right we're going to let somebody get some kills let's see the edge no we don't want to steal them all it's all right so what you're saying is i don't want to say too many i don't want to take too many with my money to lose the game and i don't want to i don't want to take too many kills at the same hd you know so right that's fair that's fair it's very powerful that's the only reason you're not getting kills yeah yeah that was absolutely insanity and i loved it again against the top sweats as well yeah we just jumping in and out of windows going up last year ladding it up picking up every like running out of ammo in one weapon type having to pick up another yeah yeah the angle oh yeah i saw the window the armor on that guy um behind the tree one time i get him hey nice okay that sniper definitely knows i'm here yeah i i finished that reload kid you not half a second later then the ammo count updated stod's orange threat he just told me he just shot at me and missed yeah how much did you land that shot i thought you couldn't shoot through metal doors that guy just shot me through a metal door okay it wasn't him that was shooting at me that's why i'm gonna go on a roof yeah that's the guy that's beaming me what's up man we're gonna have to take this peli roof here is the one here uh-huh what just in front yeah you're high threat yeah i got him now now no threat yeah i got him oh how's the guy lovely helly you gotta say the recoil the recoil is pretty controllable i guess got another one let's go right here on orange oh [Applause] yeah no but there's one more blower somewhere three cellphones though any ammo box musicians all right armor munitions sofas they've just gone to the building now they've just gone through it i'm on the roof uav entering the ao they're below they're below down low on the last two teams fighting last two teams uh i got me from uh west oh from the west from the building uh i think there's still a guy across yeah on the buy station you'll be able to snipe this guy westy no problem i should have strike the hell yeah on the flank there he is there he is there he is oh he's in the heli you get in there nice one two v two and then and they're in wesley's building they're in westie's building yeah they're just down here one less tv one there's one more in the building together can't fault that you're right i think he's got ghost yeah right he's right below westy [Music] what a game beautiful what a game eight kills in the first two minutes three in the game that always happens as soon as you say it i genuinely do prefer the cold war weapons to start uh like groundling yeah yeah they're good guns like like they're good because they're like you know most your engagements are going to be close quarters but the problem is that they just cannot compete when it comes to proper war zone combat yeah and the other person is 50 meters away exactly and you need the extra range maybe that's maybe that's a good thing though because that's the that's the area that hasn't really been explored in terms of weaponry in this game dude i've got such a good one for the uh the sound board i forgot to put it on last night very soon very soon oh my god did you oh didn't kill him go on westy there you go yes honestly finish myself he's at the bottom of the staircase in the doorway are you good wait how is he not he was there pushing you because i don't finish his teammate and his t is the guy killed when this kid do not push this guy do not push this guy there's a guy in the top of the is sweaty tower right so we get loadout again he's in there still he's still in there come on i don't see him i don't see him at all i got him is this plunder i think sorry right you know that guy with the shotgun is going to come back to you i can almost get this is ridiculous can you jump up yeah i got it even without jumping yeah i it without him okay there's a worm at the bottom of the garden how can we get our loadout twice i didn't get it um one of us clearly hasn't got it yeah i haven't got it i've just grabbed it it's remaining oh just leave us alone please hey enemy leave us lance alone oh now he's trying someone else what's wrong with you don't the movement's not great on the snipers nothing on heartbeat window stud threaded the needle through the house can we drop in on the roof on the loading over here is he down now he's on the back of the right he's just been means i survived i survived the survival of the sniper survive on the roof at the back over here on blue still in this building where the meme is at there's so many plates around here there yeah coming down the hill that's a nice kill confirmed there's one guy there's a guy in the bottom of the garden oh he's right here how did he not see me oh my god how did he not see me again that is insane get the guy down down one cross in where's that behind the truck what's the last guy dead and that's it what a mental game that was it was indeed somehow we survived [Music] you
