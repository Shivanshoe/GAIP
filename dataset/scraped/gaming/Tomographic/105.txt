[Applause] [Music] hello everyone and welcome to this first look video at far cry 6 scheduled for release on october 7th this is ubisoft's most ambitious open world game yet and a huge thank you to ubisoft for sponsoring today's video i've been lucky enough to get my hands on some exclusive gameplay footage and i have some new and exciting details to share with you today so let's just get right into it so far cry 6 takes place on the fictional tropical island of yara deep in the heart of the caribbean it's a rich diverse environment alongside decaying urban landscapes but before we talk more about the island itself let me first bring you up to speed with the story so far so frozen in time yara was once a prosperous and peaceful nation 50 years ago however a revolution occurred when the father of gustavo fring sorry i mean anton castillo played by the great giancarlo esposito was yara's el presidente the revolution resulted in anton's father being executed right before his very eyes and in the 50 years that followed yara experienced substantial economic decline eventually anton himself was elected el presidente on the promise of rebuilding yara to the place it was 50 years ago anyone who did speak out against his methods was rounded up into forced labor and his oppression of the iron people has pushed the island to the brink of a new revolution in response anton tightened his grip on the island and to achieve his dream for yara and his san diego anton has cracked down on the country's freedoms instituted brutal social reforms and now europa finds itself on the verge of collapse rule or be ruled a castile must be a lion okay so let's talk about some of our main protagonists so at the start of your journey you'll get to pick your identity while evolving as a gorilla that's grilla not gorilla and gathering more weapons and gear to fight anton's regime you play as danny rojas and you will experience the revolution through dany's eyes from the very start of the game born and raised in yara's capital you're a young military dropout who wants nothing to do with anton or the revolution you just want to get the hell off this island while you still can but once you're face to face with anton's brutality you realize that the only chance to truly live free is to lead an army of guerilla fighters into a new revolution you will join forces with a colorful cast of characters including clara garcia the leader of the revolutionary group libertad when tyranny is law revolution is order and of course juan cortez a jaded xkgb spy and guerrilla master the two go together like fire and fury from jungles beaches and swamps to villages towns and cities the island of yara has been designed in a way that makes you the player feel like you're exploring an entire country and not just a single region like some of the previous far cry games it really feels like ubisoft are trying to switch up the formula here and make this far cry game stand out from the rest with a real emphasis on storytelling and world building and you know this is the first falco game releasing on this brand new generation of consoles the playstation 5 and xbox series x so it would make sense that ubisoft would want to capitalize on this brand new hardware increasing visual fidelity and frame rates and the game is still set to release on xbox one and ps4 as well so if you haven't been able to get your hands on the latest generation of consoles understandably you don't need to worry about missing out on this one if a dog refuses to break then we must put them down from the onset of anton's rise to power and the beginning of his plans to rebuild paradise the capital city of esporanza has been placed under martial law controlled by anton's elite forces the city has become a no-go area for yarn civilians gorilla only venture into the confines of the concrete world capital on a needs-most basis that's where guerrilla paths come in handy a sprawling network of hidden paths that the guerrillas can use to bypass the island's military forces you can also find some valuable gear intel and vantage points while navigating these paths the road networks on the island are controlled by checkpoints throughout yara and they need to be taken for libertad allowing gorillas to navigate the road network safely the regime's flat cannons are how anton keeps control of the airspace above yara and players will be shut down if they try to fly a plane or helicopter with them in operation the cannons can be found in military locations spread across yara and they need to be destroyed one at a time outposts are also back in far cry 6 and they are now called fnd bases with a few more features to make them even more interesting to tackle now far cry wouldn't be far cry without vehicles would it and yara is well known for its iconic variety of vehicles frozen in time from land sea and air each with their own unique driving characteristics i just love that little bobble head of vast from far cry 3 by the way that's a nice touch another option for dany as a local yaron is to hide in plain sight by holstering weapons a brand new feature in far cry 6 which allows players to interact with the world around them without constantly being targeted by anton soldiers just don't raise suspicions by getting too close and don't enter into restricted areas without expecting all hell to break loose but how can gorilla hide when everything is controlled by the military you might ask well this is where gorilla camps come in the place where gorillas go to hide from anton's forces to plan their attacks and to regroup after a fight these camps will be the central hub where you prepare for battle and where most mission givers can be found and these sitting camps are located all across the landscape of yara now when facing anton casio and his army the odds aren't really in your favor the gorillas are outnumbered outgunned and your only chance is by making the enemy feel like there are a hundred of you when really you're just an army of one that's what the gorilla fantasy is all about and because the island has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades yaron people are used to making what they need from what they have and in far cry 6 the gorillas take the resolve of philosophy to a whole new level fueled by the creativity of resolver mastermind juan cortese far cry 6 features a broad and unexpected arsenal of customizable weapons and tools players can go deeper into their own play style and experiment with a wider range of combinations than ever before if you're sneaking into a military base for example you can gear up for stealth and sabotage to help you remain undetected on the other hand if you're planning to regain a checkpoint by force your equipment can help you deal with heavy damage and giving you an ace off your sleeve should reinforcements be called in another great feature and one that kind of helps far cry 6 feel more like an rpg is that all perks in the game are now tied to the gear that you find giving you meaningful ways to optimize your abilities in this example the marksman goggles will make you a deadliest sniper improving headshot damage while your vest pants and shoes will improve stealth and mobility and with those gloves you'll be sure to never miss your target when throwing knives far cry 6 has the biggest roster of weapons in a far cry game today with more than 49 military grade weapons to choose from and there are loads of customization elements like suppressors scopes laser pointers and more and take this sniper rifle for example you can add a homemade resolver scope to help keep your distance throw on an american suppressor to stay quiet and how about some armor-piercing rounds to ensure clean headshots through helmets oh yeah sniping looks fun in this game now let's take a look at some more of these iconic resolver weapons created by combining objects like motorcycle engines sardine cans gas bombs oh and let's not forget some old school cds so that you can blast tunes through the streets of esperanza while simultaneously blasting enemy soldiers with the new deadly disc launcher also new to far cry 6 and one of my personal favourite new features are supremos a new toy designed to truly make you feel like a one gorilla army hey what's your size let's put them on or off supremos can be activated to unleash a devastating special ability and depending on your approach to each mission choosing the rights of promo for the right job is another great way to complement your playstyle we all know things don't always go to plan right so let's say that you're running through a stealth mission and things get a little bit messy well the exterminator backpack is your best friend when all else fails the last resort diy rocket launcher that will destroy any reinforcements in your range that's so sick but the resolver philosophy doesn't stop at your loadout oh no gorillas will also find inventive ways to turn everyday vehicles into weapons capable of facing castillo's army players will now have their very own ride that they will be able to customize inside and out and have it delivered to you almost anywhere on the island you will be able to truly make the vehicle your own and navigate yara with style adding turrets various countermeasures and of course some sick new rims but why go alone on a mission when you can bring a friend along a returning fan favorite feature in far cry 6 are amigos and they're back to help you on your crazy journey to friara meet guapo the soldier eating crocodile who can help get rid of enemies quickly and efficiently and he's also a great asset while navigating rivers and other large bodies of water and who could forget charitsa the sausage dog doesn't he just melt your heart while his adorable little face will help you to distract soldiers when trying to take them down from the shadows he will of course help you out if that technique fails but listen if anybody hurts my boy chorizo don't be surprised when i become the new baba yeager and go on a revenge fueled killing spree to avenge my little dude who's a good boy having the right tools to complement your play style is a core part of far cry 6 as you can see and the gorilla fantasy with its perfect blend of stealth and action is a great fit for the far cry dna and players will now have more tools than ever before thanks to the new resolver philosophy players are given a huge amount of freedom to play the game however they want and i for one can't wait to get stuck into far cry 6 later this year on october 7th it's gonna be a lot of fun thank you again to ubisoft for sponsoring this one and thank you so
