dude my mouse is freaking broke and this has been happening a couple times how's it broken do you have like a hair underneath is it freaking out that way oh yeah that's the issue dude white guy's laughing that's a serious thing what happens to that's the problem he's been having for the past like a few days great diagnosis connor why are you guys laughing did i miss something it could seriously be there no i don't know dude all the technical advancements in my i'm telling you that has literally happened why is everyone laughing all right welcome everyone to season two of vanguard warzone and i have to admit you know this update has been very well received by me my friends there are some great quality of life changes new pois and locations to explore with two new guns a new battle pass and all the trimmings you'd expect from a new season now let's face it some of the new features have been ripped straight out of apex legends but i will say that the pacing is definitely improved with the addition of the new redeploy balloons allowing players to reposition to a new area of the map without spending time hunting down a vehicle and of course opening the door for plenty of last minute escapes and surprise attacks i've had a pretty good experience on pc aside from a few stutters here and there which i hear is even more elevated on console hopefully that gets resolved soon apparently the last update even broke modern warfare again which is great for those players and judging by my last video there's still quite a lot of you out there who play modern warfare on a daily basis because warzone is still tied to modern warfare's multiplayer launcher from all those years ago it just gets really messy with every new season so hopefully that gets fixed i don't know at least with warzone 2 i'm hoping that the game just won't be as bloated and is just released as its own thing instead of tying down the game that it's released with which is now confirmed to be modern warfare 2 and caldera as a map is just still so hit and miss for people i'm hoping that the volcano in the middle of the map just gets flattened at some point having all of the pois on the outskirts of the map just makes no sense gameplay-wise i don't know any other br that's done that it would be really interesting to see a heat map of caldera compared to the dance because i feel like there's still a lot of areas of caldera that people just don't go whereas for dansk i mean you just found people everywhere everyone had their favorite landing spot whereas i don't really have one in caldera anyway that's enough rambling from me i've got some gameplays to show you now playing with a fast squad and using the m13 and khan 98k yes i still stand by modern warfare guns and to be honest i really don't care to grind out vanguard weapons the older guns still hold up for me and like i said the game's just so blown at the moment i've been playing since warzone released and i've just got so many guns to use the new weapons just don't really appeal to me so drop a like if you enjoy the gameplay subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one dude the new parachuting system is so much better still not going to save you though is it i don't think i'm going to die to fall damage anymore i didn't even realize anything i'm sure you said that at the beginning of every season and then oh what's my street listen buglet's the one who's already died to it i'm 13. i ate let's go all right we got it baby we got it for the balloon it even has an inspect animation on it oh yeah they've added inspect for vanguard guns now oh wow they didn't have that nope no they didn't have that like a thumbnail for vanguard in a year yeah they didn't even have it in
