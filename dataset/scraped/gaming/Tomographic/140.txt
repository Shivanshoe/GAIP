neighborhood content creator so i'm finally back on the youtube grind now that i've officially moved and i'm all set up in my new place so the videos are back and the live streams are too over on twitch if you want to see me play live in today's video though i'm playing with my good friends stonemouth64 and of course jeff leach the voice actor for ghost in warzone and modern warfare i've got an action-packed match to show you now using the ffar and my new and improved khan i8k which you know i thought my previous karna 8k build was pretty perfect but a lot of you have been telling me to try the precision comb stock on the khan ia which improves your aiming stability and in this case when you ads that crosshair is always dead center i'm also using the ffar or the far as mentioned earlier but in the match i'm about to show you i hadn't quite unlocked the agency's suppressor at this point i kind of wanted to save the fire assault rifle for once the hyper died down for it so i'm finally giving it a crack and it may even replace my khan 98 and ram 7 combo which i love so much time will tell but if you enjoyed the video make sure to leave a like on it subscribe for more like

a boat out here let's get ghost we've already got ghost we've got ghost let's take these apartment buildings again they're always highly contested so if we have it at least then um yeah i'm down eliminates the element of surprise people are gonna be coming over to this region as well yeah grab some extra ammo roof of uh store guys i'm putting too much lead what's the range on this 170. nevermind i'm looking for a self-rest on that roof don't see anything enemies there's no strike on us no confirmation on that down i guess you're always gonna have to go out there i haven't seen a pop let's see if he's got a self-res or if his third team is rising come around that corner yeah there's my bleed nice all right let's see if his third boy comes up trying to res that guy now oh he fell off behind that got him okay i couldn't even see it he's like yeah i'm bouncing him though vehicle vehicle vehicle i'm one one one hopped out live on one stop one got out we're coming out the rock is live marked down one of the vehicle nice another one knock the other vehicle there confirm on him heading out knocked one in the road there hit once got the full nice this there's another one over

vehicle over on yeah yeah two of them yeah this could be the driver broke got the driver nice you can get the full there damn he made it in it's okay i don't really want to jump down on him i doing jeff yeah there's guys over here on me because my bounty i got a level three threat don't try to make it up the zip here nice and place here quick and we're gonna have a satchel and uh muni box here as well we gots to go and that guy's still on the hill he's been trying to suppress us this entire time i think we're better off just rolling the vehicle yeah rise ahead on the hill just rest right here there's a guy on the hill we're going to train yep we take the roof here we'll be pretty good [Music] especially since we don't have a trophy or anything yes sir your place jeff you're good i'm good thank you bro yeah all set cool i'll keep this armor box i guess we need it oh just up ahead yeah oh okay with a stone what i'm dead the right opposite with that and 13. that was the most unfortunate thing in the world yeah absolutely beamed me too or was he jeff oh [ __ ] same [Applause] i hit him once this guy's 100 gonna try and land on me i'm gonna try and pull back to you so behind the wall you're mad raise the ball right now safe can i land on that roof stone i grab my old gear in the lower mid tier you can land on it yeah um i'm not sure if i'm gonna be able to jump down and get jeff here though this guy's on the roof i'm going to go for it i don't know that part of him up there he's got stopping power knocked him i hate the living in this game nice i gotta jump down he's calling the crack too teammate yeah he's already above he's now on my dead body he's about to go in the middle floor he'll be on the floor just above where you are now tommy okay one goo lagged above no no dude jeff you can finish that it's alright nice all done you've got still warmer updates yeah there was a google angle though probably gonna jump out of stuns find an angle here we should head to the safe zone i was probably the guy getting his stuff back yeah huge well done gentlemen real breathe while you can yeah there's a crown over here vehicle driving dirty yep just be careful of the third party oh yeah yeah from on top of big red knocked him knocked him on big red repositioning three of them just got out yeah broke one down one what's your bloody fire i'm coming in your building here at the end knocked him on a finished one at the end of the building ground floor got the re-knock well it was personal that's twofold why didn't he shoot me that was so weird i couldn't even see him i just started shooting yeah did you get the third one was that the last one i did i don't i don't know i really don't i got two so you can okay you got two i got one okay i've just had a cell phones then clear move out just play together here play together there are 24 enemies still out there kill them all we got to go zone we got to go zone there was another team on back red over on orange um back over here hopefully we're gonna have a team coming from back orange there okay but we gotta keep moving up let's just get in zone i think we take uh this building just navigate through yeah i don't know where we go here it's gonna be hard because red building is gonna kind of suck i kind of need to be line it with the zone line ourselves up for it yeah i'm crossing over to you behind behind to the right behind the right yep let's just get ahead of them let's just keep going enemy uav or we want to fight this guy's all mean guys on me guys i mean broken behind the truck he's still on bottom floor there yep all right we are going to be in trouble here brother just going to say this small building firehouse to our right yep good call shots up at firehouse and red roof i think i saw let's take this so slow fire station like a top or uh-huh no no okay okay it looks like you might have been getting hit from top red i don't know we're not in here though i'm just gonna break this window we'd take orange that's kind of risk uh ground floor of this we could do this one edge of this corner yeah yeah behind to the right broke dead how many just one dude what was that fight that was so weird that was bad timing is what it was holy there's one guy in a bear outfit he pre-fired that door on me bro yeah i got messed up out of plates let's go come see out of stuns [Music] good teamwork though good comms good snipes funny there was a way to work out who the weakest member of the team was what do you mean that's that's 31 kills combined jeff we don't need to say one bomb let's go who got the kills yeah i'm just glad i did some damage at least i mean not a lot but there was there was definitely moments there where you came and clutch your residence stuff man i think most of my damage is probably from the the 25 gulags i went through should we see this out oh wait is this um just see who wins yeah yeah we expect this one top three might as well these guys are good they're split right now so one's in the low ones in the high building it's 2v2 be one right would be one guy who's coming in behind us on the edge of gas making zero sound ruins our game just a random random dude coming in on the flank there yeah he messed me up to be fair no he he was very good he knew what he was doing yeah i mean he heard that those fights going down too so he knew that we were going to be coming in on that side would have played it the same and just timed it out yeah down below so well yeah exactly this guy should win it he this guy should be looking at the door that's what i'll be doing we just assumed that that guy that killed us was a full team don't let him jump out i think one of them already jumped out and pushing him maybe not thought i heard one name far so good man dude i would get i'll get to the other window right now so he doesn't need to run once the zone pushes him there you go he heard you i'd be peeking that window like what are you doing he's worried he's going to get pushed but it's behind the truck his teammate got it now zone's pulling super far he's still in the ghost play i don't know what that is oh he got it his teammate really helped out that teammate carried his ass i mean um i mean helped definitely god damn uh boys ggs guys how's it going oh i'm the team leader am i it's all right rounds out the content when you see who wins the game after you've just been slaughtered by it if you're close to the end i like to see what people do what decisions they make [Music]
