so we all have those days in war zone where nothing seems to go your way be a new drop spot or loadout it just doesn't seem to matter warzone can be a cruel mistress and some days it decides that you deserve to be punished for no good reason at all oh you son of a where did you come from i've just searched the entirety of superstore just to get killed by this guy why do i live just to suffer where's waldo oh there he is okay don't see me you've seen me oh look at the flick of the wrist okay it was a sniper glenn won't peek it oh you had to peek it out the uav shall we uav i'll see you again i'm sorry it's coming towards me oh the flick is back actually gonna move around on this right side oh no i'm dead absolute rat where have you been for the last five minutes i can't catch a break today there's gonna be a lot of people landing here caught my shoots so later give me that let's go that's the one going in yes [Music] take that and you can have that give me this gun quick this is crazy where is he there he is i can't see a thing why is the sun like this no oh my god that is such a stupid design decision look how clearly this guy can see me as well how is that balanced steps i've won the fight haha you're stunned what are you gonna do fair and balanced it's like i got a most wanted contract in solos you mad lady i guess you get good money from it right oh this is the worst time to reload it's gonna play up again there is oh the trucks on fire what are you doing what are you doing you dummy you big dum-dum he just killed himself with a truck there's a lad over here that's a death wish look at him done done england oh it's coming home it's coming home broke in reload hey the server feels a bit laggy oh but hello my baby found another lad that's just called his loadout on a rooftop does he also have a death wish just need to watch that ladder hatch right on time oh i should have waited for him to actually be in his loadout i am terrible why is it so hard to hear people when they're down look how much they wriggle around i was like what seven shots to kill him oh it's embarrassing that is embarrassing that is embarrassing i'm gonna try and take one of these gondolas over there's a nice little ladder jump you can do so i'm just shooting me where there right here we go i missed it but you get the idea let's finish this contract lovely get my satchel and some cash doesn't land the back there yazzy no i want to land there if he wins his gulag okay there's an airstrike coming in [Applause] by the tower there he is oh he was low there's a guy in the truck over there must have been the other guy who was shooting at him why are there so many play boxes i swear they only pop up when i don't need them my bounty's down here somewhere in the ravine oh no must have been on the bridge let's go for his loadout wait for it bounty target is down well done uav entering the place oh he's in there no oh he's gonna hear me now always gone over what the hell is that dude dmr maybe ah wouldn't put me down that fast he's already above me i'm running around no game nope i hate that so much what gun was this guy using fal okay i respect it i need to win this flashed let's go lovely we're back in the fight just to land directly on my loadout someone's probably seen me yeah org car i8 it's been a while since used the car figured i'd show it some love i've got a buy station here i've actually got enough to get sulphurs careful someone's fighting on this hill mark attack rover feel quite slow with this org not gonna lie hasn't got the best mobility i call that one the lazy snipe just let them walk into the bullet there's gotta be a guy in that building oh he's on the building okay doesn't look like he has much i've just come back from the gulag it's in that truck though that's annoying loadout just landed on my roof he's coming towards me yes oh rocky mistake easy beam as he was climbing into the truck okay the org does feel like it hits pretty hard but the rate of fire isn't isn't anything to write home about apparently they buffed it but it still feels like it's got a long way to go i still really enjoy using it though it was my first like go-to weapon when warzone first released this setup's a bit different though i've got the 30 round mag on and then i've got the merc 4 grip mono suppressor gi mini reflex and [Music] attack laser i think no barrel where is everyone come on this is so boring i hate when it's just a complete stalemate get to the new safe zone well we gotta move now try and cut some of them out here it's definitely gonna be a guy in there isn't there i'm not sure about the ground floor of this building oh someone just get that load out barely seeing it feels bad can i eat a snapshot ah that hurt and he's got battle hardened who the hell uses that the one perk that denies my snapshot grenades crazy i never see that i was on the roof how do i oh it's this way isn't it it's a ladder here there we go no shoot me please this is sketchy i'm not sure about this one i need to cross over though to that main antenna the main satellite even anyone up there in the gondolas perhaps he's got across from that building so oh no i just crouched into the headshot and the airstrike i need to get in the hatch now no of course he had an airstrike he hit a nice sniper me there fair play that's just one annoying end game i'm gonna have to cut out so much of the mid game of this match it was just so dead i was running around for like five ten minutes not doing anything who expected now the guy that just killed me he's got an m13 with a 3x he's found a bush here a solo player's favorite the hell is that love heart okay he doesn't love me he was just shaking his head at the heart mixed messages here not gonna lie see this is just what solos is now at least the games that i get myself into the sbm is so high every match just feels i don't know how do you even explain this this is gaming in 2021 that's just power else it's always been the same this is a horrible enzyme too oh it's over at least this guy got vengeance for me all the rats start coming out of their hiding holes that was inside the uh lower doors there wasn't he can't kill me is his name we'll see about that this is the pharah i think so yeah oh my god dude he just parachuted above you no and he still wins the fight after that there's no way he didn't even start shooting first that's crazy i guess his name really does hold up he can't be killed it's been sniped out though that's from the top left right it's gonna parachute over dude is this guy wearing his headset backwards or something like he's got his left and right audio back to front he's not going to be at the very top of that is he don't think the guy made it in the parachute maybe he did i think he's on one of these yep down low 1v1 why is this other guy not pushing back at it no dude he just got himself killed how does this guy win the game i'm sorry i mean congratulations like you know i think he had like 10 kills so credit to him but well that's just a perfect example of you know anyone can win warzone anyone can win a beer toxic he just didn't seem to know where anyone was shooting him from it's crazy ggs y'all are terrible at the end hey no he was just wearing his headset backwards guys [Laughter] he's got his head so bad i like this guy dj voice what is this game that we're playing hey you probably nafty dumbo my head popped you nasty on the hill dude yeah i remember right here good [ __ ] dude thanks man ggs what the hell was that match [Music] [Applause] [Music] that much [Applause] [Music]
