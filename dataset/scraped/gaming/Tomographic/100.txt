guys how about that battlefield 2042 reveal trailer my mind is completely blown dice have absolutely delivered on the things that we wanted to see as a community so i thought it'd be cool if we slowed everything down a bit and tried to pull as much information as we can out of what we just saw together we've got a lot to cover here so let's just get right into it so the trailer starts with a bird's eye view panning over a dense snowy map and the camera tilts upwards to reveal a large peak with some sort of spy base built into the mountains we get our first glimpse at one of the aerial vehicles using flares just before getting struck by a lock-on missile which immediately confirms that this new battlefield game will be set in a modern near future setting we then get our first look at soldiers in uniform who appear to be running from their impending doom as the aircraft crash lands into the top of the base showing off some glorious battlefield destruction in the process and the camera begins to follow this character dressed very differently to the surrounding soldiers with full headgear and wearing some more lightweight attire a terrified soldier runs straight into them and they both tumble off the edge of the helipad as everyone attempts to base jump from the incoming danger now i don't know about you but this is giving me strong damage peak vibes from battlefield 3. the first time i jumped off the helipad in that game gave me goosebumps so i can't wait to relive that moment in battlefield 2042 still tracking this character we focus on a soldier gliding beside us ready to pull his parachute as he gives us a friendly thumbs up and a nod to come for us oh no he's dead just when i was starting to like that guy we then switched to a first person perspective as the free-falling soldiers begin to pull their parachutes around us and then boom turns out this character is wearing a wingsuit which they deploy and fly out of frame as the crashed aircraft hits the ground and explodes this is where we see the dice logo for the first time in years and this time in that sexy teal blue color that the internet has just gone mad about since battlefield started teasing us on social media the logo fades away and when the video fades back in again we see a large downtown area set in what looks like east or southeast asia if i was to guess based on this sign looking over a huge lush park with explosions going off left right and center as we zoom in towards the battle below boom robo-dog hits the ground and almost turns these two soldiers into kool-aid he stands up ready for battle and charges through enemy gunfire like it's nothing i'm sure we'll learn more about robodog in the not so distant future now we see our first glimpse at one of the ground vehicles and of course it's a very futuristic looking tank in the desert environment as it fires a shot at an enemy tank and reveals what looks like a large cargo ship with a giant door that gets blasted by gunfire and explosives oh yes levolution is back baby and the soldiers below are about to find out the hard way i see a vector by the way which makes me a very happy boy boom next scene now we're in a shipping area of some sort you can see cranes in the background so if this map plays anything like no-show canals from battlefield 3 i'm sure players are going to absolutely love it so we can see a group of soldiers here using a variety of weapons and i have to say this trailer is really well done because even though we don't see any gameplay here we are getting a ton of information about some of the new locations that we're going to be fighting in as well as seeing some of the new mechanics and weapons in action i'm not entirely sure what this weapon is by the way it looks a bit like the m13 doesn't it but it could easily be a futuristic weapon made up by the team at dice you know i think the year 2042 is the perfect setting for this game as it gives the devs freedom to play around with a bunch of ideas without feeling too limited by adopting real-life weaponry but there is still plenty of that in this game you can see another vector here and as the camera pans towards these two soldiers you can actually see a player vaulting up on top one of the containers there so you can jump and leg grab in this game it seems enabling you to pull yourself up to higher places which is always an appreciated game mechanic and it looks like this soldier is using a modified m1014 shotgun perhaps and this character is carrying an ak-74m or something from the ak-100 series i'm not entirely sure but anyway the camera moves inside the cargo container here as we stack up on these two soldiers and everything goes very quiet suddenly a fight breaks out between these two teams and we fall back into an onslaught of gunfire as players get mowed down from all angles clambering over and around each other returning fire and being overwhelmed by the enemy team team play is going to be really important in this game if you want to be this effective the character that we've been tracking in this scene then gets grabbed from behind and takes a knife to the throat as the enemy soldier claims his dog tags confirming that takedown animations are back in battlefield which is awesome to see and we then cut to a first person shot of a player running with his team as a large explosion goes off in the background perhaps another evolution event who knows but this shot helps to give us an idea of what it feels like to be running alongside a large group of players 128 players in fact on pc and the next generation of consoles which is just insane alright next scene an icy snowy map giving me real final stand feels from battlefield 4 showing hovercraft and the infamous rip saw which is a very real thing i'm pretty sure it was featured in one of the most recent fast and furious movies but it's actually one of the fastest super lightweight tanks in the world right now and i'm so excited to take this thing for a spin in battlefield 2042 oh and also penguins we immediately cut to a giant launch site featuring a rocket set for launch and features a lot of action it looks like around the center launch sector and its surrounding structures and yes the rocket can take off and apparently it can even be sabotaged causing massive revolution event which just sounds awesome now we get to see some aerial combat in a sandstorm in a city i don't know it looks crazy the lighting just looks insane on some of these buildings but we see an attack helicopter chasing down a little bird weaving between buildings before crashing into another attack helicopter like that is just a classic only in battlefield moment the little bird soars up to the top of a skyscraper where we see numerous soldiers in the heat of battle who turn around and realize that they are about to get absolutely decimated by the machine guns of the little bird an enemy soldier has the bright idea to hop on a quad bike on a rooftop because why not and drive directly into the helicopter causing another only battlefield moment the heli spins out of control crashes into a building destroying large chunks of the side of it i can't even keep up with the commentary on this video right now this is just insane then we cut to what is possibly the most rewarding fan service i've ever seen in a game trailer when i saw this for the first time i just squealed like an absolute fan gill but you see this enemy player jump out of the cockpit of their jet pull a bazooka out and rocket launch the opposing enemy do you know how many times i've done that in battlefield like it's so good and then he lands back in his jet it's so awesome that they've included this in the trailer because it lets those players know that this is the game that they've been waiting for and i absolutely love it i cannot wait we see some more ground combat here just explosions and gunfire everywhere little bird flying overhead and then something you simply cannot miss in this trailer it's the swirling tornado which forms on some of the maps as it travels along different paths and you can choose to avoid it or take advantage of it it will cause destruction and chaos wherever it goes sweeping up vehicles debris helicopters players even this futuristic looking tuk-tuk nobody is safe from the tornado and it creates fun and unexpected moments in the game the wingsuit character that we saw earlier reappears here and notice the sign on top of the tuk-tuk i mean i love that player then jumps from the vehicle and uses the tornado to gain some extra height and speed which i personally cannot wait to try in the game again this character flies outside of the frame and that's it the real battlefield logo finally appears in all of its glory and the title of the game is revealed battlefield 2042 followed by the gameplay reveal date june 13th it's coming i'm here for it and i hope i speak for all of us
