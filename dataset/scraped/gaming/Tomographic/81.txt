all right it's drone time baby okay there's a guy there anyone around here yes you heard absolutely nothing buddy okay well it's your funeral don't say i didn't warn you if they get a bit closer i can blow them up without fuel tank screw it oh that was actually pretty clean he walked right into my sights hello everyone and welcome back to sniper ghost warrior contracts 2 and a massive thank you to ci games for sponsoring this one i know how much you guys have been enjoying this series of videos so i'm really excited to be jumping back in today and picking up where we left off now since the last episode i've been able to save up some of my in-game cash and purchase the 50 cal heavy sniper rifle with a high zoom optic of course which might i add is a hell of a lot of fun to use in this game and today we're going to be playing in the tamid heights region with the main contract that i wanted to showcase in this video including some extreme long-range sniping with most of my targets being over 1 000 meters away so i really can't afford to make any mistakes here the game encourages you to be patient when you're dealing with super long ranges like these so the semi-auto functionality of the 50 cal should come in handy if i need to follow up with multiple shots in quick succession and launching today sniper ghost warrior contracts 2 is now available on playstation 5 and the game also includes a free major expansion on all platforms called butcher's banquet which you'll get to see on the channel very soon and introduces an entirely new region called the temple which is complete with all new objectives and some of your most deadly contracts yet so there is really no better time to jump into the game for the first time than right now so a huge thank you to ci games once again for sponsoring this video and supporting the channel you guys are always super chill to work with and i appreciate you giving me the creative freedom to make the videos that i like to make it's super refreshing and of course thank you guys for watching seeing your comments and how much you've all been enjoying these videos makes my day so if you're going to enjoy the gameplay today and you want to

seconds control this is raven sending slip wrap all right here we go go ahead raven i'm about to click out i'm heading for the first lp oh we got dropped off by a heli this time was picked for observation and target acquisition the line of sight to the target location should be clear right we're dealing with some pretty long ranges here so take your time and plan each shot carefully always do careful is my middle name that's not what it says on your service file so much for classified watch your movement intel shows groups of locals who aren't going to be happy to see you roger that raven out okay i love the environments in this game it looks so good don't they all right we've got a checkpoint over here three four guys and there's a jammer somewhere because my pings aren't staying live there it is yeah so anything that i mark won't stay alive until that jammer is destroyed there's a roadblock ahead of us some kind of checkpoint how you doing can you pass quietly maybe i'll scout for the best route stay dark if you can no point attracting unwanted attention copy that all right we're gonna get the drone out for these first two ahead of me here it looks like there's two guys on this side of the bridge so if i shoot them both with a poison dart i can pass safely looks like i can uh avoid that larger compound on that lower platform there [Music] oh good timing as well i didn't think you'd hear that but i guess the drone's pretty loud when it fires we're on the move two time goes down and not a single bullet fired i need to cross this bridge and not get spotted all right we can definitely drop down here as long as those two guys don't spot me yeah you saw nothing i always broke my ankles in the process but we move oh we can go up here look nice little uh ledge climb coast is clear what are those footsteps just use this wall for cover lovely all right there's the checkpoint that we need to pass on the other side of that i believe is our long range contract oh it's a century you can still see me apparently let's go up there you know what let me get my drone out again because he's gonna be the main guy to spot me i think so we'll put him to sleep with a little poison dart there you go and my drone got destroyed by a tower great but he's dead so silver linings let's go please don't see me should be going in the middle here there he is one down control clean seems you've gone to a lot of trouble for a journalist he's been a thorn in the government's side for a long time by exposing their corruption he's isolated the regime from support and aid but i don't get why he's still alive might bother interrogating him just shoot him perhaps they want to find his sources clear out any moles maybe but i think you're not giving me the full picture here i'm approaching the village rp remember we need to here alive and sanchez dead that will be a crippling blow to russia's morale killing the enforcer is pretty straightforward it's to hear i'm worried about this guy's all alone up here we managed to get word to him he's expecting help let's hope he acts when he gets it we know his guard has a set of keys drop him into here should react but do it quietly they'd rather kill him than let him go he'll still need to get out of the village that's why you're on overwatch clear him a path remove any obstacles copy that setting up i want to try this vector quick before i do that what can i shoot at this wall oh yeah this thing packs a punch it's very loud though stick with my suppressed ar i think all right then so i guess i think the guy's name was tahir we've got to escort someone who's locked up in a jail somewhere a couple of turrets down here sniper there is that to here yes it is i can see what looks like a prison got to be where they're holding to here can you see his guard roger that yes i can that's your target check angle wind and bullet drop you sure tahir is expecting this oh this is gonna be a fun one isn't it sure as we can be ready that is so far away oh my god one thousand two hundred meters let's try that we're zeroed in just for wind speed no yes where's it gonna hit oh damn just busted his skull open like a watermelon that was a perfect shot too headshot at this range come on now we need to here to open that gate i guess to get the key off the guard nice that's giving me a good uh point of reference to aim out of his cell maintain overwatch i will all right this is gonna be fun two guards on the left two guards on the right is he gonna stop yes good splash those hostiles to here is grounded till you do that's a collateral first shot let's go oh my god almost hit his grenade on his chest that would have been sick if i aimed just a little bit more to the right i would have hit the grenade and blowing them up but that might have been a dead giveaway i think they would have heard that for sure this door just opened okay we've got two guys in here as well another collateral opportunity perhaps so here's up there oh the game knows it just knows okay this is going surprisingly well my calculations are pretty on point at the moment i've landed almost every shot come on taj down the stairs that's it good boy all right then how am i going to deal with these two i guess if i shoot that is he going to come down that ladder go on that bridge isn't there he's going to come down that ladder to hear you absolutely mad man more tangos clear them out why would you get that close to them all right 1000 meters i'm not going to take the shot just yet because he's going to hear that okay where are you going inside no this is great for me that's a pretty easy lineup through his arm um okay please don't stay down there i need you to stand up buddy this isn't this isn't gonna be good i'm not gonna take this shot it's too risky what was he doing tying his shoelaces or something there we go [Music] lovely upper torso i'll take that that makes things easier for taj all right keep on keeping on taj i am your overwatch he's gonna use the stairs there is he okay sanchez is on the move splash those hostiles to here is grounded till you do oh i forgot about sanchez i gotta be quick then cause she'll catch up eventually i'll do the bridge guy first or these two she's on the move okay good these two are separating no how does he not see to hear is he hiding in the grass i don't know works for me though okay the shot percentage that we're hitting right now i'm making this look way easier than it actually is not to blow my own horn but i'm making good progress here oh straight out the left buttock stay focused i mean the shot here right it still counts i need to take these two out in the compound because they're literally watching that guy on the bridge nice i actually kind of like the non-bullet cam kills because you see the bullet drop it's really cool i don't know where to aim for this guy because he's crouched and take a guess and hope it works out oh it's just over please yes couldn't see it because i had to reload but the shot hit that's all that matters oh she found she found the open door come on no oh my god thank god i'm using the barrett i just blew his leg off secure the prisoner at all costs i'll try the entire village is on alert since she's just made that call what do i aim here sanchez is dead good now focus on to here get him out of there please be careful to here that's a tank an apc park there go on come on i can hit this let's lob the bullet yes i would have immobilized one of them oh that's both hell yeah decommission those turrets and the guards nearby i'm one step ahead of you mate ow concentrate to hear is almost there there's a sniper where the hell is this guy you got a run to here just get the hell out of there come on mate mission accomplished yes good work today okay you can exfil now check your map for coordinates oh i'm clearing the rest of the base first yeah where is this sniper it keeps clocking me but where'd that bullet come from there you are can i hit this shot 1029 meters these are close a little bit higher no yes oh no no no no i'm about to get demonetized for that one why am i always hitting nsfw shots in this game there we go it's a bit more like it that's a really cool slo-mo cam actually oh no see this is where the parrot comes in handy here it is oh we're flying now bullets are flying everywhere yes i love this gun oh it's so sick 50 cal is just perfect for this imagine doing this with a bought action sniper the window of opportunity would be so much smaller okay i'm never gonna hit this shot jesus reload try again there it is that's another butt cheek another butchie gone no one's safe from getting their cheeks clapped apparently i think that's it cause i'm pretty sure it just repeats the line of dialogue if you if it goes into a bullet time whilst uh while someone's talking it replays the dialogue for you yeah i think we're done here no tangos left to scan everyone's dead well that was an absolute blast quite literally the 50 cal came in super handy there can't wait to use that again that's gonna do it for this video though guys thank you so much for watching
