hello everyone so today i'm using the ram 7 and car 98k in warzone two of my absolute favorite weapons to use right now starting with the car 98 you'll notice that nothing's really changed since the last time you saw it but you know if it ain't broke don't fix it this build works so well and yeah i stand by this class setup so moving on to the ram seven which is definitely changed since the last time you saw me use it i've actually removed the barrel entirely with this build because the ram 7 excels at close to medium range so trying to extend the range even further with something like the ranger barrel also increases movement and ads speed as a knock-on effect which i've only found works against me in practice essentially the ram 7 built this way performs like an smg with faster mobility faster ads and with the addition of sleight of hand you guessed it faster reloads i really do feel like i can adapt to any situation with this loadout you know sometimes the zone will favor an area with a lot of buildings so if that's the case then i can switch to my ram seven and then when we're in open fields and stuff then the khan a8 just absolutely dominates you will need to practice those headshots though so i'm playing with jack frags and studying this one later accompanied by westy when we decide to try a locking quads and there is a super intense match in the second half of this video that really got my heart pumping i'll be honest but with that said make sure to leave a like if you enjoy the video it really helps me out subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one oh there's people we're going i'm gonna die not a stadium no one ever dies a stadium well there's like six people going okay seven eight nine nine that's ten people i guess they've got the heli first it's your boy chop them up literally trying to shoot me straight through wars yeah hopefully they're not a ball hack uphill i hope they don't yeah broke down okay behind you behind you what still up the hell is it being stopped by clearing team one oh god he's so low up there guys so low i'm out of ammo completely that one he should be low that's what i broke him he's up the top of the hill thank you i see you don't you let me reload that's the last guy oh perfect semtex from him that's annoying he's trying to play here can i keep live on him he's still there last bullet why is it making me play i've already got full hang on yeah i got ruined because my gun didn't reload nice very well actually saved my life great shot that's the kind of situation where if he had fnj it'd have been ruined but it's so rare to get something like that so we should we rotate all the way right right here that's a cool we should definitely go right oh it's kind of useless i'm going down i'm gonna go right because i think that's where we have to go anywhere i think the finish if we can he's probably gonna sell fries at some point as well sniper as well might run into another team here i need to try and escort jack's that loadout if we can yeah i'd like to get it there is a couple of enemy loadouts up ahead on the cliff here okay yeah i'm good right where do you want to go um top of here if we can around the side and can they come up though yeah i think so okay we could go we could go left there we go they're busy they're busy does that come from right here that cluster yep they should be right in front of us somewhere all running towards us right here i swear boys oh god there go there i'm moving done got dmr yeah he's on there oh i don't think we should push this guy oh yeah we should focus on the people on the hill here focus hill okay i thought maybe we could get him before we got into i won uphill oh my god boys well played really well
