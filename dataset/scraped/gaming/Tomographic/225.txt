hey guys is Tom here and welcome back to another warzone video you guys have been killing it with the support in these videos lately and I just want you to know that I really do appreciate it I'm not gonna waste too much time before get into the gameplay today I just wanted to give you a quick overview of the loadout that I'm using in this video so this is my ultimate aggression class that I've been using in warzone so starting off with my primary weapon I'm using the growl assault rifle which I have set up like this alongside the x50 sniper rifle which I have sets up like this I feel like all I've been seeing warzone lately is HDR sniper gameplay so I wanted to mix it up a bit I'll actually say it's the better sniper if you prefer aggressive medium range sniping HDR is much better range has the better bullet velocity and lowest for the drop I'd actually much rather be using the X 50 around the hundreds of 200 meter range something about this sniper rifle just makes me feel so much more snappy compared to the HDR as for my perks I've got double time overkill and amped and never substitute the amp to perk now is always in my third perk slot and having that faster weapon swap speed can and will save your life in warzone so that's about it for this loadout I urge you to try out for yourself and let me know how it goes and finally make sure you subscribe to tell on those notifications so that you don't miss out on any future warzone videos and I will see you in the next one [Music] okoma as teammates that see though that pusher mean absolutely fearless smart lads
