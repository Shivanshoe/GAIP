take this theme tune and inject it into my veins very few video game tracks rival hunt showdown for me and it's so simple yet so effective and would you believe that the entire soundtrack is actually made by an in-house band at crytek yes actual developers of the game made this legendary soundtrack how cool is that just another reason to love this game and boy do i love it you've got cowboys versus zombies versus monsters versus players i mean what's not to love hunt showdown is a truly unique experience and one that you absolutely need to try if you haven't played it before 12 players spawn around the map working inwards to track down and kill some terrifying beasts and claim their bounty you can then use that bounty to quickly scan your surroundings using darkseid revealing enemy players in your immediate vicinity fight your way out and extract in a timely manner though because once you acquire said bounty all other players will be alerted of your position and can steal it from you if you get killed in action and when a fight breaks out you'd better be ready for a battle where good angles and positioning are your greatest ally and hope that your aim is true because this isn't your typical spray and pray shooter game most weapons are painstakingly slow and cumbersome but in the most satisfying way possible make one mistake and you'll be face down in the mud plan ahead though and be patient with each trigger pull and you'll be greatly rewarded the skill gap is a steep one and you will be punished but persevere and you will find out why the gunplay and hunt showdown is so unique and so satisfying no other game matches the moment-to-moment gameplay that hunt showdown has to offer with intense action brilliant sound design with footsteps you can actually hear and audio cues that provide viable intel to you and your team there's nothing quite like it and in a world of bland soulless fps clones hunt showdown combines its gritty style and nightmarish atmosphere with an addictive gameplay loop and robust class system that's bound to keep you coming back for more but enough of me telling you i think it's time i show you just how special this game really is this is hunt showdown let's go i'm really loving this oh i've not got the shimmies oh yeah you guys can just smell all the enemies you know well i trust you i give you a sin that's really the only reason i do is because you never know when there's like a horde of zombies that just come out here don't get overwhelmed i can give you a stamina shot so i got two you got two more oh no i've got one for you and one for me i just have to inject you like this there you go oh yeah i think you can give it to teammates yeah what is it five minutes of stamina no i got ten minutes oh these are the strong ones zombie coming from the woods what are you eating knuckle dusters are a p no don't hit me you're good oh no she sent the bees off the economy why you make me lose health kill the bee lady oh hello oh that's john hello john how's the wife oh there goes john hit him once nice i heard one close to me he went in he went in here i'm on the flank uh yeah it's bugged one hand there we go kill his body kill this buddy right on that corner looking for the last guy we're getting the clue there's the last guy just reloading quick it should be on that far right side oh no another one that was the most accurate headshot of all of them his neck or something he's around this corner here there's another team here oh sh the guy in this building with me i think bottom floor in bottom floor now that's him though that's the guy that just ran out this guy's a bloody crossbow what makes you think there's another team because it's different footsteps from which direction then hey i heard somebody else it was not you guys but he went in the guard in this building yeah yeah i hate fisters down there yeah where did you see this last guy he was right on this corner and he went inside there's an ai that's the guy yeah he must be just hiding him i heard him run through the chains to the right there so he's going to be hanging around isn't he's just going to be repositioning surely he's he's bottom level of the building i can see him right now yeah okay female character careful scored header first right right behind you actually there's a heal in here right don't like this there's me hiding somewhere i keep hearing my footstep like here wait steps on me just outside the wall here could be a zombie she's not here i think this is her just disappeared i don't know all right yep down here on me once where on me i have oh nice holy crap the place is that one player yes um it's them 100 well done jumped up on the top and just like no scope down there's a heel if you need one oh i'm okay now i'm okay i'm just leaving these guys uh massive fight south west yeah i hear that spicy yeah that could be was it you guys the other two are killed uh well one of them has this crossbow hmm you might want crossbow gameplay i think i'll pass on that that's tough to use i'll just take his money thing all right let's go towards that fight that sounds very spicy like still said this game does look better than every other game we'll say that you think i think so yeah it's good good detail to this game would you say this game has the best audio ever uh one of the best readable audios i wouldn't say the sound design itself is particularly like groundbreaking yeah i like the quality of the sounds for sure being able to read your environment with audio is incredible oh yeah i forget you can ask right i saw you like jumping wait wait oh yeah like cs go air streaming in this you really wouldn't think they'd have their name like you can basically do this that yeah oh yeah that's how people play high-end your stamina so much oh yeah does it yeah it's not using stamina yeah so there's like a player stamina when you like jump and scream and lose mobility and then it takes forever for your character to like bring his weapon back i'm moving again yeah last time i was at this graveyard here the cemetery some guy went out of his way to set up like 16 traps at like every entrance and the spots you would never think about and oh boy he ended up killing like three people just waiting in the boss room and we all just spectated everyone just dying what a guy it was insane you killed these bees yeah but i thought i did um headshot there you go you knew i wouldn't miss oh yeah he never does ever they do give up at a certain range but oh that was real close right next to us there are extractors northwest of them yeah they're around this building somewhere i think can't mark it that one oh yeah i forgot the only problem that i have with the guns being so low on the screen is you waste so much space in the lower part of the screen because you're aiming lower if you know what i mean yeah that's the problem basically you can't see under your gun at all exactly did we get shot at like literally just you're right yeah they're not far at all i heard right here oh there's a guy right there i think it was a zombie yeah i can't mark him in here yeah they're just on the other side of me yeah nice looking yeah i thought that was a zombie dude it was crazy my dino could have shot him both too busy trying to mark or someone just cranked the sticker that was you know one of you guys yeah i hear someone here he's pushing right somewhere okay yeah yeah i see the muzzle flash one hit one hit they're dead nice one shot here comes anyone else the bees are coming back at me no you think he's on the same team as the guy that you just killed yeah yeah i think his teammate was pushed up oh [ __ ] these guys have been having one there and then oh he's close to me close to me right here nice shot nice shot it almost killed you that was very close looking for the team they were fighting okay that's three that's gotta be the full team there are more and there was there's oh there we go do you see anything on that thing i saw yeah i saw one on this on this thing here no i've been shot on the right right looking in the tree somewhere oh my god shot by another team they're going to kill me here i know it i don't know i can cover you maybe i'm off to my right i'm trying to push over i'm just trying to see them like over here somewhere and i can't see them at all i was going a white shirt yeah they're not obviously we've got have you healed oh yeah i'm back in the fight oh yeah he's down there down there yeah yeah i'm being shot from the air people from the building now as well why they are they find another team i'm trying to go real wide it was absolute madness dude careful over there it was around the reason these guys are over here is because there's one boss and they're camping between the extracts yeah and the boss guys oh he's in the woods yes i finally saw a muzzle flash using first aid so hard to see hit him this would be a long fight isn't it it's so hard to see dude yeah but i like it i don't like this i don't know i'm inside my monitor right now can i be skinnier can i be a stick man so i can hide behind this better oh he's further down to the right good i'm pushing up to you guys i think my visual he was buying the roots right here okay i'm just trying to avoid cause they can see us from the house too yeah yeah is it a white t-shirt guy uh i don't think so okay the other guy's over here he's got a white shirt and a cowboy hat very easy to spot in this environment he's jumping up on the on the woods here on the okay coming yeah i think you're right here in the water south east southeast this gun sucks right there see one i'm flashed i'm not flashing ground one i might have traded with that or 105 i hit a guy i've been hit by bees i killed one i killed one i'm down i'm down grenade both of you i need to reload two shorts yeah i can't make any noise right now yeah you got two guys pushing years on have you got a dynamite i've got a frag bomb but it's just too much of a giveaway right now tom is the swamp monster oh no i'm going to see you at the same time what are the odds he's down oh no he's going for the flank that other guy's back up now oh we do have a dynamite yeah do you have any heals by any chance yeah i need a first aid but this guy's trying to fight me all right he's in the water dude crazy correct you have time to pop it get him got some double room here my metal somewhere oh he hates you he hates you tomorrow oh i know you have no ammo yeah good cool it's gonna take me a while though you're gonna go for the res yeah force a 1v1 here it's not hey man the bush is there it's like push to one side or the other he's got such a good advantage in those bushes jesus christ man i am the monster oh that hurt still got this still got this it's not him yeah yeah yeah yeah big mistake [Applause] yes oh my god where the other one goes three wasn't it he's at the barn somewhere yeah pick up uh pick up the bounty real quick and scan yeah just rest i'll go for thank you i don't see anyone did he just leave did the other guy shoot him i think it was different teams maybe yeah i don't see him maybe they killed each other like clutch crazy dude that was huge uh i need to heal desperately like i don't know well i've only got one blood uh i can drop you can i drop you anything nervous i mean you can heal me um no i think you can you can't you come with a vitality shot but you can't yeah i got me look got me thank you i get the bounce off this bounty yeah yeah do i get healed if i get the battery i've used mine now that's everyone in the area yes nice work you guys want to go loot everybody uh yeah that other team for uh very first yeah yeah we do i like the way that that guy made the ultimate mistake he was like oh there's a little gap in these trees i don't know what he i think he was reloading he was like yeah his gun was like shaking over his back he didn't reload in that entire engagement he was just trying to find an angle on me you probably didn't know you had a that must have been just so frustrating for him yeah i i think he panicked as well because he didn't push you or like try anything yeah and i'd got the first down like what happened to that other guy yeah i don't know about him he ran off and maybe died to a zombie or something yeah because i didn't hear a gunshot or anything he just disappeared i know i need to try and suss out in a fight like when i could heal because i didn't know how many of them were left i thought i was fine i fought three man until they just killed that one oh no the horsies impenetrable hit a horse square on the face with a bomb lance unscathed uh do a quick scan maybe i just did i've already done it yeah we're good what run that was we die to live another day we live to die another way yeah that's right they shouldn't they should get me on the network yeah you're on the narrative team you know there was uh three people that did the narrative for 2042 no really yeah oh god and there was a whole team well we don't talk about that game you
