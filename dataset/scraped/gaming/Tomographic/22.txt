[Music] the movement feels so good mistakes were made i don't know if i've done that before so many snipers in this tree line assassination the hell is outfit changed the teammate tried to steal the kill let's try buddy trying to test the range of this scorpion there's no way how did i even get the pilot oh my god this gun beams spawn trapping him i now even see them those red dots just give them away the whole time mounting is so good in this game be careful oh we're about to get the nuke we captured all the flags here we go oh i think i died at the end but we got it that's a win look at that mushroom cloud that's so cool man grandma is still really good fun [Music] i haven't used this gun much but it looks awesome doesn't it look at this though we're back on ground war and you could even say we're back on for dansk here's someone over there take me again you're done that was the same person oh two guys in ghost outfits i forgot modern warfare had special bullets that have different effects we've lost alpha someone in the uav over here there you are can't find the head shot but i'll take two body hits it's cafe oh for god's sake man just about to kill that guy and i get hit by a predator missile just me one person unbelievable oh i missed for the teammate hit the shot he's cracked was it that plane i can't tell there's so many planes in boneyard it's just a massive scrapyard isn't it oh he's still in there got my revenge we lost d i don't see anyone from here holy that was loud i didn't want my eardrums anyway i love that they actually have a scrap yard remake it's part of this map it's so good this poor guy can't hear me you're done you're done anyone else oh why didn't you shoot me two seconds ago it just feels so good being back on the dansky now even though i can't see a lot of it i miss it man oh come on i was being nostalgic nice quick scope i'll take it there are more around here though oh oh i'm gaming they're taking b oh we got a defcon as well i need to get there quick five seconds and the nuke will go off go go go go go oh they stopped it with a second to spare we've been seeing from the helipad i forgot we could jump on this roof it's a teammate right in the head go out there as well see a sniper going in the tower that's barely rendering in there without distance where is he why you shooting me teammate please get out my way i'm not trying to shoot you why is he zig zagging how many hit markers am i gonna get on this one guy i think there's two of them in that tower here he comes trying to run me over now take me to the tower compadre friendly airstrike on the way again all of the flag so hopefully we can actually set the nuke off this time can i get up there nope that's going to kill me come on yes i haven't used this gun in ages man that's a head isn't it oh my god the back to back don't underestimate my sniper skills i feel a bit rusty the snipes are always on point i feel so comfortable with a sniper in games especially this one because so many of the snipers are overpowered as hell they've barely changed since launch which is hilarious okay guaranteed kill on this poor soul i think we've done it hey we won the game vikko tori so many people just have open mic in this game you just hear them like breathing here we go promenade this is probably my least favorite grandma map i only seem to be getting like the worst maps today this one's just an absolute fluster clock i do hope they bring back ground war in modern warfare too a huge missed opportunity otherwise if they focus on an actual like ground mode and make unique maps for it i think it would go down really well because all of these maps are just parts of the dance like they weren't really made with ground war in mind it was just an afterthought all bounce bait contested that's the craziest part about this map and just like flank and then come back on the enemy it's kind of like uh operation metro in battlefield it's got a similar sort of vibe i also think a lot more people will be playing this mode if the file size for this game wasn't so big i saw that guy too late oh i got hit by an rpg good shot teammate let's oh yes three of them we'll take it oh someone's using the javelin in the kill feed there look people love using the javelins on the ground wall maps because it's just so easy to fire one off into the spawn and get multi kills can i get on that roof i can this is a really good spot i've never been up here well i think i might have been on war zone but see that javelin go off then my teammates are using one the javelin's the meta maybe gas nades interesting yeah i hope they can fix the file size in modern warfare 2 because it's like 50 something gigabytes for warzone and then if you want modern warfare and warzone it's like 140 gigs it used to be like 200 or something but they they've done a few updates where they've reduced the file size nice knife there oh my god they've got an apc yeah for some people they can't really afford to have a massive game like this taking up all that space especially console players honestly if modern warfare 2 focuses on the ground war mode after the unfortunate downfall of battlefield 2042 they could be onto a winner kill streaks on this mode are just stupid that's another guy i really like this scorpion i don't know why i haven't used it more another guy on the side of the fence oh you would go prone under my bullet wouldn't you oh that javelin just took out five people oh no it's two different guys three different guys how are there so many javelins going off at once this is crazy oh the air strike kill streaks are a huge problem on this mode if they do bring back ground war i hope it doesn't have kill streaks or at least an optional mode without them i just got six kills without harrier see what i mean kill streaks are way too powerful on this mode i'm trying to go on a back flank here don't get killed don't get killed oh i made it i just need to get that e flag and i'm dead to a kill streak come on oh of course there's white phosphorus down as well oh we got e nice 22 seconds and the nuke will go off tested it's a guy in this corner the tank coming up the road needs to be careful oh my god that airstrike only got me are you kidding me i'm only dying to kill streaks now just died like four times in a row get rekt anyone else and i'm dead at least i actually died to a gun for a change all right spawning on the flag see it's not all fun and games ground war has its problems ultimately it's uh it's a very fun experience this was the first time cod even did like large-scale warfare i think a lot of people really enjoyed it waiting for my health to come back because this white phosphorus is making my entire team suffer at the moment oh my god man how many kills was that let me see one two three four five six it's wow easy for killstreaks to dominate in this mode oh i can't there we go abc's done there goes our cover oh no there's an enemy tank coming another apc come on i can't copy from here i don't want to expose myself for that a little bit a flashbang now if i can't see it it can't see me yes yes score in a good limit reached we got the dub we lost a lot of good men but we got it yeah i'm not really much of a fan of that map it comes up in rotation way too much and it's just not fun for anyone unless you're launching javelins from one end of the map to the other but hey we still had fun and that's all that matters [Music] you
