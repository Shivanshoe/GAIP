[Music] the one the one you there you made it hey it's good to see you too oh hey where did that come from you owe me one souls of my sneakers nearly tore off trying to get to you um i'm sorry sorry i thought i'd be scraping your guts off the [ __ ] pavement and you're sorry i don't believe it you were actually worried [Music] shut up the one you tip back [ __ ] [Music] one it's not a sign of weakness to say you were worried can you at least tell me where we're going [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] i nailed it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] no no no no [ __ ] [Music] get back hmm you just don't give up do you you should know that by now fine stick around if you have to but don't interrupt me i'm busy getting drunk no you dork looking at the stars if you should wake to a man-dead world where virtually all human life had been dissolved from the face of the earth leaving behind only buildings bridges machines if you should awake to such a world tomorrow morning what would you do where would you go hey guys it's tom thank you so much for watching until the end of the video it really does mean a lot and if it isn't obvious after what you've just watched i have spent countless hours running around the world of dying light 2 trying to perfect these parkour runs and often failing miserably so i hope the end result was worth it i do want to give special thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this video and believing in this little passion project of mine all of the gameplay seen here was recorded with ray tracing and nvidia dlss enabled to demonstrate the very best visuals and performance that dying light 2 can offer ray tracing of course improves the in-game lighting by realistically simulating the way light shadows reflections and ambient occlusion all interact with objects and the world around you while nvidia dlss uses ai to boost your game's performance meaning you can play with ray tracing or higher graphic settings while maintaining higher frame rates just look at the difference you love to see it now then if you could do me one last favor and drop a like for the algorithm or even go the extra mile and share this video with a friend it goes a really long way but most importantly stay human and i will catch you legends in the next one [Music] you
