hey friends it's tom here and welcome back to another video i know it's been a little while and i do apologize for the stagnant uploads over the last couple of weeks you know i think i was pushing myself a little too hard and uh i definitely overdid it i'll say that much but i don't want you guys to worry i'm doing okay i'm working on getting the upload schedule back on track so starting with today's video i've got a delightfully frightful match of zombie royale playing with my good friend jack fraggs and his good friend johnny and now we're all good friends anyway as you can see from the title i'm using my trusty khana 8k in this one my go-to sniper for aggressive snipes in warzone it's still so good like i know people are talking about the spr constantly but you know the spr is pretty great for range but the karna a8 when it comes to those medium range snipes oh spr who so yeah this is my car 98 class setup and then i'm also using the mp7 as my secondary which looks like this anyway i'd like to keep this intro nice and short today so we can jump into the gameplay if you're not subscribed do me a favor hit that subscribe button i think like 70 of you aren't subscribed
