all right guys so the cheaters are back at it again in warzone and boy do they want you to know it and though i don't condone it whatsoever it has made for some pretty entertaining content on stream and i think you probably like watching this unfold in a video as well there is evidence that activision is seeking out the creators of these cheats now so we might actually see fewer people using them and not taking the risk but let me know about your experiences with cheaters in warzone and how frequently are you encountering them in your matches from my own and my friends experiences it seems to be about five to ten percent of our games at the moment that we're running into a cheater of some form and in some instances it's even been multiple cheaters in a match and you're going to see an example of that later in the video so with that said leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it subscribe for more and i'll catch you in the next one oh sniper on the hill ahead yeah i can maybe get him hold on i'm knocked fudge i didn't see him you're safe for us right there i don't think he can get me i can maybe flank go for it just get my money let's get my money oh stop that's right you're not saving me where is this guy top of the hill he was on that mark orange okay he ends the headshot at me while strafing yeah he's guarded a little bit odd he is a goddess he knew exactly where he was and instead on me don't worry it's the greatest player in gaming history so be careful mm-hmm he's not even going to finish even though he's like where i am right now let's see this then i was barely around that corner okay he's cheating is he just amazing snappiest headshot i've ever seen no adjustment needed can we go die to him and see before he'd even see me like he knew exactly where i was coming from knew i was on the outside of the zone and then hit me with immediate headshot oh come on kill stone again in the middle of an open field while i'm hitting him to get headshot nah she just don't do that oh he's a guy why are you dying [Music] he's going towards those bunkers there he was going towards those bunkers okay he killed me on the the hill of the bunker right above what's that khan i a snipe only 20 it was a car 98 that killed me yeah no i just got hit by a sniper i'd get your load out there tom i'm going for it but i've just been hit once already all right snipe he's ahead of you that's him that's him is that him it's got to be him i don't know what was his name i can't see the feed i'll die that's him yes it was him hackers are back in season five of warsaw let's see oh my god pretty sure i showed the down symbol oh right there whoa why do you switch off his uh whoa why don't we switch off it's on switch off this car 98 oh right yeah it would have been bad no the car 98 would be better than this i guess because he can get better range kills [Music] i wonder if there's a two guys over there nice shot dude nice shot clean shot sure yeah good read on that play too i was going there give us a big up and down if you're watching the stream big up and down gotcha like look to this look to the roof then look to the floor oh he thumbs up look to the roof then the floor are you watching the stream knocked no you were watching the stream thumbs up again if you can hear us we might just be with you he might just be stoked that we he's got spectacular okay give us another huge nod up and down if you're hacking oh my god he is i couldn't tell up to this point yo can we can we get a 360 for the ending oh three six three six yeah this [Music] all right two teams left let's see if he's got it he's got one foul bullet left he's low on ammo he's gonna have to use that sniper oh oh hey harry okay i think he's gonna do the 360. okay he's gonna do the three i think he confirmed that last team one v e two one b two so one b two he's gotta get a knock and then he's got to hit a 360 here he knows it's up in that area it seems like okay he's breathing positioning he's going for the reposition got the reload on his gun nice nice incredible game good thing tom remind them i'm reminded i'm there hey i'm just looking off the little guy stone oh he spotted him through the trees there's one all right 360 for the last game the last kill let's see if he can get the 360 here though whoa this guy's the best player i've ever seen dude wow incredible gameplay are we going to get a little interview with him now has he got his mic open yeah cb has his mic on interview that incredible incredible gameplay [Music] uh about three months about three months and they haven't banned you nah dude this is my house account this is my this this is my auth account though i've maxed everything out of my main account and so i just played on my off account wow oh so he is a hacker okay it makes sense you're scalding did you see that gameplay the 360. he did it for us he did it for us three months that was great content that was great content but we ran into it he's so proud of it stream sniping hacker the most humble hacker i've ever encountered in my life just like yeah man i've already maxed out another account so i might as well max out another one if i'm not gonna get banned are we allowed to block i mean we're going to block him right because yeah we should definitely block him we love you but you know yeah we appreciate the love i don't know if the love is reciprocated because you know it's a bit scummy but oh for sure no i don't tolerate it gotta kill in the game you know and you can jump on his squad and mimic something look there's two oh he's still in the quad yeah he's doing a song he's off the court he's off the court he's off he's off his course yes yes damn you almost killed me what the hell damn well you're right uh why is he beaming the pretty foreign right where i was okay oh what suspicions are rising i'll go on oh i do oh let's have a look headshot hey what's that [Music] look all right he's acting straight up they killed me they're hacking okay come on who does these get ready for incoming only a hacker hold on i mean even his calling card is digits it's definitely a hacker come on come on now who does a sun god and sits on it in these lobbies come on number one let's just watch them for a bit and let's work out that they're definitely hacking so i look like a better player i don't know i'll be honest if they were hacking they would have killed me because they would have known i was oh yeah exactly they know where the final circle is look if you look at the map i mean oh my god but they've done all of them so they know exactly where their circle is i don't think cheers would do that no oh my god oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait that was a straight headshot no yeah he's hacking he's hacking it's not so happy right now his chat's just being like oh god sake stop oh my god dude i can't believe he was actually happy is this a joke you had that feeling when i crossed when i crossed he hit me so fast i was like dude yeah that was a little sad i told you suspect i was so ready to leave that game wow oh my god i can't believe it the thing is though that i don't think they have war hacks because they would have they would have killed me or called me out straight away they must have some kind of hack because the angle i mean maybe he's just facing away maybe he's just passive like you could just been looking away from where you were dude i cannot believe it can't believe it the content's gonna be flowing yeah i had so many doubters in his chat yeah nice come on call everyone who kills you a hacker no i i no i was actually making a bit of a meme bit because they didn't push me when i was literally right next to them so i was like okay well there's no way guys look they've got 180 millisecond latency they were hacking because if they would have killed me straight away right with a pistol they would look like knowing exactly where i was and kill me why is he if he's the one hacking why is he the one driving because he can just get all flick around and kill instantly i'm just saying keep an eye on one of you keep an eye on cleveland he's just closed the line one of his buddies oh they've all got the same clan name clearance and plug-in yeah clearance and plug-in oh oh they've left one behind they've left clearance behind what is this oh look they're not getting they're getting beaten they're just like no what is going on you think they're waiting for us to stop spectating maybe oh no look he died oh no here's the title oh my god [Applause] oh this is insane i cannot believe this believe it oh he's gonna die oh my god he has to push through here he has to push through so if he's the other guy's on a full team in a 1v1 situation the other hacker has taken down taking damage is he going to beat the wall they're both picking each other they both know each other there it's holding position on the left side of this rock and the edge of the hill here uh what's he going to do it's going to be at the end of the game you know it's been shut up from the right let's see how this one plays out oh he knew he's how did he know he was there looks like he's gonna get pushed by the zone he's getting flashed was there a hacker there was two and they fought each other i mean let's not call them another oh my god he's behind me [Applause] that was that my god this guy needs to be signed up immediately i hope the orgs are watching oh man he hasn't heard that he doesn't have he doesn't have walls oh look at the flicks m4 by the way he he's given in he doesn't care he just doesn't care now he wants to win there's only 13 people left oh my god he's gonna get his friends back oh my god he almost lost again yeah i don't think he has because he literally has no idea when people are shooting people keep on surprising him and he has to like react to it this is at least like five ten percent of our games now ten percent i mean yeah that was two hackers in one game two tears yeah right i will i will say in season five i'm not sitting there questioning every single like death now but i'm starting to notice them creep back in last week or so it started to become a bit more of a problem again i mean that's just i mean yeah you could have pulled that off anyway i mean the flick the flick i do this all the time yeah i know and i'm firing a shot before the scope is settled and still getting the accurate head shot like yeah i mean this clearance guy as well though look he's just landed a just landed a kill and another one another down from the clearance guys i think clarence is cheating too 12 spectators on this guy right now yeah let's have a look at clearance maybe i don't know clearance is the guy that i i downed yeah he beam he almost beamed me from here he's got damascus way yeah clearance i'm watching him now he's got about he's not getting more kills because the car 98's bullet velocity is not fast enough yeah yeah this is plug it plug into the plane this is something else boys this is one of the most egregious sneakers i've seen in a while one of the most egregious oh look through the wall in the sky this guy's aimbot broken oh my god the flick then was just nutty oh look it's like i mean he's prioritizing his targets and he's dead so friends i think they could lose yeah i mean we'll see these guys are smart the guys that they're playing against are playing are really smart well i can tell come on they're just not peeking the teammates keep getting down yeah they of course they know they must know oh he's dead yeah unfortunately if he wins this dude nah you wait till he's reloading he just he had so much ammo he could just completely empty his mag over and over and over again reload after reload slot of hand as well probably oh my hacker versus hacker that was not steed that was that was a bit weird to watch yeah both went down simultaneously yep both are sulfurous and then it was just who's gonna stay behind solid cover the longest yeah if that's what hacker gun fights are like in war zone it must be so boring just it's literally how is it fun no i don't know it's it's not even big peen energy [Laughter] oh god i'm back seeing the university all right i'm taking that one wow and then someone else can have i'll have the scraps you have hacker versus hacker fine i've just watched this on tomorrow westy's channel yeah i feel like i've watched this already mr prostoto graphic good video westy on star's channel [Music] you
