all right legends welcome back to sniper ghost warrior contracts 2. and ci games have graciously decided to sponsor yet another video so a big thank you to them if you didn't already know sniper ghost warrior contracts 2 has just released on the playstation 5 and includes a free major expansion available on all platforms called butcher's banquet which also introduces an entirely new region called the temple we will of course be playing through that one in a video very soon but i wanted to make sure that we finish up the main missions first and today's episode is actually the final chapter of the main story so we're hunting down bb rashida who is at the top of the command chain and she's got her hands on some nuclear missiles which is never good and since we've taken out pretty much all of her allies over the last few videos she needs those missiles to win any kind of war so what do you say we pay her a little visit put the kettle on bb i'm on my way control i'm on the ground starting recon move up to the first location but keep an eye out for the trolls russia's forces are weakened she's got enough left to end it acknowledged look at this all it takes is one bullet which you know better than anyone solid copy you've made it this far i know you can finish this control out man that is a nice looking skybox that's a big old fortress over there as well look how sharp those gates are usually when you zoom in at range in games it like blurs the crap out of the thing you're looking at but everything looks so clear arranged in this game which is great i mean it makes sense you know because you're sniping so far away just amazes me how well this game performs control i have overwatch on the crash site sweep the wreckage the control chips may be underwater it's vital we retrieve that data we must determine the target location are we sure the chips are still on site that's uncertain but rationa's forces took control shortly after the crash there was little time for any cargo to be removed and you only need to retrieve one i'm lucky for them but lucky for us time for a swim oh woman to go in there okay that should be fun the hell was that all those footsteps so we climb up here let's go there someone to the right of him as well oh yeah hopefully i can use this bow more in this mission i think he's behind his rock isn't he where you at boy oh yes how did he not see that too engaged in conversation it's gotta be a cloud oh what was that noise i haven't had that sound effect when i've killed someone before the base in my eardrums was incredible oh yeah i've got the uh i've got the deagle now by the way look at this bad boy i've got the suppressor on it as well sure how much that's going to help what are these guys up to need to split them up i think throw a knife for you i really like the sound of the steagle too pack's a punch my god look what it did to that guy's head just gone hide the evidence while we're at it yeet a huge crash site here a couple of guards as well i need them to separate though there you go you walk that way take you out first oh through the cheekbone i take this guy out with a bow just to mix it up oh he's moving he's moving there you go beautiful all right let's get back to the top of that overwatch because i do want to jump in the water like the game told me to that sunset looks so good doesn't it should be careful though because there's a sniper looking at me the last time i came down here is that him oh crap you seen me oh my god i think that's the fastest i've ever zeroed on the enemy oh my god this is brains dude what the hell this sniper is gone right off the edge of the cliff let's hope no one else finds that there's a couple of guys here any other snipers on the mountaintops though oh yep found one there's a guy in there see by the campfire i could shoot that to distract them take this guy out excuse me you want to die i think i got my zero ring right there let's take these two out [Music] yes oh the bullet curve that was so good okay yeah you repair that lovely if i kill you though no good you haven't seen that he's up there okay you turn the spotlight off i'm gonna do with these two i am so lucky that was very messy big chungus we meet again it's your turn okay yep he's definitely dead probably should have taken his body out first but i don't think he saw it i was having a sip of water it's your biggest mistake it's good to stay hydrated though i'm gonna get my drone out for this one hopefully it's in range these two be tricky to take them out from here so we'll do it with a drone two quick shots and they can't call them reinforcements because they're dying [Music] usually when they go red like that it means that everyone else is about to be alerted but we're good there's a guy there as well another one for you oh he's gonna he might drown before he dies of poison oh no what a way to go caught in 4k as well feels bad okay three guys left down here let's get a get our attention with that there we go he's off to fix it no line of sight on this guy oh man where did that land top of his shoulder it's gonna fall in the water yeah there he goes hide the evidence all right now it's my turn to take a dive going in i'm sure they heard nothing they didn't hear me splash like that put on some weight over log down hopefully the splash wasn't too big all right what we gonna do about these two should i get on top of that container yeah i know what i'm gonna do a double take down well that didn't go smoothly as i wanted it to but how did this guy not see my badass takedown on his body i have fresh satellite intel showing multiple hostiles in the grounds and what looks like automated tourists outside check your angles and watch high wherever rashida goes she is heavily guarded anything on the prisoners no no updates we last had them somewhere in the dungeons free them if you can okay massive this place two out the front here three up top a generator oh the sniper on the batman isn't there that's what you get for looking at me oh i don't if you deserve that jesus now for the rest of them tangos eliminated let's get in there shall we oh i hear rattlesnakes please don't bite me how do we even get in here this is a minefield so there might be something on the other side of it oh i want to step on those okay see a side entrance there that's good no more mines let's get in there there's a collectible around here apparently is that it desert camouflage unlocked equip in loadout sweet great i got multiple doorways windows and levels plenty of places hostiles could be if you can stay dark you'll improve your odds watch your movement and be methodical methodical is my middle name oh that look cool our scan effect is awesome how many are we dealing with here two oh that could have been close more steps over here big chungus switch to my armor piercing rounds lovely sounds very windy in here should be careful of that five miles per hour wind it's not too bad oh oh no just empty someone else is whistling nearby stop driving prisoners they brought in yesterday well that worked i'm just gonna run down here where do i go this way i'm heading into the tunnels beneath the palace nice we may lose our visual feed down there if so you'll be on your own that's new standby can i miss you control it sounds a lot like sean bean the guy what's happening bridge collapse i've fallen into some kind of water tank are you still functioning roger but it's low light and i've got no idea where i am your mask can scan the terrain give you some idea of the features at least big brain that scared the crap out of me i'm gonna lie it's not nice when the floor just drops out from below you this our exit looks like it starts to lose oxygen there my health was depleting there's a guy right here sorry buddy two more here damn it's a dead man right there onwards oh no the prisoners i think they're still alive i hear the audio approach carefully if they see you they might kill the prisoners on my watch [Music] there's a lot of recoil on this deagle i have to like wait for it to recenter every time takes a while what they do into the prisoners then it doesn't sound very good does it oh my god assassinate this guy one there two in there [Music] who've you been torturing huh control we were too late oh no the screams are coming from a laptop recorded video are you sure they're dead affirmative this visual is pretty conclusive are they burned have you found any bodies no jesus but they were on screen it wasn't an easy death okay secure any data on that laptop will assess later you can't do anything else down there look for a way to get back to ground level keep heading up copy that i'll find some stairs [Music] found some stairs control do you have visual i'm in the upper part of the palace roger that rashida's quarters are in the presidential tower keep heading up and you'll find it she's usually covered by a security detail let's hope so i'm really liking this bow super cool i think it's called the rambo oh god security camera more steps out there as well pack that where's this oh is this her office oh boy that's a lot of people there's a jammer there so i can't mark anyone for long i will hide you in this convenient box there you go good night where is this dude there i couldn't see him past the bush there we go another box for him i don't know if anyone's going to come down here but they're safe than sorry rather get through this stealthily as possible and here's the fountain with a jammer is that dead yeah i think so all right everyone should be marked now look at them all one here parkour parkour an arrow with your name on oh my god he flew wait what what's up in that tower yeah i see him oh no not someone in here is there oh what the hell epic bullet time right through the upper torso that's a clean kill where the hell were you man who's in that corner maybe so confused right let's keep moving there's a sniper up here he just sneezed bless you let's give the take down on him [Music] the hell did he just say me all right let's take this zipline should be safe now oh right there oh that was cool [Music] suspicious uh i think a second later we would have been spotted there but we're all right we're still in this wouldn't mind if we got spotted at this point because we've cleared out a lot of people now but we'll go for the stealth run as long as possible oh that's rational target's down excellent work now get out of there oh my god the recoil i missed so many shots come here survive juggernaut get those ap rounds in line down let me get this though with a bow jump shot put hey you going in my montage i think that's all i need to do we can just extract now [Music] [Applause] celebratory bell ring what's two down here coming in hot [Music] i was sick throwing up oh no throw a knife that looks so much cooler in my head i didn't actually press the right key oh just always died the full damage and only fools die to fall damage let's get out of here here we go that's the gate we saw earlier when i was over there somewhere there that's where i spawned awesome that was really fun cleared out that entire base without getting you know noticed until the very end that was a lot of enemies that we could have screwed up and just got spotted by so it was a good run this bow was really sick too should blow the tank up for the lulls why not video over thanks for watching guys hope you enjoyed that leave a like if you did subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one well done raven that's a problem solved and a lot of fires put out rashida's little war would have impacted more than kuamar and her new neighbours this conflict had the potential to burn up the whole region but she's out of the picture the command chain is broken and no one is going to use those nukes kumar now has a chance to return to the peaceful state it was before the albacus seized power more critically for us oil supplies are no longer under threat the global economy won't be crashing anytime soon and the ceos of certain multinationals are breathing easier now that hellstrom is dead and is stolen data corrupted well apart from the files you've seized which our tech teams are decrypting we will make sure that the government here won't block an election there's a good chance it'll be free and fair too in fact our man to here is leading the pool of candidates it'll be useful to have someone on the inside you must have wondered why he helped a journalist right now that your work here is done and all payments made why don't you have a break heal rest recharge but stay in touch you will be hearing from us again
