so for months squads have arrived in warzone and boy does that make a huge difference to the pacing of the game fights can last a number of minutes now and having that one extra player on your team to manage ammo and armor place with makes acquiring cash and contracts even more valuable during those early rounds as you race to acquire your own custom loadout so as soon as possible late-game skirmishes become increasingly more difficult as resources become scarce and coordinating with your teammates is going to be detrimental to the success rate of your squad personally I think that trios is a sweet spot for warzone but I'm glad that we now have the option of quads and rumor has it that will also be receiving a duo's playlist very soon let's be honest there is no absence of players on warzone right now so why not have a playlist available for all team sizes let me know your thoughts on the new chords mode below and if you're enjoying the warzone content on this channel don't forget to subscribe for more us according to my YouTube analytics over 80% of you that watched my videos in March wouldn't actually subscribe to the channel so be sure to do so if you haven't already
