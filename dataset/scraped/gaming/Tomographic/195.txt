all right so let's be honest the hdr sniper rifle is pretty unmatched in war zone at the moment i'm talking bullet velocity damage over range and just the lack of bullet drop in general means that you can just point and click at anyone in sight now the khan 98 is easily one of my favorite snipers for aggressive close to medium range sniping in war zone but when it comes to taking shots at longer distances nothing comes close to competing with hdr today's video though is sponsored by nvidia and zotac gaming and last weekend i took part in a killrace warzone tournament with other uk creators who were all using the zotac 2060 super mini gpu in our pcs a compact graphics card which can fit 99 of systems and as you know a faster graphics card can deliver higher frame rates which enables you to see your enemy sooner and give you a better chance at hitting your target while producing a smoother overall image and i really put this thing to the test during my live stream i was playing streaming and recording while using enthank encoding from a single pc setup during my stream i put this thing under a lot of stress and it's still performed admirably under load so if you want to learn more about the zotac gaming 2060 super mini gpu then you can check out the link below for more information generally speaking i think that sniping is in a pretty good place right now but we're still waiting on that much needed rytek amr buff because for whatever reason it still doesn't want hit headshot in warzone and the only way you were able to one hit headshot originally was if you were using the explosive rounds but apparently that was a bug and so it got nerfed anyway i'm just hoping to see some much needed changes in the season 5 update which is just around the corner now so i guess we'll see what happens i'm going to show you some of our better matches from the tournament now but i'll be honest we had some difficult games in this one warzone can be so unforgiving at times but we did place third in the tournament overall which isn't so bad look third place is still third place okay anyway enjoy the video subscribe for more like this and i'll catch you in the next one who can participate in the challenge so the challenge is us we are being challenged there's three teams there's myself tommy triple nine and tommy from two angry gamers the tom team which is making it very interesting for call-outs there's study with the gaming definition and jade sure yes jade sure and then it's uh hans westy and the broken machine they're on a team as well i think they're the real threat here though you know like me me stodd and westy we play together all the time we've played a few games with broken as well when we've done quads but westy and broken have got that communication down and they play duos together all the time so i think they're they're the team to watch out for here the the scores are based off our top three games you get a point for each kill or if you win the game you get 10 points all right try hard mentality here we go i need i need a beer or a gin starter at least it's like popeye's spinach someone else is going for this search there's loads of people going for it whole team on it i got it three down one fourteen behind me yeah i'm down hit one hit one coming at you time coming to get your tom guy right here on blue moving coming to
