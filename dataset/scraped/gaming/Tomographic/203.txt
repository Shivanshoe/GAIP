so if you guys know me I don't like using the metal weapons in warzone I just see so many people using the growl in mp5 at the moment it gets really stale for me as a viewer and as a content creator I don't want you guys to feel like you're watching the same videos all the time so I try and mix up as much as possible and offer you guys some more interesting loadouts and you know just mess around have fun with a game that's what it's all about but believe it or not one weapon I've never tried in warzone is actually the m4a1 now there was a time where everybody considered this to be the metal weapon and that's all kind of shifted over to the ground now but my opinion on the m4a1 is that I mean it's kind of just a jack-of-all-trades you can kick this weapon out to be close-range long-range but it's never amazing one thing and that's why people love it you know like that's why it's great for new players who are brand new to warzone and maybe even modern warfare but that's the beauty of the m4 you can really tailor it to your own preference yeah I think this is a pretty balanced bill that's worked pretty well for me in warzone so far and that's what you're gonna see in today's gameplay I'm playing with study and stone man 64 in this one so lots of banter and a solid game overall so I really hope you enjoy it you guys have been crushing it with the support lately and I cannot thank you enough I mean I even posted a modern warfare gameplay video the other day and it performed just as well as some of my warzone stuff so that was really surprising to me and it really means a lot so thank you all so much leave a like if you enjoy today's video and make sure to subscribe for more like this and I will catch you next time let's go baby let's go baby that stopped
