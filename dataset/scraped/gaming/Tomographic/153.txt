hello guys i hope you're all doing well and staying safe during the holiday season this video will probably go live on christmas day so merry christmas and happy holidays to all of you and i've got a little update for you it appears that i've been put on the naughty list this year yep sadly i've been shadow banned in call of duty war zone there's no biggie right it's just the main game that i play you know i must have had a significant number of reports over the last few days now that the dmr 14 has risen in popularity i mean there's no arguing it now the gun is just straight up broken the fact that you can two shot people in the head is definitely the reason that i've been blacklisted i've even heard in the deathcoms of numerous players that i've killed in the game recently as they accuse me of cheating because it's clear that not everybody is aware of just how broken this new rifle is this guy's cheating so if you don't know exactly what a shadow ban is essentially my account has been blacklisted from the matchmaking system and i've now been moved into a cheater bracket along with other players that i assume have been falsely reported like myself and i understand why they have a system like this in place it obviously works to a degree because i am running into countless cheaters now but it just sucks that i can't play the game with my friends because all of my games are occupied by cheaters which means that when i play with a groove the matchmaking system sees me as one of the bad guys and then that just ruins the game for everyone else in my party we actually had three or four games back to back yesterday when i was playing with acula and jack frags i'll show you some of the gameplay on screen now you can see that we just kept running into cheetahs in every match i honestly just thought there was an increase in cheetahs on the new map and game mode but it appears that as soon as i left the party the guys carried on playing and seemingly had no problems no interruptions from cheetahs for the rest of their playtime so yeah now whenever i try and queue up in warzone i get horrendous queue times like 15 to 20 minutes long sometimes i then have to deal with laggy hyping lobbies filled with cheaters and i just have to deal with it there's seemingly nothing that i can do but just get punished until hopefully the sbmm kicks in and i start to get put in more fair lobbies it's just crazy and banning legitimate players like myself just isn't the way mando would not be happy all i'm saying is be careful using the dmr14 in warzone if you're one of those players making the most of that two-hit headshot potential like myself don't be surprised when you suddenly get mass reported and find yourself in the cheetah lobbies you know if this is the only way that activision are combating cheaters right now then so be it i suppose this is the best option for now until they implement a system that actually effectively eliminates cheaters from the game and these players should be banned permanently they shouldn't be given the privilege of being put into a bracket with other cheaters and other players like myself who've found themselves in these cheetah lobbies even when they're not cheating again i know i'm not the only one this affects and there's probably some of you out there are watching this video now who have been shadow band whether you realized it or not i actually think getting shadow band is worse than being banned and shut out completely because you're left in this weird limbo state where you don't know whether the game's just broken the servers are ruined there's an influx in cheetahs or your internet just died you just get placed in these lobbies with zero warning or notice and there are players way better than myself too and i'm sure as hell not enjoying the matches that i play now that i'm in this bracket all i can do is hope that warzone's matchmaking system realizes that i am one of the good boys and i can get back to recording some new content i suppose i'll have to look at the positives for now and maybe take a few days off to relax over christmas but for now i guess i'll leave you with a match that i had using the dmr14 shortly before i was shadowbanned so yeah thank you very much for watching and a very merry christmas to each and every one of you seriously i can't thank you all enough for the support that you've shown me this year the channel has grown exponentially i mean look at these stats i really never expected it and i appreciate you all so much more than you know and uh yeah here's to the new year hopefully i can continue to bring some top-notch content your way and keep you all entertained and yeah let's just hope that 2021 is a better year for all of us because 2020 was an absolute short show i love you lots stay safe and enjoy the holidays and i will catch you legends in the next one maybe we're all going too far though maybe we should go here no there's enough loot
