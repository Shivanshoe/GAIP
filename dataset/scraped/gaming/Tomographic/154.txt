so you've probably heard by now the dmr14 in warzone is pretty damn good and it really is if you couple this thing with the mac 10 smg then you just have a recipe for dominance at almost any range i've got my dmr setup like this with a recently buffed agency suppressor which now matches the traits of the monolithic suppressor that we're all used to and yes that does include the hidden 15 bullet velocity increase which for some reason still isn't listed but we'll take it i've got the task force barrel which adds bullet velocity damage range and it apparently increases the overall damage but i'm not entirely sure this is accurate to warzone you know a lot of these attachments seem to work very differently since they were moved over from cold war so i wouldn't trust a lot of the information that you see at first glance here and actually you might prefer using the titanium barrel which increases the rate of fire allowing you to spam this thing to your heart's content with a slight reduction to effective damage range so this might work really well for you and more importantly it doesn't have the recoil penalties of the task force barrel and that penalty is quite significant it does feel like two or three times the amount of recoil so at those longer ranges if you are spam firing you will have difficulty hitting your target you know maybe that's a better option if you play on console for example you won't have to deal with those penalties and you'll really be able to play at this weapon's most effective range which to me feels like it falls off around 100 meter mark as for the rest of the attachments we've got the axial arms three times optic with a hunter reticle which is my personal favorite i really like this one for those thin middle crosshairs you know you don't want your target to be hiding behind those at range so this has worked really well for me i've got the field agent grip to help balance out some of that recoil as well as the 30 round mags to maximize the aim down sight speed as the other magazines can really slow down your ads and 30 rounds is still plenty to work with you know the time to kill with the dmr 14 is actually really fast and just two shots to the head will down your opponent so try this build for yourself and let me know what you think if your aim is true you can absolutely destroy with this gun and it's proven to be a really solid pick for warzone with that said i'm going to let the gameplay speak for itself i'm playing with thuggler and stoneman 64 in this one so if you enjoyed the video leave a like to let me know subscribe for more like this and i'll catch you legends in the next one i am not going through it no no no do it no no no no no we're getting we're gaming now all right we're

broke him he's on that corner target location we can push that oh freaking i'm under fire i'm selfie i'm sorry i almost got that knock on the surface we can fight this [ __ ] we can fight this we can't get on the roof though we can't but i'm confident we can win this fight [Music] i'm coming in from the other side i'm a little bit behind he's going up the stairs i thought i heard him here going up the stairs teammates outside down as well might sell for us just at that ledge is he dead i heard the teamwipe sound effect okay i guess i got it then oh easy uh satchel here if you need something caliber one of you probably do okay so he he opened the box but it's supplies he opened it from the ledge so i don't know how we get that i don't can you even get up there we have to parachute off uh we have to go to the bake building over there yeah yeah yeah some good luck man i'm just gonna let you guys send it shots on blue new visa recon go on advanced if you can uh oh on top he's just at this tree here two of them though in the building broke them broke them up there [Music] that's not my relocation other guys at the building i don't know did you get the finish yeah yeah i finished him off he was like he's [ __ ] lasering me bro top hill blue mark from like a year away cresting hill uh moving left i think he got my kill i think that was a visual probably going to try and get that guy's still mark now he's on the back of the hill uav is back again he's on uav still one in this house just hiding there do we want to push the hill we can push the hill there's no one

knocked him in the hut yeah the other guy i shot got rest i don't know where the other one is but there's one in the heart nice behind the hill no um i don't even know what you're shooting at bro oh that's uh north directly uphill nice i think he's got a cell phone too i think he might have gone down to the shots on the roof three there three there careful yeah he's still up he's still up there orange mark where is orange i fall off there's a lot for me i don't see an orange mark there you go he's up there somewhere running around all right all right i'm looking he's gonna be forced here yes right or left of the mark new orange right he's running a right side of the mountain where you guys came from he's following the itches on yeah got him instead calm very good um i knocked one on blue roof there just be cautious that he's going to get back up and firehouse tower i think he was who is he was shooting at i'm not sure though i'll top the other roof there as well i got a bird you guys need plates or are you good i got i'm full stacking right now actually we should go i should go spend some money we're taking shots i'm going to jump in the gas i'm going to jump in the gas wish me luck i'm going to get a self-res and um tom so i can go get a self rest too have twenty one thousand dollars oh okay dude what the heck i don't wanna really do my fps is tanking right now oh yeah

somewhere no anymore okay i'm moving up here out there jumping off right now okay i did down one on the roof take the top of the wreath for now we'll move when we need to that's not even in i'm gonna go to the next building that's what they always done this building on blue yeah oh shooting in couple armor hits on i'm in pushing ground floor second second i'm trying to come back over to you guys first clear second clear closing our doors here it's on last i can air strike the roof if he's on it no you know what's not worth knock him nice on this yellow roof should i be on him just don't hit

no dude oh there's one guy middle floor okay we played i thought he was outside the building when he did i accidentally switched my guns i think i just gotta roll with this though can you play stone no i only knocked one on the right roof there all right i think he's probably soft these guys were wiped on oh yep i broke them you drop off i'm selling i'm selfing i'm fine just go got four gas masks go make it yeah i'll be fine find me i think you're blind oh there's another one behind me unlucky dude i wonder where that guy came from if he was in the building or not you got mask tom how you can go quick on me but awesome for your dad probably not worth actually no forgive me ladies and gentlemen that's what you like to see this is going to be tough 1v3 airstrike take cover say this armor now i did have an airstrike on me in the building there i believe you're going to have a tough time when the stone pushes you out you don't have a knock oh my god i can't spam it like that super steady good knock that's the thing so i'm gonna go get the uh clean 1v2 you can't spam it too much past medium range it's yes you can good job one more 1v1 you saw him called an airstrike right in the middle yeah she got this way on the right you got a mask don't know about this play i don't think i have the cover no you gotta put the shots on them this angle's rough dude come on there's some shots on here no dude i'll pick the wrong spot to get in there should i hold my angle in the building yeah you didn't have the zone there so it's like you're kind of forced so it's kind of a bully even if just like there was there's an inch on that wall you could have got your plates up you could be set going in oh yeah i probably could have played the gas a little bit longer but damn i wanted to keep him guessing well you only had half gas mask too so you throw i mean maybe you could have waited a little bit yeah but i like his pain ggs that lance it's good fun [Music] you
