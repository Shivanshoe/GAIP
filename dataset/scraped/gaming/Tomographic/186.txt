so the season five mid-season update is now live on modern warfare and warzone and with that update came the introduction of a new 556 lmg called finn say hello finn okay i think he's a bit shy anyway there are actually seven different barrel attachments for this gun and if you use one of the adverse barrel options your fire rate will be increased to the absolute maximum so much so that the end of your barrel will actually catch fire if you shoot long enough i just thought that was a really cool detail and there is even a chainsaw stock attachment which i'm going to be trying in another video so make sure to drop a like if that's something you want to see now my boy finn here has a default fire rate of 630 rounds per minute but that can be increased to 996 rpm which is how i like to run this lmg for maximum damage so this right here is the class setup that i'm using in the following gameplay i'm still experimenting with different loadout options for this one but this setup actually worked out really well for me in game so give it a try and let me know what you think i'm running the monolithic suppressor for sound suppression and damage range as well as the hidden 15 bullet velocity then we've got the xrk long shot adverse barrel which is what gives us that increase to fire rate as well as increased damage range and bullet velocity this does however greatly increase recoil so i used the mark 4 grip here to help balance things out a bit as well as giving us a slight increase to movement speed i'm then using the gi mini reflex for better target acquisition and we only receive a four millisecond penalty to ads speed with this optic the iron sight is really not too bad on the fin so you could use attack laser here if you prefer but you will struggle to keep track of your target at those longer ranges finally i'm using the no stock attachment for faster movement speed and aim down sight speed as well as a 17 reduction to hip fire spread but once again the game just does not want to tell you this so that's it for the class setup now let's jump into some gameplay i'm playing with jack frags and studying this one and we had an absolutely ridiculous game here so make sure to stick around till the end of the video because things get a little bit spicy leave a like if you enjoyed the video subscribe for more and i'll catch you guys in the next one nice
