okay we're starting off on the mountain bike i need to get into pole position oh my god this is crazy i love what we're all just wearing the same flannel shirt nobody's customized their characters yet will you stop bumping into me please let's get past this guy oh it's a big jump good landing oh jesus that rock was almost the end of me all right we're in first place now let's keep it up whoa got other riders trying to take me out on different courses those guys are on wing suits oh there goes all chances of me ever having kids it's over there's nothing left down there oh man i didn't know i was going to skis immediately i forgot this was a multi-race but be careful now good pace though no i spoke too soon oh freak please crash please crash yes idiot that's what you get for showing off he attempted the 720 and just face-planted at the end of it oh i'm such a bad sportsman how fast i'm going down this hill this is so steep actually it's not steep that's a different ubisoft title oh no get out the way oh baby there's other people doing different races in front of me this is crazy oh my god the speed i thought to come off right now oh big jump i'm too sick send me to the hospital it's getting a bit narrow now finish line yes let's go i gotta stop saying let's go jesus i've been saying it on ironically for so long it's actually become a part of my vocabulary that was a fun one though i really enjoyed that let's move on to the next one shall we how big this map is it's crazy i'm loving it okay your next biggie ridge tv's lucky straight he's closing in faster than a butter bullet light it up push to my first and remember riding rocky wing is way more fun than riding slow lucky straight it's a bike only event i like the sound of that we'll choose expert why not get an extra bit of xp for that as well let's do it ridge tv lucky straight doesn't look very straight does it not have a lot of fun with this game at the moment can only play for today though i don't know when this video is going up but ubisoft hosting some sort of writer's republic play day i think it's called so i jumped at the opportunity to play because i haven't had the chance yet i'm really fun so far let's get it i think i need to beat the clock in this one so i don't need to worry about doing tricks and stuff i might throw a few in there though you know oh this is fast this is so fast what the hell why is there a guy stood there you crazy he's trying to get killed oh my god he puts a turn after a jump like that gonna hit those try and stars the challenge i can find them all there's one get back on track we're good you can actually hear them stones and stuff go through your spokes when you're on the grass that's cool oh yeah let's get the 360 in there it's another start i got it this is fun man this is so fun i've got a giant smile on my face right now oh no no i don't hold on tight hold on tight we're still in this this reminds me of whistler dude with the wooden wooden ramps and stuff this is cool really cool track i love the level design in this oh little a narrow narrow there have to feather the brakes a bit made out alive though steep hill so jump oh i don't think that's a supposed to be an intentionally big jump got more airtime than expected landed on the back wheel there almost came off pick up the speed i'm flying is this the finish line oh why did nobody catch me you had one job look at the size of that guy's nose a little bit of history about me i actually used to be super into downhill mountain biking only casually but i still love the sport but playing this game feels like i'm back in the saddle i could never do anything like that though prefer to keep my wheels on the ground for the most part yeah the mechanics are actually pretty decent in this game surprisingly even though it's very arcadey [Music] oh left or right left or right we're going right looks great in first person though you actually feel really immersed especially because i'm playing with like minimal hud so there's not much ui on my screen superman [Music] i'm coming lois this is so fun man i'm having a great time i want to try the there's like 64 player races in this game oh my god i haven't done this trick before oh i'm not gonna land it oh yeah that's that's me dead oh right before the finish line i fall off i got 98 of the way there and then crashed that's great actually no we should switch to hey kid this stunt remote force will provide oh gosh almost killed myself okay we're going this way now it's fine remember don't set limits on your unlimited potential keep pushing right on dude wait what was that a crashed plane whoa slow it down slow it down slow it down come on there we go touch down safely look at this there's a guy playing the guitar down here ah he's doing that method i forget what it's called sounds very different though i like it okay what the hell is this thing so i need to balance across this press a collect relic found hello painful dude you're right i think that's a new jet wing that i just unlocked it actually benefits you the free roam in the game actually reminds me of forza horizon where you could have the barn finds and stuff i wonder if it's already equipped challenges my god it is provide a massive hit of adrenaline look at this on the big trees remember don't set limits on your unlimited potential got a jet on my back where's the speed boost there it is holy crap we're gonna win all the races with this thing that is so quick this game is awesome man i don't even care okay guys it's time i was about to do another race but i've just been informed that a mass event is about to take place so i need to get over there i'm a regular joe england now because the other one isn't quite as mobile but it does go really quick let's do it 64 players in one race this is gonna be insane here it is the first round i'm so ready look at this [Applause] oh boy starting on skis everyone just looks the same because no one's customized their characters yet myself included apparently i want to be third person for this let's go first person look at everyone that guy's already fallen over go go go go go so look at this oh my god how am i supposed to tell who's who oh jesus oh i'm getting bumped it's illegal oh my god the collision please stop crashing into me i'm like fighting them off yeah you don't want to hit the trick spots no you oh god he bumped me into the tree almost i was so close all right we're biking now a very nearly new you ass you're with a hole in an ass let's catch up big time i do i do i really do i'm getting smashed by everyone this is it's ridiculous it's too many people there's too many people who are good at the game and out front i'm all over the place here i'm still in the runnings though you know i'm in the front of the pack oh god all right i'm all right let's keep it going i need to catch up just got put in the cabbage thank god that kept me on the line take this and stop back to skis i haven't seen snowboards yet i wonder what else we're gonna get in this race other than bikes and skis so 360. that wasn't fun i need to stop focusing on tricks also spoke too soon all right i need to stay clear of the rocks here otherwise i'm going to lose all of my speed nope find your own line damn it there's plenty of space for all of us that guy's going backwards don't want to get bumped around here there's way too many obstacles in my way back on the bikes [Music] oh wait someone's won the first round damn he must have been really far ahead of everyone i'm sure i should have gone on the right hand side there yeah left foot in better i've taken that guy on the final turn that's not the final turn that guy really was far ahead of everyone what the hell first person oh frick no where did that come from at least he was the final oh for god's sake okay we came tenth out of 64. that's that's good right that's top 15 percent oh my god okay we're starting out front this time i've earned my positioning push all right let's go guys less crushing and shoving this time all right let's get down the hill nice and clean oh my god this is not clean it's very messy watch out for the trees click on this right side but it's a nice powder here oh no get to the left the start of these races is absolute chaos just trying to fan everyone out trying to separate the pack a bit we go almost top ten big old ramp here oh rocket wing hopefully i can control this decently enough that's all i need hit my boost whenever it's ready you're flying keep pushing it rider can't do that all the time it's on a cool down but because i've disabled most of my ui i don't know when that cooldown expires i'm all right though i can just keep spamming it here we go back on the bike back on the bike nice transition good amount of speed oh no oh we're good yes a little shortcut that i remember that one for next time keep going this is right as hell dude okay we'll stay on the right side here come on boys keep up the pace coming for that top five position taking number six oh god you've got a rock there mother nature what are you doing  the rocket wing final switch gate this is it this is it don't mess up now tom come on i'm feeling it i'm feeling the pressure i'm gonna choke why did i say that bob and weave yes okay it's not where i wanted to be but we're still top ten jay boone doc is also doing very well i've seen him a couple of times he's been like top five twice he's got 211 stars under his belt twitch density has got over 500 what the hell how long have you been playing for it's only been out a day oh i've been demoted that guy beat me on points he finished like last but he beat me on points i need to do more tricks i think this is the last round oh crap i think i need to do more tricks it's not just about the racing oh screw it i think racing is still more important i'll try and do some tricks here and there [Applause] it's time to focus it all comes down to this if i can get top five somehow i'll be happy there's no way i'm winning that's for sure i hope this mode catches on though i just hope the game does really well to be honest when it comes out this could be like the new fall guys just imagine the potential for this game oh my god that wall i used to play um a game called ssx religiously which is a snowboarding game what the hell is this rocket skis this game is so sick that break really helped me there oh my god that break was so good maybe slow instead he does win the race because the amount of trees are here this is crazy i need to just hope and pray that one doesn't come out of nowhere i'm doing all right at the moment i just went flying yeah it is i am forced right now right i think so all the people are right next to me just listen to him flying over my head come on yes i want top three one good pace this guy is a little bit faster than me you might have a better rocket ring some of the higher guys will do that jetwing would have been sick for this because it'd be super fast but at the same time i wouldn't have had the mobility for some of those tight corners here we go back on the track closing sections time to nuke your way into the top three oh slalom massive obstacles here but that one guy's so far away what the hell no was i not supposed to go right they debated me so hard just then dude what was that all right i've somehow still managed to keep my spot i've lost a lot of time there it's horrible that was the final switch so i can't do better than fifth place now pack is so far ahead of me yeah someone's won i can't believe that because if i went the wrong way got debated so hard careful oh that's not what you want yes no what is this oh my god yes 10 seconds left yes where did i place i think i came fifth i'm gonna i'm gonna guess i came fifth not bad at all nice work oh no i came sixth oh that turn completely ruined me came out of nowhere all right there my dudes that's gonna do it for today's video i really do hope you enjoyed that that was a lot of fun um and yeah if you want to see more i mean i've recorded plenty of footage today i really made the most of this uh ubisoft riders republic play day i think it's great honestly the races are already fun free roam aspect is great it's gonna be a really cool social game i think maybe some of you got access to it let me know
