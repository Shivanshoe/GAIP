thanks whoa it's good to see you spike how long has it been far too long but don't get all mushy on me now come i want to show you something how long has it been where are we going you'll see spike's an old man now incredible what's incredible most pilgrims don't last two three years on the road but you've been kicking around for what four years now and you're still alive still got spring in your step so are you i know but i'm [ __ ] awesome yeah yeah right right look at that a beehive full of honey can't let an opportunity like this go to waste yeah no way oh look around if we're lucky there's chamomile growing here too i'm a meal who's making the tea all right objective updated collect honey and chamomile i can use my survivor sense with q to find any nearby resources careful of the bees and you're just gonna stand there huh spike while i do all the work i'm surprised to see spike in this game i don't think there'd be many returning characters all right well these orange leaves are a sign that i can climb things this will do there's loads of camera meal up here all right i think we're good hey spike i bought you some flowers you remember that old herbalist we helped escort to her village oh yeah the one that had that saying uh remember chamomile and honey are gifts that keep giving combine them and lucky you you just might go on living okay crafting is now available so you've received your first blueprint blueprints are plans that allow you to create accessories consumables and weapon modifications using various parts so we're going to craft some medicine it looks like come on we're almost there you can see my health in the top left there so i should probably heal up before we get into any action lead the way spike this is it come on need some help i guess not okay we're here but where is here wow somebody had a nice crib this place is bougie don't tell me damn it locked know it i'll try to get through here you check the other side take anything we could use okay oh i don't like it but it's the only entrance i can see i swear if this game gives me a jump scare this early i will not be happy empty anyone home [Music] it's not like anyone's been home for a while nothing here nothing in here how about this oh no hello what are you playing at rats try and give me a heart attack yeah just rats i think it's time we parted ways why i'm starting to worry about you and you know what i'm saying you're starting to worry about someone it means it's time to go what do you mean by that spike really he really just left well i guess we're going it alone i need to find a radio antenna oh god that didn't sound good at all check your current objectives pilgrim's path get to the radio antenna there it is i think we need to go down before we can get up though so let's move and those zombie noises are terrifying imagine hearing that while you're sleeping oh god that's just as bad what the hell's making that noise oh wait are we gonna get to kill our first zombie it's a beehive there i wonder if i can get a take down on it if i sneak up behind it don't see me don't see me don't see me there's a zombie in there too oh gross hope you enjoyed your last meal oh snapped his neck oh my god thank god for breakthrough shadows have that i feel good someone's got a free bite let's have a look around the back side of this lake house oh hello you come outside to play let's get a good look at you that is quite scary jump attack i think i need to upgrade my skill tree a bit before i can do that okay what is this somebody's got steam coming out of his head these physics are so good oh my god he got heated stay down you're done okay now where do i go up there is that a bus what the hell this will find a way somehow i've got to go through it on the inside no way this is sick scary but really cool this could fall at any moment it's barely suspended off the edge of this cliff reminds me that scene in uh jurassic park three uh can i reach that yeah just about oh that's close your stamina is depleted wait for it to replenish oh all right we made it let's get down my zombies about through that tunnel next i guess this way oh no definitely not this way up and over are you kidding me it's a bloody zombie sleepover good job this vent was here obviously not the first person to come this way many have tried before me i gotta stay quiet how would i go over here be quick i almost woke them up let's drop down okay we're in the clear i could have gone very badly what's this gas tank [Music] should i i mean i made it out the other side [Music] what's the worst that could happen hold x to ignite it oh that didn't go very far well that definitely woke him up time to get the hell out of here gotta test these things you know they definitely left that gas canister there for that reason they knew someone would do it where exactly is the radio tower looks like i'll go this way that was actually really satisfying that worked so well animations are really good in this game all right we keep moving oh another beehive say no more okay he can't get up there ah zip line every great game has one love it look at this this game is breathtaking man look at the wind in the trees that's so good going into a cave are we how big is this going to be just the way through oh i think i can get around this guy so we'll have to go through him press e to perform a kick sorry buddy it's your unlucky day we love a 300 moment we have to be close now surely the sun's getting real low we all know what happens when night falls the zombies come out to play parkour skill point acquired what can i get you've leveled up your parkour proficiency you can now use it to unlock your first parkour skill high jump let's get it so now we should be able to get up here almost there pretty easily awesome would have been able to do that before another one okay i think we're here ah it's already dark it's time to hide somewhere for the night it won't get any better than this i don't think so i'll climb these pipes right yeah i can jump over here it's even the right way ah it's this window i need to jump through got so ahead of myself there the broadcast station should be here somewhere let's have a look around then i guess it's in there right locked okay there's some footprints leading through here someone moved them not long ago um okay let's give it a try so we got hidden door that's gotta be heavy this is it the broadcast station i gotta start the generator need to start the generator and here is it don't like this oh good one all right i guess we're fighting huh three of them what the what the hell is that i was going to say that what's it doing behind there why am i just holding on this camera angle oh my god get off me what the hell is that thing some enemies use power attacks to deal massive damage and can knock you down when an enemy is about to use a power attack the health bar starts blinking red dodge to avoid being hit perform a dodge with space while moving backwards to the side okay oh this soundtrack is sweet all right and it's still away from that thing i don't even know what it's called what is this enemy i don't think this is in dynamite one let's go zombies just jumping on top of them what the hell yeah this is horrible keeping an eye on you gonna try and do as much damage to these guys before she comes and smacks me in the face that's one down get off me where is it there okay you stay back [Music] come on there we go there's two more what the hell so fast i hate that horrible little thing all right two zombies left durability of my weapon isn't looking too good now though so [ __ ] on that too for a kick in there the melee combat is so cool there we go all the last hit as well my weapon just crumbled in my hands okay that was intense let's look at these guys and then start the generator finally it's never that simple is it there we go i just have to spam f this time you know when a game puts you into a cut scene it's about to hit the fan start the generator there we go lights on raggedy chopper new weapon acquired all right some scraps there can't loot the fire extinguisher there we go that was a cool fight the zombies were just chilling downstairs the whole time lovely in the right mess of the place what's this player's stash okay just dump my stuff in there i'll leave a weapon behind why not this one all right let's try and get a good night's sleep shall we it's been a day turns out it was all just one big nightmare i have to say i'm very impressed by this game so far performance has been great i really like the graphics melee combat it's awesome and the parkour just feels like more of what people loved to be honest in the first game [Applause] look at this that was so unnecessary i don't know why i did that okay let's keep moving there's a few zombies around here but i think i'm okay easily avoided so i'm on my way to find an informant i'm not gonna spoil anything because i have just gone through like a pretty spoilerific segment of the game this doesn't look safe at all what the hell that actually just tilted like a seesaw okay i guess i need to use this rope let's get over the fence stamina's draining quite quick though oh baby just about made it meet the contact in the metro tunnels what's gonna be fun isn't it i don't like entering dark places in this game i'm entering the tunnels hey can you hear me i'll meet you soon here i come let's pry these doors open oh no i don't like this hey is anybody there oh man oh [ __ ] this doesn't look good you're telling me oh my god it's a damn bloodbath come on let me in oh [ __ ] oh no remember the volatiles it's got me oh yes the uv light did it by me don't look at me like that dude i can't be good are you all right you [ __ ] bit me a volatile lots of those [ __ ] in the sewers quickly just stay strong and that my friends is where we're going to leave it for this video like i said in the intro i wanted to leave out any major spoilers and focus on gameplay for the most part so i hope this was a good first look at what dying light 2 has to offer let me know your thoughts in the comments below i haven't been sponsored to play the game early or anything but i do have to give thanks to the kind folks over at techland for allowing me to capture some early content for you all i've already sunk a few hours into this game now past what you've just seen here and i can tell you with full confidence that there is a lot to love about this game it's pretty evident to me that tech land have built dying light 2 for the long haul just like the first game so i have faith that this one will be equally adored i've only run into a handful of visual bugs here and there but for a game that is so packed with content i think it's easily forgiven and we've had so many disappointing aaa titles recently it's just so good to play dying light 2 and get lost in the world and just enjoy the whole package and wrapping things up i wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to all of you watching yes you without you i wouldn't be getting opportunities like this and i appreciate you sticking around until the end of the video if you could do me one last favor and drop a like for the algorithm it really does help me out subscribe for more dying light content in the not so distant future but until then stay human and i will catch you legends in the next one
