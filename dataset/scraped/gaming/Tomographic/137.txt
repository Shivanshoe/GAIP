also the monument's completely split in two look that's crazy all right i don't know how many people are going to try and make it in here you idiot i don't think stoner be on this early [Music] so it's content day in warzone and season two is finally upon us i think we've all been desperately craving some new stuff in warzone and new stuff is exactly what we've got in this brand new update there are two new weapons the lc10 smg and the pharah 83 assault rifle and just look at this reactive blueprint which you can unlock at level 95 in the battle pass players are also finding some new unreleased weapons for modern warfare in loot boxes around verdansk the cold war attachments have finally been updated to do what they say they do but i think i'll let jay god and true game data be the judge of that rather annoyingly though it has been proven that the agency suppressor appears to be broken and it now reduces bullet velocity between 35 and 40 on the assault rifles and tactical rifles which is similar to how it worked at the start of season 1. and i've just found out that this also applies to the rap suppressors on the cold war sniper rifles as well such as the tundra and pelington which have also been nerfed by around minus 30 percent this has to be an oversight but honestly who knows anymore for now at least i'd suggest that you run a flash guard on any of these weapons otherwise you might just prefer using some of your old reliable modern warfare builds seeing as the monolithic suppressor is unaffected so the new fire assault rifle is a lot of fun and feels to me like a direct competitor to the ffar with a fast fire rate and high time to kill though the recoil pattern does leave something to be desired so definitely keep your engagements between close and medium range with this thing but i've really enjoyed using this gun so far and this will definitely be the first weapon i max out so keep an eye out for my recommended loadout in a video on the channel very soon i haven't really spent much time with the lc10 smg but to be honest i wasn't really wowed by it when i first picked it up it kind of feels like it pales in comparison to the mac 10. but if the mac 10 does receive a nerf in the future then maybe this smg will take its place we'll have to wait and see [ __ ] [ __ ] so moving on to the new points of interest on the dance we have of course got the vodanoy ship which is crashed into the dance between paw and gulag prison and inside the cargo hold of this ship are some new friends and just as we expected zombies have arrived in verdansk and they're not in a separate mode this time around they are now ai controlled and you can find them in any of the vedanska playlists including plunder as part of the outbreak event and as you can see i had a lot of fun farming zombie kills with big bertha here this is a great way to get started with some of those outbreak challenges that's for sure now the zombie waves are actually triggered by players using this terminal here and there are more of these around for dansk but they seem to be inactive at this time which by the sound of it means that verdansk is soon to be overrun by the undead the first terminal can be found in bunker one which is here at the construction area you can easily get lost in this place and there is lots of cool stuff to stop and look at as well as plenty of loot the next bunker is actually one that we visited before but this time we don't need an access code and the area at the back is now open with these ominous windows that seem to be hiding something you can also find another zombie terminal here so you can imagine how claustrophobic fighting off the zombie horde in this bunker could be and the final bunker we can access is located at military base and the monument on the hill has now split in two revealing a silo which you can drop into or climb in and out of using this ladder there's not really much to see in this one but once again would you look at that it's another zombie terminal the lower level of stadium is also no longer accessible probably to improve performance with all of these new points of interest opening up and something that i found over at dan whilst i was exploring in plunder is this doc over at damn which to my knowledge wasn't here before right it seems like a very small and random addition to make if the theories are true and verdansk is supposedly getting nuked soon the way i see things going down is that eventually all of these zombie terminals that i mentioned will soon be active and will have no choice but to leave verdansk and hopefully at this point during the mid season update we'll maybe get a new map as we are approaching the one-year anniversary of warzone's release so i can't help but think that this is all part of something much bigger let me know what you think is going on in the comments below but with that said i'm going to leave you now with some solo gameplay from my first ever match of season 2 and the chaos that is the new shipwreck drop spot but yeah do make sure to subscribe so you don't miss out on any of the videos that i've got coming your way very soon for season two of war zone and please feel free to leave a like to help this video get recommended by youtube's algorithm it really helps the channel out and i would appreciate it greatly i really would i got up at 7am to make this video alright thank you all for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one this is a good circle for it isn't it let's try i don't know how soon people are going to be jumping so maybe we well actually i can't grab a heli let's get my trajectory right there we go looking good look at these size strafers oh god people love a new spot to drop don't they they really do love it all right here we go there i look back oh my god i looked back cold war mp5 let's do it bad someone died here oh [Applause] someone else died here zombies ain't coming okay that's cool but what does it mean there are shots everywhere can i get up here oh jesus good job he was low this thing reps dude i like it oh i thought it did full damage there no idea was coming i'm not designed for mornings i haven't been out this early in a long time oh i was looking at the time on my second screen geez that woke me up what is going on [Applause] who needs caffeine jesus eight kills already oh god maybe you should play at 7am more often this is mad i shot inside or out hmm don't know this is wild man it feels like i'm playing a multiplayer map it's supposed to be an open world battle royale experience haven't left this ship yet there's a guy right up there what a madman see if i can get over to him popping daddy you can still hear my steps pretty clearly yep he didn't hear me though that's the important thing enemy dropping into the ao oh they are are they but where where aren't thou i haven't even seen the zombies yet it's my first game i did see a zombie when i looked in the mirror for the first time this morning though i'll tell you that much geez oh come on that's a shame now i really am a zombie oh yeah he beat me surviving that cold war mp5 took us far didn't it very impressive maybe i should have just gone lower level 10 kills that early into the match though is pretty crazy right i don't know if it's a it's the best idea to go back there immediately it was a nice little segment of gameplay though hi bud you're up next mate get ready is the game going to make us fight now just remember they'll never tear us apart i think it's actually him i'm fighting you're up soldier let's go sort this i saw the red paint on him no my one true love okay yeah i've spawned i've spawned quite some distance away from where i started but hopefully i can get my loadout soon-ish and uh yeah try and try and win this game i guess and that is what we were waiting for oh perfect look at that gives us the high ground as well try this uh shall we there's a truck coming my way um i don't know if the suppressor's broken on it or not got a suppressor on my other b3 is he using the zip he is wait for it good ah good run from it hide from it destiny still arrives [Music] all right let's get self rest from here and then head into zone there's another vehicle driving on the road there but i found some catching up cool there's a guy on that road roof oh that's clean i can drive it's kind of annoying though it's got self-rest i'll try and get on this roof but there might be someone up there ready to kill me can't cut him off here i'm ahead of him so look i'm really straining my voice today probably the coffee don't often drink gas moving it hmm that's not good did he not see me yeah what the [ __ ] oh who did that they put a cluster right on my vehicle no not mr truck this sign might ruin me i gotta move now gas masks would have come in clutch there but we're good got a satchel out of it and this game could have ended totally differently if i just stayed at the ship and not been killed when i was went from like the most fast-paced start to just barely any action this zone is so close to the ship as well i would have been in walking distance if i just oh correct target mark center cluster's gonna do anything but this is loaded 2-0 good copy enemy uav onwards we go this isn't good for me not a good spot and i can't get to a building right now quad jesus what were you doing ballsy just switch seat and start gunning at me from the back respect it i swear i died oh god that's not good for me i hit x to slide instead of c have an ammo box on me less than 10 was still standing that's that's annoying look at this dude i believe you went for an assassination there that's crazy great well there's my first game playing on uh season two but um that's not a terrible game you know just an insane start but just couldn't finish it really started on a high ended on a bit of a low but good game leave them alone you bully that's not very nice is it not very nice is it [Applause] yeah so i thought if you choose to beam you get beamed [ __ ] [Music] you
