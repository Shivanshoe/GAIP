so then if you've been watching my warzone videos and streams long enough you'll know just how much i love sniping in this game i just can't help it i've put so much practice in with the snipers in war zone that i kind of feel naked without one at this point there's nothing more satisfying than winning a one-on-one gunfight against someone using a metal loadout especially when you hear your enemies death comes after downing them multiple times i've got a near perfect sniper round to show you today using the hdr and quads but before we get into that i wanted to let you know that today's video is sponsored by loop deck and they recently sent me the newly launched loop deck live a compact power console for streamers and content creators that can really help to speed up your workflow i've been using the loop deck for about a week or so now and i've been really impressed by its functionality in the various programs that i use now i actually get a lot of questions about my youtube thumbnails and what my process looks like so i figured this would be a perfect opportunity to give you a glimpse behind the curtain so to speak as i do make my own youtube thumbnails i have a bit of a graphic design background prior to making content and maybe this will help answer some of your questions about my own work process or at the very least give you the inspiration to try out some new techniques the loop deck live really does feel like a natural extension to the software that i use like photoshop and premiere pro but the loop deck works with pretty much any program you can think of it's designed for quality with an aluminium cover and industrial dials which have a range of different functions to help you with things like color grading levels and zoom and if you're anything like me and you struggle to remember all of the different keybinds that come with these various different programs then loop deck really helps to simplify the experience by having all of the necessary tools at your fingertips when it comes to the streaming functionality of the loop deck live i can switch between all of my scenes and sources with the touch of a button or screen in this case the loop deck does in fact use touch screen with built-in haptic feedback and one of my favorite features as a streamer is the ability to change audio levels on the fly with the dials that we mentioned earlier it works seamlessly and honestly the loop deck live is a joy to use and works great for all of my needs as a content creator so if you want to find out more about the loop deck live there will be a link at the top line of the video description but with that said thank you very much for watching leave a like if you enjoyed the video and subscribe for more like this now sit back relax and enjoy
