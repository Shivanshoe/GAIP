all right guys so let me tell you about the sheer amount of pain and mental torment i've had to endure just trying to get some decent solo gameplay with the new car 2 tactical rifle in warzone solos for me lately have just been so hit and miss but there's no greater feeling in war zone than pulling off a solo victory after getting your butt cheeks handed to you game after game but we do get a solo victory in this video and the redemption arc is enough to make a grown man cry but the games i had prior to finally winning couldn't have been that bad right holy what was that no way look at this guy double claymore who plays like that now my voice rarely gets that high so you can tell that i was frustrated after what i just witnessed but that wasn't the only game that ended in frustration oh no let me show you another example so this match starts off like any other pick up my first kill grab a satchel and buy my loadout i selected my loadout when all of a sudden i heard a stun grenade go off behind me i checked my heartbeat and sure enough this guy wants a fight i pick the left side and he slides right into my arms one enemy down and killed before he can sell fresh i recover from the fight and find myself a big bertha my free loadout has now dropped in so i wanted to go and get high alert when i suddenly spot this guy i noticed he had an ffr so i jumped out the truck and hit him with a drop shot it's a dirty tactic i know but it was enough to throw him off after grabbing hilah i roll up on this building knowing that i'm being hunted by someone nearby a c4 gets thrown and detonated by this guy and i jump out the truck to try and take the fight i figured i could use the truck to jump through this window but nope game design doesn't allow it and i get beaten by a common ground luke street sweeper with stopping power i'm laughing to hide the pain and thankfully i get a second chance with my gulag and i win the fight and get sent back to the front line i didn't want to waste any time so i went back to my place of death picked up my loadout and got back in the truck but the guy just wouldn't let me leave would he so i got out of the truck and now there's some distance between us i take him out with the car 98 and prove to this guy why you should never 1v1 me on rust the match progresses and i haven't fought or seen anyone in a while when i suddenly get shot from behind and an enemy tries to throw a thermite grenade at my truck well i'm not having any of it so i jump out of the truck and with some decent tree cover between us and the khan i ate in my hands i take a shot and break his armor i miss the follow up shot and he takes cover behind some rocks a few seconds pass as he tries to play out before repositioning and i desperately try to find an angle missing my next two shots then i hear this sound my ears are now ringing and i've been paralyzed by not one but two stun grenades i hug this tree for dear life but it's simply too late oh well at least i died fairly and had a solid chance at winning that gun fight let's see how i reacted to that one what am i supposed to do in that situation this game is gonna give me a [ __ ] aneurysm whoa dude someone hasn't had their way your picks this morning if you watch my videos enough you know that it takes a lot to get under my skin so just imagine the number of games i had to play before i got the win if you can't accept me at my worst then you don't deserve me at my best so join me on this journey won't you do me a favor and leave a like for the algorithm and subscribe for more warzone content enjoy the gameplay and i will catch you legends in the next one okay start this off right i want my loadout 176 meters away i'm getting that truck maybe if i side shoot oh yeah easy oh hang on what's going on over here what are you shooting at you're about to become roadkill my friend maybe not oh no i've been shot from two different angles street sweeper and the gulag gun so stupid right let's finish this contract finally grab my satchel wait is my truck still over there what happened here then that's one body it's got swiss there as well and this is two bodies here well i'm certainly not gonna question it i'm getting the hell out of here okay looks like this is the only loadout here which is nice that means that there's no one in my vicinity so take my loadout all right give me that bounty is this it yeah objective right next to me he's in a truck as well what are you doing oh he's not even in it hey well come on then if you want to snipe off oh wait are you going there fast oh you don't oh almost had me what was that okay i'm not letting you sell fresh way to uav i think i've seen that before what are the chances this guy's landed where he died i'd say the chances are pretty freaking high he's got no grenades he can use against me so well you can throw a stun grenade but it's not gonna do much to me oh no no no okay he's escaped if he really wants to play this game why is he stopping all right i respect it it's kind of annoying doesn't peak for any longer than a millisecond get out of my game you're nothing did i just see a sniper glint i think i did whiff i whiffed it it's in the building no there you are it's not bad you know this car build way better than the range build i tried this one you can actually play for the weapons strengths fire rate on that titanium barrel as well actually makes the gun competitive at close to medium range okay have this bouncy get back in the truck i'll drive and get into the zone maybe even fight this guy if we can find him hang on that's precarious looking quad bike i knew it to you what are you doing huh nice to meet you sorry that was terrible i can't wait to try out the ballistic knife in war zone when do we get that forget the carve rifle i need me a ballistic knife let's restock on plates and put this trophy system on my truck oh this thing rolled some distance away didn't it enemy uav overhead really recons on lines cancel all that enemies uav go back for that play box oh he's seen me i might just leave it he might have a good shot on him i don't want to get sniped trying to get in that building see if we can fly him on this hill well he's at a disadvantage now i think he's buying more plates oh no we've gone critical but we've got the down and there's the finish nice take this vehicle into the zone goodbye truck been good to me are upgrading to a more robust vehicle all right not a bad game so far six kills on the board let's take this by station don't trust that building yeah i knew it dude [Applause] come on there it is i would have liked to use the car there but i never would have downed him he was jiggle peeking too much contract expired friendly recons online two enemies without ghosts maybe more closer she'll get my high alert class might as well haven't had my second loadout yet friendly loadout thank you getting nervous now no oh my god i've got double sniper now not like this panic soldier oh wait would be you in it should i just push him i'm trying to get his loot back won't he oh no gas is closing in relocating the safe zone oh he must have saw my shadow or something that silence is so easily abused man targets remain so broken all right nine people left well enemies to kill i don't know whether i should take the vehicle or not i'd be safer on foot i'll drive really don't like this end circle wait let me buy cluster strike could win us the game i'd like to drive all right oh wait there's a truck please don't be a trap i can drive good just waiting for a bouncing betty to go off as soon as i got in it should be a tight turn nice right now what do i do oh man i hate this someone just shoot at me you mad look at that guy what are you doing oh no i'm being shot i'll drive dude that guy has got massive balls absolute boulders on that man oh lee completely compromised his position in the zone someone else will get him i'm gonna try and get up here that's not gonna work is it all right it's just uh slowly does it let's just check all the rocks on the way down oh hidden enemies okay oh that's one way to get down snipe a shot to my right see if we can find this guy how in the open he's using that loadout for cover okay he's not this really is the most horrible end zone go over there are you fine you need a ride i'm always being sandwiched get in the back oh i'm so sorry what have i done please rate me five stars i was getting shot from up top as well i've got to leave him he's self-resist finish him other enemy please we can still learn to work together i gotta go play now and have to do it like inside the gas there's a guy there rightly above me with a sniper rifle and some sort of beamy gun a max probably okay this is it folks i like this oh that airstrike still in this he's not going to push me because of the clusters yes i did it well that was certainly a messy game but we prevailed oh my heart my heart is pounding i finally got a decent lobby after getting my ass kicked all day oh that feels good and with the new tactical rifle as well the car of t let's go i don't know how many kills actually got there like maybe five or six with it but that build works so much better with my play style just rips man you need to hit those shots so i find if you put the zoom scope on it any sort of zoom optic the more pronounced the recoil feels so that einstein build actually works really well i like that a lot it's not a p by any means but it's definitely a competitor at mid range [Music]
