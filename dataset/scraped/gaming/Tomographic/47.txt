dude what is this teleport ability that looks crazy okay so we do more damage with our car alliance uh uh mine's mine's the m24 i think i think it's different for everyone and then ultimately we can teleport and we get a tomahawk cool down on teleport so if you both just teleport behind them yeah yeah yeah these are them yeah it starts you in a smaller area so you don't play the whole map all all at the same time this is a 42 player lobby like it's capped at 42. oh we got to go to space center space center look at this there's a rocket ship oh space center oh we've got to go to space center that's what i'm saying i don't know i don't feel mad you guys play back oh it's like it's like orbital first yeah it's like battlefield dude it's just like battle oh my god i mean they do exist in the real world [ __ ] that's how they launch everything in everything that's the basic template of a rocket platform it's basically battlefield in the future man i can't believe they copied it huge i literally copied it they literally miss outsider there as well i'm going to land over with [ __ ] let's go nice there's another team with us to the left of us they're going straight in for the good
