there's more on the outside right now okay thanks i'm sorry if i offended you i'm very sorry he went i'm sorry if i offended you i'm very sorry warzone's new limited time game mode power grab is pure unadulterated chaos from start to finish you've got eliminations dog tags kill streak rewards fewer circles no loadouts no goo lag and a whole lot of action and to take a leaf out of rambo's book survival war you gotta become war yeah i'm sorry anyway season three reloaded actually feels like a really substantial update for warzone and personally i'm a huge fan of many of the new balance changes and reworks to attachments as well as the new nakatomi plaza building in downtown and it's just so cool that they've added this iconic building from the die hard franchise every level is so incredibly detailed and i mean the flanking opportunities in this building alone are just insane so gameplay today is with my good friends jack fraggs and hanler and this is our very first match playing the new power grab game mode together so i think you'll find it entertaining to learn this game mode along with us because we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into when we first queued up to play this mode i'm gonna leave you to enjoy the gameplay now but thank you very much for watching as always leave a like for the algorithm and subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one so is this there's some new contracts there then unfinished business so that's how you start the that's where the new thing is for the vault yeah they're always there that's how you start the vault contract uh which one do you want to go for uh blue let's go for the back one yeah never mind i don't know which one's gonna be more contested at this stage oh you start with the milano uh yeah apparently you come back with the weapons you had oh man there's so many vlogs a lot of people yeah it's already gone oh what the hell that one jesus i think we should get a respawn i mean there's so many dog tags there what the hell yeah we gotta respawn okay dude they're all gone you spawn with full armor oh yeah yeah yeah the dog tags if you run over them you get all of your place back well there's one here whoa i'm super speedy yeah like it's like shield swapping in apex okay oh it's is it like cranked where you move faster as you get killed yeah yeah okay it gave you a uav as well stodd was saying what you should do is fight around a dog tag and then when you're getting hit by the enemy you can just run through it and get all your health mid fight are you doing it there son i just killed a man there's a die hard poster i still only have the milano oh yeah i see is there a guy right in front of me here tom i think he's up top somewhere there's an actual die hard here as well but they're underneath what they glitched under the map or something oh i'm in the parking garage and it is very hectic in here another one oh he's low time i want to push in in the building wait there's bots in this yeah really i'm killing henchmen or something what oh i'm in the basement right now and there's a bunch of bots i don't actually know what you get from grabbing that dog tag jack i think it's a respawn you see your tokens on the right hand side above all the kill streaks oh my god yeah it's a christmas tree look this is very i bet i was frying these guys and i'm like wait a minute those aren't real players i literally bought there is a christmas tree i mean it doesn't feel very christmasy in may i have to be i mean it's come on jack die hard it's a christmas movie yeah well is it it's the biggest debate ever of course i gotta put that in there as an easter egg should we go to the top of the tower uh i don't want to climb this ladder but i'm gonna do it anyway this one here i'm going up oh right okay this goes all the way to the oh my god i'll cluster it close to the top so how can we get handler back in the game uh i did not know there was a set um yeah he hasn't unlocked the respawn name oh there's a guy didn't even realize this is cool man this is like a really elaborate it's cavernous isn't it bad design they've done a really good job i've got nowhere i don't know where i'm going or you can't get loadouts in this mode though jack okay you can only use groundling i don't know jack uh it's okay i mean it's a bit chaotic right are you fighting people um there were some people up here how to get to you i was a staircase oh there's a whole new level here a whole new level i don't want to just throw it down but on the rooftop so how accurate do you think this is to the movie because i haven't seen it in ages yeah i haven't seen any ages i was probably like 16 last time i'm sorry heavy weapon drop yeah what's that about yeah so that'll be like a minigun or oh we can get up there tom look there's one on the roof i don't know where the stairs are jack yeah right here on there okay be careful there's people running around um is that a minigun then or something i mean i don't actually know it just sounds like it might be because they're out at the moment now so oh my god this place isn't his enemies up there absolute maze dude i don't good cover you were right about this game being complicated you got a respawn jack uh yeah that's the first time i died guys that crate is still at the very top i don't know how i get respawns back dude i just slid after you using those speed boots and i've went for miles can i grab that now oh my god okay that one takes ages to open so i imagine there's something good in this although the zone is coming it's a grenade launcher and a ppas is unfortunate oh disappointment careful jack i hear lots of steps an artillery marker that's okay well that's something i can't shut this door it's permanently open have you seen it here jack hold on sorry i've just artilleried this thing that's all right how big is this artillery gonna be what do you say tom this look it's a fan oh god gasps that must be in the movie yeah it must be the steps oh jake is really good he was shooting the minigun whilst pound i got it that was odd you're the unlimited gas mask there's a guy here tonight yeah this killstreak system is so weird oh get on a building or something jack i'm trying to find him they've got voice lines from the movie for these characters yeah i don't think it's being dubbed like redone by other voice actors [Applause] okay try to find a way to uh buy ryan in so there's literally no way we can get ryan back we can buy him this the buy stations and there was a a thing that dropped at some point that we missed that was called a respawn drop right so i guess if we capture that it brings whoever's down back okay but that's just a theory i'll get this scout yeah i guess supply box location that's right where they are though up here i think i just rest yeah my guns are kind of awful as well wait i've got three guns yeah i've just realized that double tap one yeah you can carry four i think huh good oh god nice that's ruinous uh highlight from the left jack here i've got super speed don't worry i don't know ammo with my uh thing anymore just unlock that by killing yeah it gave me a precision airstrike and i feel like they're testing stuff you know this is this is too much in a mode isn't it yeah i wonder if we'll get any of this in the main vr eventually well like i don't know like their tokens just randomly find some tokens yeah advanced uav is lasting very long right now didn't they used to exist jack do you remember dog attacks being a thing like there's like a picture of it ages ago maybe that's the specialist token i'm thinking of specialists was in the easter egg bunker right yeah the juggernaut rooms i don't okay overdrive the dog tags gave me overdrive and i can run really fast and slide like a crazy person what forever oh look i stopped you'll see it when you pick one up there's a little uh circle that pops up at the bottom of your screen it's on a timer but if you chain it if you keep getting kills it'll stay this is crazy this is the weapon wait no it's a loadout box i thought it was just going to be like the little drone thing that flies in oh my god that's a respawn token though right what did that do oh it gives you a golden gun oh gosh back out of the truck what was the token we got from him okay so confirmed the crates will kill you now yeah that's that's that's something that is back i guess there's no snipers in this mode i feel so naked oh no i can't believe that i'm so sorry yeah let's play that on jack's placement of the drop it was right through it just sudoku for so long we finally bring him back and that's the first action he does yo what has happened here it's so bored this has been broken for the since the colder integration this lads dropping it yeah there's people up on the array as well i've got a specialist so i can see his steps right now there you go buddy he was just trying to direct me to kill him what's that i'm behind there you go buddy what the hell i enjoyed it might be someone in there there's people down here as well should we have a go look there's loads dude they've got a minigun or something yes you ask queen one down here tom ammo box down dude you're good go ahead sell fries yes okay i'm coming to get you yeah i don't like sylvester stallone speaking to me it's weird was that sylvester yeah nothing like him it didn't sound like him i think it's just from the movie and it's just bad quality because it's from the 80s i'm coming oh my god you could slide forever yeah have a limited gas mask pretty much i'm going to use this one okay i mean you do have 14 000 basically so it just feels like a safer option you know it's weird having this many guns i actually don't know how many ticks this is gonna give you two pharah the grenade launcher and the ppsh i'm out here to buy another gas mask you tommy lasts like 30 seconds i can't buy you kidding tom please can't die what do you mean it doesn't let you buy i'll take them right i guess we'll go to this one no no no no no don't kill me don't come with me don't come here oh my god oh thank you oh my god one hp in a dream yes jack right well he's dead i think i've gone a long way around and brew myself guy in the building right here tom all right okay [Applause] are you trying to get to the bite on i don't know if we can right now how do i zoom in in cold war v and j of course with pain i guess nice sniped this guy's above on array yeah so i mean are we gonna be able to use the spy station i think we should at least oh where did that come from yeah it was an airstrike yeah i didn't get the warning can i rest okay okay i think i'm safe tom okay as long as they don't kill you you'll be fine right okay i'll have the sound of that dog tag just dropped down from the sky and his body yo they got a minigun up there it's not great though is it in war zones i mean [Applause] yeah i think you have one more no no no this one is crazy not like this it's absolutely madness dude survive tom survive so i should respawn with everything that i had yeah yeah i'm down oh my god they're safe you back jack yeah i'm back okay this guy self fred is going to finish me so many guys where i am geez minigun grenade launcher that's it for respawns it's all on you i don't want it to be all on me you know why is my heart rate increased in real life or in real life i don't know i mean is this a stressful environment for you uh-huh i thought that was yes this guy's running on the uh the flower platform jack it's directly below you is it yeah yeah on that round turn around a bit a bit more to the right there he is roughly one grenade left now he's dead one handed jump in on you oh my god we're in an action movie now yeah to the chopper what's the chopper do oh you have to get on to it no you have to go go go exfil look the cap that flag an expert that is serious mode either kill everyone or stay well how many people are left yeah you've got the minigun i think you just wait watch him try and cap you're good building there what if it's a super quick x-fil like really fast yeah like the gulag flag or uh maybe you play roe jack no oh yeah bring the police to him yeah yeah it's like that isn't it it's a race to the hellen extract okay so that's out of ammo enemy soldier incoming are you serious you got any streaks left or no i've got nothing no i've got a mini gun and a dream captain he's capping it oh my god oh man yes right oh god i don't know i don't know might get me get onto the table this is not a drill yeah i've got that advanced gas mask though i can yeah that's a good idea actually yeah you're staying the gas phase oh my god this is really really freaky you can see when the cabin is the bar above the hurley bring it home jack okay yes get down let's go jack go go the other guys are so friends i think no no you're good get on the heli wait there's still three enemies yeah what the hell i don't know where they are what they're using their gas masks i don't know are they like i guess i'll just stay and hope i get it unless they're in the heli waiting for you to let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go could be in the oh my god what the hell man that was fun but i don't know if it was like it was just just chilling next to you that's the weirdest game mode ever it's not war zone yeah it does feel like something new that doesn't it's a lot going on though my god my brain is just completely frazzled right now um do you want to try and i don't know i think yeah i don't know if i can do another one of those straight away [Music] [Music] you
