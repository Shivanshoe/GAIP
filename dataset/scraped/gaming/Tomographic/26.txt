hey hello everyone welcome back to ready or not it's been a while since we played this game um last time i was checking the game out single player but today we've got the boys you can't see them right now i think they're downstairs trying to shoot me playing with jack in store today so it'll be a good um good laugh for a couple of hours there's some new content that i haven't checked out since the last time i played there was like a new map uh which one was it brisa cove so this one we haven't played yet there's a couple of test levels which you'll probably avoid just because they're like blocked out and you can't really there's no textures for him uh but there have been some new weapons i've also got the usp in my hands right now one of my favorite guns from modern warfare 2. and the thumbnail wasn't a lie they have indeed added a a goddamn grenade launcher to this game um this is actually a primary weapon it doesn't go in the gadget slot like some of the other ones do but this is flashbangs only you can't like you can't kill people with this unless you hit them directly with a flash grenade because it's got the uh it's definitely got the uh the velocity to do that um i'll go downstairs and test that in a second but i'll show you here as well they've also got the where is it uh long tactical the m320 which is the stinger um version i think it takes a while to load these when you select so ignore the black screen for a second but i hope you are doing well i was going to make a couple of videos for the content but like i figured there's quite a bit i need to cover and instead of like splitting this into a bunch of different videos i'll uh i'll give the people what they want and that is more live streams from me apparently um but yeah you will all recognize this one bf3 this was in um really good fun these uh yeah i'm gonna unmute now i'll chat with the lads um and then we'll get into all the content there's we're actually playing with mods as well today so i'm gonna be moving around a bit faster i've got the guys to install a mod that basically makes you move slightly quicker because the game you do move around very slow so the pacing will be a bit more a bit more fast it's not like cod levels are you know running around like hooligans um but we're also playing with a mod that uh it's obviously got the movement if you get shot on the legs as well i think you go really slow and then there is a new map that i've got the guys to download which is a fan made map i guess uh with full custom assets so that would be fun to check out and they got a little run around it earlier the guy's done a really good job so wow say hello guys hi guys i'm gonna kill this innocent civilian with the stinger nade just found the tesseract that'll do it that's the flashbang one he's been flashbanged i'm dead i think i i think i got here in the head i'm not sure i'm pretty sure if my direct impact with this thing it will definitely kill you press after wear hat what oh jack you're in the firing range no i'm in the first one downstairs so am i wearing like a oh am i wearing a blue hat oh uh yeah you are but it's on the top of your helmet can i take it

absolute massacre did we kill all the sieves or what happened um i don't remember what happened here i'm just trying to bag the weapons there's going to be a lot of guns we miss out on which is annoying because you well well then somewhere was there a trap on that door what happened yeah i completely forgot the advice i gave jack two seconds earlier i mean am i done now what's going on um yeah you're deemed don't stand a chance no i mean um try and find like a new room make sure the guns are bagged someone maybe you can yeah can you bag my gun you don't need to hold it yeah i bought

haven't rescued all the civilians ah many of them have died okay well let's have a look then so you need to find the right okay there's actually quite a big list here maybe we just maybe just reset do you want to start maybe we just put some c4 on this wall uh no you can't do that you can blow up on a door it has to like find it find a non-breach to door unless that one does close the door and then breach it have you done it um yeah i can't keep oh yeah it's it's been i think this door's been broken already because i kicked in okay that steps too right that just sounds like steps somewhere but it doesn't sound all right all right well we'll just reset how do we reset i'm doing it now i could trap wiser that's allowed oh yeah we need to drop our cam lights that's a good good shout chat um so when you clear the room start i don't know what your thing's bound to but this will like wow that what what the physics on that was a bit weird maybe it's control for you okay round two we're taking it seriously there you go you've got it seriousness there's a staircase here what we're a different spawn here or did we just miss this i scared the life army we've got a full swat team downstairs hold on guys guys guys guys everything no hold on invincible there's a guy with a gun in the room just to the so you open the door you do what i did open the door hold on hold on hold on so basically has he got a gun i can see there's someone in there i can't tell he's got a gunny i can see his right hand are all the gunman right-handed i don't know maybe go in there i can't tell if he's got a gun or not you have to make the case oh yeah that's that's the sacrifice that being an operator that's the sacrifice you make for 1440p and 4k streams on youtube there's no better stringing platform to get the uh the content out to you know it's good for me to stream directly to my audience i think and especially because quality means so much to me just a bit weird like that uh what was i reading lost quite looks great to me yeah good yeah exactly high quality i'll take 4040p streams over 1080p horrible bitrate on twitch like i can stream at 12k bitrate here it probably means nothing to a lot of you but that's that's just not not possible on twitch all right here we go that's right then i'm going to arrest him oh it was the same civilian again was it it's good good right i'll just start check this door right check in the door now all right everything will be okay reported okay the door is not booby trapped keep it up you didn't eat anything are you muted not me thank you oh yeah yeah yeah thank you okay um no one to the right i don't see yeah i don't see anyone okay you're going loud are we in this gap yeah i mean they know we're coming your flash thought i heard a footstep which i've got flash i can i can flash oh you both just switched your weapons seven times god that would be the right thing in the crap okay moving in right clear that's all we're clear oh movement movement far right he peeked it and then ran flashing that corner okay did they have guns one of them didn't have a gun top he actually used i think he you yeah use the hostage that's great really use the hostage as a meat shield i guess did you get him still i mean he's dead we're not gonna save all the hostages this time it's very dark i don't know how you're supposed to see me it's quite dark i've got night vision how do you do night vision security you have to bring it you have to equip it you guys i can't check that right just yet okay i'm holding the doorway now yeah zipped up and ready to go zip on boys oh yeah just walk close enough and uh cut cut with scissors come on here we go trap darn it garnet got it disarmed so steps to the left you got your gun yeah there's no door to the oh the other left they opened it he had a nice civilian a knife if they open a door like that it's usually always i mean i took the initiative there to save my boy from getting stabbed all right yeah so if someone opens the door shoot him immediately if you're going to run at me you're going to die it's a it's a very erratic move from a from a sieve get on the ground okay uh mirror gun you need stodd okay yeah yeah can you not take your teammates loadout once they're crouching and walking now you can't very dark um i don't see a trap i'd still be able to see it yeah i don't see anyone in here okay if you peek the door the trap won't trigger us when you boot it down or open it fully yeah no wait yeah i know why i know why no one's on your side no no i don't think so okay could be something around this corner bathroom is it okay yes but another exit though lots of wine is that just go where we can um is that a different room i'm doing the loop around you'll see me in a second yeah you're on the other side of the store now store yeah yeah hello yeah yeah yeah bang there was a trap on that door and i just willingly opened it forget yeah okay that that short bathroom's clear another door here we've got mirror gun on it we have no traps oh wait is that oh that is a trap there is a trap on the other side of the saw it's just a line though i didn't see anything attached or anything there's a trap how does how do we do with it deploy enemy but i see how enemy with a gun behind that guy above your head he's literally using the civvy as a shield though so i can't do this take the shot fire a stinger in okay yeah yeah uh we might kill a sieve hang on maybe not opening the door trying to get the serve to get down i get a flash over him be all right great rebounded second one going in the door it's saying it's in it's in flash he's down he's down he's down is that the guy or is that the sieve still there the the enemy was the one in the the hives oh man i just shot him in the face above me is it he's looking at the end of the corridor keep your eyes on the hive this guy they can come out of a rest mode like they will just grab their knife or gun again and go ham i think there's someone on the other side of this door i'm not sure oh there's a lot of blood from the guys shot in the face uh a gun here casper thanks so much for uh becoming a member man i appreciate it thomas stream go on then writer franklin thank you man i appreciate tuning in oh your jack you get him he had a sword off he was about to blaspheme my way so what's that what's the point what's the map yeah can you mirror gun this door in front of the circle uh there's a guy doesn't look like he has a weapon it's a sieve on the other side of this door yeah there's no there's nothing there's no trap on this door but there's a sieve on the other side but we can carry the sieve away from you first pick them up from the front to get down for your glass nice oh good jack he's got an angle on him yeah kind of see through it here i think there's anyone in there you know yeah there was just one guy there you don't know if this guy's armed uh well no he's he hasn't got anything on him down on the ground as well okay there's any more all right apprehending suspect inside [Music] oh it's not working no shame i really want to play all this oh there's a door there yeah drop your cam lights in the rooms we've been in it also gives you some light starting to do that like that like obviously you don't have a flashlight so uh is there a trap no okay there is a man there i'll get flashing then he's down on the ground now what's in moving in yeah i'm covering her back they might come and sneak up one in here in the room on the right side right side i don't know if i got him yeah there's a guy with a gun oh i got a civilian i think no one in the small room still in there doing that i am i'm throwing flashbangs you got flashdodge uh yeah i do flush it full of jumpscares uh so we need to find uh locate rifle in room king locate marksman rifle following room queen arrest three suspects at the scene in progress these are like gun cases they've been killing a lot of the suspects instead of arresting because he goes he's a he's an m16 yeah that's it that's it that's the king one done now we need the queen one what's on the telly open fire um teletubbies i can't tell sweet our coverage is what we now believe is this the queen response to the reason it's an epic exclusive or something that's the epic logo isn't it we're aiming to finalize cops it says one there's nothing oh that's not the problem at least three oh no no i meant like there's some sort of exclusivity with them uh we are heroes we died whilst you all got fat and rich you greedy and to add on top of that ops that that's what the game said um queen room i don't know where we're gonna have we maybe it's adjacent yeah that would make sense i don't know i think i'm in the room that you're trying to go into we need a rifle uh no this isn't this is like a suite oh here's the queen room is it not i thought it might be this locate marksman rifle a sniper on the northern side of the building has killed two officers in an injured three civilians locate the rifle in queen room i've got an enemy here in front of me going surrender nice nice uh we can't i can't see where you are jack team comes yeah i'm looking oh my god he slashed me shh did he come out of that stance did he do that yeah yeah it's crazy god that was a proper jump scare that yeah if you're not quick enough they can just grab their like gun or knife and just turn on you in an instant you actually get yourself oh yeah he nearly killed me back i'm back in the shotgun start the mirror on the door to jax right roger trailers oh there is a guy and i think he's got a gun um yeah it looks like he's holding now come out and go to the door oh there's a trap here hang on come on that room the way you came um yeah i'm pretty sure he's trying to hang on disarming trap so yeah this should lead into the same room if you just married on this as well yeah just one guy literally um where i'm facing he's literally opposite the door okay you ready you got an angle on it yeah yeah it was fast nice good you almost killed me you almost got me is that the last suspect i mean this isn't the queen this is like a laundry room i think that's all the suspects killed yeah we have a compass we don't do we no so it said on the north side of the building it's killed two officers and injured oh there was a room that we didn't kill we didn't know if we killed those civilians still remember yeah do you think maybe it's just there that's the bathroom no no there was like a gun on the floor there's a random room where we walked in and we were like did we do this that was the last round that wasn't this round i don't know if that i went through here and i couldn't see anything that looked like a queen room there's a good dead guy on the floor there's this door here oh no it's just gonna be a larger bed isn't it green rooms are smaller then uh did you just close the door oh did you just close the store i closed the door yeah that's a that's

i crashed again i think oh not that one yeah me too i just actually can maybe restart the lobby because it's yeah it'll be the lobby um because my menu do you wanna host jack whatever yeah try hosting good play click public lobby might just be a bug that i'm having because whenever i have the uh i load up with the grenade launcher thing just has like a black screen forever and then finally puts me in all right so jack's in the pre-game lobby oh that's really easy to join just clicking the bottom right here like uh what you're saying chat hk416 okay i want to try the house k416 yeah it's good i have the mk1 carbine which is the variant of that so i use that one because it's all black well you get different sites depending on the weapon you use well you bought the supporter edition right stud yeah yeah so select the mk1 carbine below it if you prefer the look of it i mean it's it's the same gun same properties it's just the support edition version of i want the clearest sight picture the srs good i like the holo and i like the micro t2 it's like a circle sight yeah might be the micro i'll try that it's quite hard to see [Music] compressor angled grip this screen takes forever man whenever i change my weapon weird hold on i'll see if this is a good sight um it got crash again black screen wait just way out yeah there's something going on with the um when you select a loadout because that's when you crash both times you said i was in i was just gonna enter that and i guess maybe because it took me so long the game was like oh thomas disconnected now you've disconnected he disconnected then i hate i hate that site it's horrible which side the hollow to micro t2 oh no no not the micro one do the not the microphone um there's another one that the oh no i hate the way i have to go all the way downstairs to do what to see uh what looks good all right to win our site you can run away with my ear load up there yeah oh this is nice yeah that's nice [Music] it was the fourth one for me i really like this scope actually i don't know if i'd use it but it's not as zoomed in as i thought it would be there's one called the sdr one to four x you can toggle it uh srs is the one i was talking about stored that you'd like it's kind of like the holo but it's clean if that's what you're after yeah it might not be on well it will be on the gun if you're using the same one as me how do i i find it weird that you can't just change the gun here you can modify your gun here but you can't change the look well here sword oh hey oh yeah the srs that's what i'm using it's what feels good looks mental though all right i'll do the holo you've got your mvg's on yeah yeah put on the um the mvg laser sight as well jack i've just got laser pointer is that another one no there's a there's an mpg version no laser yeah yeah mult ir laser my laser done start your laser on stud uh no i gotta go to the weapon table for the island for a night we're gonna do a night vision raid okay is it is it not the malt ir ir laser or the laser pointer laser pointer is just hit fire iron laser is when your ads it puts your weapon out of slant yes yes um got that gone got that got that don't think i've got npgs equipped hopefully there's nothing like the game no i don't know it doesn't it how do i turn it on wedge flashbang gym game uh x maybe should tell you in the bottom left what your keybinds are does it tell you kind of it's just oh i think i've changed the button yeah it might be unbound let's come to the table when you're ready uh we'll do the trolls rainy level that mean jack

pug juice oh yeah do you hear that oh yeah a bit of asmr also uh go to your settings go to this update for the graphics nvg display you can select white for now instead of green options graphics you can do white phosphor mvgs instead of green i like the green ones tom i'll put the green ones on then it's nostalgic i do prefer the green actually it's just something you can do now i mean i think the white one's definitely clearer but this one is just your nostalgia isn't it my gun doesn't turn sideways when i ads um maybe that wasn't a thing and i was lying have you got the laser on okay yeah i'm lying i think yeah good there's a man down the end there yeah i see that uh he just he's dropped already yeah i don't know what happened to him he like teleported to me okay he goes easily he's

oh that's that's where we started isn't it no oh my he's so fearless about these tracks could have called both of us yeah but okay peek wouldn't kill it yeah he couldn't kill it no you're right but it could have been an outwards-facing trap and could have just walked over a while without knowing because it wouldn't have set the door off think about that think about this oh yes this is the place jack yeah i remember this it started with this yeah remember that hear this it's completely clean understanding wait let me use that um these puddles look so good now what the hell yeah the way rain

homes yes and so on does it look like the map raid or barricaded suspect let's try barricaded suspects team's number one priority is rescuing civilians rules of engagement are stripped don't kill unless an officer or civilian surround we can't even shoot until they shoot us basically we're an actual swat team now why have you pinned me against the wall how dare jack drinks the weird juice in

successful there that first yeah a good one enemy entrance done and dead one enemy let's go guys let's go okay so this house the one that's currently uh being fumigated circus done yeah the interior is completely changed oh you do have the jeez you want now everyone it is a bit scary can be people outside it too i'm just gonna check this right side first are you looking through the sights of your gun jack or is it have you got it sideways no you don't you don't i thought that was a thing but i think it maybe it's an attachment i'm not sure well that's the modern warfare clean house mission isn't it uh is there a wire on that like no it takes a couple of kicks it can be in the garden in the back there so we're going through the side entrance this room's a bit bigger than it used to be it used to be just like a little short storage room watching the right it's clear okay uh let's go through the front door breach with the c2 charge you've got one have you started yeah yeah or breach then we can hold the angle okay level six going lead lead going loud aiming at the door um i don't think he did it uh back away back away oh i don't think a dick went down all right you're supposed to send yourself down the street that front area where the blue tarpaulin is used to be open and now they've blocked off uh mirror gun right mirror going left okay there's a balcony here as well they're blocked on the right yeah he said help on that yeah jack shotgun left yeah shotgun left i'm going left go low oh a guy running with the gun okay i'm starting holding cover got him he's down i'm kicking this open could be one on the other side i think i'm yeah he's gone let's go with the gun guy storage room might find more meth in there right i know this is what is this it's a lab it's the lab isn't it but what are the is that math it's all in bags oh this is like the pre-done meg we've cleared this already everything's green what do you want to do upstairs or clear this floor all right

package rescue all civilians preston neutralize any contact at the scene oh you haven't opened this door yet uh no no it goes outside so there could be people in the garden i think we go through this

i've been reporting everyone yeah yeah yeah nice [Music] he's got a a knife oh no this has been very successful so far on the yeah i i did you can see it from the bottom floor you can actually see down the corridor from the bottom floor i think the meth is in this room on the right we should clear this one first though um it should be a corridor and a block there's a very dark corner on the right but i can't see anything and then there's a bathroom on the left i hate that i don't see anyone and let me just check the door is not baby trap no the door's not booby trap but i don't see anyone but they could be in the i can remember if you keep the door down i'll breach with a shotgun jack's got the angle right yeah i've got the angle on the left obviously bring the door don't hear anyone in here move in watching left i'm watching that right claire this is the door here though i'm just clear this is from spain yeah it should be a bathroom a bedroom and a bathroom with the camera um that's not a knife this is a knife got anything on them this is hard to see i can't actually see above the door but i think it's okay is the camera in night vision maybe maybe maybe shotgun that shotgun that door because i can't see if there's anything you're right there jack yeah yeah gone there's no kick it now there's no trap there's another door there's nothing yeah that's a bathroom at

a problem yeah because i can i couldn't sleep there's a new attic that they've added ah god is that why it's scary and it's horrid yeah let me just have a look at oh god what's this it's just that's the connecting bridge between the house and stuff get on the ground flashing directly upwards go go go one down nice sounds good old hold do you want me to throw another flash uh yeah try and get it

bedroom it's very dark yeah you know this i can actually see in there okay there's a guy with a gun in the back room so when you go through there's a there's a door and then uh definitely an enemy yeah oh yeah yeah he's got a gun tell me though exactly basically you walk in yeah there's a room and then there's a door just off center to the left and he's through that door and he's uh he's looking is he stood in the doorway not in the doorways he's in the back of the room through the door tell me if these shots are close uh the first shot was closed please move now you're going towards just walking towards the door he can't open it or jammed this guy did he rush you yeah when you started yeah so he tried i wedged that door i think jack's just removed the wedge yeah i did um oh my god there's a horrible face on the other door so we can open it like we've got the door handle becky max checky mags this guy that we um this guy that we arrested is like edging around with it yeah i just want to clear this down level okay what was that beep we'll clear this last i just want to make sure this first round should we clear jack thing uh the beep might have been an alarm on the door to alert i think we're it's pretty obvious we're here now doesn't sound like there's anyone here go check these coins the kids room that's creepy as hell there's no one in here though okay i'm gonna peak this door let's move the steps or steps 100 to the left i'm watching your door tom to play the k's room it's uh there's no one in here okay i'm gonna kick this you ready jack there's another door there's another door i see him i see him he's at the bookshelf to the left jack 30 degrees if you flash in he's just stood there behind the bookshelf he right bookshelf go go go the room next door is empty there should be oh wow the lighting effect yeah look at this little projector as well where's the projector on the scene projecting the lights isn't it the shapes i see i see the light i just

don't watch this for now uh no no no no no damn it i threw that flashbang go now oh my god i've pushed the room back dude that was so weird it was like a quick quick equipped wedge so i clicked left and i just you don't want to flash out my hands all right so there might be someone to the right here but no that's clear i'll check the door again okay there's no trap uh the room's empty i bet there's another door to there how is this how is this as uh stream content chat you enjoying it does it work as a stream game i figured you'd want to see a lot of the down time because i usually cut it all out in my videos but like part of the planning in this game is what makes it so entertaining it's a very dark room all right good trap on the door there's this door too though isn't it there's not been any traps so far bang um this one looks empty but there could be someone hiding to the left in here okay let's let's clear these this short the short room because this this connects there's a door here this one oh geez they usually sit right behind that there's no it's like see there's no trap you might want to shotgun it jack have you got a preaching shotgun yeah yeah you breached right left both of these there's no there's nothing to the right there's nothing to the right it's just the left you just watch out for yeah but stop you take the corner i'm in stand here yeah and then

is it two rooms on the right one on the left there's there's a room either side but we can just open it there might be a second room well there is check the right is there two doors one there's a door to the right and the door to the left they're both but is there another door on the right hand side uh door open yeah cause they it runs out of there sometimes i don't know if they've changed that with this update yeah well he could be in that right hand okay if you want me to cover the door hold left angle i'll breach three two one okay wait no one at the door no one in the door yet okay no he's on the right well he might be we don't know if there's someone there i'm gonna fly okay yeah nice i'm actually out the right the right oh yeah okay no he didn't go in he [Applause] [Music] i think it was in this left door here watch out yeah i was blind oh okay mirror left i think there's someone in there hold on hold on jesus man right the thing so he's not got his hands down by his sides but i can't see if he's got a gun or not but if you shoot should he okay so he's to the right side of the door he's literally he might he might react i'm gonna shoot ceiling ceiling okay he said i have to ditch soon get now i can blow the door and look through the mirror guns when i shoot you looking yeah does it really happen no he's just standing there i have to ditch soon that's not something the civvy would say is it no i'll give you the angle okay he's literally right there yeah yeah i mean you killed him yeah you had to go look tech nine ask it i have to ditch soon is not something a hostage says when they're trapped in the room i'm gonna get out of here man all right let's go now okay i'm going all the way through there oh my god i'm gone it's the last room careful left okay okay okay we're cleared are we clear there's some sort of weird look age of end mission gg that was really good that was fun it's not even uh didn't he cut the wire of a trap in this raid no no okay all right hey john it's not a single pager are we done is it definitely not yeah we've done it the only thing we failed was rescuing all the civilians i think that's my favorite map in terms of like intensity and the route you have to go you can go like several routes through that but 26 minutes yeah it flies by i should try the um mod one yeah friendly fire e e for excellent all right bring us with you jack did he do it correctly yeah he did oh my god new gun i've got 10 000 sensitivity um mk16 hey blanky thank you thank you blank for becoming a member hi ben how are you doing my guy so much hunt to get good content i feel like this game is just awesome smg over anything else um yeah rate of fire depends on the mission obviously it's obviously a lot quieter as well so you don't get hurt um i didn't know this weapon bench was here it's got mp5 are we going for another night mission really wants to use this but it's just a flash cannon you know what i don't think it's like an interior thing sod well it's like in a building this mission can take not at night no it's not night it's still worth having night vision i guess i'll be the flashbang uh flashlight might be better actually oh yeah well i don't have a yeah i'll take a flashlight i don't have um [Music] infrared on this mp5 why do i lose so much fps in this menu that's mad that's mad oh that's a nice sight um wait for it the black screen of doom might be one of the mods conflicting with the game what guns are you guys using shotgun jack i wish the attachments actually told you what they did well it's i think it's like the angled ones are just more ergonomic so like there's two for the muzzle on the show so so angle is horizontal and vertical is vertical no you can't get uh underbarrel on the shotgun it's just a 12 ga break a choke will be a tighter shot right i think so then what the break does steli access it they might have had it not in the description yet um i don't need a red dot sign for a shotgun david garcia becoming a member as well thank you man good to see you david didn't you hold a stop sign up with my logo on it in my birthday video i think into the right david um [Music] i want to use a different gun i'm going to use a submachine gun mp5 let's do it this exit menu takes a long time now yes if you join us late we've installed a couple of mods so i've got a movement mod so you you generally move around a bit faster usually it makes you play really slow ready yeah we're going to do the um the customer right now yeah yeah but i'm right is it night time or daytime it's uh yeah it's daytime it's inside an office building so i don't know i'll take it i'll take a flash raid again or barricaded suspect uh i'd say i don't know suspects is considered normal hardest seems to be more like an open raid then yeah because some some areas get cut off in barricaded i think i want an underbarrel because it ruins a look at the mp5 yes look at the ballistic mask have you got goggles as well i don't have goggles i don't know um goggles from it should be have you got the combat uniform on stored i don't know go to the mirror to the left of me [Music] and customize your character um you can't you can no oh you have to stand like a little bit away i've gotta use irons with the mp5 haven't i coming upstairs okay covering covering actually before do that you're gonna throw nados are you gonna do something i'm just flashing this poor soul been flashbanged i know it's been banged all right uh have you got the right one selected jacker yep let's go let's take an mp5 pretty naked naked without clothes um because it looks way better you got nvgs on somewhere oh god oh god oh god stop don't stop this stop this at once mpgs go for anti-flash goggles oh my god they have my glasses

my way oh you're drinking it you're drinking it you're drinking it okay um delicious coffee all right selecting mission can't believe it's not coffee bottom right confirm okay come on guys right right right and oh no why is that saying minus five doesn't seem to be working as planned i'll mark that as completed then it's completely cheers for playing there guys that was fun it was nice it was great really enjoyed some good moments there hello yeah the little um clown house was great oh yeah i'm making us it wasn't a clown house oh what no no it's it was other fumigations because we were in it right yeah we've turned into a glass all right i've got a full swat team with me now that i can command so this is a good way to demonstrate the game a single player become all stacked unit gg toy yeah we'll catch you soon it's me you and five ai uh combatants so this is a um this isn't one of the maps uh in the game i now command this whole unit uh this is a a modded map which is why we're having some issues playing together there there's obviously something going wrong um i'll get this guy to open the door go uh breach getting to kick that down clear so this has been uh custom made by a modder it was their first time making a map on unreal engine and they've made all of these assets custom not one asset you see is uh [Music] is there any other any of the other maps which is really cool really like high quality textures too he's done a great job look at that keyboard that is the most high-res keyboard i think i've ever seen in a video game that's the most high-res chair i think i've ever seen in a video game i'll drop a camera as well clear moving on see i think he's done a really good job this is one of the more popular modded maps of uh get down just don't lady shoot all right put some shoes on make them secure wait you're not serious right it's feeling comfortable he's got a door trailer cycle cameras yeah so you can't play this single player it's obviously way way more difficult when you've got like command several other has he only just seen that guy uh we'll we'll check this we'll check this door first i don't have a mirror gun though so hopefully one of these guys do um open play with flashbangs and i can select which of the you can see two of them are highlighted in red and two of them highlighted in blue and the bottom right there you see i'm scrolling between them all so yellow is all of them blue is team blue red team red door locked so i can make team red go i am moving out clear our backs and then he's gonna close with a flashbang hopefully that was a pick lock okay breach with shotgun then clear with bags 600 likes ggs let's keep it going i think it's been pretty good stream game to be on it this is a way smaller room than i was expecting hello you're out love restrained targets i like that i can do that secured and ready i don't think i did this last time i did my uh really nice looking map though i haven't explored it's like that's a chair get on the ground i've seen a little bit of gameplay this one but i haven't played it myself so this is all completely new to me as you can see by my erratic scanning uh let's make these guys fall in on my six as a unit moving into your position and i won team blue to open and clear that door all right copy that seem red let's clear that with flashbacks that was a massive staircase here affirmative it's locked it's locked orders okay uh open door feature shotgun deploy flashbangs and clear oh i'm selecting the wrong team deploy shotgun and clear okay nice there's a lock on that one too all right good work i got this one all right light stick away solid malone appreciate you tuning in man hope you enjoyed the stream ready for trailers pretty irregular these old youtube live streams just streams for me in general but i do like uh i do like streaming on youtube especially the quality like being able to leave this up on the channel afterwards and not you know they're not being a dip in quality is really nice it's a random doorway here i don't have a mirror gun though so i do have this i wanted to use this but peak door a trap is this the flashbang one i don't remember we'll find out yeah that's a flashbang all right we're clear i don't know if i'd prefer to just have a flash to be honest i suppose it just allows you to carry more flash bangs than you would be able to usually so it's not the worst thing um i've break this one on my own as well i think i've got a i've got a lockpick i need one though my trap at the bathroom toilet seat wow never would have guessed something talking about going to arthog with your school on jack stream i used to live there it's a small world man i used to think arthur was like a mask like i thought to me when i was younger was like disney world and then i told the guys about it and they had no idea what it was or even where it was meetings at 12 pm don't forget to bring sandwiches smiley face did the guy create that asset as well must have done okay this looks very pretty oh my god that is really on cool six come on nuts right behind you let's turn on the uh the music i want to see if it picks up on the customer this is so open what the hell do the right thing because it's right who who asked the graphics in this game are amazing but like yeah the fact that someone's made all this themselves it's really impressive uh we'll get team one open the door roger that sir team two two he just did the most you're a badass mate he did the war zone jesus christ i forgot i made him do that come over here get over here boys he like turned his back because he's got a right shield amazing oh god oh god so make sure my v5 is also on full auto i held the trigger down and only fired one bullet who's been there before jesus christ is on the left he's dead guys he's dead don't worry i know you're really worried about me though i have no fear his new knife the knife guys is scary as hell no more mr knife guy breach clear the door clear it i got this one actually could the double angle breach yeah you've absolutely ruined yourself one job i've got an ornament like that little thumbs up forget to give the stream a thumbs up guys sorry that's low-hanging fruit but do it do it these desks seem massive oh just listen jada it's just a joke down on your knees keep my wife's name oh up do it now that's gonna be fine isn't it let me trap on this door hey there's people over here restrained targets down on your knees please good luck get off me good be advised i have unarmed contact this one's secure i love the team comes [Music] absolutely stay on me i'm gonna catch this uh don't like that not one bit no i don't want that either way happened last time get him boys move to my front going and gone there's someone on this corner what's going on here what's king seeing that was king wasn't it this one coming king oh my god there was a guy in there the whole time so there's literally a server maze that's sick wow look at this it's an actual maze of servers i walked straight through this door and didn't run into an account with that guy unreal fake or fact that's a really clever logo some good graphic design right there um okay open the door clear it can you clear that nice stack up boys copy that it's open it's just an alarm no need to panic although i panicked quite quite badly yeah i don't need to open that second door when it's on the other side of it follow me boys provide support on me all right i got a civilian killed there actually you're not a civi yeah there's two guns struck your knees no way did he have an m16 in his doa it's a variant of the m16 remember using that gun in like home front honestly the details just like blow me away in this game obviously this guy's made custom textures so the performance isn't quite as good because he's like really pushed the boat out in terms of how crisp like the fact that i got i can get this close and read that as as crisp as it is like usually in games it's so blurry because they have to like reduce the quality of uh smaller objects but everything is super high res in this which is really cool uh that's an enemy actually i can't be sure uh can i cancel the pin pull no i guess not okay get on the ground police are you an enemy i can't be sure you had a knife get on your knees all right kenny thank you so much for watching have a good night anyone else suddenly they're everywhere keep my wife's game i'm sorry sorry sorry for everyone i've killed um i only i only believe in uh i only believe in love and positivity i will slap you if you mention my wife's name uh i'm gonna kick this i can see the door cam in the top right so use that to my advantage um open room blind corner i was a gymnasium this map is massive almost as massive as my biceps are about to be spot me mate spot me 10 kg lift that left that with my pinky i couldn't that might be trap yeah we're good probably a tiny room worth checking yeah it's just the oh god imagine there was an enemy spawn there maybe nuts what's that kind of something excuse me boys no more rooms to clear amazing okay uh detain unarmed contacts at the scene arrest or neutralize any contact i was just about to command him to go to move over there just to bait him out you know see what would happen if one of them moved forwards scared the life army dude moving and clear is that the room i got them to breach with the c2 i think it is check this the alarm went off in this room this room i'm not actually sure of now oh yeah this is a different room crap light stick away if he was actually stunned by that or not thought maybe the flash itself had killed him i'm enjoying the flow of this map it's really cool there's so many like blind spots that i keep missing what's that it was one of those like weird conference phones uh where haven't i been there's a double door over here or an elevator or something if i can go in it no played that that's the gym that's the changing room went down here cleared all that it's secured hmm down on your knees appears to be bugged i'm pressing f but it's not doing anything sorry mate i just got to try and move you out of the way that's a problem with the modded map it's still saying it from over here though so it must be bugged that's why i reported those guys these bloody jump scares ai i know okay well i guess i did it it's disappeared off the screen now yeah the this isn't even so i've got a movement mod on so i move slightly faster usually the game makes you walk around at snail pace um and this this still might might look slow but it obviously works for this type of game where you're room clearing and stuff uh that room we've been in this we came up that staircase ah but yeah there's like ai mods so this movement mod also included an ai mod that improves the ai and makes them like flank you and do even more horrible jump scary stuff but raid kind of does that to an extent anyway because i mean you've just seen it it will randomly jump out of you all right let's get the mirror gun into this uh stack up mirror on the door hey mason how you doing buddy got the mirror here uh suspect on the left i can see his foot looks safe to me does yeah that wasn't a civvy you said suspect in sight okay uh in which case uh stand over there moving up let's try this again i need to reload it keep doing this continue this kid will be killed though all right one more quickly put your hands up are you talking your hands that's over here swan what are you doing get down i want to see hands hands up above your head hands up oh my god missed the guy completely civilian ready for trailers jason stefan copy that trailer is you guys standing by for trailers talk to high ground roger okay last round stockholm for contact roger we'll take care of it it's fun mirror gun ready oh no he might blast the door careful buddy it's such a cheap way of me to look through the mirror gun with actually having one just switch to the team cam does it look empty though i feel like you're missing someone open clear with flashbangs copy that come on boys last stream i think copy that it's unlocked sir okay readying flashbang myself slightly stunned by that oh maybe it is clear no other can't go outside anyway can we a balcony looks like you can get on it something we're missing you guys have been marked this guy suspect doa we've killed or arrested all the suspects now so that's good what was that they want me to pick up oh the actual civilian himself you can carry arrested now this new mod and then you can oh twins aren't they these two it's just eating like nobody's business hey there we go we're done mission complete that's a really cool map you have to do that though i keep needing to remind myself because if you don't report the targets or the the civvies that you've arrested or killed it won't count as a mission complete can you actually go out here there is a door there is clear oh in the umbrella i mean you're definitely not going to be able to climb a ladder i think you can even do that in this game probably a solid wall somewhere no easter eggs about can't see any all right ggs uh what is it page up talk reporting copy that put them on safe and let them hack hell yeah what's our school gonna be for that felt pretty good i mean i shot a lot of people that didn't need to die but they had guns too you know me or them in that situation it's been killed minus d that's the best score we've had all night and all it took was losing stardom and jack oh man there would be no memes without them though i mean it would be memes but it's usually at my own expense backed headquarters that was really good fun though good banter with the lads and then uh a nice little solo run was able to show off the ai the ai there which you might not have seen before uh i'm trying to think i think that's all the content we've covered the new stuff there's a bunch of quality of life changes that i won't go into because i mean i don't remember them to be honest there's a lot of stuff that's changed that time is gonna start oh what i love this game though like the fact they've been updating it the way they have but there's substantial updates every month the sensitivity is a bit high actually i've been playing with this all night yeah the constant making changes i think the game's in early access like it's not full release oh man it's come a long way in the short amount of time i hope it looks visually it stays like this did i not complete it what the hell am i missing a target who did i miss killed you killed you killed you dead blended in with the cardboard or the what do you call this mdf done all right well 37 seconds that would have took yeah cheers for watching guys hope you enjoyed that that was uh about two or three hours of ready or not good fun i love that there's this lethal training room that you can just have constant spawns oh yeah i haven't tried spam firing this yet and if you even can oh you can that's enough to make me have an epileptic fit jesus and it's probably it's really stunned me as well wow yeah that's been ready or not i hope you enjoyed that guys uh again if you did leave a like and uh subscribe engagement is key for youtube and that's how we go that's how we do engage uh some some big videos coming
