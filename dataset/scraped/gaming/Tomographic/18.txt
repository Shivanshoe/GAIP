vampire the masquerade blood hunt i look a bit like voldemort don't i vodka anyway this is bloodhound and a big thank you to them for sponsoring this video so bloodhound is a free-to-play battle royale game set in the city of prague where you use your supernatural powers as a vampire to hunt and outsmart your enemy gear up and feed on the blood of innocents to grow in power and defy gravity with various abilities and some awesome parkour skills that are guaranteed to make you feel like an absolute boss it's a super fun and fast-paced game but you have a ton of freedom during the match if you want to slow things down or speed things up if you want to live life 100 miles per hour there is a very clear skill gap in blood hunt but not to the point where you feel completely helpless and you have to rely solely on how well you can aim so if the shallow end of the pool is more to your liking they do actually have a mode called bloodhunt that caters to both newcomers as well as existing players that mostly play the game for casual enjoyment featuring comeback mechanics and different match variations to keep things fun and interesting a new ranked playlist also just released where you can earn ranked points by defeating enemies and placing high in matches with various ranks and rewards up for grabs and so if you're not typically a fan of battle royale games i encourage you to give this one a go and if you find this video enjoyable to watch be sure to let me know in the comments and i would be happy to post some more the download link is in the description below if you want to check out the game for yourself on pc or playstation 5. consider leaving a like and subscribe for more and i'm going to leave you now with some gameplay that i've accumulated over the last few days
