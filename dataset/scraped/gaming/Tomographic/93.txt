on the roof yeah yeah they're sharing plates they're sharing plates together adorable right here on the corner i've thrown a snapshot you ready right one there you go bouncy push behind me yeah they're just there oh i can pin that as if i could pin that oh my god snapshots are illegal you've penned that i've gone up to the usd yeah i know that's two two he's stuck on the zip he's stuck on it nice i'd already killed one coming up the zip timer because the team pushed over and i was like oh no that snapshot grenade was so effective there how could you pen that so yes the snapshot grenades in warzone are now extremely effective and you should definitely consider using them in some of your classes so what changed exactly well the player highlight now lasts two whole seconds whenever you throw these things out and not only that but now your entire team can also see the snapshot graphic which at first could only be seen by the person throwing them essentially if you have a full team all using snapshot grenades you've basically got three wall hacks for a few seconds making these things extremely useful for pushing buildings or making sure you're not about to get ambushed the moment you step inside a shack in the middle of nowhere this even carries over to modern warfare's multiplayer so it's easy to see why these things are going to become a camper's worst nightmare i mean the intel that you get from throwing these things out before pushing a building it's just absurd i mean look i can see this guy in the bathroom still on top of a sink like what do you do in that situation i might be thinking oh it's not so bad you know it's not like these things are unlimited right they're not unlimited right are you fools did you forget that restock was in the game now you have unlimited snapshot grenades on refill every 50 seconds that your entire team can see unlimited refills how has nobody clocked this yet now of course i'm not forgetting you can counter the snapshot grenade by using cold blooded but it's very rare that you're going to find a full team using cold blooded everyone's got someone on the team using eod to save themselves from explosives and all that sort of stuff i was running the snapshot grenades all day yesterday and honestly most of the time i threw these things out the full team would light up like a christmas tree on fire and i had a great time if you're going to enjoy the video make sure to leave a like and subscribe for more like this i've got some gameplay to show you now just messing around with these snapshot grenades and figuring them out whilst playing with westie and the tactical brick thank you guys so much for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one i had to look for the card that they gave me the other day because i was like oh crap i didn't get one i didn't get a card you need to get one i haven't got one because i've been told i can use the nhs app i'll get you card rusty though mine's on the app i don't need a card apparently what's the point of shooting just what's the point i don't understand what the point in shooting tomo has killed men i think he did it for me it's lovely it's so darn melee like what was the point what was the three hits and you're done i shot a man like seven times and then punched him once and he died then his teammate i was like ba-bam just punched him and finished the fight without even firing a bullet dame what was the point um we do have lodi i do want to specify this question sorry just murder these men just going in the door okay just been pied that's right you're fine yeah i would come back come this way let me get lowly that's right and then let me chase them that's right someone together oh god i mean i don't think it's a
