oh one's parachuting down right there oh yeah is this possible there's two of them that's nuts i didn't know that jump was possible come on come on this is call of duty you never need an optic oh god yo what's up everyone and yes it's finally time for another ironsight spr video i think i've kept you guys waiting long enough after the last one which you know seemed to go down pretty well with you guys that first video was a lot of fun to make and honestly speaking i didn't think i'd find a practical use for this particular class setup in warzone but somehow it worked and you guys loved it it's actually super beneficial at times to run iron sights on a high-powered sniper rifle especially when you can react quickly and land those critical headshots in the heat of battle the accusations just seem to come flying at you when you use this loadout but it's actually really good practice for flick shotting and the experience you get from using a sniper in this way definitely carries over to when you use a sniper rifle properly scope and all this build is more focused around mobility and versatility but i'm still able to hit those long range shots if i squint really hard at my monitor i mean having a 1440p display definitely helps a range but those close to medium range engagements are where this build really shines people just don't expect it it's like running around with a pump action shotgun at times even if you're not that good at flick shotting to the head those upper torso shots still do a surprising amount of damage so yeah this loadout was a lot of fun to come back to for me and i still get so many requests for more ironside spr gameplay so i hope this video can help to feed your craving for more but you know there's really no better way to scratch that edge than to try this loadout for yourself so this is the class setup that i'm using so i covered this build in my previous no scope spl video so i'm not going to bore you with the details today but i am using the ram 7 for when i absolutely need it and i have that class set up like this so i just wanted to say a quick thank you for all of your supporters of late i'm doing my best to churn out videos for you but you can always expect quality over quantity on this channel so i appreciate your patience and continued viewership and i think it's really important to touch base with you guys every so often just to let you know how much you appreciated because without sounding cliche i really would not be in this position if it weren't for you watching these videos so thank you again if you are new around here and you want to see more then subscribe for more it's really that simple you know how this youtube stuff works and yes i'm going to be that guy for a second and say that 61 of you that watch my videos aren't actually subscribed so do the right thing click that subscribe button and you won't miss out on any future content okay then with that said i've got some gameplay for you now
