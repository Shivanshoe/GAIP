well guys that's it we've reached the end of 2021 and it kind of feels like we're right back where we started doesn't it this has been yet another really challenging year for us all but there's still a lot to be grateful for i really wanted to take this time to say thank you for all of your support this past year i don't get to say this very often and the more that i say thank you the more the word thanks seems to lose all meaning but you really have changed my life in ways that i could have never imagined i've had so many great opportunities this year and i've been able to try new things and make videos that i enjoy on games that i enjoy even if they're not the most popular i just love coming up with new ideas and seeing your response to those ideas and knowing that i don't just have to make the same content that is expected of me or that i used to expect you expected of me basically what i'm trying to say is i'm just glad i no longer need to make warzone loadout videos in order to put food on the table i don't think i can be more clear than that look i like surprising you guys with certain video ideas and quirky edits that allow me to show more of my personality you know this is a job that started off as a passion of mine after all so it's important that i still enjoy the work if i'm going to make the best videos that i can if i'm not having fun playing these games and editing these videos then you're probably not going to have much fun watching them either and entertaining people is my favorite part about being a content creator i'm really looking forward to continuing that mindset in 2022 and focusing on quality over quantity and just enjoying the process it's definitely something i overlook and i just want to have more fun with my friends and focus on the now and stop worrying about the future i don't want to put too much pressure on myself with editing though because editing only enhances good content when the content is actually good it's been a few times over the years where i've spent hours editing to make a good video out of bad footage and i want to stop doing that if i don't have the footage then i need to like just tell myself to restart the process otherwise i'm just wasting energy and i'm not really doing it for the love of it you know burnout is a real thing and sometimes you just need to take a break it's that simple i don't know this year's been really weird and games that i thought were going to spice things up for content creators and viewers have kind of been a huge letdown so i'm just gonna keep doing me trying new games and posting a variety of stuff to hopefully keep things interesting let me know if there's any ideas or games you want me to try you know i do value your feedback and it does influence my decisions and gives me inspiration as a content creator i'm always down to try something new so here's some more warzone anyway i've got some leftover duo's gameplay that i recorded with jack recently that i thought you'd enjoy so i'm gonna let that play out now but seriously thank you all so much for making this year so great despite the real world being such a mess i know i wanted to remind you that you don't need to have everything figured out yet there is time and on any one day you can change the direction of your life that day doesn't have to be today it might not click for you yet and that's okay but don't sweat the small stuff you know you do you in your own time stay safe thank you for watching as always and i will catch you legends on the other side how can i be down me and bizarre in florida whose room slept on the floor of the motel and dr dre said hell yes and i got is stamped like a postcard well to mailman and i know they're going to hate but i don't care i barely
