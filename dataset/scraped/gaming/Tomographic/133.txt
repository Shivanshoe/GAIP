had since the last time i played yeah the performance was one of the worst things when it came it was terrible it's good fun now though it's a good meme there's a man in the tower isn't there god how am i supposed to tell is that you yeah that's you what color is that slightly lighter blue i'm like squinting to confirm oh my god that just decimated the entire map is an a10 oh it sounds so good that's a war hog isn't it the delayed audio as well yeah that's sick that sounds way better than the one it was oh yeah people go prone to some weird places in this game dude because it reduces the recoil so much some people just can't take it oh wait i found the guy that was brian are you talking about he's just like on the top of the stairs right oh yeah he's just killed me i i walked around the corner to kill him saw your body and shot the crap out of your corpse you shot my clothes instead why did you look that way you just turned around it's so loud yeah i turned my i set my volume down i will go back there i'm going to finish the stronger i want to throw it on the fourth quarter got him clear in all i care about is just you could walk away this bloody slug over here i'm going to try and get over there now i've cleared c dude you can probably just quick scott people at this game like oh yeah you're that cyan blue guy oh guys just full team below full team one at the center boards don't call that full squad below there's one there's a one team he's one he's one they're underneath you jack ground floor on the road between you and our spawn if you're still where you were when i died i'm with you you're behind me yeah normally i just run along here and die that's what i've been doing be careful to the left low level because that's where i saw a full squad yeah they were like down there on that low part i'm going i'm going i'm going oh god he's right there tom blowing that building at the deck or right on me yeah you see the hole in the wall yeah right there henry yeah yeah nice good good car get in there tom clear it clear it don't fall off so i just want to go all the way to the top of the swirly whirly oh someone nice is he dead oh my gosh fully unloaded so i'm gonna so many more rounds than required you hear these guys i hear him jack they're very excited about that yeah boy they're very excited it's a purple smoke grenade what's that well here on the main point that's it yeah almost four oh that's what that was that's a uh smoke to indicate where to air get on the point [ __ ] did you go bang boom boom bye bye yeah yeah yeah that was that's what happened bang boom boom bye bye zom he's just been using can they get oh there's a guy in the road blow you there killed him it's that prone gamer that's the same spot everywhere we go gamer he's a man i'm dead i'm definitely dead i'll be all right and i'm dead and i'm dead i push way too deep into their spawn i came where you were but i was in a restricted area yeah it was a rough spot this guy's got bloody rocket launcher look at this where amber see that rpg oh god oh wait wrong team they're taking c i don't know about this walkway yeah i'm off it now i'm off the hype oh it's like someone just killed his teammate wait did i kill a teammate mr isaac yeah oh i killed him dead i'm on d but it's locked to the moment i must unlock the d oh we gotta get c don't we i'm gonna restrict there again yeah i'm trying to get there how am i supposed to get up to see from where i am i'm right behind two enemies but i can't shoot them you die i was like running behind three people for like 30 seconds oh my god i found them i couldn't shoot them i'm deep again jack i'm so deep oh you got a nice red dot on that yeah i'm surrounded by them dude it's so difficult to hear where they're coming from how did we get pushed all the way back to our spawn we're literally in theirs this train playlist is blocked well we're gonna have to kill them that guy's got their idea don't die they got more weight than us all right we need to play defensive okay guys guys guys very spammy got one outside let's try oh he was right on the stairs there yeah i didn't hear anything i love that you can hear the enemies commas when they're in the vicinity that's really cool okay here we go are you unsafe i assume that's the yes well i was dry heaving at the fact i just shot someone in the head and i saw their head explode off their corpse and i was pretty mad and then i died oh no we're out waves is it just this guy yeah it's it's our guy versus harmony he could clutch he's just playing like he's cracked out of his mind and there's no one by him what is going on oh yes i how did we go from like winning by eight waves to going to sudden death how is this [ __ ] possible we were dreaming like how did we go to sudden death this is not [ __ ] fair not fair [ __ ] consolation [ __ ] price [ __ ] is this he's so mad he's upset he's upset that was a long one dude i think
