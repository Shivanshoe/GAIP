in today's video we're popping off with the fast squad fugler acolyte starmat64 and myself and i'm using the zrg 20mm sniper in the following gameplay and man is this gun underrated for some reason i just don't see anybody using it in my games but this could very well be the most deadly sniper in warzone right now it certainly took some getting used to for me because i haven't used it in a little while and still don't even have it fully upgraded but you just point and click with the zg at almost any range and it absolutely deletes people this was my first game using this sniper in weeks and i hit some really nice shots here and it all gets a bit hectic in the late game but holy the vibes were immaculate during this match and we were all doing our own thing using different loadouts and play styles and it was just a lot of fun definitely one of those matches where you want to see everybody's perspective so be sure to check out the other guys videos as well leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it and subscribe if you haven't already thank you guys for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one what's the big deal man what's the big deal stone is a broken man
