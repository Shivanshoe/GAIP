so if you didn't know call of duty warzone added a new limited time mode early this week called operation flashback where essentially you get to relive some of the past ltms and events all rolled into one single match sounds crazy but it's actually pretty fun you've got stuff like the juggernaut royale mode the crashing satellites event and nakatomi plaza's vault is open again and they even have some of the old modern warfare and cold war meta weapons spawning as groundly obviously nowhere near as powerful as they once were but still a really cool mode for war zone and one that keeps you engaged from start to finish since you always have objectives to partake in with the whole flashback theme though it would have been cool to see the original vedantic map activated for this mode since i'm sure a lot of new players haven't even experienced that map before at least the original version of a dance that most of us remember when warzone first went live those were some good times before metas even existed and everything was just new to us i miss those days man hopefully the vanguard integration injects some new life into war zone because i am looking forward to getting back into this game again particularly for the memes and good times with friends i've got some really good memories from the early days of warzone and really what started the trajectory of this channel so i'm sure there's a bunch of you out there who are looking forward to seeing more warzone content on the channel and many of you have stuck around for the variety stuff that i've been posting lately as well which i really do appreciate i'm having a lot of fun making videos at the moment more so than i think i ever have and that's all because of the feedback that i get from you guys so thank you for supporting what i do in my little corner of the internet you're all welcome and i just want to make the best content i can for you guys so with the soppy stuff out of the way let's get into some
