what are you doing [Music] this is awkward oh he's playing a horn oops [Music] hello my friends and welcome to nightfall a co-op fps action adventure battle royale game with a twist released and then immediately ceased by landfall the developers of the game it's not uncommon for landfill to release a project before moving on to the next one though they have been doing so every april fool's day for the last couple of years now and this is their latest installment so in nightfall 28 players pair up in teams of two with the goal to reach the castle and pluck the fabled rose before anyone else the journey will take many days and you will need to find shelter in different towns along the way so as not to freeze to death during the harsh nights being the first team to reach each town you ensure the first pick of weapons and healing that you'll need to defend yourself against approaching players and as you can see there are a wide variety of weapons that you can find including enchanted weapons like this ak and even spell books that cast some pretty devastating attacks nightfall has a really simple concept but it's executed brilliantly and i have some mussy gameplay to show you from a full match that i think you'll find very entertaining oh and did i mention that you can drift horses all right here we go hop on teammate take shelter at night ride along the road and get the rose it's that simple i think i'll call my horse tokyo yeah let's go tokyo so we need to drift in order to get there as fast as possible you get a nice little speed boost oh baby there it is you drift hard enough like that i hit a tree i lost all the speed immediately i need to try and there we go drift where i shouldn't be able to drift [Music] i think my teammate's enjoying the ride that's an enemy player well two enemy players i bet he's here isn't he yeah news waiting for the ambush shortcut didn't work oh that slowed us down massively come on teammate need to loot up before nightfall hence the name this enemy team is also here that's a bomb another one that's one down where's the other try open this chest all right teammate ow okay he was trying to live ping for me give me this gun there we go revolve my teammate i need to hold it there we go i could have done without the fancy flailing of my weapon but we got the kill part of the fun i mean look at this make sure i've got the right gun nice little double kill to get the uh get the match started okay so we're pretty close to night time now so we'll just loot up this area [Music] all residents of the town please get inside the night will freeze you take shelter in the town yeah we have to stay here basically because if we leave the town we'll start taking damage you see the top there i've got like a dial i guess that tells you when dawn dusk and nightfall is we're currently in knife all the night cycle is very short [Music] all right let's get back out there so my teammates are good shot with that bow i've got to be careful of the grass too if you touch grass which i wouldn't recommend in real life you know oh god i've just done exactly what i god damn it see we like tries to eat the grass you don't want that i'll give you all the baby carrots you want but right now i've got to focus on drifting oh no there's a fork in the road we're going left we have to take a gamble i don't know if this is the quick route or the long route obstacles ahead come on teammate i got it another one come on see me you can hit this you missed it's fine i got it that's an enemy ahead i'm also not going fast enough i shouldn't really be getting overtaken right now i need to train my drifts like this town nearby it looks empty well it's not going to be is it yeah this team have pulled up already there they are have a bomb oh my it flew great work let's go teammate ronin there's a book there i don't really want it i love this pistol full auto glock what's not to love let's get some bandages loot up what we can off these guys teammate might want that i think he had an ak definitely better than this but i do have an energized weapon so basically move faster when i have it there's a lot of different perks you can get for the different guns from chests mostly come on kwandale dingle it's just hitting nightfall now but it's so quick [Music] it's a sound that's the other horse eating some grass yeah that's the problem if i try and like run on grass then i just go really slow and my horse tries eating let's go we both have energized weapons which want me to go through it i am cold make haste to the rose or maybe you just meant let's go was in let's go we both have energized weapons definitely sounds more plausible we did just take some damage to the zone there let's make sure i time these drifts effectively this looks so stupid man i love it though what a cool concept for a game i don't think i can ever be going like the wrong direction because if i just turn around now it'll just say i'm going the wrong way there is a map i can look at but i'm pretty confident that we're going the right way [Music] there's another team right there we've got to catch him get on his track i need to catch up with these drifts because he's going to beat me to the castle which is right here when we catch a big drift there it is that's a good idea actually do some drifts up here more speed oh that's a tight corner they want to fight i'm not fighting there my teammate is though oh my head was in the roof oh we need to heal fast please don't push me [Music] yes i've been hit by a bomb ow there's a player up top looking down [Music] oh he's under me there's another above me now this is crazy slam these heels and that play is still up there he's waiting for the rose give me all these heels oh my teammate died does it say for us no these guys are fighting too that's one i've been smashed though i did hit someone with that bomb there he is [Music] yes oh my god a clutch what an absolute battle that was that has to be the last guy right surely holy you're insane oh that was a bit crazy even for me i just wiped so many of them oh i'm buzzing my heart is absolutely jumping out of my chest i guess there's nothing left to do but claim the rose i think you killed the entire lobby we did it couldn't have done it without you corndale dingle [Music] victory is ours what is this why is he pinging constantly i'll ping you back i have some of that i love this game that's the most fun i've had in ages playing a video game are you kidding me i wasn't even playing with a friend just some random and it was still fun you gotta smash a like on that video and subscribe for more because i'll be playing this again with a friend at some point soon you can guarantee it holy crap this game is good [Music] you
