someone called the cop that's an enemy but it sounds weird you can get a grenade through that window shall i just bash it you flash it he's got a knife yeah i bash it you flash it no i can just he's running through oh he stopped me flashback out i'm bleeding i'm bleeding you're like and three two what he came through the door i didn't have a hand he could hear you counting he just started knifing you up so welcome back everyone to ready or not and this game just keeps getting better with each update the devs have really smashed it out of the park this time the new and improved ai mechanics for suspects and civilians are some of the best i've seen in a game like this almost simulating the way that players themselves would move and use cover even hiding underneath beds and inside wardrobes it's really impressive so naturally we decided to up the ante even further and do a non-lethal run using beanbag shotguns and peppable guns to take down and arrest as many targets as possible without actually killing them or ourselves that being myself acula and stoddy as we try to score as highly as possible by the end of the mission we were at first joined by jack fraggs but sadly he was let go for dishonorable discharge involving an altercation with a civilian in a bomb vest down here hear me tom shoot the bomb best track do it no please don't do it please don't do that we're here now don't do it oh you killed [Applause] clearly i played no part in encouraging jack to do so anyway drop a like if you want to see more ready or not on the channel soon and subscribe for more like this don't think i don't see those of you that keep coming back to the channel but aren't actually subscribed by the way because i'm calling you out this time alright thanks for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one that's right i've got breaching shotgun as well look at us man looks like we're going in with airsoft might as well be yeah oh i got we can already already hear this guy moving around hold on yeah i hear him i've got a bridge if you want it all right just mirroring this door uh there's a civvy directly ahead shooter shooter what does it matter the beanbag isn't it yeah i said it was clear i heard there's a door there's the room there yeah but you'll still get an authorized use of force well well is there a problem oh well i think i hear that guy in the next room there you mirrored it yeah i hear a movement are you moving arrested remember can you move hook yeah trailers come here move out of the way trying to get him down he's got armor on help yeah so he's dave just close the gap close the gap he's dazed getting closer there we go there we go good good good you dropped the gun it worked he was fully stunned there like but that's what i mean it doesn't actually get them down i thought he's non-lethal like if you keep spamming them if you shoot them four times they will die that's not the objective i shot him five we've been we've been in silence so far yeah it's been good i like this all right uh nobody i feel this is how you're actually supposed to play the game guys it's crazy you're okay those are so loud i don't like this left corner i didn't mean to do that i don't know where i can see him okay so there's one sieve i'm gonna flash in and i'm gonna flash in no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's fine it's it's not like unnecessary we don't know i'm going to wedge this one so we don't get flanked this one's mirror blocked okay okay i can join some breach charge uh breaching shotgun i can now just do normal breach instead of going too loud i think the whole place will hear oh i was gonna plant an explosive okay you're gone no no no we're doing so well on the stealth front hold on flashbang okay flashing flashing flashing i like that a lot going slow do you go and you'll show there we go there we go i think you're just too far away you are shooting a beanbag oh my goodness this i shot him but it hit this wall here right i was aiming around shoot on a wall or something i've already gone loud so it doesn't go where i'm aiming which is yeah see it's like a rough single bean bag round this barrel around can you put attachments on it yeah but only basic ones it's just not great okay okay we got a civi and a guy with a gun directly to the left like really close okay i think right now still can taste you want to take actually if you just open i might be able to taste them i need a little pick you want breaching shock on it no i'll peek it just be ready you'll know oh i opened it i don't know if i got him go ahead now i'm moving in i'm moving in you're at me a lot civi and enemy i started i think he ran check corners and blind spots off stage nearby watching your back got fired i think i got hit by one of you there yeah you gotta press f while you're shooting them yeah you're making comply when you have the upper hand and ready for training okay we're missing doors this way yeah there's a one or two kept moving is this one as well what the heck happened to that guy i wish the woman came through okay we got two civvies one's on the ground one's directly ahead and then a guy with a gun just to the left okay close yeah fairly close i don't know if you'll be able to tase them though i mean i can i can flash if you want okay don't push in straight away wait which sizing the guy with the he'll be left okay i'll open it yeah flash in uh don't push right away okay i need to bash it ready yeah i'm going to do it from this angle flash in go flash go move in front yep nice good work good work here we dude that's so go man the evidence here reaching together like that really cool his room's closed off we're good he's not arrested again yeah restraining the other one hey man get off of me there's another door over here can't close this door come on because i broke it the door here is wrong ruin that door um okay there's no trip wire oh there is a trip wire here arrested remember okay yeah or i could shoot with a breaching shotgun from range you just don't want to break it i mean you can yeah yeah no do it do it back away connor it's already done if you haven't cut the wire so back away and then he can breach and it'll blow up that's gonna go loud yeah it's fine we've been loud they've got their bullets oh it's a it's an alarm door not an actual uh oh that's fine then there wasn't a frag attached to it i mean kind of cleared the room so i don't know if there's guys in here or not yeah looks clear there is another room there no doors behind me i'm gonna flash that next room okay there's a big opening incapacitated civilians on the right no one in here cool closing door or wedging yeah nobody's in there well he ain't good no he's not you've seen better days for sure not looking too hot i've got gas grenades which you should probably nice i mean you can use them but like you don't have a gas mask on so it'll do the same amount of damage to you and then we can't get in there you just gotta make sure if you use them do it from range all right we haven't gone upstairs again hold on hold on yep all right fine where was he he's down this whole way directly at the end you got him corner i got [Applause] that's right that's right holy crap dude he had a knife on him just slapped him in the head as i arrested him i wanted to make sure that i i was pushing towards the end of the hall here dude that's amazing i didn't know they could have there's another door or door but you just won't he's got no rights that's crazy dude i've never seen him do that i thought they could do like one or the other you know like he just stacked so many different unique mechanics okay let's let's throw one into the other other let's go this way first we all loaded yeah everyone's got enough friends hold on um oh they're pepper balls yeah i think they do more to your head then um like it'll probably daze them faster right yeah i guess so okay it's clear but i don't know if the room itself is clear no trap okay okay you didn't chat for traps did you i did i swear there wasn't one there lucky that was a flashbang and i was definitely trapped the wires on the floor checking left thank god that wasn't like an actual frag grenade we'd actually all be dead accomplished mirror this we were all so tight on that door i'm really glad that was a flashbang yeah nothing it's just a bathroom okay no trap bang it's a bathroom with a gun he's in the bathtub that seems like a tiny bath my ass can fit in there i got bunda fam you could fit in there yeah i'm six three connor yeah you could be squeezy in there maybe not your whole body oh recover bell brady we need to find we need the senator's daughter back alive no matter what leave it up to you decide how to handle it actually no i think last time we did this yeah i know it changes every time there's a door here by the way there's a door here are these lifts oh these are called lifts guys oh nice uh we didn't love you yeah we spawned there and closed it that double door on the left is where we spawned i thought it came like down so we don't forget big brain might stick away keep your eye on this guy is that not where we've been already nope we were down this hallway okay this should lead to a staircase uh maybe a different door can't play much this map it's really cool door on right it's closed you want to go first no no well not really i'm gonna i'm gonna flat i've got so many flashes i can only like stop them once they're actually stunned i can do work there might be a guy ahead i'm just sneaking for left carefully closed not doing left looks clear unless he's laying down just at the door i just have my clothes there i closed it clearing wardrobe check this with a mirror again uh light stick away what come in here come here yeah yeah look look oh we can't we have to wrap around though oh my god oh my god he doesn't he didn't no he doesn't react to light wait wait well it's a one-way mirror can we break it into you look i'm going to don't think you can i don't think you can shoot through this no well i don't want to test it and him go aggro you know okay no it's really tempting we know he's there but you literally have a beanbag shotgun make sure you walk because he might hear us yeah no he didn't hear me which i think because it's closed off right so he i mean we can try it like have somebody sit in there right did we want to finish clearing this this way yeah no no wardrobe was clear but there's two doors that i needed mirrored this one goes back to the main area i think the one on your right yep no trump it's just a bathroom nobody's in here oh i lied there is a guy there somehow he's very close i've got a taser yeah you could taste him easily he's like right here okay okay okay opening he's good i gotta taste nice you need to stop him yeah nice good shot starred well done we're killing it this is really fun unless i haven't done this before like fully committed to it but everyone's got a lesson lethal weapon i've got no taser left now though that's it okay um this way wind around to get to that guy do you want to try uh hitting this guy through yeah we have the end let me get right hang on hang on let me get on the other side of him you two stay there and shoot him with a shotgun if once he turns around or something yeah you stay in that window start and you just watch him we'll try and get behind him so that we see we have a backup option just in case that fails and you can't actually break the window okay do it now do not wait don't go further further no it doesn't work it doesn't work doesn't work doesn't work sorry across there got him calm down got him down yeah that was messy my bad i can't i can't see through this you're right yeah i don't think so it's like a stud mirror from what i remember my head was detached from my body there for a moment oh wow it actually is yeah bit creepy yeah that's crazy creepy who the hell is watching use it against them how much ammo if i go left how do i check hold our hold on you should do the same really so they should lead to that same corridor right yep okay now we need to go upstairs i think the staircase is sway i shot this door behind us so we're fine yeah it's straight ahead to the left actually what about this door oh never mind it's clear there it is yep ah the stairwell going up there's loads of areas to check on this map could be anywhere clear it's upstairs your movement anyone else yeah someone's got a taser up there you've got a taser yeah i got them i got one as well two shots left of taste uh it's too hard to tell like what's going on can i drop it deploy okay it kind of opens up i see obviously yeah uh on the left put your hands up right hand okay more than left clear on the next hallway you want to secure her yep it opens up down here too or doesn't open i see you on team cams actually can i you lose some fps though i know you've been through a hell of an ordeal it doesn't open everything's gonna be okay okay we're moving connor in this right hallway okay this isn't fully uh cleared over here low light deployed this is quite big this area don't see anyone there staircases in between this side or maybe it goes the same direction this left door that door yeah so this is the area i was going to clear yeah let's see to it i wasn't sure you want to see to this door yeah yeah that one when you're up should we check underneath it first have a look here you can have a look i won't ping it yet blows it up uh it's very dark it opens up into other rooms okay believe it i'll get away from it be far away it's okay we're clear of the explosion it goes inward so i don't know how to do it i think the charge disappeared okay maybe not now it did no one yet no i did no one yet no one yet no i didn't hear any voices either careful right i think this is a cupboard no yeah we could have someone in it yeah that's so scary man let's check that out yeah that's terrifying uh bathroom let me mirror this door open okay we got a guy in left door uh left door he's like just to the right pretty close wait so he's to the right of the door yeah bathroom's clear you could tase him if i um uh yeah but it's a big room like this all opens up into a pretty big room sure what's left so he's just to the right of this if you open it yeah if you open it i can get them that's the khm right there oh wait breaching shotgun surely yeah if i breaching shotgun the door from your left i think you just need to open it though okay it won't be quick though should we just peek it yeah peek it okay almost killed me early stop bleeding it's fine yeah hold it you're good i've not got anything else i'm not ready for that right yeah i'm gonna punch it he wasn't yet he's running he's running right here right here that perfect flash there nice more steps at this point all right you saw me tommy yeah yeah got him he's down i'm keeping him down i'm getting this guy down holy watch out for any more just watch out i'm gonna keep these guys there's a civilian the next room restraining this guy stuck the peaking portion of that did not go well no no no it wasn't enough you need the surprise attack kitchen is clear nice oh my god i blasted this guy i got them there could be another guy over here in this room yeah there's more rooms isn't there i cleared the bathroom the one you're in now noises the bathroom is clear okay another civil in the next room in flash in here oh it's a stinger grenade said they're over here i don't know if that means anything stunned what's that yeah oh let's go let's go dropped it watch out for the civilian nice hold on um yeah get yeah we've got more doors this way i'm ready you've reported everyone right yeah okay again it opens up into a big room and a door on the right uh hold on no flashes left i get a flash okay i'm gonna breach it if you open i'll flash straight ahead preaching you guys take point there's the guy there i'm keeping him locked down nice i don't know if there's another one i don't know if there's nothing this is way too open man yeah i'm checking right i'm checking right yeah i know he's gonna do that yeah i made sure he's off the knife i'm gonna get him this one's secure back in the knife this is getting tough we have to be quick when they are trying to survive someone who killed him again he dropped his knife that second time you guys don't get it we're trying to survive it's there we've just absolutely blasted all of your teammates i think this just opens up and we're looking for that hostage still well there's still another room in here now oh no we found it we found it we found belle and we just need to rescue civilians that's it there's a civilian somewhere where are they there's more doors though isn't there hmm nothing in here careful of a trout maybe boom uh maybe we didn't report all the civilians pissed in the bath look they're actually pissed in it i don't want to see that golden shower do we need to report this villain i'm guessing there must be one we're missing well there's more doors we haven't checked it yeah on this left side yeah we haven't cleared the top floor yet obviously failed to report someone but i think well we didn't go right side downstairs so there might be like one accident no you're right yeah there was a few more doors downstairs what was that what the hell someone just said [ __ ] i was like um this isn't his last word on the go maybe okay the city here oh here this door this door is closed oh this is the one we had to breach or whatever almost well i found yeah there's no one we haven't reported can you have been on this hostage somewhere uh oh there's a door here i wedged this yeah everything's this guy hey here we go nice dudes oh yeah that was such a clean run keep going that was insane let's go i mean we had some moments where it definitely could have been cleaner but that was good overall yeah oh ggs at least ggs see what we get out of this that's got to be a plus you better be did we use excessive force like i'm trying to think of any civilians every single i don't know 10 11 11 oh we didn't report oh one dead body a plus st is the highest you can get and that's a little bit of extra xp we missed one evidence yeah we're pros now that's a solid run for our first non-lethal we'll take that we're now the best in the game i didn't even know [Music] you
