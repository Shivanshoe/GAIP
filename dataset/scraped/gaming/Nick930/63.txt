description below welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to cover another playstation 5 exclusive the remake of from software's brutally challenging classic demon souls and see how it compares to the original release of the game from 2009 for this comparison the remake of demon's souls on the ps5 is configured to play in its cinematic mode which locks the game to a native 4k resolution at 30 frames per second and the original game is being played on the playstation 3 which only offers a humble 720p resolution at 30fps however i will demonstrate the benefits of the remix new 60fps performance mode and explain why it's definitely the way to go if you decide to pick this game up alright so let's kick this comparison off by first looking at some of our character models starting with the player model for this analysis i decided to create a simple night class character that by default is equipped with the same fluted armor set and as you can clearly see there's been an exceptional overhaul to the quality and visual complexity of this character design the polycount has seen an exponential increase allowing for intricate details to pop on the screen that were never even perceivable before and every texture map has been tailor made for ultra hd displays and the results are truly incredible you can now see scratches along every single plate of armor along with what looks like decorative motifs carved into the metal each leather strap is now accompanied by supplemental buttons folds and steel rings and the cloth garments hidden underneath that used to look like rubber tubes now feature a great new stitch pattern but what's even more interesting is that the armor itself has been redesigned a good amount the general style remains intact but features like the helm look almost completely different with thinner slits along the visor and a more prominent crest along the top ridge it's a much more intimidating design choice and i feel it matches the tone of the game's dark atmosphere a bit more but it's not just the player's character that has seen these improvements all the enemies and npcs throughout the game have similarly been given a next generation treatment and the results are impressive the maiden in black for example retains all the aspects from before like her hairstyle jewelry and outfit but we can see it now in a new light as the black rags now feature visibly loose threads along the edges the decorative inlay along her robe is now more prominent and her signature waxed over eyes are more clear as it now appears with more depth and texture as opposed to the flat dark shade used before the blacksmith located in the nexus features even more drastic changes as his old dirty rag has been replaced with a damaged leather armor set instead his beard is also fuller now and he's now wearing an elaborate gauntlet on his left arm making him appear more like a skilled blacksmith than what he appeared like before we could go on forever detailing each and every character in the game as they've all seen some pretty substantial changes but the general takeaway here is that everything has been lovingly recreated on bluepoint's more advanced graphics engine with a surprisingly high level fidelity and while some of the redesigns may have strayed a bit from the original art style they all still fit in well with the atmosphere and at least when you first see them it's a joy to discover these enemies all over again next up let's take a look at the environments now as with any souls born style game you're going to become extremely familiar with these levels especially considering how often you'll likely die and have to replay them and if you've already suffered through the brutal gauntlet that is demon souls in the past then you should feel right at home with this remake as the structure of each and every area is practically unchanged every enemy ambush shortcut narrow ledge and deadly trap is exactly where it should be though you might have trouble recognizing it at first thanks to the incredible work bluepoint has done updating it all take the initial tutorial area for example it might look a bit different at first glance what with its much longer arch ceiling added vegetation and of course its vastly improved geometry and texture quality but it's still exactly the same length and leads into the same courtyard area with the game's first enemy this area is more of the same story some incredible improvements to the level of detail while also retaining all the key components and scaling i was even surprised that bluepoint kept a lot of the old structural details intact like these broken pillars here only instead of being made of stone they're now made of wood with vegetation growing around them this attention to detail not only ensures that areas share the same dna as the original 2009 game but also enables players the ability to utilize the same combat tactics as before like using certain objects as cover from enemy projectiles or creating space in order to safely heal up it's pretty shocking just how many of these tiny details blue point managed to preserve like this broken wooden door or these storage crates hidden in the corner even this small pile of rubble seems to have been purposely put in place where this fire pit used to be guaranteeing that despite the drastic change to the visual design the game still feels the same to play through but let's fast forward a bit and talk about the next major area in the game bulletaria castle seeing as this is probably one of the most recognizable sections of the game it makes sense that blue point would put an extra level of care and detail into revamping this grand entrance way like with the tutorial area the general structure remains intact but it's covered with a substantial layer of new detail to really add more depth and personality to the presentation each of the main gates flanking towers now sports a large network of scaffolding and box windows some of which have been lit alight by the rampaging dragon nearby and new decorative pieces have been put in place many of which expand on the gothic theme of the game it's a pretty impressive update and like before this extends to the finer details all around the player as well like higher resolution textures a huge increase to the amount of vegetation some of which is dynamic and even areas with wet mud that the player can leave footprints in temporarily so the big takeaway with the environments is that each level in the game is exactly the same in terms of its scaling and design but every single pillar tile patch of grass and wall has been overhauled with better textures and geometry all while ensuring the gameplay feels exactly as you remember another major contributing factor to the remix visual design is its lighting as we've seen with a lot of our direct comparisons we've made throughout this year lighting can really make or break the look of a game's visual quality and the demon souls remake demonstrates exactly how it's supposed to be done bluepoint has completely nailed the look and feel of this game's atmosphere all while drastically changing the coloration and techniques used to light the environment rather than just burying the game in its original drab brown look from before this remake offers a much more natural color tone with a good balance of blue and green light to properly capture the moody locales but it also includes much more sophisticated techniques that just weren't possible in the original game due to the limitations of the hardware volumetric lighting screen space reflections and enhanced global illumination all help to create a lifelike looking image and when combined with an hdr compatible display it's really impressive looking the original game even considering the time it released didn't utilize the most impressive lighting techniques it employed some rudimentary form of rasterization and offered no form of dynamic effects and interior areas like this section in 2-1 look absolutely terrible with a floor that's weirdly glowing red for no reason the remake fixes all this and light behaves more believably however because of this you may find yourself struggling to see in some areas especially the larger towers and cavernous drops making some of the awkward platforming even more challenging but if you want something more akin to the original game's unnatural color tones and brightness settings you can use the filters offered in the game's photo mode to change the look of the image in game now sadly demon souls on the playstation 5 does not make use of any of the new amd based retracing techniques offered by the new hardware but i think this game makes a good case that ray tracing isn't everything and just having some fantastic global illumination along with some well implemented post-processing effects can create an equally convincing image shadows have also seen a huge upgrade now the first area i checked with this was the tutorial section and i was surprised to find that unlike the original game's incredibly sharp albeit pixelated projection the new game shadows are barely noticeable but this is actually a good thing as you wouldn't expect to see a clear shadow in these atmospheric conditions and you'll find that shadows in general behave much more realistically in this remake with varying levels of intensity depending on the white source and the distance to the object casting the shadow there's no dynamic time of day so all the shadows are baked in but the way they've been baked in feels so much more precise and it helps to accentuate all the new details incorporated into the structures and the statues i was a little disappointed to find that the white cast by the player's vial of souls doesn't appear to cast any real-time shadows on the environment it does cast a player shadow which means you'll only see light cast in front of the model but it doesn't seem to cast shadows from environmental objects like fences or pillars like it probably should next up we have effects now the first effect that really took me by surprise when the remake booted up was the water simulation water simulation was handled extremely well here with some nice fluid physics that react believably whenever the player trudges through shallow pawns and puddles the original game simply emitted splash effects at greater quantities depending on the player's movement while the fluid itself remained completely static firing explosions that previously appeared as big balls of yellow light now are rendered in much higher quality with additional particle effects like embers shrapnel and smoke effects along with improved dynamic lighting capabilities that make scenes like epic boss fights all the more intense and then there's the dynamic physics that hold up surprisingly well in the original game with lots of props in the environment featuring destructibility with some impressive havoc based physical manipulation though this looks even more impressive in the remake thanks to the increase to the amount of dynamic pieces and the heavier ragdoll physics applied to things like enemy corpses but of course after 11 years all these visual improvements are expected so let's take a brief look at how the gameplay has been altered so for the most part the gameplay is purposely designed to remain almost exactly the same as the original this is the type of game that players have learned to master despite all of its strange quirks and arguably clumsy controls so knowing this bluepoint made the choice to preserve everything as closely as possible that being said there are a few interesting quality of life improvements hidden throughout first there's the character creation menu the remake expands upon the cosmetic aspect of this a great deal with a ton more options to choose between and a much cleaner interface to get a better view of what your character will end up looking like the hairstyles have been redone to be more appropriate with the time period and things like facial hair tattoos and individual body part scales have been enhanced to give you more control over how your character looks when actually playing in game all the controls and mechanics feel about the same you can run block slash and stab and all the weapons handle as you remember though blue point did manipulate the ability to roll slightly allowing players to roll omnidirectionally now the remake also changes a pretty major aspect of the healing system by greatly limiting the number of healing items a player can hold at them at any one time green grass for example has had its max carry capacity decreased from almost 100 down to 50 and stronger healing items like new moon are now limited to only 10. so you're gonna have to be a bit more conservative with your healing items as you travel through the game now the demon souls remake also adds in a new photo mode which offers a surprisingly large amount of options to tweak in order to capture your favorite moments with a high resolution snapshot and the last but not least there's the new features made possible by the ps5's unique hardware capabilities including haptic feedback that adds in more precise controller vibration that not only adds to the immersion but can also warn the player of an impending attack and adaptive triggers that will offer more tension when trying to use tools like the bow and arrow and then there's the toggable graphics modes allowing for a native 4k cinematic mode at 30fps or the much smoother dynamic 4k at a locked 60fps which i strongly recommend using there's a few other changes hidden throughout like new secret items to find and some tweaks to the multi-part content but otherwise the gameplay experience should remain very loyal to the source material finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which version of the game do you think offers the best overall sound quality brave soul who fears not death i shall guide you so that you may love the old one back to slumber brave soul who fears not death i shall guide you to the fissure so that you may lull the old one back to slumber yes and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall the demon souls remake is probably one of the most visually stunning updates to a game i've covered all year and that's really saying something because the remakes for tony hawk mafia and final fantasy vii have all been similarly incredible every character model has been beautifully recreated with much higher fidelity textures and more complex geometry giving them this depth and detail that we could only imagine before and the level environments that so many demon souls veterans have painfully embedded into their memories have been given a total makeover while still staying incredibly loyal to the source material and enhancing it with new effects details and a few gameplay tweaks to improve on the game's very few shortcomings now if you weren't a fan of demon souls before then i can't say this remake will necessarily change your mind it's still an incredibly difficult game and there's a fair amount of trial and error involved along with troll messages left by online players and the occasionally annoying invasion that you still can't disable but for players looking to really push their playstation 5 and see what it's capable of and who are willing to learn all the ins and outs of from software's breakaway masterpiece this is no question a must-have title for any early adopter of the console and sets the bar exceptionally high for both remakes and playstation's well-received exclusive lineup but what do you guys think are you impressed by what bluepoint managed to accomplish here or do you still prefer the look and feel of the original game let me know in the comments section and once again i want to give a
