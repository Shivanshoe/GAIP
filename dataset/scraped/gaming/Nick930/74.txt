[Music] this video is brought to you by ubisoft welcome back everybody i'm nick930 and in today's video we're going to take a closer look at ubisoft's recently released reveal trailer for their upcoming extreme sports game writers republic for those of you that may have missed the trailer writer's republic is a brand new multiplayer based extreme sports game where you can ride around huge environments with your friends using a wide variety of different disciplines including but not limited to biking snowboarding skiing and even jetpacking now i'll be sure to provide plenty of additional coverage for this game when i get some hands-on time with it but for today i want to focus on simply breaking down the trailer and discussing all the interesting features that we can expect when the game releases in late february 2021 alright so let's kick this trevor breakdown off with our first few clips showcasing a pretty diverse group of what looks like player avatars some of which are equipped with some pretty wild cosmetic items the first and quite possibly the most eye-catching clothing item here is this golden bike helmet shaped like a skull with a sort of feathered mohawk x'd out eyes and two smoke bomb canisters jammed into the mouthpiece this is a crazy cosmetic to show off right from the get-go and sort of sets the tone for this game as an experience that really isn't trying to take itself too seriously you'll also notice he's wearing some of those colored glow stick necklaces on top of what looks like a pair of gold medals that could possibly be equippable awards for winning specific competitions throughout the game after the text highlighting the many different ubisoft subsidiaries currently working on this project we get a glimpse of a brief taunting animation of the character pretending to look off in the distance and i'm guessing based on several other similar showboating animations throughout the trailer these emotes can be triggered manually while exploring the world our next character seems to be wearing a similar helmet only this one is pink has a different design and the smoke bombs are not emitting any smoke possibly suggesting that the effect can be toggled on and off skipping ahead we get a glimpse of several other characters most of which are wearing much more grounded clothing like jackets hats and goggles though there are a few characters that stand out like this guy wearing a demon panda costume or what looks like a competitive skier with a race suit and a number assigned to them based on these first few intro shots we get a clear indication that ryder's republic will feature a robust set of cosmetic items to select between including different tops bottoms headgear head types and accessories along with plenty of emotes to help express yourself which you'll see plenty more examples of throughout the course of this trailer but it's this next clip that really stands out of a player attempting to ride a bike across this insanely narrow metal pole stretched across the canyon this is the only time that this activity is showcased in the trailer so it's hard to tell exactly how this will work but i'm genuinely excited to try this out there's quite a few videos out there of real life extreme bikers doing crazy slackline stunts like this and to have this featured in a game to try without the terrifying consequences sounds like it could be a lot of fun though i do hope that this mechanic doesn't rely on any form of quick time events or mini-games to maintain balance and actually lets you control the balance with a joystick or something this next sequence shows six players lined up possibly for an event with five of them on bikes while the sixth is set up with a pair of skis but right as they're about to set off an even bigger group of players shows up behind them with a wide variety of different sports to showcase the absolute chaos you can expect on the mountains writer's republic looks to be much more ambitious than other similar titles in this genre in that it will feature huge online player lobbies with everyone capable of playing the game their own way in this shot alone you can see bikers wing suits skiers and snowboarders all at once according to ubisoft riders republic's multiplayer will feature several structured activities including pvp arena battles mass hill races and casual trick sessions but my guess is that there will also be a more open-ended free roam mode for players looking to just ride down each course at their own pace without any sort of restrictions i also wanted to point out the environment itself that looks like it might offer some unique obstacles to overcome depending on the sport discipline you happen to be using this snowboarder for example seems to jump from one snow bank over to the other avoiding the patch of grass in between and lands slightly short of it causing a bit of dirt to kick up for a split second this could suggest that despite the many different sports available to choose between you may find yourself forced to switch depending on the course itself with the rocky desert cliff sides we saw earlier not being suitable for skis or snowboards and i can't imagine the racing bikes will be very good choices for the thick snow high up in the mountains which brings us to our next scene that shows a large snow park in the mountains called bear park again we can see a ton of players all jumping around independently with their preferred gear but what's important about this clip is that we do get confirmation that there will be a full set of tricks to perform for most of these sport disciplines including grabs spins and even slides in this next sequence we get a better glimpse of the desert biome available in the game with a huge mountain pass loaded with several bikers racing to the top peak while another player in a jet pack flies overhead this gives us another clear indication of how level designs will be handled in writer's republic with more structured courses that complement what ubisoft is calling a massive multiplayer playground this i think was the right call as the open world design often results in a lot of bland empty open spaces and games that attempt it whereas downhill games with more structured level designs often feature more interesting paths and shortcuts that are a lot more fun to ride down and explore contrasting to that large open desert we get another shot of a snowy hillside only this one is overrun with players all wearing some of the more goofy available cosmetic items including an inflatable t-rex costume a few panda and bunny helmets and a giant giraffe head on the horizon which again all highlights the more light-hearted tone that ubisoft seems to be taking with this game now the next few clips show off a few things first it looks like you will be able to freely explore courses while other players are participating in events as you can see this one player doing a backflip over a road race below then we get a few more shots that highlight the available tricks including bike specific tricks like tail whips and bunny hops while snowboarding and skiing will no doubt have a big presence in this game it does seem that ryder's republic's most defining features will be with its wide range of biker options there's a lot of different bikes available to choose from including road freestyle slope type enduro and downhill and your choice of bike can impact your character's effectiveness on certain courses which is shown pretty clearly when this biker attempts to jump this gap on what looks like a road racing bike and eats it at the bottom next up we're given a little bit more information regarding the types of events you can expect throughout the game first we have a big x games super pipe competition where players will probably need to score big points on the pipe to earn one of the medals we saw earlier then there's the red bull rampage that looks to be a sort of time trial bike course with lots of deadly turns along the ridge out in the desert this course looks to be really technical where you need to bunny hop and control your bike's pitch to land properly and then drop in several feet below on an even more narrow path you can even swap the viewpoints of first person for those with a stomach for it now this next section of the trailer helps to explain exactly how these course environments are going to be handled as i mentioned before writer's republic is not an open world game instead you'll be able to select between several large-scale environments that based on what were being shown should still offer plenty of freedom and variety this first large area referred to in the game as yosemite valley seems to stretch on for miles with lots of dense forests and mountains flanking either side of the trail from the looks of it this area may not suit disciplines like skiing or snowboarding very well but it should be fun to explore using mountain bikes or these paramotors that can be used to soar through the air there's even a brief glimpse of some fauna hiding on the forest floor that could potentially serve as a hazard if the player gets too close the camera then zooms out to show a large map screen that does a much better job of explaining how these games environments are laid out with yosemite valley consisting of several smaller courses of its own like glacier point or north dome the player's cursor then drifts south into a new section of the map called bryce canyon that seems to contain at least four separate downhill courses all within the same general area this is probably one of the more impressive looking sections shown so far with lots of beautifully sculpted mesas weaving around large rock outcroppings and creating a maze of deadly paths to descend from we next get a glimpse of mammoth mountain a snowy mountainside with a large city area towards the bottom now this section of the map has me a little bit confused typically with snowboarding games areas designed for pulling off tricks are all tilted at an angle so that the player can gain speed for jumps but here everything looks to be set up more like a skatepark with ramps facing both directions to allow players to travel back and forth there's a few sloped surfaces but i'm thinking the trick mechanics will be built with a more arcade-like sensibility meaning physics may be a bit more forgiving something we'll see more of in a bit but before we get into that the trailer shows two more areas zion which looks to be a winding canyon filled with long roads and high cliff walls and grand teton a dark snowy cliffside with lots of sharp peaks next we get a better glimpse at the game's arcade trick system with a large ramp park with what seems like no natural physics at play there's ramps facing all directions with no sign of any sort of required momentum and there's even a full inverted rail to grind on again pointing towards something a bit less realistic additionally we also get a glimpse of one of the available competitive modes where landing tricks off of certain obstacles will transform that ramp or rail into your own team's color and finally we have our final sequence in the trailer a huge race with upwards of 40 players all participating on downhill bikes this might be one of the most defining aspects of writer's republic this idea that no matter what even if you don't have any friends online to join on you'll never feel alone in this game which explains why ubisoft has chosen the term massive multiplayer playground to best describe this experience all the events shown so far like arena battles trick sessions and this mass hill race are designed specifically around this concept and with the game's many different locations serving as individual lobbies the player density per area should be far greater than it would be for a game built around an open world environment i think overall ryder's republic is shaping up to be an incredibly ambitious extreme sports experience there's a ton of disciplines for players to experiment with including snowboarding skiing wing suits biking and even para motors offering a little something for everyone but it's certainly the biking that has me the most interested with lots of different bike types that will directly impact your ability to cross certain terrain and a robust set of tricks to learn as you explore the different large courses throughout the game but what do you guys think are
