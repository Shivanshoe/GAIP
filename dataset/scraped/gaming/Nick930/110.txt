this video is brought to you by Ubisoft welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're gonna take a look at Ghost Recon break points new Ghost experience and see how the new immersive mode compared to the games original regular mode that it launched with now in case you're unfamiliar with this game in its history Ghost Recon breakpoint is the latest entry to the long-running tactical shooter series though it's new design choices left many scratching their heads much like other popular Ubisoft properties like the division and Assassin's Creed breakpoint adopted a new progression system built around tier based loop meaning players would uncover more powerful gear as they progress through the story even if the weapons themselves were virtually identical and while this style of gameplay may appeal to some many longtime fans of the Ghost Recon franchise including myself felt like this may have been too much of a departure for series that has built itself upon realistic tactical warfare to address this concern the team at Ubisoft Paris has spent the past several months creating an alternate way to play more in line with the franchise's core values and for today's video I want to show you exactly what they've managed to incorporate including the new parameter options along with details on the new deep state Splinter Cell DLC and if you like the sound of the stuff I cover in this video and want to give Ghost Recon breakpoint a try Ubisoft is making the game available to try for free this weekend only alongside a big sale up to 67 percent off you can find the specifics of this deal in the link provided in the description alright so to kick this comparison off let's start by going over all the new ghost experience options now when you boot the game up after the update you'll be given the choice between the original regular experience complete with gear levels and loot tiers or the new immersive experience that removes those aspects altogether upon selecting one of these you're brought to a menu of parameters allowing you to fine-tune your choice you can now freely adjust many aspects of the gameplay including the difficulty the heads-up display and various gameplay mechanics but the most notable change here is the gear level option with gear level enabled every weapon or armor piece you find in the environment has a level associated with it with different colors denoting different level this means in theory that you can grab a gun like the MPX early on in the game that deals a low amount of damage to enemies and then find the exact same MPX later that deals significantly more damage simply because the number attached to it is higher this is a very popular gameplay design for most games as it encourages players to search around the environments more and explore the game world at a more distinct pace with gear level disabled you can remove a level based equipment and loot tiers entirely this means that a gun behaves exactly as you'd expect it deals the same amount of damage no matter how far you get in the game and if you want to enhance its abilities further you need to upgrade that specific weapon using weapon parts this also removes duplicate weapons in your inventory and changes all the loot crate's scattered around the island into areas where you can easily swap to a different weapon you still need to collect blueprints and bring them back to the merchant to add those weapons permanently to your arsenal but you don't need to worry about building new weapons based on your player level anymore now of course if you've played break point before you probably know by now that even with the gear level enabled weapons still behave more realistically than they wouldn't say the division enemy soldiers for example are in no way bullet sponges a headshot will still kill them instantly but other more powerful enemies like behemoth drones feature health bars and based on your weapon level they can take a while to destroy with gear level disabled damages based entirely off of your weapons core stats and destroying armor plating and targeting weak points will make short work of even the most powerful vehicles making this mode more realistic but also slightly easier in the process speaking of which let's talk a bit about the game's difficulty options now when the game first released we were given the option between four overarching difficulties arcade which had a strong aim assist and much slower enemy response times regular which was the recommended way to play advanced that offered slower health regen and smarter enemies and extreme also known as simulation mode without means that are fast smart and deal devastating amounts of damage with the new ghost experience you're given a ton of options to fine-tune the specifics of the game's difficulty and gameplay mechanics you can still tweak the detection speed and damage output of enemies we can now also tweak tactical settings like how come injuries are how many bandages you have access to the number of available weapon slots how stamina functions and even whether you drop unused ammo when reloading a weapon magazine with the regular parameters this defaults to the standard confirmed setting so you'll never run out of bandages you can reload all you want and injuries are rare but with the new immersive parameters bandages are limited ammo is lost on reloads and injuries will occur frequently and of course you can always use the custom menus to fine-tune each and every one of these options to make the game play the way you want next up there's the interface settings now this isn't technically new the game already had a pretty robust list of hot elements that you could tweak allowing you to easily reduce clutter and fine-tune the game to be as immersive as you want by default the regular mode will shift the interface to full while immersive sets it's a minimal making it impossible to mark enemies or track them in the game's mini-map I personally find this to be a bit excessive especially if you plan on playing the game with a friend but again it's all personal preference and if you want the game to be as immersive as possible you can hide all the UI elements the next setting here is the social and bivouacs option for those of you unfamiliar breakpoint features a safe zone hub that players can walk around shop for new items accept missions and hang out with other players in with the new ghost experience this hub area can now be set to private meaning you'll only see yourself and your friends roaming around here this is a nice change as it was always weird having all these additional ghosts running around when you're supposed to be part of a fracture squad but again if you prefer the old design you can easily tweak this option to behave as it was intended unfortunately it does seem as though the game still requires an internet connection at all times even if you set the hub to private so keep this in mind if you have an unstable connection and finally there's the guided mode again this isn't anything new this feature was technically available before when this mode is enabled the game behaves like every other open-world game missions are acquired from NPCs a waypoint is dropped onto your map you travel there to feed some enemies and move on to the next objective but for players looking to be even more immersed they can set the game to not be guided removing direct waypoints from the map and forcing them to rely on clues to identify the location of their next objective this is a really cool option and one that I like to use when I have the time but if you find yourself running around in circles for hours and have no idea what to do next then you're probably better off leaving the guided mode enabled and now I want to take a moment to talk about my favorite new addition here the new Splinter Cell inspired episode - aka deep state unlike the Splinter Cell related content that came out for wild lands deep state offers a true stealth action experience complete with eight missions to play through to new character classes to utilize and a bunch of Splinter Cell related gear to unlock for players interested in this you can try out the first mission for free as a sort of teaser however after playing through the entire DLC pack this weekend I have to say that the first mission is a very poor indicator of what the rest of the deep state content is actually like it starts off okay with you infiltrating a dock area and meeting up with the victor cos to get intel on Sam Fisher's location but once you meet up with Fisher himself you'll soon find yourself in an on-rails shooting gallery completely disregarding what Splinter Cell is all about thankfully by the second mission this all starts to make a little bit more sense as Sam tells Nomad that he's gonna try and train him in the ways of fourth echelon and introduce more stealth based approaches to objectives you don't actually learn any new moves but the missions themselves are designed almost entirely around stealth your primary objective is to locate the mysterious strategist the head of a project called a claw and one of the few people left on the island who may have some information on nomads lost partner Midas missions typically involves sneaking into large military bases acquiring Intel or sabotaging enemy hardware there's even areas with laser trip wire alarms that can be bypassed by either using an EMP or by carrying a body straight through the sensors by the end of the content the experience felt more like a new spin or sell game then even Splinter Cell blacklist did what's more this DLC brings back some of the classic music from chaos theory and even intensifies based on your detection level there's some really cool fanservice here and I hope this is a sign that if we ever do see a new splinter cell game the development studio behind it recognized by chaos theory is so beloved by fans and try to build off of its excellent design deep state also comes with two new character classes to choose between a salon and engineer the Echelon class is predictably built around being a stealthy infiltrator with a new technique called sonar vision that emits a pulse that will highlight enemy straight through the environment special end players are also equipped with a shock pistol a callback to Sam's iconic sticky shocker gadget the shock pistol can neutralize any enemy within range instantly and can even disable electronics like drones and laser grids esalaam players also benefit from having increased south when hiding in shadows higher damage from pistols and the reflex shot that allows players to auto aim as are being detected sort of like the gameplay mechanic in Metal Gear Solid 5 the engineer class isn't quite as stealthy it appears to be based on the mercenary from splinter cell's multiplayer modes and allows players to deploy an automatic quadrotor drone to shoot at enemies and an additional supply drone to resupply ammunition engineer players also deal extra damage to drones and have improved grenade launcher stats again likely a callback to the mercenaries from Pandora tomorrow and chaos theory overall these eight missions will take you roughly four to five hours to play through maybe even more depending on the difficulty settings you decide to play it with and if you're a fan of splitter cell it's certainly something to check out and that wraps up this episode of Tobruk comparison overall Ghost Recon breakpoint is in a far better state than it was last year when I played it the game's new ghost experience options are phenomenal and finally allow players like myself to set up the game the way that we want to play if you liked how Ghost Recon breakpoint Sloot function before you can continue to play that way and enjoy the new splitter cell based content but if you were turned off of this game because of the tiered luden enemy ranks then this is your opportunity to finally jump in and if you're still skeptical then don't take my word for it try the game out for yourself Ghost Recon breakpoint is free to play this weekend and if you end up liking what you play you can pick up the game now for up to 67 percent off but what do you guys think is the new Ghost experienced the overhaul breakpoint needed let me know in the comments section and don't forget to Like and subscribe for more videos posted every week
