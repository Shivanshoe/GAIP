this video is brought to you by amd welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the most recent entry to the dirt series dirt 5 and see how it compares both visually and from a gameplay perspective to its 2017 predecessor dirt 4. for this analysis both games are being played on the latest high-end amd pc with a radeon rx 6800 xt graphics card and a ryzen 5950x cpu allowing for all the settings including amd's fidelity fx to be cranked up to the highest values at a native 4k resolution and as always the motion bar options will be disabled for cleaner still images also before we get started i think it's important to understand that despite the naming convention these two games offer drastically different experiences from each other with dirt 4 being built primarily around point-to-point rally races and its randomized track generator while dirt 5 leans more heavily on its circuit-based rallycross events because of these changes it's difficult to make simple direct side-by-side comparisons as many of the cars are built to different specifications and none of the tracks seem to be shared between the two games and so while i'll still be talking about the visual differences between the two games i want to spend more of this video highlighting the changes to the available features along with how the overall gameplay experience differs from one title to the next alright so let's kick things off with the presentation by first going over some of the shared vehicle models starting with the peugeot 205 t16 evo 2. now from a distance these two cars look practically identical they have the same brace spoiler the same rear panel and even the same number of bolts holding on the mud flaps but there are a few minor cosmetic alterations that have been made likely to make the car appear more suitable for the different events available in dirt 5. first the front bumper is equipped with a set of rally lights now making it more effective for night racing additionally there's a bit more fine detail along the windows and engine compartment with new visible screws holding on the side windows and higher fidelity assets visible in the back however i did find that the image resolution overall doesn't appear to be as crisp in the latest game despite ensuring that the settings are set to their same native 4k resolutions without any of the adaptive scaling options enabled my guess is that this has more to do with dirt 5's implementation of temporal anti-aliasing that does not seem to have any sharpening option built in though amd's fidelity fx ambient occlusion option does help to offset this slightly by allowing smaller details to be more defined relative to the light in the scene with the interior we can get an even more drastic example of how the game's lighting and taa implementation has impacted the visual quality while shadowing is undoubtedly more authentic in dirt 5 there's no question that the details along the dash are more clear and richly detailed in dirt 4 with all the dials and labels being clearly legible it's a distinction that persists with practically every vehicle model i observed and no combination of resolution settings seemed to make the image any clearer in dirt 5. what's more the rear view and side mirrors are no longer functional in dirt 5 displaying only rough cube maps as opposed to the low res real-time reflections used previously i think if i had to choose the vehicles in dirt 4 absolutely look superior to the ones in the latest game with a sharper cleaner appearance overall but it's still worth acknowledging that dirt 5's vehicles react more realistically to ambient lighting and offer some extra detail along the body moving on we have the environments this is where the two games differ the most in both games players can choose to race on courses from around the world with multiple layouts track conditions and disciplines to master but that's where the similarities seem to end in dirt 4 a bulk of the available tracks are point-to-point rallies when players race in staggered launches against the clock without having to worry about overtaking opponents or getting run off the road the opposite is true with dirt 5. in dirt 5 practically every course in the game is a closed loop circuit with much wider lanes and big jumps designed to offer more exciting racing action with multiple cars at once these types of races are offered in dirt 4 but they're rare and there's very few cars available to use by comparison this is because dirt 4 really leans into its rally racing and makes use of a special random track generator mechanic called your stage that can create an infinite selection of rally courses using only a few simple parameters set by the player while a cool piece of tech this random generator does suffer from frequent redundancies like placing a lot of the same tiles down and creating a lot of repetitive track designs and at the end of the day the courses themselves really aren't all that interesting to race on the courses in the campaign mode are all pre-built but even these feel weirdly artificial and lack any sort of memorable designs that's why it's a relief to see that with dirt 5 the focus has been turned back towards specially designed courses each with their own distinct look and feel available locations include the hillsides of rio de janeiro the muddy jungles in southern china the cliff sides of greece aquarium rome and even the frozen waterfront outside of new york city each location is bursting with color and is rich in detail with lots more npcs cheering from the sidelines significantly more foliage and plenty of other distracting visual effects to give the game a more chaotic and festival-like feel dirt 4 on the other hand seems to borrow a lot from its simulation-based dirt rally spin-off series in that its tracks feel more grounded and realistic locations include lots of thick forests and wide open valleys across the world including australia spain sweden norway wales and the us but aside from some distinct geometry and weather options it's difficult to really tell the difference between them all these tracks are often scarcely detailed with a few grass sprites bushes and trees mixed in with pockets of npc crowds and parked vehicles the more circuit-oriented rallycross events offer a somewhat similar look and feel to the many circuits and dirt 5 but the latter game sports a higher level of detail in things like the dirt roads especially in regards to its tessellation effects what's more dirt 5 also offers a leg up when it comes to the lighting as well with significantly more color in practically every frame everything feels so rich and vibrant with lots of colored lights and effects like smoke and confetti thrown in to ensure that each turn offers at least some palette variety other lighting effects like global illumination and bloom are also cranked up a bit more with new almost blinding simulated hdr effects thrown in alongside volumetric light shafts that seamlessly transition throughout the course of each race dirt 4's lighting feels remarkably dated by comparison even the more vibrant locations feel flat and lifeless with static light maps that don't transition quite as smoothly and this is hurt even more by the incredibly poor shadow implementation that more often than not delivers low res pixelated projections on the ground that doesn't seem to line up with the relative white in the scene der 5's lighting design and shadow quality isn't exactly revolutionary but it's still a welcome step up from before and the implementation of screen space reflections to highlight the muddy rain sucked tracks looks fantastic especially when combined with night races filled with plenty of environmental prop whites like neon loops and colored lanterns then of course we have effects here we have a bit of a mixed bag on the one hand i believe the vehicle damage model and destruction effects are superior in dirt 4 with more pieces that can break away and much more realistic consequences for damaging the car the physics effects aren't necessarily the most realistic in the world of racing games but it's still some of the better damage models offered in the mainline dirt series dirt 5 however feels like a step back in this department as its damage effects are minimal likely to encourage the game's more light-hearted and sim-cady style players can smash directly into opponents without fear of repercussions and are rarely taken out of a race just for hitting a corner too hard now on the other hand dirt 5 does at least offer some better smoke and dirt effects with more particles kicking off the ground at any given time to give that proper dirt racing feel what's more dirt 5 also offers more advanced dynamic tessellation effects causing vehicle tires to transform the terrain temporarily especially when dealing with snow or thick mud it looks fantastic and you don't really get this impression from dirt 4 especially considering most of the tracks offer really dry dirt roads and packed snow tracks so overall at least when it comes to the visuals it's difficult to say one looks better than the other unlike past codemasters games i've analyzed we're not really looking at a yearly iteration of the same tracks with some slight technical changes dirt 5 is a completely different game altogether with brand new closed circuit tracks lots of new cars and a complete overall to the design of things like lighting and effects sure the image is sharper in dirt 4 and the damage is minimal now but i think this feels more like an artistic choice built around dirt 5's much more arcade-like gameplay design speaking of which let's switch gears now and talk a little bit more about the gameplay and available features so first off there's the campaign mode in dirt 4 the campaign was your run-of-the-mill racing career with four different disciplines and lots of configurable difficulty settings to fine-tune the game to fit the player's playstyle dirt 5 is a bit more structured though there's now only one campaign with each of the available disciplines built into the main path and the game's difficulty is based on the player's progression the campaign also has a slightly more lighthearted feel to it with new radio djs voiced by nolan north and troy baker adding a bit of comic relief in between races available events in dirt 5 include lots of different variations of rallycross races like rally raids land rush and stampedes but these all handle about the same with the only real differences being the available vehicle sets there's also a few more interesting events that have been added in like sprint which has you drifting around at high speeds in a sprint car pathfinder that challenges players to climb up incredibly steep inclines and sharp turns to beat the clock and the return of the fan favorite jimmy kana where players are awarded points for pulling off crazy drift maneuvers and jumps the overall tone and feel of the game feels more reminiscent of older dirt games like dirt 2. and while i do wish there were actual rally races and trailblazer events thrown in as well i think this is the right fit for the mainline dirt series as the experience is just more fun and enjoyable overall outside the main events dirt 5 also offers a few more nice additions including the long requested photo mode to snap high quality screenshots without having to rely on the replay cam and an easier to use livery editor to make some wild designs for your favorite cars the your stage random rally course generator does not make a return appearance for obvious reasons but in its place is a new custom track editor called playgrounds arena creator mode where players can craft their very own wacky obstacle courses for players to race through and then share them online for other players to attempt dirt 5 even offers a surprisingly rare feature for pc players with a full split screen option built in allowing players in the same room to play together on the same computer finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you think has the better audio quality and design go go go [Music] um [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall i was pleasantly surprised with the changes codemasters has made with dirt 5. the visual quality isn't as sharp or clean as its predecessor but the level of detail and quality of effects like lighting shadows and particles are all a step in the right direction and i'm glad to see developer made tracks being added back into the rotation rather than the dull random track generator we were given last time what's more there's a lot of great new additions to help make the game more enjoyable for longer and i personally found myself playing more of dirt 5 in the past few weeks than i've ever played of dirt 4 thanks to its more interesting style and more fun gameplay design though this will obviously depend on the player if you were looking for a more hardcore racing sim then you won't find that with dirt 5 and you would be better off sticking with dirt rally games instead but if you're disappointed with dirt 4 and have been looking for a game with lots of muddy drifts and jumps then dirt 5 may be worth checking out now if you are interested in playing dirt 5 and want to play the game as smoothly as possible be sure to check out amd's new line of radeon 6000 series gpus including the amd radeon rx 6800xt which was used to record all the footage in this video powered by the new rdna 2 architecture the rx 6800 xt
