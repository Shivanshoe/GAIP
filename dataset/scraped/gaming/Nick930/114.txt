welcome back everyone I'm Nick 930 and to celebrate the upcoming release of Eid software's doom eternal I want to share with you the complete history of doom [Music] doom is hands-down one of the most iconic first-person shooter franchises of all time and it's influenced hundreds of video games with its revolutionary gunplay mechanics over-the-top violence and competitive multiplayer death matches each title in the series centers around an unnamed Space Marine on Mars in its surrounding moons who's forced to face off against an invasion of demonic creatures straight from hell using a variety of weapons like shotguns rocket launchers and chainsaws the series is often credited for popularizing the first-person shooter genre and to this day continues to thrill gamers with its smooth combat and unapologetic levels of insanity so how did a series was such an absurd premise get to be so insanely popular and how has it managed to persevere for nearly 27 years to answer that we need to start by taking it way back to the original game in the early 1990s in 1991 its software had started to make a name for themselves with their first break away hit Wolfenstein 3d that established the basic format for the first-person shooter genre as I detailed in my documentary on Wolfenstein its software's lead programmer John Carmack utilized a sophisticated technique referred to as ray casting that creates the illusion of a 3d space by utilizing 2d level data well certainly an impressive feat the technique limited the game to very basic level structures without any sort of verticality to overcome these limitations Carmack had already begun working on the next revolution in the FPS with the more complex engine capable of calculating vertical 3d space the question now was what kind of game would they make to incorporate this complex design they consider both the new Commander Keen game they're more child-friendly platformer series that they worked on in the past and even another entry to Wolfenstein but ultimately settled on doing something more original and much darker using their in progress campaign of dungeon dragons as inspiration lead designer Tom Hall built a massive design document for their next project titled doom doom was intended to be unlike any video game that had come before it with a seamless large world to explore complex cinematics and deep lower off brought to life with Carmex new engine architecture and their revolutionary first-person shooter gameplay mechanics but when Carmack was shown the document he dismissed the idea focusing on the story famously saying story in a game is like story in a porn movie it's expected to be there but it's not that important many members of it signed it with Carmex view on story ultimately leaving Hall feeling isolated from the team as he worked to reconfigure his design for the new gameplay focused direction by the start of 1992 full development / doom had begun using Carmex early version of the new engine architecture both he and Romero began designing environments experimenting with the tools with angled walls and complex architecture meanwhile two artists Kevin cloud and Adrian Carmack worked on the design of the game's models many of the monsters were created using clay molds that were then scanned and placed into the game as two-dimensional sprites for the more complex models they even hired a professional Hollywood master maker to build sculptures using latex and metal components giving them an even more unique look within the first month of development it were able to piece together an early tech demo for the game with a complex heads-up display to simulate an advanced soldiers helmet along with a few animated monsters and basic environments throughout the course of the next few months the developers expanded the scope of the experience significantly level architecture became more complex more enemy and object models were scanned in and Carmack was forced to incorporate a new rendering technique called binary space partitioning allowing for static map elements to be drawn more efficiently with this new tool at their disposal its software began to rapidly piece together the rest of the game throughout the course of the next few months levels became even more complex more weapons were introduced AI movement and hit points were coated in and new flying enemies were incorporated to help add variety to the action by the end of the summer it had become clear that Tom halls vision for doom differ too greatly from the rest of the development team and he parted ways with the company in August of 93 following his departure sandy Peterson and Dave Taylor jumped on board who assisted with additional gameplay elements including the game's auto map system and ramping up the level designs Hall had left behind in the final months of development the team work tirelessly to finalize the project they did away with things like collectible unholy treasures and incorporated new multi-part components including the ability to play the entire game cooperatively and the revolutionary competitive deathmatch that allows players to fight each other in specialized arenas finally only a few weeks before the holidays their passion project had been completed and its offer released the first episode of doom a game that would forever change the gaming industry doom takes place in the future but a series of large facilities built along the surface of Mars and its surrounding moons the player assumes the role of an unnamed Space Marine who's stuck providing security in a waste management facility after assaulting his superior officer meanwhile the Union Aerospace Corporation the ones responsible for building these large space facilities have been conducting a series of classified experiments involving interdimensional gateways but after a UAC scientist mistakenly opened a gateway to hell demons begin to invade the area killing everything in their path the players character colloquy referred to as the doom guy ends up being the sole survivor of the incident and is forced to fight through health forces in order to escape it's a simple narrative one that's delivered entirely to short text excerpts at the beginning and end of each episode but its simplicity is exactly the reason why it works as it avoids asking how or why it just lets players respond with plenty of hot lead the game plays a lot like in software's previous work with the ability to move around a 3d world and first-person and a main objective for reaching the level exit with the bonus challenge of finding all the pick up items and killing everything that moves but unlike Wolfenstein doom features more gameplay variety weapons for example now range from standard firearms like a pistol shotgun and chain gun to more extreme armaments like the chainsaw the rocket launcher the plasma gun and of course the BFG 9000 to complement these weapons doom features a diverse cast of demonic foes the game starts off slow introducing enemies like zombie soldiers and fireball throwing imps and gradually introduces more challenging enemies like the demon aka pinky they're invisible counterparts the flaming lost souls the floating Cyclops kakko demon and of course the towering cyberdemon each enemy offers their own unique attacks and vulnerabilities forcing the player to carefully juggle their weapons while constantly moving to avoid taking damage if the player does get hurt they'll lose points to both their armor and health and just like in Wolfenstein will need to collect items in the environment to stay alive along with health and ammo pickups first can also put power-ups that bestow special abilities the berserk powerup for example replenishes the player's health and gives them increased strength to punch enemies into paste while other power-ups like the radiation suit help players traverse the game's many treacherous level environments speaking of which the environments play a massive role in dooms gameplay in Wolfenstein players need to open doors shoot enemies and occasionally search for keys to open more doors everything was flat and straightforward but doom offers verticality to its worlds adding a new dynamic to the movement pairs can fall off of ledges and need to find either rising platforms or short stairs to climb back up enemies can also be located at variable Heights now and while the player still can't look up or down they can fire straight at an enemy and automatically target them regardless of their elevation the environments can also be manipulated using wall mounted switches that often cause large platforms to appear or doors to open this increased verticality highly buried enemy configurations and unique Arsenal all make dumi far more interesting shooter than its predecessor and the added multi-part components only further add to the game's robust feature set Doom was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before Wolfenstein 3d may have opened the door into the FPS genre the doom was the one that blew it off its hinges it was insanely popular and received an overwhelmingly positive response from fans and critics alike it received several game of the Year awards and is still considered by many as one of the most influential video games of all time in fact the game was so popular upon release that it crashed several network servers forcing universities and companies to put strict bans on students and employees attempting to download and play the game on top of this the game also generated a ton of controversy in the early 90s video games were only just starting to incorporate high levels of gore with games like Mortal Kombat prompting u.s. congressional hearings only a week before dooms release as expected the game was criticized by a few for its satanic imagery and excessive violence and was frequently used as the scapegoat for mass violence including the Columbine massacre of 1999 but these controversies were minor when compared to the overwhelming success of the game Doom helped to establish the backbone of the FPS for the next decade completely overshadowing the contributions of other FPS games released around the same time and with fans desperate for more demon killing action its software immediately began development on a sequel one that would build upon the original success with doom 2 development went a lot more smoothly all the tools were already made so the focus shifted more towards expanding upon the initial formula more demonic creatures were created a new weapon was introduced yes Annie Peterson along with newcomer American McGee pieced together even more complex stages filled with more challenging layouts and enemy configurations only 10 months after the first game its software released their highly anticipated follow-up doom to hell on earth doom 2 takes place directly after the cliffhanger at the end of dooms final episode Inferno warehouse forces have managed to invade earth itself the player continues to play the role of the doom guy and are forced to kill even more demonic creatures as they attempt to rid the world of the unwelcome visitors like before doom 2 doesn't emphasize its story everything is explained through text logs at the start of episodes though interestingly there's no longer a map screen indicating the players progress in the narrative highlighting an even greater desire to steer away from story and just let players kill crazy monsters doom 2 plays almost the same as its predecessor players explore maze-like environments fight increasingly more challenging enemies and pick up powerful weapons along the way however doom 2 mixes up the formula with the introduction of several new enemy types including the arachnid Ron's pal Knights heavy weapon dudes the revenant the arch file pain elementals and the men Kubis these enemies greatly impact the flow of the action forcing players to prioritize their attacks more carefully the game's difficulty overall feels much less forgiving traps are more common and large open-ended arenas require more precise movement and reaction times to keep under control doom 2 also introduces the fan-favorite super shotgun a double-barrel sawed-off that deals significantly more damage dents pump-action counterpart at the cost of a slower reload speed overall doom 2 makes only a few changes to the formula though they do make for a much more fast-paced and intense experience something that only further strengthened the series popularity it was met with a familiar positive response with many plays in the game for his complex level designs and increased enemy variety though a few criticized it for failing to innovate nothing about the game was typically different from the original making it feel more like an expansion pack than an entirely separate product that's it software handle distribution for doom 2 they also supported the original game as well they released multiple ports for several systems including the Sega Genesis 32 Atari Jaguar SNES and with the help of williams entertainment and the original playstation they even released an updated version for him das called the ultimate doom complete with a bonus 4th episode to convince newcomers to jump into the series doom 2 however didn't get quite the same level of multi-platform support it perceived a couple of expansions like the master levels and the final doom both of which were created mostly by third party level creators but the core game itself never saw releases on other console platforms at the time likely because of all the tactical compromises that had to be made previously that just wouldn't be possible the more ambitious sequel but despite this Doom hype was at an all-time high and doom tomb became the best-selling computer game of the year at this point practically everyone had heard of doom his popularity transcended the relatively small computer gaming community and became a worldwide phenomenon churning its software until legends in the industry and of course it didn't take long for other developments to use to take notice as fan-made levels and distribution continue to grow around the title the age of Doom clones arrived soon after spawning countless titles all based on Carmex graphical architecture games like heretic Hexen duke nukem star wars dark forces and countless more flooded the market and were all subsequently given the name doom clones for lack of a better John redefining term unsurprisingly this got old fast and its offer recognized that they would need to continue to innovate if they were to remain relevant moving forward in 1996 its software did just that with the groundbreaking new shooter quake that unlike doom featured real-time 3d rendering full polygon based character models and more advanced lighting effects it was the natural next step for the company and as the team continued to build on this new shooter series they had the team responsible for the PlayStation version of Doom work on a separate port this time for the n64 the n64 was unlike any console platform the doom series had been introduced to before it was more powerful than the likes of the Super Nintendo or Sega 32 and allowed for far more sophisticated visual techniques including the first instance of 3d accelerated visual effects for the series environments were built to be darker the color palette was expanded and enemies were redesigned giving them a more sinister look the result was an entirely different doom experience altogether that released at the end of March 1997 doom 64 takes place after the events of doom 1 & 2 with hell's forces having been defeated and pushed back to the moons around Mars however a mysterious new foe emerges and begins to revive all the slain demons forcing the doom guy to kill them all over again as usual the story is basically non-existent staying true to the classic format and the gunplay retains its classic feel only with a few notable changes all the iconic weapons return like the double-barrel shotgun plasma rifle and chain gun but some weapons have been altered slightly with the chainsaw now featuring dual blades and the rocket launcher are causing players to kick back slightly after firing doom 64 also introduces a brand new weapon called the unmake er that can be upgraded throughout the game to be even more powerful there's also a few new enemies to deal with like the cloaked nightmare imps though some classics like the revenant don't make up a churn appearance levels in doom 64 are not only darker but much more complex Keys switches and portals play almost as big a role as the gunplay this time and often require the player to sprint quickly from point to point to progress further levels are also typically much more narrow and claustrophobic requiring even more careful maneuvering to avoid being overwhelmed by powerful enemies like The Barrens of hell Midway did initially intend to include a multiplayer deathmatch mode a hallmark of the doom series but they were ultimately forced to scrap the idea making doom 64 the first title in the series to not feature a deathmatch mode a major missed opportunity especially considering what rare was about to unleash on the platform later that same year this coupled with the exclusivity of the title on the n64 ultimately made doom 64 one of the most underappreciated doom games as its excellent level designs and challenging combat encounters were credited by many as being some of the very best in the series but at the same time gamers had begun to move away from the doom series quakes release essentially marked the beginning of a new age for the FPS and doom 64 despite being entirely different was viewed by many as just yet another port of the classic title meanwhile new games like Tarak the dinosaur hunter and bears double-oh-seven goldeneye have begun to dominate the scene with completely unique and more expansive experiences unseen before in the FPS genre doom was beginning to lose its relevance in the industry and moving into the new millennium it's software aimed to save its most iconic property from being lost to the ages after the hugely successful quake 2 in quake 3 arena continues to define the PC gaming scene in the late 90s its software had begun discussing options for future steps regarding the doom series many employees at its software expressed an immense desire to remake doom from the ground up with improved visuals and more modern shooter gameplay mechanics according to an internal memo released by John Carmack the idea of rebooting doom was not something everyone that the company was on board way echoing similar creative disputes during the original Doom's development but with great matter interactive success with Return to Castle Wolfenstein the path forward became clear after some minor staff restructuring a reboot of Doom entered full production with John Carmack once again leading the way with even more technological advancements aimed to push the industry forward the latest engine architecture now known as EdTech 4 allowed for far more advanced per-pixel lighting effects along with an increased emphasis on scripted animations and environmental interactivity with these tools at hand the team was able to completely reimagine the UAC headquarters with narrow industrial corridors and advanced lighting effects while creating a much more horror oriented tone to accompany this new direction its software reached out to a science fiction writer to construct the game's narrative and even utilize storyboarding to help organize their ideas the goal was to recreate things from the original doom games but with substantially more depth allowing players to have a better understanding of why enemies look the way they did and what hell's motive was for attacking in the first place throughout the course of the next few years it suffers reboot of doom was shown off at several major game conferences most notably III in 2002 where doom fans were blown away by the next-gen visuals and immersive new experience after a major leak of the e3 demo the game continued a lengthy development cycle for the next two years and in August of 2004 do 3 was released for the PC with an Xbox 360 port following a year later doom 3 story is essentially a reimagined version of the original doom whereas once again take on the role of an unnamed Space Marine who along with a squad of other Marines are stranded on a Mars research base after demonic forces invade do an experimental gateway and just like before where as they're forced to fight their way through the facility and how itself to prevent the forces of evil from taking over their realm but unlike the classic doom games doom 3 takes an entirely different approach to its storytelling lengthy dialogue and cutscene sequences now have to establish the game's characters in plot and new interactive environmental elements like computer terminals and wounded soldiers help to expand on the Lord's lore bears can even uncover secret codes from emails and data logs that allow them to unlock secure locker filled with helpful equipment adding incentive to really take in the UAC facility and the now unbreathable surface of Mars itself Dhoom 3 even establishes a more distinctive villain character this time around who continually taunts the player thanks to the enhanced audio design between patru Gers evil omnipresent laughter and the significantly darker environments doom 3 establishes a more horror oriented tone in fact it was widely considered at the time as one of the scariest video games ever made and thus focus on horror inevitably had a major impact on the gameplay direction as well while the classic dooms emphasized fast-paced action and environmental exploration doom 3 is much slower paced and linear in its design in fact the introductory sequence is so slow-paced that it takes almost 30 minutes before players are even faced with an enemy to shoot many familiar elements from doom 1 into batur including most of the weapons and enemy types though the new horror oriented design changes how they function almost entirely weapons for example now need to be reloaded leading players vulnerable if they're not careful enough and enemies like zombified soldiers now know how to take cover requiring players to either wait for them to re-emerge or utilise explosives like the nuke or needs to draw them out imps still throw fireballs at the player but they now also jump at the player making them much more agile and threatening some enemies like the pinky are given more of a boss like role in the experience only appearing in small numbers as opposed to the large herds from before but surprisingly both this works well to provide a fresh new take on the classic property the pitch-black atmosphere coupled with the game's flashlight that can't be equipped at the same time as the weapon gives Doom 3 its own unique personality the game even includes several new features like weapons and enemies new enemy types include lots of basic zombies the maggots wraiths and swarms of smaller enemies like traits and ticks all requiring different methods from the player doom 3 was met with mostly positive reception from gaming journalists and fans alike the game is praised for its unprecedented steps forward in graphical technology along with its new terrifying horror oriented tone however not everyone was on board with the franchise's new direction many complained that the game deviated too drastically from what made the original title so special the slower pacing and cliche horror was found to be more frustrating than scary and the games requirement to swap back and forth between weapons and flashlights were widely criticized with many joking that Mars was apparently suffering from a shortage of duct tape the game was even compared to its initial III sharings with some noting that the retail version failed to live up to early promises but ultimately doom 3 was a huge success and even inspired a major motion picture starring Dwayne the rock Johnson only a year later in October of 2004 its software announced a follow-up expansion for doom 3 titled resurrection of evil which offers a new campaign experience developed both by it'd in combination with nerf software who had previously worked on the multiplayer mode for great matters Return to Castle Wolfenstein this expansion sees the return of the iconic super shotgun along with a few brand new tools including the grabber that could pick up objects and throw them around like half-life 2's gravity gun and the artifact that can slow down time temporarily to allow players to get the jump on enemies or bypass obstacles resurrection of evil scored decent reviews overall many journalists know that the more challenging design and increased gameplay variety but others criticize it for failing to innovate and even borrowing unique ideas from other developers following the lukewarm success of doom 3 and its expansion its software went quiet for several years they instead collaborated with smaller studios like Fountainhead entertainment and created various mobile spin-offs of their classic properties including role-playing version of doom but the future of the mainline series remained unclear then during QuakeCon 2007 Carmack confirmed that a fourth doom title was in development but he still remained vague only mentioning that the new title would take place on earth again after Hal had invaded you know the game engine technology would be even more advanced the engine karmic hinted at would eventually be adopted into its software's next major project rage an open-world shooter game that would take advantage of its software's reputation for solid shooting mechanics but would ultimately disappoint longtime fans with what felt like a clear disconnect from the studio's core values additionally the engine itself almost felt like a step back with West's dynamic lighting and serious texture streaming issues around the same time its offer also re-released Dhoom 3 in a collection called The BFG edition complete with the remastered versions of Dhoom 3 and its expansion along with a bonus lost mission to play this version of Dhoom 3 addresses the controversial flashlight design allowing players to turn on the new shoulder-mounted flashlight instead on top of that the bfg edition also includes ports of the original ultimate doom and doom 2 and even includes a brand new episode called no rest for the living and while this sounds like the ultimate package this version of the game has been widely criticized for abandoning the creative design of the original doom 3 the flashlight swapping while arguably a frustrating feature was a core part of the gameplay design and without it doom 3 BFG feels like a very basic survival shooter especially when compared to other titles in the early 2010's meanwhile older properties like Wolfenstein and quake were also being turned out by different development studios with a new narrative driven quake highly reminiscent of Doom threes visual style and direction and a reboot of Wolfenstein that felt more like a modification of call duty than its own distinct property after rage finally released in 2011 and was met with a mixed response the team turned back to doom again but early concepts traited many of the same poor design choices the game was slow paced looked derivative and had almost nothing in common with what fans typically associated with doom one of the biggest problems identified with this early build was how much it relied on scripted narrative sequences and dialogue a trend that was popularized by other conventional shooter games released around the same time to avoid this trap its offer made the costly decision to scrap tomb for almost completely saving only bits and pieces for later use they quickly identified that in order to revive this once-great franchise they would have to shift their focus away from the narrative driven experience and put heavy emphasis on increased fire control and movement speed players need to be able to move fluidly through the environment and not get stopped every 10 minutes to talk to an NPC concepts like weapon reloading and having to wait for cussing were completely counterproductive and were scrapped in favor of new mantling mechanics and open-ended sieges around the same time John Carmack finally parted ways with its software citing an increased desire to pursue virtual reality tech as the primary reason for his departure in his place it hired ex Crytek programmer Thiago Souza who helped to finalize the design of the even more advanced ed tech six capable of streaming textures more efficiently without compromising the quality of lighting or shadows but the most important contribution came from creative director Hugo Martin who helped steer the game in the right direction martin recognized that while the original Doom's had some mature elements they were ultimately very silly games blasting demons from Hell on Mars using laser guns and chainsaws all while rocking out to heavy metal that's what made do him so much fun gym 3 while still a good game in its own right abandoned the charm of the classic titles and Martin's goal was to bring that charm back finally in 2014 bethesda showed off a trailer for the redesigned doom at e3 restoring faith in the project that many feared had become vaporware the response from fans to doom guy grabbing iconic weapons like the super shotgun and chainsaw proved without a doubt that Doom was finally coming back and two years later it did just that as Doom was once again unleashed upon the world in summer of 2016 in this doom reboot players wake up inside a facility overrun by demonic creatures and are instructed by the mysterious and dr. Samuel Hayden to push back the Hellspawn and put a stop to a corrupted UAC researcher named Olivia Pierce staying true to the original games the doom reboot allows players to get right into the action there are rarely any dialogue sequences outside of some crucial moments throughout the campaign so just like doom 3 players can expand their search around the game's environments to uncover data entries unlocking additional backstory for people that care the story structure shares many similarities to past games even doom 3 with the UAC scientists opening a portal into hell and the player need to travel back and forth between dimensions to put a stop to it all but interestingly this new story appears to be a continuation of the original plot with the players character now being referred to as the doom Slayer in evidence suggesting that Hell itself now fears his return there's also more reasoning behind the Yui C's experimentation as it's revealed that they are attempting to harness house energy called Archon to benefit mankind but of course as always the game plays the most important component of the experience and the doom reboot delivers one of the most ambitious experiences in the series to date this game returns to its roots with smoother movement and combat mechanics and all the enemies and weapon models are based heavily off of its offers designs from the early 90s almost all the classics returned including the imps pinkies Cacodemons and Barons of Hell though they're now even more aggressive with multiple attacks and unique movement designs forcing players to strafe and jump all over the place to survive this game also introduces some new enemy types like the hellraisers that can engage from long range the summoner that functions like an arch file only with the ability to teleport and spawn new enemies into the fight and several different variations have possessed humans like a security officer equipped with an energy shield but players are more than equipped to deal with these enemies as the Arsenal is far more robust than any other game in the series before it the super shotgun the minigun the rocket launcher everything is available to use again though they've been expanded significantly thanks to a new player progression system dooms progression system is one of the biggest changes to the design of the game by completing specific challenges or collecting special argent energy cells first can equip many upgrades align them to enhance their speed durability and power each weapon can now be equipped with found weapon attachments like rocket pods or underbarrel grenade launchers and each attachment comes with their own set of special challenges to complete that can improve their functionality even further while all of this can seem pretty overwhelming the game still manages to play more smoothly and fluent than any other doom game in the series first can easily strafe around large environments Mansel up objects and double jump to clear larger gaps players can even initiate a new takedown called the glory kill that will reward the player with extra health alternatively using the iconic chainsaw remorse the player with extra ammunition giving it a much more practical use in the flow of the action these new weapons and movement controls play a major role in combat encounters that now offer a mix of freeform combat like the old games along with scripted survival sequences after ripping apart things called gore nests this triggers an intense battle where the music increases in intensity and the enemies begin to spawn rapidly to challenge the player the doom reboot also features bonus rooms requiring players to complete crazy challenges in order to unlock other special upgrades for their gear outside of the single-player experience toom 2016 also sees the pattern of online competitive deathmatch only with a much more modern twist players no longer have to find weapons in the environment but instead select from loadouts additionally players can collect diamond power-ups to temporary slaughter their opponents as one of the many different callous monsters likely influenced by the likes of call duty and his popular kill streak feature and while this latest doom does not feature the classic for player co-op mode wares can still team up together in the game so unique snap map mode that allows players to easily build their own custom environments and campaigns using a simplified map editor tool however these tools are fairly limited when compared to the level of complexity offered in older map editor tools in classic doom titles even so toom 2016 was a monumental success it's smooth movement incredible soundtrack and faithful recreation of the franchise's classic weapons and monsters resonated strongly with fans and newcomers alike after years of waiting doom had finally returned bigger and better than ever before the game's reviews were all mostly positive with many applauding the game's visuals combat mechanics and new features though a few found the new glory kill system to be overly repetitive it was designed to be optional but the flow of the game essentially requires players to make use of it having to sit through very brief but repetitive takedown animations regardless doom 2016 was an undeniable hit in the industry and with the success in software turned their attention back towards an emerging new technology that they were excited to take advantage of throughout the course of doom 2 as the 16th development in software expressed significant interest in virtual reality gaming and began to experiment with ways to incorporate VR into their classic properties they eventually decided to adopt our gameplay formula from June 2016 into the virtual reality format reworking some of the core games environments and weapons to function in an immersive space and within the next year its software released doom VFR doom VFR puts players literally in the boots of a UAC scientist named dr. Peters who after suffering a brutal mauling from a pinky demon in an elevator is revived partially by a series of high-tech machines suspending his consciousness in a computer matrix using this to his advantage Peters then transfers his brain into a robot giving players the opportunity to move around the UAC facility in full VR providing an entirely new perspective to the doom experience players can use the VR s controllers to teleport around the game world and can simultaneously aim using their alternate controller firing all of the most iconic weapons surprisingly do VFR provides an incredibly steep difficulty curve introducing some powerful enemies like the Meng Cubist's and the revenant but then only the first few sequences challenging players to quickly make use of the new teleporting feature to stay alive though this does make sense considering the game's incredibly short campaign with only roughly an hour and a half of gameplay from start to finish but being able to stand at the feet of a cyber demon is quite possibly one of the most surreal experiences available in the Dhoom series even if it does make me dizzy for the next 12 hours doom VFR is the lowest rated title in the entire series the game short length this initial requirement to use only the teleportation method for movement and months of technical issues upon release have resulted in a mixed audience response though it's undoubtedly one of the more unique experiences in the franchise's history but the VR spin-off was not the only thing its offer was focused on Tim 2016 had after all left off with a massive cliffhanger and based on the story presented in the classic games it was only a matter of time until hell found its way back to earth and at e3 2018 Bethesda Softworks confirmed the existence of a direct sequel with the announcement of doom eternal the spiritual remake of the original doom 2 but this time the doom Slayers got a lot more tricks up his sleeve whereas once again controlled the doom Slayer only in a new hell possessed version of his classic suit equipped with a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher and an extendable wrist blade perfect for slicing through enemies in the improved glory kill system wares are even given more tools to improve the maneuverability including a grapple hook to slingshot off of enemies and the ability to swing on specific horizontal bars around the environment players will also be challenged with significantly more demons including several returning enemies like the pain elemental and the arch file unfortunately doom eternal won't feature a traditional deathmatch multiplayer mode this time around though it does come with a brand-new style competitive play called battle mode where two player control demons team up against the player controlling the doom Slayer for an intense asymmetrical showdown it's software also plans on releasing a version of this mode that allows teams to invade a single player's campaign though this should always be entirely optional so far doom eternal is shaping up to be one of the most ambitious entries in the entire franchise and I'll be sure to provide full coverage of the game when it releases next week including a detailed comparison to the previous game along with a final review soon after its release on March 20th doom has had a monumental impact on the gaming industry what started as a small passion project between five young game developers in the 90s has grown to become one of the most well-known and cherished first-person shooter franchises of all time it is directly responsible for hundreds of different gaming experiences thanks to its revolutionary technology and simple game mechanics is one of the very few franchises that has ever managed to properly return to its roots despite their age and obviously dated visuals the original games are still even 27 years later just as enjoyable to play through and even sports some dedicated fan communities with players still actively participating in wot designs and deathmatches everyday doom isn't just a fantastic franchise it's a legendary one and as long as its software stays true to the series core roots gamers will always come back to rip and tear some more but what do you guys think which doob experience has been your favorite and what do you think its software should take the series next let me know in
