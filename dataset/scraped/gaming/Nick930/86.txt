welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at sucker punch's latest open world action adventure game ghost of tsushima and see how it compares to its original e3 debut from 2018. for today's analysis i'll be playing ghost of tsushima on a playstation 4 pro outputting on a 4k display and it's important to understand that the footage from the e3 reveal may not appear as crisp due to the video's compression but because we'll be looking primarily at changes to gameplay features and level layouts this shouldn't make much of a difference now to keep this video as organized as possible i'm gonna run straight through the original e3 reveal and point out any relevant changes along the way including alterations to lighting models gameplay mechanics and the overall layout and before we begin i want to thank sony computer entertainment and sucker punch for providing me with access to the game alright so let's kick this comparison off with a look at the opening cinematic sequence shown at the start of the e3 demo the first shot shows the edge of a bamboo forest with jyn and his horse slowly emerging and looking off to the distance this sequence does not play in the final retail build as it was intended more as a dramatic character reveal for the audience during the e3 show but for the sake of consistency i decided to use the game's built-in photo mode to try and emulate those few opening shots and i was surprised to find that the environment has been altered a great deal from what we were first shown the general layout is still intact but as you can see here the vegetation isn't quite as impressive the grass and trees are far less complex blowing in the wind in large groups rather than independently as before and despite the lighting effects during the scene being locked during the mission and matching exactly in the background the specular light along the ground and trees is no longer visible there's plenty of specular lighting throughout the game especially when it rains so it's not like the future's been cut completely but it's just not visible at this angle anymore it's also worth noting that the pre-rendered cinematic is often going to look better than actual gameplay rendering and when the demo swaps over to the actual gameplay things like the grass and trees while not identical are much closer to how they appear in the final build i also tried to match up this close-up of jyn's face but unsurprisingly the in-game character model doesn't match the quality of the pre-rendered cinematics so a lot of the high quality texture work and shaders just aren't there though considering the average distance of the player camera during normal gameplay i'm still impressed by just how detailed this character model looks and the actual pre-rendered cinematics that are in the game come a lot closer to matching the quality of the original reveal though you will notice a few subtle changes to things like jyn's face including much smaller eyes and a less rounded face and there are some tweaks to the depth of field now let's move on to the actual gameplay for the most part the terrain in this whole area lines up pretty much exactly every single object is exactly where it was before and i was surprised to even find the same puddle on the dirt path right at the start the muddy path doesn't feature quite the same depth and the grass as i mentioned before isn't as varied but it's still pretty close the more obvious change though is the rework to the lighting conditions now before i unlocked this mission i located this clip side and immediately started to play around with the weather and time of day settings trying to match up the look and feel of that original e3 reveal but after trying every combination of atmospheric conditions i never once was able to get the sun to sit in the right position on the horizon to cast the same shadows on the game world but after starting the actual mission the weather and lighting immediately locked into the right setting providing the exact same shadow distance and effects necessary for the comparison but even though the clouds and sun are all in the right place you'll notice all throughout this comparison that the lighting isn't quite the same between both builds there's a much warmer collar tone in the retail build that kind of takes away from the dark foreboding feel that was originally showcased this becomes especially clear as the player reaches the top of the hill where players are instantly blinded by the sun rather than having it naturally pass through the character's clothes like it does in the demo additionally the npcs standing at the top of the hill have also been changed in the demo there's a few scattered civilians on this hilltop some are crying off to the side while one is standing under a tree playing an instrument but in the final game the musician is gone and instead there's a group of civilians cowering in fear while massacre threatens them in the retail build of the game this area serves as a mission start point for mosaic's 8th side mission where players assist in finding her family's killers so instead of just meeting her by the red tree temple like in the e3 demo players need to first talk to her and then travel to the temple together after the conversation with masako the player is told to follow her on horseback through the field but instead of following her i walked up to the cliff side just like at the demo to see how this beautiful sprawling valley has evolved since it was first revealed and surprisingly it looks almost identical the camera doesn't zoom out like it did before so i had to make use of the photo mode again but once i got the angle correct i found the scene to match up almost exactly even the lighting looks similar though if you look even further into the distance there are a few very minor tweaks to the scene first it looks like the depth of field isn't quite as intense as it was before making the distant ships more noticeable additionally the tree line has been altered slightly with a few of the taller trees having been removed you'll also notice a lot of those distant fires are missing now with a couple large smoke stacks taking their place that's not to say you won't see distant fire still in fact there's a brand new fire sitting off to the right but it does feel a little bit more calm in the retail build than what was previously suggested then of course we have the horse riding sequence now this part is pretty much identical to what we were shown in the demo the player whistles for their horse mounts it and dashes down a path across a large field of flowers at this point we get a nice close-up look at the dynamic grass in action along with some wildlife like deer and birds really moving throughout while i didn't spot any deer at this particular point they're definitely in the final game and you'll frequently encounter them as you explore the island you may have also noticed that during the scene you are now accompanied by masako however i did find that you can easily break away from her and run solo and the mission will still function just fine towards the end of this frolic through the flowers we can see a few more minor changes to the environment the path is now more distinct with less overgrown grass and the tunnel of trees across the bridge is now more open and brightly lit again giving the sequence a much brighter aesthetic i also wanted to point out that the final build seems to feature a lot more ambient particle effects floating around in the air like leaves and flower petals which is a nice touch as the player travels further a group of civilians runs across the path screaming prompting the player to dismount from their horse and investigate now despite the lower quality trees and grass i mentioned earlier almost all the details in this part of the woods match up pretty closely the rock in this corner looks a little bit better in the demo but otherwise this area is still beautifully decorated now with this next section we have our first confrontation with some enemies and here's where the gameplay is altered a little bit normally when you approach a group of enemies you can challenge them to a standoff where you can carefully unleash a single powerful slash to kill an approaching enemy instantly this is exactly the feature that is being shown off here in the demo minus the locked camera and letterbox effect but for some reason you can't actually perform this ability at this part of the mission i tried it maybe three times and the enemies just detect you when you get close and there's no option to perform a standoff another small change that's been made is to the location of the enemies that now appear right at the end of the path rather than being located off to the side by the waterfront the combat itself handles about the same though it's a little bit more involved than what was previously suggested with a lot of unblockable attacks that need to be dodged and a major focus on swapping between fighting stances to attack certain enemy types it's sort of hinted at based on the position jyn holds his sword but without ui prompts it's really hard to tell that this is a controllable feature after killing all the enemies a final enemy rounds the corner and is shot by an arrow revealing masako but in the retail build considering players have already met up with massaco only a few moments before this moment never happens in the retail build instead a more basic cutscene plays after killing all the enemies if you look closely at the demo you'll also notice two really cool animations one is jyn finishing off an injured soldier with a sword and then he wipes the blood off with his sleeve and puts it away well i didn't perform these particular moves here they both can be performed in the final game still mercy killing an enemy will grant the player resolve which can be used to heal or perform special attacks and if you wipe the touchpad from left to right you can manually clean the blood off your sword and put it away after this fight both the player and massaco head towards the temple steps and take cover behind a rock for the most part this section looks and plays identically though there is a new cutscene that plays when taking cover behind the rocks after performing a simultaneous takedown on the two guards the characters then take cover behind an old cart that in the retail build actually has a bit more cargo than before the camera then pans up to reveal the secret entrance to the building and the player then runs off to the side and begins to climb up a nearby roof here we have another very minor change in the e3 build the player appears to hold a button down to prime a grappling hook and then leaps off the roof and attaches it to a nearby wooden beam while the grapple hook is still in the final game you can't prime it and instead need to simply jump towards the grapple point and press the r2 button in mid air after pulling up onto the roof the player then rounds a corner and makes his way inside here you'll notice two things one the red leaves are no longer visible on this rooftop and again the specular lighting has been toned down significantly now this next part is one of the few areas in the original reveal that i was a little bit disappointed with as the crouch animations for gin looked really stiff and clunky but thankfully it looks like sucker punch must have noticed this too as the animations have been reworked and he moves a lot more smoothly along these planks though the camera is a little bit difficult to maneuver in this tight space you'll also notice that just like with the open combat the stealth based user interface has seen a few changes rather than highlighting the enemy like in the assassin's creed series sucker punch instead has big button prompts with the option to assassinate only one enemy or initiate a chain attack just like in the demo you can drop down and smoothly take out all three enemies in this room but the enemy outside doesn't seem to notice anymore you can still stab him through the paper wall with a nearly identical animation but he never attempts to blow on a horn and call for reinforcements just like with the other gameplay feature shown before this is something that is very much still in the game if an enemy suspects you're there he'll blow on a horn and call for reinforcements but at this particular moment it just didn't happen now after speaking to the monk we get our first glimpse at an actual cinematic shared in both versions where jyn helps the monk up and brings them outside at first glance it looks almost the same though the character animations and facial expressions have been altered a tiny bit and the coloration remains more bright and vibrant in the retail build now we've already discussed how jyn's character model has changed but muscago has also been modified a little bit with more gray hair less dirt covering her face and some very minor alterations to the shape of her head and finally we've arrived to the epic sword duel the grand finale of this demonstration this is the part that really blew me away when it was first shown off and while it's not exact it's still pretty darn close the leaves are just as dense possibly even denser than previously suggested and because the depth of field isn't quite as extreme you can make out distant particle effects more clearly though there are definitely far fewer leaves flying around in the background it also seems as though the bloom has been toned down a little bit here which is interesting considering how blown out it was earlier as for the actual combat there are a few minor changes to how these duels function first in the e3 demo you'll notice that the camera remains locked into place throughout the duration of the fight ensuring that the pretty sunset is always visible but in the actual game the camera focuses more on the enemy making it easier to anticipate their attacks because of this the camera angles are difficult to match up but thanks to the photo mode i was able to capture a few similar images to give you a better idea of how the two versions compare additionally the fight itself is much longer and more challenging than what was shown in the demo masako has a lot of powerful attacks and you'll need to be really good at dodging and parrying to come out on top just like in the trailer enemy reinforcements will eventually show up and start shooting flaming arrows making the scene even more epic but instead of flipping massacre onto her back and smoothly flowing into a cutscene the retail build just abruptly fades to black after landing the final blow and cuts to her being wounded and defeated on the ground this cutscene has seen some pretty big changes most notably the fire in the background while there's still a flame in the retail build it's barely noticeable and it slowly burns out as jin gets closer to her you could probably argue that there's some symbolism here but i would have loved to see those bright embers in the background and less of that extreme silhouette we have now and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall ghost of tsushima's retail build retains all the exact same gameplay features traversal options and level layouts as previously shown you can cut down a soldier with a single slash stealth assassinate three people at once and pull people through walls but it does appear that sucker punch had to make a few alterations to the lighting and environmental quality in order to get the game to run at an acceptable frame rate on the ps4's nearly seven-year-old hardware the foliage is not quite as complex as it once was the specular lighting was toned down a bit and the fire towards the end was almost completely removed but the biggest changes seem to be attributed to the lighting and how the new color tone has drastically altered the feeling of some of the scenes still all things considered i'm incredibly impressed with what sucker punch managed to accomplish here this game looks stunning and of all the e3 comparison videos i've done i was surprised by just how many of the beautiful details like particle effects and dynamic vegetation they were able to retain this is easily one of the best looking experiences to come out of the studio and i'm really looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us for next gen but what do you guys think are you happy with the presentation of the retail build of the game or did you prefer the design of the e3 build let me know in the comments
