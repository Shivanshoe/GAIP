this video is brought to you by AMD welcome back everybody to another episode up to wreck comparison in today's episode we're looking at the upcoming resin evil 3 remake and seeing how it compares both visually and from a gameplay perspective to it's 1999 source material now before we get started we're obviously going to see improvements visually and just about every aspect but the goal of this video is to highlight just exactly what Capcom has managed to accomplish with this remake and how the new visuals bring new life to Raccoon City but much like the Resident Evil 2 remake that released last year resident evil 3 remake isn't just a graphical overhaul it features drastically different gameplay mechanics along with some pretty major changes to the level structure but before we get into all that let's first briefly go over all of the visual enhancements that you can expect when the game releases on Friday so to kick this comparison off let's begin by looking at some of our character models starting with Resident Evil three's lead protagonist Jill Valentine now as you can probably already imagine the new character model features far more complex geometry shaders and overall detail making her appear like a genuinely real person the design still looks pretty similar to the classic character though there are a few big changes that have been made to her outfit rather than sporting a tube top and skirt Jill now is wearing a blue tank top and jeans probably a more comfortable outfit when running around zombie infested streets at night and then we have the Nemesis the game's lead antagonist who looks even more ferocious and intimidating than before for those of you unfamiliar resident evil 3 the biggest feature is this towering creature that can't be killed and will relentlessly pursue the player through the alleyways and streets because of this fundamental role in the gameplay Capcom spent extra time ensuring they nailed down every last detail here and it really shows the first thing I noticed was that the proportions and scaling of features along his face have been adjusted with his jaw being lowered slightly giving him a more menacing look the strange purple veins or tubes in and around him have also been hidden with nemesis's new clothing that instead of being a custom-made leather jacket now appears to be biohazard containment bag that he broken out of throughout the course of the game nemesis will continue to devolve and change like he did in the original but for the sake of avoiding spoilers I'll leave that for you guys to discover Carlos's character has also seen an interesting redesign the first thing that stands out right away is his new hairdo that's more unkept and much longer he also has more stubble on his face and is sporting a t-shirt rather than going sleeveless and then of course we have our zombies that seemed to be mostly made up of models used in the Resident Evil 2 remake in the original game the zombies featured some nice detail like blood and tears along their clothing and there were even some brand-new models like this heavyweight zombie inside the police station the remake seems to make similar improvements with a handful of new zombie models being mixed in to help boost the variety and just like last year's game the animations are vastly improved with zombies stumbling around corners and failing around as you try to land precision headshots on them it's also difficult to judge whether a zombie you've down has been put down for good in the original zombies could be pronounced dead if they made a certain animation or if blood started a pool around their corpse in the new game the animations make it difficult to judge and if there are blood pools they're almost impossible to see in the dark atmosphere of the remake next we have our environments the environments have seen a massive overhaul even more so than the environments in last year's remake Raccoon City is almost unrecognizable save for a few iconic landmarks like the warehouse and the RPD in the original game these environments were created using static pre-rendered images that while not technically impressive still offer some beautiful detail and gave the game its own distinct look and personality in the remake these locations are brought to life in a fully 3d rendered world and the full range of movement and camera control helped to provide an even closer look at these areas it really feels like you're trapped in the city now and exploring every inch of its streets is not only immersive but also necessary to find supplies as for the changes to the level layout I'll talk about that more in a bit the lighting is of course another area where the remake makes some fantastic improvements lighting in the original game was pre-baked and simplistic making the environments appear overly bright with no real-time shadow effects for the time they looked great and there's some nice shading in these images to create a sense that you're standing under fluorescent lights late at night in an abandoned city but the remake is on an entirely different level with real-time lighting effects that properly cast shadows from objects and character models and helped to create an entirely new feel to the experience volumetric lighting helps to make silhouetting zombies even more horrifying as they stumble out of the shadow and towards the player and some areas are now pitch-black requiring players to navigate them carefully with a small flashlight only further adding to the horror oriented tone of the experience and then we have effects well effects like fire and water all looks significantly better in the remake I have to give the original credit for what I was able to accomplish back then the fire effects still look fantastic and coupled with the beautifully rendered backdrop images it genuinely looks at the fires lighting up the environment the fire in the remake of course is even more impressive and the added benefit of the wet Street surfaces and zombie gore effects only further add to the immersion and now we have our gameplay comparisons and just like with the re - comparison last year this is where things get to be very interesting earlier this week I played to both the original resident evil 3 and the remake and their drastically different from each other in terms of how they play of course the biggest change here is the movement and camera design the Resident Evil three remake features a modern over-the-shoulder viewpoint allowing players to freely control their camera and directly aim their weapon and enemies in the original the cameras are fixed at specific angles only changing when the player runs off the screen at specific points this design made controlling Jill and Carlos much more difficult and made it easier for the developer to put in surprise moments like unexpected hordes of zombies around the corner this camera system also plays a major role in how the Nemesis functions and allows him to spawn in off screen to trick the player into thinking he's constantly chasing them through doors in the remake the player is given far more control over the camera and locations are all seamlessly connected now with no loading screens of any kind this impacts how the Nemesis behaves he still feels like he's spawning in at certain points but they're more surprising now he'll burst through walls or even superhero drop in front of a player and we'll chase them at incredible speed the same tactics from before still work here so trying to fight him with explosives will earn you a valuable loot while dodging him and running away will likely save you from a premature death but his constant presence and faster movement speed makes them even more intimidating than before it's a very similar experience most of the game will have players running away from this unstoppable monster while also dodging zombies and trying to secure an escape route out of the city but the layout of the city isn't quite the same as it was in 99 it's much simpler overall darn as many interconnecting alleyways to memorize and the paths are a bit wider allowing for greater maneuverability when dealing with enemies some parts the game have been removed or replaced entirely the first half of the game for example is spent on the streets with new shops to explore and even a large construction site but the RPD isn't accessible until much later and there's quite a few surprises inside that might catch longtime fans off-guard the later half of the game is even more interesting though as it no longer features the iconic clock tower interior the park or the water treatment plant elements of these areas are now incorporated into new extended sequences like a large sewer network a much more expansive hospital and a massive underground umbrella lab another interesting change has been made to the game's enemies most of the classics returned like zombies dogs hunters and of course the Nemesis and they all behave pretty much the same as you remember however the insectoid brain suckers are now limited to a substation area rather than spawning all throughout the city additionally the rare gamma hunters located in the basement lab at the hospital have been removed in ER instead combined with the gravedigger boss from the park to form a brand new enemy type and just like with Resident Evil 2 remake the giant spiders and crows are nowhere to be seen the general gameplay mechanics have also seen a few tweaks gunpowder for example no longer requires the player to use a reloading tool to craft ammunition gunpowder simply needs to be combined to make ammunition saving on time spent juggling items in the storage container the ink ribbons have similarly been removed allowing players to save as often as they wanted typewriters Eve on the hardcore difficulty setting Resident Evil threes dodge maneuver has also returned but is expanded slightly allowing players to aim in slow motion at the attacking enemies head for a quick critical hit our e3 remake also removes the choice system implemented in the original game in the classic certain scenarios would trigger a slow-motion scene where the player could choose between two options which would branch off both the gameplay and story drastically and even impact how the game ended in the remake there's no choice system at all the only ending is the canonical ending and players are not given a choice in how they approach encounters with enemies like the Nemesis overall the gameplay experience may seem similar on the surface but the changes made make the Resident Evil three remake play much faster and more aggressively than its source material there's more scripted action set-pieces and QuickTime events spread throughout and moments of tense silence are replaced with hordes of undead and lots of action finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you think has the better overall sound design [Music] [Music] [Applause] and that wraps up this episode of Tobruk comparison overall the resident evil 3 remake changes a surprising amount from the original game the visuals are obviously a huge improvement and the redesigns to characters like Jill and nemesis look much more modern and realistic but the major changes made to the layout instruction of the game design ultimately result in a shorter slightly easier experience my final time for the original game was a little under 7 hours while the remake was only 5 and a half hours that being said the inclusion of a new modifier unlock system that allows you to purchase upgrades using credits earned in-game does make repeat playthroughs more enticing in the remake the original game had some replay potential like the unlockable mercenaries mode that turned the city into a challenging time child sorts but there was nothing to really entice buyers into replaying the main story outside of trying out the different choices at specific points our e3 remake also comes bundled with a new asymmetrical multiplayer experience called resistance that pits 4 player controlled survivors against a player mastermind that can spawn in zombies and other obstacles though its multiplayer centric design will likely not be for everyone overall Resident Evil three remake is a surprisingly different experience from it's 1999 counterpart there are several callbacks to the classic games design but there are definitely some major changes that fans may be torn on the removal of the Clocktower and park area for example may be disappointing though the greatly expanded hospital sequence and the new underground lab area to help to make up for the slight way the nemesis's behavior has been altered to make them even more intimidating and the improved controls lend themselves to a much faster paced action experience that helps transition this title smoothly into the more action focus design of Resident Evil 4 but what do you guys think do you think it improves on the original or do you still prefer the design of the 1999 classic let me know in the comments section now if
