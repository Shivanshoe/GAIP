welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the open beta that ran this past weekend for the hotly anticipated battlefield 2042 and see how it stacks up both in terms of its visuals and its general gameplay mechanics to the fan favorite battlefield 4. before we get started it's important to understand that 2042 as it's shown here is still in its beta phase in fact the developers have stated multiple times that the build that was used for this open beta test was at least three months old because of this we should in theory see a drastically different launch experience for this game when it's made available for early adopters on november 12th so any graphical bugs performance issues or general gameplay design elements could potentially change before then also because battlefield 4 came out way back in 2013 and served as a launch title for the previous console generation it's to be expected that battlefield 2042 will look more impressive from a visual standpoint so while i will still discuss the visuals briefly i want to spend more time discussing the gameplay design and will save a more in-depth visual analysis for closer to launch with a look at how dice has improved over their previous title battlefield v for reference both games are being played on a pc outputting at a native 4k resolution with the graphic settings cranked up to their highest values however i will be disabling the motion bore options to enable cleaner image capture so let's kick this comparison off by going over the presentation starting with the design of the character models now this is an area that i feel needs quite a bit of work right out of the gate setting aside the whole specialist system that yes i will expand upon more in a bit the actual level of quality and complexity incorporated into these four models in this build is just disappointing leading me to believe that maybe some of the settings in the menus may not actually be activated for this beta the textures on the uniforms for example are really muddy when compared to the nicely crisp detail shown on the uniforms and iv and other facial features like eyes skin and hair just feel off battlefield 4's models have no doubt seen better days especially when you stop to look closely at their simple looking facial geometry but the textures still hold up remarkably well and there's so much great detail along each of these uniforms what's more the character models are unique to each faction available in the game whereas in the battlefield 2042 beta there's quite literally only four character models six if you include the pilot models used in vehicles and whatever these ai models are supposed to be this means that regardless of what team you play on your character model will always look the same requiring players to rely solely on the user interface to identify threats versus friendlies it's a really odd design choice but again we'll get into the specifics of that later another problem area with battlefield 2042's presentation is its player animations this is something that stood out to me right away when playing the beta as i feel it really takes away from the immersion of the experience something about the way that the weapon sways on the screen when running feels incredibly unnatural almost as if the player is trying to sprint into battle wearing high heels the weapon sways back and forth rapidly with this jarring redirection that completely kills the flow of the movement in battlefield 4 the movement feels more fluid and natural with the weapon more steadily swaying across the screen and then flowing seamlessly when initiating more complex motions like vaulting i think by improving this animation loop players will immediately feel more comfortable with battlefield 2042's general feel as it's something that no doubt contributes to the game's really awkward feel in its current state next let's take a brief look at some of the weapon designs now unfortunately we are limited a bit here as there's only a handful of weapons available in the beta and almost none of the weapons available are shared with battlefield 4. though there are still a few similar weapon types that can give us a rough idea of how the models have been improved take this glock handgun for example battlefield 2042's version of this classic firearm is significantly improved over its older counterpart with much more detail in practically every area the textured surfaces are crisper the level of detail is increased and the general animation quality for firing and reloading has also been improved a great deal the ak-12 also makes a return albeit in a slightly different form in battlefield 4 the prototype version of the ak-12 is utilized with smaller spacing between the grooves along the top rail and a less detailed receiver in 2042 though we're given the final production version of this same weapon given the name ak24 in game the core structure of the weapon remains intact but we can see wider spacing for the top rail a different hand guard with tan coloration and much more detail along the barrel and receiver and this is kind of the case with every weapon in the game each firearm in 2042 is some sort of modern weapon given a fake name with a lot more detail and because more gaming pcs and consoles today are capable of actually running these games at high resolutions like 1440p and 4k the developers have made sure to make even the smallest details clearly visible whereas before these smaller details like etched serial numbers and insignias were barely legible next up let's talk about the environment here's where we really see the advantage of nearly a decade's worth of incremental improvements to the frostbite engine 2042's orbital map is absolutely gorgeous with some fantastic dynamic vegetation density huge draw distances and some impressive set pieces the map itself is one of the bigger maps in the series roughly twice the size of battlefield 3's caspian border though thanks to the increased player count it also doesn't feel as empty as maps like 1942's el elmain now we'll of course talk about the implications of this change in a bit but before we do it's worth noting just how much more detailed the world itself is over this old 2013 classic the texture quality and overall detail level of the maps in battlefield 4 is looking surprisingly dated now especially when stacked up against the newer 2042 the roads the dirt the grass buried under the 3d dynamic grass models and especially the various rocks and boulders all look significantly more photorealistic than they appeared in battlefield 4. the only surface that appeared better in battlefield 4 at first glance was the bark along these palm trees but upon closer inspection it's clear that battlefield 2042's texture quality is still vastly superior the world just looks and feels more realistic this time around with even more of those great dynamic grass objects and trees all swaying realistically in the wind and directly reacting to the actions of players and all this is brought out even more thanks to the improvements made to the lighting design the lighting in 2042 is probably the best it's looked in the series so far with some nice implementation of the same third party enlightened technology that's been coupled with the series for over a decade now because of its implementation the lighting is still static only changing to preset configurations under certain circumstances but even with this dynamicism the lighting will always appear the same way every time this valley for example will always bask in sunlight when there isn't a storm and will never get covered by cloud formations or anything like that similarly these areas that are cast in shadow during the storm will always remain in shadow even if there are other areas where light seems to be peeking in through the clouds now despite all the lighting effects being technically static the general look and appearance is nothing short of impressive the series has struggled for years to really lock down a realistic color tone without relying on intrusive screen filters to accomplish it and while there's certainly areas where 2042 can feel a bit flat there's other times where the presentation comes off feeling more lifelike the screen space reflections along the various puddles and water surfaces look particularly good and are a massive improvement over the practically non-existent reflective surfaces in battlefield 4. though again this is an area that's been gradually improving for years now with both battlefield 1 and battlefield 5 offering some beautiful lighting designs that in some cases even look better than what's on display here but we'll save that comparison for when battlefield 2042 is officially released so we have more maps and samples to compare battlefield 2042 also features improved shadow quality over bf4 with players projecting their own shadows and various environmental shadows feeling more prominent and detailed the shadows in 2042 still aren't great as i found a lot of really bad dithering in edge shimmer especially from the character model's own hat along the surface of their weapon but it's still technically an improvement over battlefield 4's almost non-existent shadows finally there's effects this is another area where battlefield 2042's presentation really shines as there's a lot of really big improvements in practically every area the explosions for example now look like real explosions with a realistic fireball coupled with hundreds if not thousands of particle effects and far superior smoke simulation to round it all out the explosions in battlefield 4 haven't aged quite as well with what looks like a big bright orange cloud of fire quickly fading into a short smokestack with only a few particles visible at any given time the worst part of the effect is this strange looking orange fire that appears at the center towards the end that doesn't look even remotely as good as the yellow fireballs emitted in 2042 all that being said 2042's explosions aren't perfect one issue in particular that stands out is the complete lack of dynamic lighting from the explosion something that bf4 very clearly demonstrates having light emit from this fireball and bounce off the environmental surfaces and the player's weapon model would serve to better integrate the effect into the world water effects are another area that look immediately more impressive in 2042 the ripples along the surface look incredible and this coupled with the specular lighting and high quality textured surfaces of the sandy beaches really helped to sell a realistic looking image but there's still a few issues here first the screen space reflections being used look terrible at times with a really pixelated appearance at certain angles then there's the dynamicism of the water itself this just appears to be broken at the moment with the ripple effect from swimming and shooting only appearing occasionally as opposed to every time like in bf4 on the bright side battlefield 2042 does feature a nice wet shader effect for the player's hands and weapon model after emerging from the water which is a nice attention to detail moving on we have battlefield's big claim to fame its destruction destruction as of late has been weirdly downplayed in the battlefield series with some really nice dynamic destruction and bf1 and 5 barely being promoted despite improving a great deal over 3 and 4. battlefield 2042's orbital map doesn't necessarily provide players with a lot of opportunities for destruction mainly because most of the map is just open terrain and massive concrete structures but i did find smaller destruction effects to be a big step up shooting concrete walls for example produces some really impressive particle density and alpha effects something that battlefield 4 really doesn't deliver as much and craters formed by explosives seem to be more common than before with rocket pods from helicopters completely deforming the terrain and areas of the map and giving players new reliable sources of cover there's even some impressive terrain deformation when driving vehicles with grass getting crushed by tanks and muddy roads forming deep tire tracks as the player drifts by aspects that were not offered in bf4 in any discernible way then of course there's the epic scripted destruction previously known as levolution in battlefield 4 revolution was introduced to present game-changing moments where something huge would happen to reshape the flow of the action siege of shanghai had the tower collapse paracel storm had the battleship crashing into the beach and flood zone had the alleys flood to the point where players need to swim or drive boats 2042 seems to be bringing this aspect back to the experience with orbital's massive rocket and its new dynamic storms only now these events are completely unpredictable something that i feel would have made the revolution events and battlefield 4 more interesting in 2042 sometimes the rocket would launch early on in the match sometimes at the very end and other times it would completely explode on the platform causing massive chunks of debris to litter the tarmac the latter scenario seems to be more caused by the players hitting it with enough firepower but it could also explode after being impacted by the even more epic tornado that will very rarely spawn during a match and cause absolute mayhem to ensue both the rocket and the tornado effects look incredible and are easily 2042's most interesting new twist to the formula and unlike revolution and how often it would disrupt the flow of the action these events feel random enough and interesting enough that they don't feel nearly as gimmicky we'll of course still need to wait and see how this plays out in the other maps but so far i think the levolution type systems used in 2042 are a big improvement in fact collectively the presentation of 2042 is a huge step up but these improvements are all to be expected considering how much the series has evolved since then what's even more interesting are the changes that have been made to the gameplay so first off let's talk about the elephant in the room the specialist system in battlefield 4 players have four classes to select between there's the assault that serves as a frontline fighter with the option to equip medical supplies to heal and revive teammates the engineer tasked with tackling hostile vehicles while also repairing friendlies support is all about suppression and ammo resupply and recon intended for long-range sniping and scouting enemy positions all four of these classes are purposely built to encourage specific team-oriented objectives and also have their own signature class of weapons to help encourage players to choose that specific playstyle it's a system that has been with the series since the very beginning but interestingly 2042 looks to be abandoning the class system altogether in favor of a more simplified specialist system with the specialist system players can select currently between four specialists each with their own unique appearance passive ability and specialty device the first specialist mckay serves as a sort of replacement for the old assault class as his passive trait gives him increased mobility perfect for offensive playstyles but he's also equipped with a new grappling device to zip around the map and climb out of reach areas the next specialist is boris a sort of spiritual successor to the engineer who can deploy automatic sentry turrets and improve the effectiveness of other nearby sentry turrets the third specialist casper is a ghillie suit wearing recon unit with access to a proximity sensor and a remote controlled recon drone similar to the mavs from bf3 and iv and the fourth specialist is the game's medical support expert that can revive any teammates with a defibrillator and also heal teammates at range using a cerret pistol so far it sounds pretty much the same as any other battlefield games class system however under this newer system players can equip any weapon and any gadget regardless of which specialist they choose if players choose to play as the medic for example they can grab a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher for their loadout likewise a recon specialist can be equipped with a light machine gun and a medical crate the idea seems to be to encourage that sandbox mentality and while it's certainly nice to give players more options this change introduces two fundamental problems to the battlefield formula one team play mechanics are no longer being encouraged and two threat identification and prioritization is nearly impossible so let's start with that first problem the problem with letting players use whatever gear they want for whatever class is that now key team play-oriented tools are less likely to be equipped nobody is going to choose to use a repair torch when the other option is a rocket launcher or a way to heal themselves this is a big problem as things like ammo resupply and repairs were already difficult to obtain from players whose sole job it would be to supply those services if you end up running out of ammo on the field now it's probably unlikely you'll find a player with an ammo bag equipped and even more unlikely they'll recognize that you need ammo and drop it for you what's even more odd is they didn't even bring back the large ammo stations from battlefield v so you can't just resupply yourself by going to a specific section of the map though you can at least pick ammo up off of dead enemies which is a nice addition i think making certain gadgets mandatory for certain specialists like the repair tool for the engineer and ammo for the support would go a long way in improving the emphasis on team play though because of odd design choices like making the support class now function as the team's medic there's several issues that would need to be addressed first before making this type of change then of course there's that second problem threat identification this is sort of similar to what we just went over but by making it so any player can carry anything players now don't know exactly what they're dealing with let's say you're driving a tank and are looking out for enemy at soldiers looking to blow you up with rocket launchers but because every specialist can equip an rpg this could literally be any enemy in the game a player wearing a ghillie suit for example could be holding a rocket launcher and there's no way to know until he's already started firing this is an even bigger pop when it comes to players using c4 or c5 as it's known in this game in past battlefield games seeing a specific class running at your vehicle would indicate whether they were capable of blowing you up instantly with explosives an assault class rushing you is often not a big deal as they are never equipped with c4 but a recon class or a support class depending on the game was a totally different story and would be cause for panic in 2042 though this is again a mystery to the player anyone could be holding explosives so it's difficult to prioritize targets and this issue extends to general infantry combat as well you really don't know what kind of weapon the enemy may be fighting you with a player wearing a ghillie suit originally could be identified as a sniper so it's likely they were using a bolt action rifle that you could probably outrun and dodge but now players using the casper specialist could just be wielding an lmg and you won't know until it's too late in short there's just no defending the special system in its current state there's other specialists still yet to be revealed but aside from having their own unique tools there's really nothing about any of them that makes it worth scrapping battlefield's most fundamental of gameplay structures moving on let's talk about the weapon customization and general balancing aside from this specialist system the way weapons are handled is more or less the same as it always has been the several different weapon categories each with their own ideal configurations suited for certain play styles but instead of featuring a detailed weapon customization screen prior to spawning into the world like in battlefield 4 battlefield 2042 introduces the new plus system that like metro exodus and crisis allows players to fully customize their weapon at any time while on the field by simply pressing a button players can toggle between several different attachments for four different areas of their weapon the scope the magazine the barrel type and the grip each with helpful stat indicators and notes demonstrating what each attachment adds to the weapon's performance it's a cool idea as players can now change out scopes and barrels depending on their situation however it's also a little bit limited in its current state as well it's unclear exactly how the system will work with the full game as there seems to just be a random selection of attachments for each weapon in the beta the smg for example had a few different barrels to choose from and a suppressor but other weapons didn't seem to offer suppressors at all my guess is that with the final game you'll be able to choose which 3 attachments you want to bring with you from each of the 4 categories meaning there will be just as many attachments as in bf4 if not more as for the actual gunplay itself i think 2042 is on the right track the combat feels fantastic in this game from what i've played with a short time to kill great long range accuracy and satisfying kill confirmation sound effects the user interface is a little problematic and i'll expand upon that in a bit but so far the only weapons that don't feel as good are the sniper rifles considering how effective lmgs and assault rifles are in this game it's surprising just how weak and useless the bolt-action snipers feel the bullet velocity is way too low making long distance shots very difficult to execute and to make matters worse the damage dealt is so minimal that by the time you finish reloading the enemy will likely have already found a way to heal themselves back to a hundred percent snipers in battlefield 4 feel more satisfying overall with much queer crosshairs and higher bullet velocity making long range engagements feel practical another strange change that's been made is to the grenades in pretty much every battlefield since bad company 2 grenades can be thrown instantly by either tapping or holding the grenade button but battlefield 2042 removes this quick throw option entirely forcing players to switch to the grenade and then throw it separately which certainly hurts the pacing of the action thankfully the grenade itself feels nice and powerful with high damage output and a decent radius and because this particular map is so large the grenade spam didn't feel quite as noticeable as it usually does 2042 also reworks how melee kills are handled in battlefield 4 players can eliminate players using a flashy first person takedown animation dependent on the direction that the victim is facing but in 2042 there's only a single takedown animation that's shown in third person which is arguably not nearly as satisfying if the player tries to melee attack in front of an enemy then they'll instead just throw a punch with multiple punches being enough to kill someone it doesn't feel quite as polished as previous entries in the series though it does seem likely that we'll see additional more unique takedown animations with the final release next i wanted to talk briefly about some of the changes that have been made to the available gadgets starting with the defib paddles the defib revive system has undergone dozens of changes since battlefield 2 with many games making the tool a simple one-click trigger while others tied in a full revive animation with set timers in battlefield 4 players could choose to instantly revive a teammate by clicking the shock battles once or they could press and hold to charge the paddles bringing the incapacitated player back with full health in 2042 though the defib paddles must be charged to revive a player and instead of being a separate tool they're now context sensitive requiring players to hold the interrupt key down when close enough to a downed player this presents two problems as well one the interact key is the same key used to swap kits so medics will often accidentally pick up a weapon instead of revive their teammate and two the forced timer applied to the animation feels inconsistent and resets if the player lets go of the button too quickly this is a really clunky design for the revive system as it limits the player's options and makes reviving less intuitive than it ever has been other than that most of the core gadgets function about the same as always the med kit and ammo box have a new visible radius to indicate when a player is within range for them to function and the c5 explosive has a funny randomized display message every time the trigger is pulled but otherwise these features should feel fairly consistent with their appearances in other battlefield games the only other gadget that i think could use some work is the rocket launcher the velocity of the rocket projectile is too low to be used against any helicopters and jets like before and what's worse even if you do manage to master that rocket velocity the damage dealt to these difficult targets is disappointingly low a direct hit on a scout helicopter for example won't blow it up with a single hit it won't even disable it it will at least hold its own against armored ground targets like tanks dealing anywhere between 25 to 35 damage depending on where you land to hit but i feel landing a shot on a lightly armored aerial target should deal increased damage if possible like it does in battlefield 4. and that brings us to our next topic the vehicles battlefield 4 featured a ton of eagles each built specifically to counter one another with the series signature rock paper scissor formula bf 2042 is built in very much the same way only now because of the increased player count there's a lot more of every vehicle in the field at once this makes the airspace at any given time a wild spectacle flares rockets and gatling guns lighting up the sky while tanks and scout vehicles duke it out below it's quintessential battlefield and easily one of 2042's strongest aspects as most of the vehicles in the game have a decent feel to them helicopters in particular have a really strong torque allowing them to accelerate into a climb or drop almost instantaneously whereas there's a bit of a gradual climb in battlefield 4. you can also roll helicopters over and perform flips more easily almost like the old battlefield 2 days but there's also a simplistic feel to them too almost as if they've been toned down to be more accessible to newcomers and the weapons included by default for the choppers especially the scout helis do feel a bit excessive the scout howies not only get dual chain guns for infantry but also rocket pods making it almost a more effective chopper than the attack helis i think reducing the number of rocket pods for the scout heli and improving the accuracy of the chain guns to coincide better with the player's crosshair would help to balance this vehicle out a bit more and make the attack helis feel more practical as a result the jets though are even more problematic they're easily the least effective vehicle in 2042 they feel terrible to fly with really slow banking speeds and a weirdly cluttered first person cockpit view and they also feel wildly ineffective against the many choppers and fetals roaming the skies so much so that dogfights with other jets is very uncommon they do have a new air brake feature which is a nice addition that's never been added before but its limited maneuverability and weak armaments make it little more than a single man transport to get across the map quickly the vitols are one of bf 2042's biggest new additions these behemoths seem to replace the standard transport helis from the past and serve more as flying tanks with lots of powerful passenger guns and a ridiculous amount of health these can take several hits by aa missiles and will still fly straight because all vehicles use a auto healing system after a long while it'll take a dedicated squad of players several rockets to take down one the ground vehicles are about the same as their battlefield 4 counterparts tanks for example have the same great feel to them with a really powerful cannon that's coupled with some nice sound effects the aa tank feels okay in its current state though its lock on range is very far and can easily shut down in airspace if used properly and while it does have low armor to help balance it out i feel lowering its range by about 30 percent would help to make it feel a little bit more balanced then of course there's the scout vehicles that are more maneuverable and drift prone than the jeeps and trucks in battlefield 4 and will fly off of ramps in an almost comically over-the-top fashion but the biggest change up to the whole vehicle system is the way spawning works like with battlefield 1 and 5 players are forced to spawn directly inside of vehicles from the deployment screen this means there's no airfields or vehicle spawning locations at a base deployment what's more vehicles now have a new spawn cooldown timer preventing players from consistently spawning in their favorite vehicle without letting someone else have a churn this is a great feature as this has been a long-running problem with the battlefield series unfortunately in its current state the spawning rarely works properly spawning from the menu on a specific vehicle sometimes just spawns the player as a soldier at a completely random objective additionally using the new deployment tablet to call in a vehicle drop almost never works and it's not clear why certain vehicles are unavailable at times moving on let's talk briefly about the user interface this is an often overlooked aspect of the beta that i feel needs some serious work before release the ui is a mess in its current state with bugs causing some notifications to appear larger than they should kill feedback either repeating itself or being delayed and other anomalies like the wrong icons appearing for vehicles but the biggest issues seem like intentional design choices that greatly impede the flow of the game there's the size of icons for example that don't seem to adjust based on distance making friendly players with a revive symbol appear closer than they actually are then there's the squad orders that can't be activated until the squad leader or members are already practically on top of the objective additionally there's no way to zoom in or out the minimap like before or even a full overhead map at all though the latter seems to just be a bug and then there's just the overall style and design of the hud itself that feels overly large and intrusive wasting screen space and contrasting too heavily with the action especially the large banner notifications that drop down to demonstrate that a team has gained or lost majority the scoreboard is also very difficult to read with a lot of key information being weirdly hidden from the player that could otherwise be used to identify obvious hackers high pings and other key information even the series's signature comma rose is not available to use in this build of the game with the developers stating that it may or may not be ready for the full release it all just seems incredibly odd as a lot of these elements have existed within the series since the beginning and to not have basic functionality like being able to communicate with teammates or just viewing an overhead map is of particular concern even if the build is three months old but it's also possible that these seemingly more simple aspects of the game are prioritized in the later stages of development and what we're seeing is most likely just placeholders for the design finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison now just a reminder none of the weapons in 2042 are technically shared with battlefield 4 at least not exactly but by using similar weapon types in regards to their functionality in the game we can at least determine a rough idea of how the sound has been updated with the latest release so what do you think what game do you feel has the better sound quality and design [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] so [Music] they have control of sector alpha [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall battlefield 2042 is in a rough state from a purely graphical perspective it's a huge improvement the world is gorgeously detailed the lighting is great and the visual effects are spectacular there are a few areas that look rough like the design of the character models and a few of the weird graphical bugs and glitches though it's nothing that can't technically be fixed by release but the gameplay design is particularly concerning as it seems to stray away from some of the series's most fundamental tenets team play and communication are key to what made games like battlefield 2 such a huge success back in the day so it's odd to me that with this latest game basic features like distinct class roles and a usable user interface were not given top priority when piecing this together the specialist system just doesn't make any sense it's not like their gadgets are all that unique either we've had auto sentry turrets and deployable shields in 2142 and they were tied to the support role as gadgets but at the same time those gadgets didn't replace the supports ammo box as that was seen as a key aspect of the game's team play design just as the repair tool medical crater i think the easiest solution here would be to just give players four classes each with key gadgets like ammo or health boxes that can never be unequipped the specialist tools like the grapple and sentry turrets should be optional as they aren't nearly as important to the flow of the gameplay certain primary weapon types should also return to being class specific in order to aid in threat priority and both factions should have specific skins just like how the vehicles are already faction specific without those changes battlefield 2042 just lacks the sort of structure that makes its wild sandbox actually work it's a nice sentiment to give players the options to do whatever they want but without any sort of backbone to it all it ends up devolving into a complete unwieldy mess but what do you guys think do you think battlefield 2042 looks and plays good from what you've seen so far or do you agree with some of the concerns that i've brought up here let me know in the comment section and don't forget to like and subscribe for more content like this posted every week foreign
