welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the recently released pc version of sony ben's open world action adventure game days gone and see how it compares to the original ps4 version of the game released a little over two years ago and if you're wondering why we're not looking at the ps5 version of the game instead well that's because my ps5 is currently on its way back to sony after completely breaking on me during my playthrough of return last week so my coverage for that game and other ps5 specific titles will be on hold for the next few weeks but considering it's still close to impossible to even get a ps5 i reckon a lot of you today are still more interested in seeing how the ps4 version or more specifically the ps4 pro version stacks up to what in theory should be the ultimate version of days gone played on a much more powerful pc for this analysis day's gone is being played on a pc with its settings cranked up as high as possible at a native 4k resolution whereas the original release is being played on a ps4 pro outputting and recorded on a 4k capable display and after this comparison if you want to learn more about days gone be sure to check out my other videos on the game listed in the description below alright so let's kick this comparison off by first going over some of the character models starting with our lead protagonist deacon at the standard camera distances deacon looks virtually identical between these two platforms things like the poly count the texture maps and all the small intricate details along this person like various ties straps tears and jewelry all remain intact though upon extremely close inspection there are a few subtle changes that can be observed deakin's ring for example does have a higher poly count helping to make the insignia more rounded than before and while the texture maps are the same they're far easier to make out thanks to the ability for the pc to lock its resolution at 4k making things like the hairs along his beard and brow stand out more prominently and other finer details like the zipper to appear with more depth i also found that some of the weird checkerboarding artifacts found on the ps4 version are no longer a problem on pc an extremely fine details like hair don't exhibit that same fuzzy pixelated look anymore they've even addressed a very minor bug at the start of the game where deacon's pants appear clean during this cut scene but then inexplicably are super dirty once the players give him control a second later an issue i did not observe when playing on the pc even so there's not very many improvements across the board with any of the characters in the game so let's move on to our next section and talk about the environments the environments are kind of more the same situation for the most part it's an identical layout all the geometry the vegetation and textured surfaces are all identical but there are still some very minor changes thrown in that give the pc version a slight edge first there's been a nice bump to the lod distance reducing the amount of pop in that you'll experience mainly for plants and shadows that they project additionally some areas have more vegetation than before like these tall clumps of grass surrounding the tent at the bottom of the cliff along with this there's also a lot more detail in certain scenes like this piece of cloth lying in the road or this fallen tree that's brought out more by a mix of the higher 4k output resolution and just additional texture work in general however weirdly enough there are a few exceptions to this specifically this opening cinematic where the pc version seems to look worse the textures just don't seem to be loading in properly here and it's a problem that seems to persist all throughout this particular cutscene this problem never returned afterwards though so it could just be a one-time bug other than those instances the environments are more or less the same between versions with only very minor increases to the level of detail on some of the surfaces and very little added to the level environments to make them feel more dense next up we have lighting once again very few changes here the wing design has been carried over exactly from the ps4 version with near identical dynamic lighting effects volumetrics and reflective properties there are a few very minor exceptions to this though like this missing specular lighting effect on deacon during one of the cinematics and some scenes feeling like they have a slightly different brightness level to them despite the brightness setting in game matching up exactly but it's otherwise the same and the shadows are the same deal as well with nothing but an increase to the sharpness for projections by the player and an increase to the shadow render distance for vegetation especially along the sides of roads there's still a bit of minor differing that occurs underneath the hairline of characters during cut scenes but because of the higher resolution this too isn't quite as noticeable anymore and feels a bit cleaned up in general next we have effects that again really won't change your mind all that much in regards to daze gone's visual design the explosions for example function exactly the same as before with identical particle density and emitted fireball effects only with some slight differences due to the variability of the effect itself the fire also hasn't been changed at all and while it mostly looks great it still does that annoying thing where sometimes the flames don't show but still propagate and create ambient light that inevitably will light enemies on fire it would have been nice to see this occasional bug addressed but it too remains identical to the way it's handled on the playstation so collectively there's really not too much new with this release of the game when it comes to its visual design the character models the environments lighting design and effects all these aspects have been brought over more or less the same so if you've already played this game on playstation or if you're playing it on ps5 then what's the point in playing it on pc now well like with the horizon zero dawn and death stranding pc ports days gone's biggest achievement on the pc is its fantastic performance level assuming you have the pc that can handle it at least the game runs incredibly smooth in the builds that i've tested with frame rates far exceeding the capabilities of even the ps5 version of the game it's honestly the only thing that really bugged me about days gone especially considering how accurate you need to be with the weapons to avoid getting overwhelmed so to now have the game running at 100 plus fps even during some of the most absolutely insane horde fights makes the experience much more enjoyable which is why instead of a sound comparison that wouldn't really make much sense considering it's using the same sound i want to show a few brief clips of the game in action on both platforms so you can see for yourself how much of a difference the increase in performance makes can't have much no [ __ ] he can't have much gosh [Applause] [Music] the hell [Music] finally um uh and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall day's gone feels right at home on the pc what was already an absolutely gorgeous game on the playstation family of consoles is now looking just as good if not better with performance that makes it much more fluid and exciting it's a confident port of an underappreciated ps4 original though sure it certainly isn't perfect as there are a few minor grips i've had with the game itself outside of the performance which is why i recommend you check out my review of the game as well but other than those few minor issues this is a fantastic release that will hopefully be followed by more playstation exclusive titles brought to the pc sooner rather than later but what do you guys think are you impressed with days gone on the pc or were you expecting more let me know in the comments section and don't forget to like
