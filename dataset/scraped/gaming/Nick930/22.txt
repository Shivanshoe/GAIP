this video is sponsored by crytek welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the full crisis remastered trilogy collection and see how it compares to the original trilogy of games both in terms of visuals and available features for this analysis all games are being played on a pc with the graphics settings cranked up to their highest settings at a native 4k resolution and the motion blur options will be disabled to ensure cleaner image captures also because each of the crisis remasters do support nvidia's deep learning super sampling technique i will be setting this feature to its balanced mode as i feel this provides the optimal presentation with the most reliable performance especially when using the hugely demanding retracing options for each of the three titles and of course if you like what you see in this video and want to try out the collection for yourself the crisis remastered trilogy is available today for fifty dollars us on pc current gen and last gen consoles and even the nintendo switch you can learn more about this collection and the crisis series from the links i provided in the description alright so let's kick this comparison off by taking a look at the first crisis and the changes that have been made to the remaster since the last time i looked over it now if you may recall from my comparison last year there were several issues with the first remaster in this collection including but not limited to broken physics poor performance and arguably some less impressive visual effects now i can't say every issue i've brought up before has been fixed since that last review but there have been a number of fixes that are worth mentioning first off there's the performance the performance originally made crisis remastered borderline unplayable on its maximum can it run crisis settings the idea for these settings was to future proof the game pushing out the lod to an insane level with thousands of distant objects like trees and other vegetation being visible from much further away and while it didn't run well it made scenes like this overlook look very impressive but thanks to the implementation of dlss these options are actually usable for those with a compatible gpu with frame rates typically averaging in the 60 fps range it's still not perfect as the frame rate can dip down when viewing things like this wide vista here but it's otherwise a much more playable experience than it was before saber interactive have also addressed a major bug with crisis remastered physics effects in the original release many of the dynamic physics seem to be broken with a low frame rate for animations making things like tree leaves move in a jittery unnatural way but now the tree leaves will move fluidly just as they were always intended and other physics-based effects like dynamic destruction also seem to have been addressed with the wood planks from this fence now breaking apart into smaller pieces than when we last looked at it it's still not as complex as the destruction in the original 2007 version but it's an improvement nonetheless other worthwhile improvements include a reintroduction of the infamous ascension level where you fly a vtol across the island and dogfight with alien scouts the addition of a revised nanosuit ability wheel that can be easily toggled in the menu for players that prefer the classic control scheme the ability to lie prone even when using a controller which i don't think was in any other previous version of the game and the ability to lean left or right again with all these changes the crisis remaster is now on a more level playing field than it was before i still feel there are a number of advantages to playing the original over the remaster like the ability to manually save games and i also still feel that the lighting design in many cases looks more photorealistic in the original game as opposed to the highly saturated look of the lighting used in the remaster but with the aid of ray trace reflections more accurate hdr and bloom implementation along with higher quality textures weapon models and smart use of volumetric clouds there's no denying that the crisis remaster can look more impressive at times even if it's not always the most realistic appearance and things only seem to get better from here as the crisis 2 remaster has launched in a far more stable state with net gains and visual quality across the board along with several much needed fixes that only serve to better the experience take the weapon models for example each weapon in the game has been updated with higher fidelity models and reworked textures better integrating them into the world with the overhauled lighting design additionally the weapons also sport a depth of field effect now blurring out the portion of the weapon closest to the player and hiding some of the details near the edge of the screen but the best improvement to the weapons is without a doubt the fixed firing and reloading animations that for whatever reason were initially locked to 30 hertz on the old pc version even when running at frame rates well above 60 fps it's one of many animation locks that seem to have been lifted with this remaster as physics-based objects in the world and other scripted destruction effects are now more consistent with the smooth action of the gameplay the quality of the environments has similarly been improved with updated texture maps on practically every surface there's even some improved tessellation effects implemented around the game world as well a feature that was pretty new back when crisis 2 first released but this effect is integrated more realistically this time around and this is due largely in part to the redone global illumination just like with crysis 1 crisis 2 remastered lighting has been given a total overhaul though unlike crisis 1 and its weird blown out saturation the lighting in crisis 2 remastered does tone down some of the lighting designs that were initially excessive bloom for example isn't blindingly bright to the point where detailed surfaces are being lost in translation and the general tone feels more consistent with what you'd expect rather than the exaggerated appearance of the original game this is because light in the game world seems to actually be the result of visible light sources like the sun as opposed to being manually placed around the world like before this means interior surfaces will now appear darker and will only be illuminated when there's either a direct light source or an opening that allows for indirect light like from a window on top of this crysis 2's specular lighting has also been improved a great deal with all the texture maps now standing out more prominently at appropriate angles giving the game a more sleek and modern feel that being said there are a few areas where i feel the more technically advanced lighting has the opposite effect and actually hurts the visual aesthetic of the scene like this corner where the shadow projections are now missing or this rainy street corner outside of times square where the screen space reflections are practically non-existent now to make up for this crisis ii remastered does feature ray trace reflections with many surfaces more accurately reflecting light relative to the type of surface glass and metal surfaces for example will often show reflections of larger assets like trees buildings and the character all in real time and these are then coupled with some screen space reflections at times to improve the reflection even further crysis 2 remastered also sees a small bump to its particle density that for a 2011 game was already pretty impressive to begin with but you'll find that smoke stacks seem to be much lighter in the remaster as the clouds of smoke are now reflecting ambient light more accurately and the result is a more photorealistic looking image finally there's the inclusion of dlss again that i feel may be the biggest reason why i'd recommend this remaster over the original the performance of the remaster is just unmatched from what i've played with no noticeable stutters and buttery smooth combat even in the most intense encounters wrapping up the trilogy we have crysis 3. now with this title we see even fewer visual improvements which is understandable considering crisis 3 classic could release today and still passes a next-gen title the game is absolutely gorgeous still and is also pretty demanding even on the most top of the line hardware today which is why crysis 3 remastered's dlss option makes it the preferred choice when playing this conclusion to the saga as the average performance feels so much smoother even during this famously demanding sequence additionally just like with how crysis 2 remastered fixes the low frame rate weapon animations crysis 3 also seems to fix the animation fluidity of several environmental assets like water rippling even the dynamic grass has been fixed that was previously locked to 30 fps but now is running at 60. crisis 3 remastered also sees many texture improvements along with some minor enemy uniform redesigns but when compared to crisis 1 and 2 these changes are mostly minor and only noticeable when comparing the game side by side the only thing that i'm not particularly a fan of with this particular remaster is the coloration of some of the scenes like with crysis 1 remastered crisis 3 remastered seems to inject a bit more color into each sequence in a way that feels a bit unnecessary the grass is almost too green in this opening area and while it doesn't necessarily look bad it doesn't quite nail the same photorealistic look that the original had either finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which versions of each game do you feel has the superior audio design and quality [Music] [Music] [Music] oh god so [Music] so [Music] yes prioritize sector 1 delta 6 strong contender magazine wow and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall the crisis remastered trilogy has proven to be a worthwhile collection for both fans and newcomers alike not only are many of the biggest problems with the original crisis remastered finally addressed but both crisis 2 and 3 remastered feel great to play right out of the box with far more sophisticated lighting fixes to decade-old visual bugs and vastly improved performance thanks to dlss old-school fans will no doubt still be disappointed that this collection does not include any of the online multiplayer modes and there's definitely areas where the rework to the lighting seems to deviate in a noticeable way from the original art direction but this is an otherwise great way to experience one of crytek's crowning achievements these improvements are even more apparent when playing on consoles where players on current gen consoles like the playstation 5 and xbox series x will be able to enjoy each game the way that they were meant to be played with high fidelity visuals and smooth performance but now that we finally have the full collection what do you guys think do you feel the updates made to the original game and the improvements in crisis 2 and 3 are enough to justify this remastered trilogy or were you still expecting
