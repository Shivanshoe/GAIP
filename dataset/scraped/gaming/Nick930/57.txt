welcome back everyone i'm nick930 and this is my final review for the long-awaited cyberpunk 2077. cyberpunk is a first-person open-world role-playing game inspired by mike pondsmith's tabletop rpg created in the late 80s in it players explore a massive dystopian metropolis called night city where corrupt mega corporations like arasaka rule on high while gang wars and human trafficking run rampant below the situation is exasperated further by the ease of access to body changing cybernetic enhancements disregarding natural evolution with devastating results it's a hugely ambitious setting and one that is coupled with a well-written story great gameplay mechanics and a beautiful art direction but after a good 40-some hours of playtime it's plain to see that this game wasn't really ready to hit store shelves as it suffers from a plethora of technical hang-ups but before we dive into all of that let's first go over the game's story in cyberpunk 2077 players take on the role of v a high strung mercenary with a reputation for getting things done but after botching a heist v is left in critical condition with only a short time to set things right before succumbing to his or her unique injury it's a compelling narrative and is enhanced further with some fantastic voiceover performances good pacing and a complex web of player choice the story kicks off with players selecting between one of three different backstories either a nomad a street kid or a corpo and each of these three backstories offers their own unique intro sequences along with unique dialogue choices throughout the course of the main campaign however outside of these instances and maybe a few specific side missions sprinkled throughout the backstory choice doesn't seem to change the overarching plot or even the personality of v all that much that being said the choices that the player makes do have a fundamental impact on how the game plays out this opening mission for example that has you finalizing a deal with a local gang can be approached a number of interesting ways like coordinating with a corporate agent to secure the necessary funds for the transaction or just going in solo with the intention for things to get hot the actual dialogue choices themselves could use a little work as they sometimes don't accurately reflect what v's voice actor actually wants to say but it's otherwise a really well designed narrative system the game features a wide range of supporting characters as well all of which are coupled with some nice voice and motion capture performances cyberpunk also does a fantastic job with its overall pacing and mission structure every mission both main and side are very entertaining the main quest can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to complete with lots of characters to interact with and exciting action set pieces mixed in for good measure and the side missions while not as robust come close to matching the level of polish offered by the main quest line normally side missions in these open world games test players with completing meaningless tasks for forgettable npcs and while there's definitely some of these missions in cyberpunk a majority of the site activities are varied and fun to complete and can offer big set piece fire fights and stealth sequences and a lot of times these side quests lead to valuable new gear or even a chance for some awkward video game romance even the seemingly more repetitive and annoying tasks you'll get called to do can offer something enjoyable for the player like ridiculous easter eggs and references to other pop culture material i'm going to kill you and all the cake is gone but i think the aspect of cyberpunk story that really steals the show is undoubtedly johnny silverhand played by the famous actor keanu reeves i don't want to dive too far into detail here as i feel this gets too much into spoiler territory but the dynamic relationship between johnny and v is fantastic and turns the story around significantly once he's introduced it adds an aspect that while not necessarily original still feels really well thought out and it's this narrative aspect that i think will stick with the player long after the credits roll but of course the story isn't everything so let's turn our attention over now to the available gameplay features cyberpunk at its core is a first person shooter built heavily around its robust rpg leveling mechanics birds will spend practically all their time in night city completing missions ranking up their character and blasting away enemies using a variety of crazy sci-fi weaponry if you're familiar with other looter shooter titles like borderlands or destiny then this should all function about as you'd expect however what cyberpunk does differently from those games is that it gives players much more freedom to approach missions their own way players that favor more action for example can go in guns blazing blasting enemies to bits jumping into the air and slicing them apart using cybernetic mantis arms while stealthier players can choose to mark their targets and distract them with clever quick hacks and then slip by unnoticed it feels decently fleshed out regardless of what style you choose to adopt though i do wish the game's diplomatic options were more robust i rarely found there to be ways to talk my way out of situations even relatively tame confrontations like almost hitting a pedestrian on the street with a car and then being met with police officers opening fire without so much as a warning and the game's stealth mechanics while serviceable still feel a bit too basic with a weird requirement to grab an enemy first before initiating a takedown animation as you progress further you'll unlock more abilities like an aerial takedown but overall the stealth mechanics feel noticeably dated and i found myself having much more fun with the open combat as a result the combat is certainly one of the stronger of the gameplay mechanics offered in cyberpunk there's a lot of great abilities incorporated here that helps to make you feel more and more badass as you progress further in the story you'll start things off with fairly basic first person combat maneuvers like being able to sprint crouch speak around corners and slide along the floor but as you enhance your character you'll eventually unlock access to much more advanced tricks like being able to slow down time during a dodge or double jumping high in the air and when combined with the highly varied arsenal the combat feels much more satisfying and intense weapons include your standard array of pistols shotguns mg's and sniper rifles but there's also specific variants and affiliated brands that offer their own distinct advantages like these power weapons that can punch clean through walls and hit enemies on the other side or smart weapons whose projectiles can track mark enemies and hit them around corners i had fun testing out all the new weapons i found and assuming it was the proper level for the enemies i was dealing with they all felt satisfying to use i think my only criticism when it comes to the combat design would have to be the melee system whether it's with a deadly katana or your bare fists the melee combat feels really rough you can swing light punches and heavy punches block and even parry but the way the enemy ai locks onto you with their own melee attacks feels so unnatural considering how rarely you'll need to engage in melee combat this isn't too big of a problem but for players looking to spec out their characters for a melee build this could prove to be disappointing speaking of which let's move on to talk about probably one of the most important aspects of cyberpunk's gameplay loop the player customization and upgrade system there's a lot to go over here and it can be pretty overwhelming especially for players unfamiliar with rpgs we'll start simple by first taking a look at the player's inventory here's where you'll find all your collected weapons and armor pieces like other rpgs you'll pick up weapons all over the place with a lot of randomized stats that determine the overall damage per second and newer weapons you find will typically perform better as they will scale depending on your current player level this encourages constant cycling of your loadout pushing players to experiment with everything the game has to offer even if it means switching up your playstyle from more run and gun to something more conservative and long range but sorting through these weapons can be a bit of a pain the game's filter options don't appear to be functioning properly at the time of writing this meaning you'll probably have to manually look through several duplicates just to find the better weapon most weapons can also be customized further using weapon attachments and gear mods adding extra functionality where you see fit these mods can either be found on defeated enemies hidden around the game world purchased or even crafted using the craft menu the latter of which i generally didn't find much use for throughout my playthrough next to the weapon inventory we also have several slots to equip found armor pieces this is another area that i feel could use some improvements as there doesn't seem to be any way to change the visual appearance of these armor pieces i spent most of the game wearing really stupid things like reflective construction vests and fedoras as opposed to the cool jackets that the game is often advertised with i think a really simple solution here would be to allow players to change the visual appearance of any equipped armor piece to any other items previously discovered similar to how the recent assassin's creed games have handled their own armor unlocks preserving the stats but retaining the look that you want it's not necessarily game breaking but it would be nice to see this change in the future now moving on we have the character skills tab this is where things get to be a bit more complicated the first section here is the attribute screen here you can assign attribute points to different aspects of your character's abilities this includes things like your overall body strength your technical know-how and your cool or how well you handle stealth you'll receive more attribute points as you complete missions in the game and upgrading each category will unlock unique dialogue options during conversations and expand the available perk trees for each respective category each of the attribute categories offers two to three skill trees each loaded with perks to unlock almost all of which offer passive benefits to the player the body attribute category for example has three different skill trees one for athletics like your overall health and recovery annihilation which enhances your combat while on the move and street brawler that can improve your melee capabilities these perks can be unlocked and upgraded using perk points which are also awarded as you progress through missions and side gigs alongside the player level cyberpunk also offers a secondary progression track called street cred street cred is earned by completing gigs and side missions in the game world and doing so will unlock additional side missions to complete along with helpful discounts at vendors finally there's cyberware this is one of cyberpunk's more important upgrade options by visiting one of the many river docks in the world players can purchase special cybernetic upgrades transforming their basic human body into an unstoppable machine upgrades here include things like the bladed mantis arms or fortified ankles that allow for boosted jumps but these enhancements are also some of the more difficult to obtain as they cost a serious amount of in-game cash and different doctors can offer different upgrade parts requiring you to visit multiple doctors before you find everything you want to get around the game world players can call for their own purchased vehicles that often pull up right next to the curb or they can alternatively steal an npc's car risking potential police interference the cars are alright though the controls could certainly be a bit tighter especially when trying to make tight churns and the physics do feel a bit whacking making head-on collisions feel really weak though if you really get annoyed with the driving you can always just take advantage of the many fast travel stations around the map as well so overall i'm decently satisfied with cyberpunk's core gameplay design sure the melee system is wonky and the stealth mechanics could use some fine tuning but i really like the combat mechanics and the progression options that kept me entertained all throughout so now let's turn our attention over to the elephant in the room the visuals and the performance cyberpunk 2077 is up there as one of the most visually impressive looking games that i've ever played with realistic looking character models an incredibly dense game world and an absolutely gorgeous lighting direction however getting it to actually run at this level of quality is a different story even on the absolute top of the line computer specs cyberpunk only manages a little over 20 fps when outputting at a native 4k resolution and cranking up all of nvidia's special ray tracing features you can of course obtain a more stable average frame rate by switching on dlss but i immediately notice a huge drop in the sharpness of the image quality as a result surprisingly the new playstation 5 and xbox series x actually managed to pull off a stable 60 frames per second with only a few minor dips here and there depending on the scene there's no ray tracing features as these are technically the ps4 and xbox one versions being enhanced on next-gen hardware but it's impressive nonetheless but then we get to the actual ps4 and xbox one platforms where the experience is just barely passable at best i tried this game out on the ps4 pro last week during a stream and not only did it run terribly but it looks substantially worse than its next gen in pc counterparts on top of this the game feels incredibly unstable and even crashed as soon as i walked out the front door into night city and then there's the bugs no matter what platform you play on you'll no doubt run into countless bugs throughout your playthrough these bugs can range from simple things like clothing items clipping through players view or characters t-posing to even more severe problems like npcs popping up in front of the player's vehicle or missions not triggering properly at almost every turn i felt like i was encountering another unintended problem with the game and because of the unique sci-fi theme sometimes it can be hard to know when the game is actually glitching out or if it's just part of the game's story almost every tv panel out in the open world has this weird flickering effect that seems to be unintentional and the relic artifacting that is supposed to fade away after a few seconds sometimes lingers requiring a full game restart i even had my controller constantly disconnect every time i press the a button with no solution other than disconnecting it from the system and re-initializing it an issue that i never ran into before hopefully these problems will be ironed out in the near future especially performance and visual quality on old gen platforms but until then just bear in mind that while the game itself is very good there's several layers of annoying bugs and glitches that you'll have to dig through before you can get to it overall cyberpunk 2077 is both fantastic and seriously flawed at the same time the game's story is engaging the gameplay is loads of fun and there's a lot of replayability for players to enjoy but the technical problems are simply impossible to ignore especially considering how much time fans have spent waiting for this game to finally be released only to receive what feels like an unfinished product i have no doubt that cd projekt will address most of these issues especially considering that they had some similar launch woes back when the witcher 3 first released but until then you should absolutely consider if the game's story and gameplay outweigh the almost definite bugginess you're bound to run into so what do you guys think are you willing to give cyberpunk a shot despite its technical shortcomings or are you gonna wait instead let me know in the comment section also if you do plan on picking this game up on pc be sure to grab your copy at gog.com which will not only give you a drm free copy of the game but it will also go straight to supporting both this channel and the
