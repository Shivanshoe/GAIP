welcome back everybody i'm nick930 and today i want to share with you my thoughts on guerrilla games highly anticipated upcoming title horizon 2 forbidden west forbidden west is a third person open world action adventure game that will soon be made available for both the sony playstation 4 and the more recent playstation 5 console in it players will embark on an epic journey across a lush post-apocalyptic landscape where they'll face down a wide variety of gigantic robot creatures using an expansive arsenal of technologically infused nomadic weaponry as many of you probably already know forbidden west is a direct sequel to the highly regarded ps4 game from 2017 horizon zero dawn and thus shares a lot of the same basic principles though it does also significantly expand upon these principles flushing out the game's combat systems its traversal diversifying the playable area and bumping up the visual quality to new heights and after having spent roughly 40 hours playing through it over the course of the past week or so i can confidently say that forbidden west is probably one of the most enjoyable games that i've played on the playstation 5 so far that being said there are still a few areas that keep this game from being perfect that i'd like to share some of which are minor hiccups and bugs that could potentially be fixed with day one patches and others that have more to do with the design of the game itself but before we get into that let's first take a spoiler-free look at the game's story forbidden west kicks off almost immediately after the events of both horizon zero dawn and its expansion the frozen wilds and follows the story of a nomadic huntress named eloy who's been tasked with the unprecedented responsibility of saving the planet from another catastrophic extinction level event following her actions in the first game eloy eventually learns that in order to fully save her world she'll need to head into what is known as the forbidden west or the former western united states and recover the fragments of an ancient computer ai system necessary to reverse the onset of several world-ending phenomenon complicating things further are the human inhabitants of these western lands known as the tanakh tribe who after a disagreement concerning their neighbors the karja are thrust into a civil war between the three dominant clans and a rebel group that has mysteriously discovered a way to tame the wild machines the game's narrative is set up in a mostly linear fashion with a set of main story missions spread out across a wide series of mountains and valleys stretching from former utah all the way to the san francisco bay though much like the original game there's not much player choice in how these events unfold as all dialogue options and player actions will progress the story in the same way each time that's not to say this is a bad thing though as i feel this does allow for a more concise narrative approach but for players unfamiliar with this game series i do feel it's important to highlight that while there are a lot of open world rpg elements to this game the narrative is set in stone with the only actual choice presented to the player being additional exposition by means of optional dialogue choices along with these more conventional dialogue and cinematic moments forbidden westworld is also loaded with some fantastic environmental storytelling from leftover written notes and audio logs that help to piece together the final days of the old world to the beautiful overgrown backdrops that the player traverses across it's genuinely fun to explore a lush jungle environment only to later realize that you're actually standing in the remnants of a famous old world landmark and it really does speak to the town of the art team here to be able to effectively sculpt in these rich playable areas while still retaining enough of these locations to make them at least somewhat recognizable another aspect of the narrative that i feel is worth mentioning here is the voice actor and animation performances unlike the first game that often came off feeling a bit repetitive with its recycled dialogue animations most of forbidden west conversations feel genuinely unique from one another all the motion capture and animation work has been tailor-made to suit each particular character and scene and that includes all the optional side quests as well by doing this interactions with other characters feel more meaningful and i found myself regularly invested whenever arriving to a new encampment and speaking with quest givers and this is aided further by some solid performances delivered by both old and new voice actor and motion capture talent alike which seems to be consistent with the quality expected of sony's typical first party offerings as of late however it's not perfect several times i caught aeloy weirdly staring off into the void or looking around erratically in ways that just felt unnatural it's something that most games are guilty of doing as well but because this game's characters can look so incredibly convincing at times it does seem to stand out more as it teeters in that uncanny valley it's not necessarily overly distracting and a lot of times it just boils down to an unintentional bug like this conversation where both characters eyes fail to move at all but in other areas it just feels like the animations for characters like eloy are a bit too exaggerated and just robbed the scene of its authenticity as for the quality of the storytelling itself it's not necessarily anything revolutionary it's your typical race to get to the treasure first type story with twists and churns along the way split up into three acts though it does at the very least maintain a consistent pace all throughout giving players plenty of breathing room to explore but also properly integrating some big moments to help to drive the plot forward the intro does drag on a bit as it wraps up some plot threads from the first game and slowly reintroduces the player to all the gameplay systems from before but once you're set loose into the actual forbidden west itself the game really starts to pick up and gives players a chance to explore at their own pace and carve their own path across a vast playable area based on my own playthrough which involved all the main story missions along with a healthy mix of side quests and activities the game will take roughly 40 hours to get through though for completionists i can easily see this reaching 100 hours or more which brings us to our next topic the game world forbidden west playable space is massive slightly eclipsing the size of zero dawn's midwestern region but unlike xerodon forbidden west world is also substantially more diverse in what it offers incorporating rich biomes with their own unique vegetation wildlife weather effects and terrain complexity integrated into these regions are old world ruins as i mentioned previously adding a literal layer to the environment along with a ton of returning and brand new open world activities to properly explore each aspect of the game's mechanics tallnex for example tests the player's ability to problem solve using the layout of the environment as each of these lumbering giants now require the use of nearby high points and structures to climb up to alternatively ancient relic ruins offer more puzzle solving opportunities with seemingly unobtainable objects requiring players to locate hidden door codes plug in power cores or open up new paths using special unlocked gear for players looking to test their stealth capabilities the forbidden west has plenty of rebel occupied outposts to conquer with lots of different hiding places distraction opportunities and loot to steal then there's the more direct combat oriented challenges like hunting grounds fighting pits and arenas that test the player's ability to deal with the game's many enemies in a wide range of time-based trials and finally like most open world games nowadays forbidden west comes packaged with its own unique mini game called machine strike machine strike is a sort of twist on chess where each piece modeled after certain machines in the game world have their own unique capabilities in regards to their movement attack power and defense but to mix things up a little bit more each machine strike match takes place on an uneven terrain board with different terrain tiles impacting the performance of the relative pieces additionally the pieces themselves can be collected throughout the course of the game expanding the player's wooden army and giving them a chance to take on more difficult foes and finally there's the return of cauldrons that act as horizons dungeons filled with a healthy mix of platforming puzzle solving and some fairly challenging enemies to defeat by completing cauldrons players unlock new override codes for machines in the open world which can then be used to sneak up on robots and reconfigure them to be friendly and in some cases can be turned into usable mounts which are easily the coolest way to get around the world though for players that are somehow too cool to be seen riding a robot velociraptor through the jungle there's always the returning fast travel option available using limited fast travel packs or the free to use campfires spread all throughout the world and that brings us to our next subject traversal rather than just climbing on very obvious yellow marked handholds in the environment like before forbidden west adds in a new free climb system allowing players to climb up most vertical rock surfaces with dynamic climbing animations the old yellow marked environmental objects are still present but they're more supplemental now making general platforming and climbing more varied and interesting adding to this is the inclusion of new unlockable special gear earned by progressing further in the story these include a special rope tool called the pull caster that could be used to rip open walls and vent covers to reveal new paths or can be used to zip towards marked points in the environment useful for a quick getaway in a challenging fight with an enemy then there's the shield wing that can be used at any time to safely glide down from a high point and then there's the diving mask that can be used to freely explore underwater without needing to worry about oxygen levels which is also coupled with new underwater gameplay mechanics like being able to hide in seaweed and jump off of marked objects for a speed boost to help clear stronger currents there's a few other special gear items to discover as well all of which will be necessary in order to uncover some of forbidden west's most well-guarded secrets infusing some metroidvania elements on top of all pre-existing traversal systems established prior though this is where things start to get a bit problematic the traversal and general movement and control of ailoy in the first game while serviceable was a bit cumbersome especially in tight-knit situations and i do feel that forbidden west does very little to rectify this issue i regularly felt like i was fighting with the controls trying to get alloy to move in the direction that i wanted only to have her get caught on tiny ledges and corners that i couldn't see at first though thankfully most of forbidden west does take place in larger outdoor spaces and aside from the occasional exposed tree root or boulder this issue doesn't present itself enough to be too problematic next up we have possibly one of the most important aspects of the main gameplay loop the combat design just like the first game horizon forbidden west combat is built strongly around using the right weapons and ammo types against the right target most of the combat involves circling larger robot enemies sliding and jumping to avoid sweeps and then blasting them with a series of elemental infused arrows and harpoons but new to forbidden west is a largely revamped melee combat system with lots of unlockable combo moves that could be strung together to make eloy as deadly up close as she is at range one of the most notable aspects of this rework is the addition of the resonator blast where players can latch on a blue target upon building up energy in their spear and then jump back to shoot the target to deal some massive damage it's a cool idea and i appreciate the effort that went into revamping one of the weaker aspects of the first game though it still doesn't feel quite right like the traversal i found the melee combat to be cumbersome and awkward with a noticeable delay in the action on screen relative to the buttons being pressed and because ailoy is stuck always using a wide sweeping spear it does feel a bit limited in this regard as well there's definitely ways to maximize the potential of these new combos to expertly dispatch challenging groups of human enemies but i did find that aeloy's ranged weapons were still more fun to use almost all the fan favorite weapons make a return here including the various bow types the rope and trip casters and a more cumbersome take on the rattler known as the bolt blaster though there's a few new weapons as well like the spike throwers that while limited in capacity can deal a lot of damage with each hit adding to this weapon variety is a range of different ammunition types all built to take advantage of available weak points across the many different enemies in the world a flying robot that shoots ice for example will be very vulnerable to flame arrows whereas a fire-based enemy may not fare as well when hit with a purge water attack causing it to be inflicted with a drenched status effect for a short while it's a persistent game of rock paper scissors and one that can get increasingly more complex depending on how many different enemy types the player engages at once and if the player does get overwhelmed they can now drop a smoke bomb to disorient their attackers and slip away unseen where they can proceed to heal up using any collected medicinal berries to avoid this type of scenario altogether players should scan the battlefield from a safe distance using their updated focus device that can now be used to highlight each component more easily using a quick tap to the left or right on the d-pad players can even pin specific weak points to keep track of during combat and lycan zero dawn can highlight their default patrol pathing to set up ambushes using a variety of traps crafted or built into the environment itself by understanding an enemy's various weaknesses strengths and vulnerable areas players can make short work of even the most intimidating foes assuming that they're within a reasonable xp level that is which brings us to our next topic the overhauled player progression system as with any action rpg players will progress through a set number of player levels by earning xp for completing actions like exploring the world defeating enemies and completing quests with each new rank players are awarded with skill points which can be used to improve alloy's abilities across multiple distinctive categories but this time the skilled tree is even bigger with smaller passive upgrades like ammo capacity stealth effectiveness and crafting speed being represented by these smaller less expensive nodes while the much larger triangles represent brand new active weapon techniques the weapon techniques offer a new creative way to utilize certain weapon types arrows can be launched in volleys strung together for a triple shot or even fired in a powerful braced position for a guaranteed knockback effect the catch is that these weapon techniques have a cooldown for use and only one skill can be selected at a time per weapon class though these can be easily toggled using the available weapon wheel forbidden west also introduces the even more powerful valor surge valor surges can only be unlocked by first unlocking all connected nodes in the skill tree once unlocked players can trigger their valor surge after building up their valor meter from various actions performed in game like defeating an enemy or knocking off a critical component the surges are typically powerful temporary buffs to the player like increased damage from arrows a protective shield the ability to turn invisible or a deadly electric aoe attack generally i think this is a great idea as it helps diversify alloy's already impressive arsenal of attack options but the way it's triggered does feel slightly cumbersome unless i missed some sort of hotkey when this was first presented to me it seems like the only way to trigger a surge is by accessing the weapon wheel first and then tapping the r1 button it's not necessarily hard to do but it does feel a little bit odd of a design choice considering most games typically go with the tried and true l3 r3 combo for this type of feature but skills aren't the only way to upgrade aloy forbidden west also sees an expansion to the number of merchant types available throughout the game world too there's of course weapon and armor vendors where you can spend earned metal shards on new powerful gear but there's also a new herbalist that you can buy various potions from cooks that will grant temporary buffs that could be consumed before a big battle and a few cosmetic based vendors to change armor dyes and alloys face paint there's even a new weapon bench offered at most settlements which can be used to upgrade players gear with rare robot parts and craft necessary provisions then we can't forget the star of the show here the robots themselves one of my favorite aspects of the original game was the large variety of robotic creatures that roamed these overgrown landscapes aside from certain story-specific machines every single machine offered in zerodon returns in one way or another in forbidden west and these are coupled with over a dozen more including the utah raptor looking claw strider what appears to be a sort of otter like machine called the burrower a massive snake called the slitherfang and the fully equipped battle tank version of a woolly mammoth called the tremor tusk there's of course a lot of other really cool new machines to discover as well one in particular that i was both happy and terrified to witness at the same time but i'd rather you guys discover the rest on your own all in all forbidden west just feels like a much better realized version of xerodon's gameplay design it takes pretty much everything that worked in the original game and improves upon it with more varied environments more open-world activities expanded traversal and combat mechanics and lots of ways to improve aeloy and transform her into a machine killing well machine and all these great improvements are then coupled with the elephant in the room the presentation simply put horizon forbidden west is one of the most visually impressive games i've seen on the platform since the system launched if you were waiting for a game to really push the playstation 5 technically then this is most definitely it i went into this expecting it to look roughly the same as the first game but was immediately blown away by the insane attention to detail here the character models alone look incredible with tiny details like peach fuzz hairs visible along most faces and some fantastic subsurface scattering that perfectly places the characters within the world i mean just look at this screenshot this isn't from a cinematic this is an actual in-game render shown up close using the provided photo mode feature which may enhance the detail a bit but it's still impressive regardless then there's the environment that is absolutely loaded with moving vegetation high quality shadows and dynamic ground deformation effects allowing for sand and snow to form realistic tracks and imprints when either the player or even npcs like animals cross through it on top of this there's more impressive water simulation lots of dynamic destruction effects for small structures and trees and other nice touches like wind simulation weather effects thrown in with visible particles of sand and snow being blown across the landscape it's an absolutely gorgeous presentation and it really does shine when displayed in its fidelity mode on a 4k panel for players that prefer smoother performance though forbidden west on the ps5 also offers a performance mode option at 60fps though this does of course come at the cost of a much lower resolution which is a noticeable drop in quality from its 30fps fidelity option and then of course we get to those technical issues that i hinted at earlier while the build i was able to play was an early review build with a few known issues set to be addressed with the day one patch i did still encounter a few rare issues throughout like lighting not properly applied to some character hair or various texture loading errors one issue in particular that really stood out though was an object model pop-in that caused larger structures to not render at the appropriate distance though i have been assured that this is an issue that's being investigated if not solved already other more minor issues include some occasional awkward animations during dialogue sequences some rare ai pathing issues and some odd rendering of the water surface in this opening area but otherwise i had a genuinely smooth gameplay experience all throughout overall horizon forbidden west is an absolute joy to play through it's precisely what a sequel to a successful video game should be taking all the aspects that worked and improving them with expanded gameplay mechanics and features without over complicating the formula additionally it hugely expands the playable area to include anything and everything that a player would want with not just canyons and snowy mountains like before but huge deserts jungles farmlands and tropical beaches add on to that even cooler robot dinosaurs a more cohesive narrative and some absolutely incredible visuals and we have a title worthy of pushing this series onward but what do you guys think are you looking forward to exploring the forbidden west let me know in the comment section and don't forget to like this
