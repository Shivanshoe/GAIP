the James Bond movie franchise is one of the highest-grossing cinematic series of all time with a collective gross of over seven billion dollars worldwide so it should come as no surprise that had generated an exhaustive list of subpar video game movie spin-offs and quick cash grabs throughout the course of the past 40 years but among the many titles released under the double-oh-seven license there have been quite a few standout classics that not only perfectly capture the spirit of the James Bond property but even helped to redefine gaming as a whole with revolutionary gameplay mechanics and unique ideas most of the Bond video games are either first or third person shooters with several elements from the popular films being incorporated in one way or the other players are often challenged with completing objectives using the robust arsenal of weapons and gadgets and are typically offered to the opportunity to play competitively in intense split-screen death matches a hallmark of the series during its heyday but sadly the series just sort of tapered off in the mid-2000s and the complex network of licensing agreements associated with the double-oh-seven property have made it extremely difficult for any future games or remakes to see the light of day so what exactly about this franchise was so special and what caused it to fall apart in the end well Dancer that let's start by taking it way back to the franchise's humble beginnings in the early 1980s the double-oh-seven series made its videogame debut in the early days of the video gaming industry the very first title based on the property is simply called shaken but not stirred a text-based adventure that has players attempting to stop the evil doctor death from destroying London with a nuclear device Tech's adventures were a big deal back then as they offered a more interactive way to experience storytelling and this particular adventure was well received for its incorporation of the popular Bond property however the creators of shaken but not stirred never obtained an official license to use the James Bond IP and so credit for the first official double-oh-seven game goes to the Parker Brothers instead the Parker Brothers were an old toy company that had been around for at least a hundred years at this point and had begun to break into the emerging video game market by developing several movie tie-in video games including the very first Star Wars game several attempts at making a licensed bonded Oh game were pitched to the Parker Brothers by different developers but the publisher eventually settled for one created by on time software the game is simply called James Bond double-oh-seven and released in 1983 for the Atari colecovision and Commodore 64 platforms it features a handful of different levels to choose from each inspired by a different James Bond film including diamonds are forever The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker and test players Luke guiding a pixelated vehicle across flat environments while dodging various obstacles as silly as this looks it was met with positive reviews back in the eighties with only a few criticizing it for its steep difficulty curve but more importantly it showed the industry the potential that the Bond series had in the video game medium a couple years later two more Bond games were released another text-based adventure this time by mindscape and a more complex action game created by don't mark software both of which were based on the film a view to a kill starring Roger Moore mine escapes game follows the same basic design as the original shaken but not stirred Tex adventure but was written this time by Raymond Benson an American author responsible for several of the Bond novels along with two Splinter Cell novels released in the mid-2000s while this new text game offered a more immersive Bond experience it wasn't quite as ambitious as demarks project dough marks a view to a kill features three distinct levels inspired by the film itself players can drive around Paris searching for the villain Mayday help Stacy escape from a burning building and need to explore Zoran's mines to disable his bomb it was an unusual game for 1985 considering it was basically three games in one but despite its ambition it still failed to stand out from the crowd especially with massively successful titles on Nintendo's new platform taking the world by storm throughout the course of the 80s the series continued to turn out more low-budget titles each focusing on a different film the double-oh-seven franchise mindscape released two more double-oh-seven ventures one on Goldfinger and another on live and let die while Doe mark released several more games each featuring an iconic moment from the respective films but even with countless releases Bond video games never found a solid foothold during its early days and was brushed off as a lazy cash grab linked to the declining quality of the films they released alongside at the start of the 90s interplay productions the very same that would later become known for their groundbreaking Fallout series published a narrative driven spy videogame built by Delphine software the game initially titled operation stealth was designed strongly around concepts and ideas in the James Bond universe but as interplay struggled to obtain permission to use the IP the initial release of the game featured alternate character names like John gleams and sin of James Bond after finally securing the rights to the property del fine updated the game to display the correct names and released it to the North American market though this led to a few inconsistencies in the story like bond working for the CIA instead of mi6 still despite these issues operation stealth or rather double-oh-seven James Bond the stealth affair worked a major step forward for the Bond series the game is beautifully detailed with colorful backgrounds and characters along with an immersive point-and-click style gameplay approach a mechanic that had proven popular with titles like Monkey Island while not the best received title in the 1990s the stealth affair marked a turning point for the series as it married the immersive text-based experiences from before with more interactive gameplay mechanics in 1991 the Bond series finally made the jump to Nintendo's platform with James Bond jr. a platforming adventure created by eurocom developments and based heavily on the animated cartoon series of the same name in it players control James Bond's nephew and navigate challenging platforming sequences while simultaneously fighting enemies with a handful of different weapons the game also released on the Super Nintendo platform with additional vehicle based levels echoing the classic style of some of the older Bond games but outside of the name and the idea of saving the world using cool vehicles and gadgets the game really does not have anything to do with the core double-oh-seven franchise in 1993 Demark released their final entry to the James Bond video game series with James Bond double-oh-seven the duel the duel is a platforming adventure game much like James Bond jr. only with a slightly more mature tone and a graphical design synonymous with other sega based titles like Sonic the Hedgehog the game features five level each with increasingly more challenging configurations of enemies that bond must defeat using a special along with female hostages to rescue in several classic Bond villains that serve as boss encounters the duel marks another major step forward for the series as it was made available to a wider audience and features a lot of the core elements of the Bond experience but it was nothing compared to what was on the horizon in 1994 a British game development studio called rare entertainment had begun making waves with a revolutionary Donkey Kong Country series for the Super Nintendo it was built using an advanced silicon based graphics processing unit the same style computer used to create the incredible CGI effects and films like Jurassic Park after completing the third Donkey Kong Country title the studio began to branch out significantly hiring several new developers of splitting into multiple development teams one of these teams led by designer Martin Hollis began work on a new unveil shooter experience using the recently acquired double-oh-seven license the project was initially planned to release for the Super Nintendo platform but suffered multiple delays as the scope of the project grew to be even more ambitious the development team worked for years building an advanced game engine with intelligent AI high quality weapon models and beautifully detailed environments as the game grew Martin decided to take the experience off the rails a direct response to the hugely popular doom series and its subsequent spin-offs and copycats this move transformed the game into something different entirely as the environments can now be expanded even further and more accurately represent the scenes from the film when the environments were finally completed the small team of developers began to populate them with several different objectives and enemy patrols resulting in a wildly different experience than any other shooter on the market finally after piecing together a last-minute split-screen multiplayer component rare released the breakaway hit Goldeneye double-oh-seven exclusive for the Nintendo 64 console the Goldeneye video game follows mostly the same narrative plot threads as the film it's based on players control James Bond in a new first-person perspective as they infiltrate secure facilities and recover Intel regarding a secret space weapon called goldeneye the game features many iconic sequences from the film like the big bungee jump stunts sneaking on board a frigate and planting a bug on a helicopter and even rolling through st. Petersburg in a tank though in order to accommodate the game's limitations a few elements of the story are tweaked promoting a much more action-oriented experience Goldeneye double-oh-seven is one of the first truly groundbreaking first-person shooter games designed specifically with consoles in mind first can control their character's movement in aim simultaneously providing an incredibly smooth control scheme that surprised many gamers convinced that shooters wouldn't translate well to a console controller but Goldeneye did more than that it also helped to popularize major components that are still used in shooter games today like needing to reload weapons or holding down a dedicated aim buttons and more carefully target an enemy with things like headshots being considered more effective than body shots it even includes some very basic stealth action elements allowing players to Sully dispatch enemies with silenced firearms and disable security devices without setting other nearby enemies on alert in each mission players are required to complete specific objectives in large open-ended environments filled with dynamic enemy combatants objectives range from standard information retrieval to hostage rescues and escort that serve to make every mission peel distinct and interesting the open-ended environments offer players the chance to approach missions creatively with multiple routes to and from each objective and several secret areas offering additional armaments and tools to stay alive by default players are equipped with bonds iconic Walther PPK but can equip more powerful firearms like the ak-47 m16 mp5 and spas-12 along with the option to dual wield weapons like the easy and takarov's all of which were given fake names to avoid copyright issues on top of these conventional firearms players can also make use of a few gadgets throughout the campaign including remote explosives a laser watch and even a devastating grenade launcher golden eyes impressive lineup of weapons was unprecedented in the early days of the FPS and the built-in special attachments like the sniper rifle scope and weapon suppressors allowed for more buried combat encounters speaking of which the AI was another hugely impressive feat every level game is populated with several soldiers some static that patrol specific paths and others that spawn in during alarm events each soldier is uniquely modeled based on the environment and even feature of rough facial textures of the developers that worked on the game on top of that the AI even reacts realistically to the player's bullets with each limb impact causing a different animation to play games today seem to neglect this small detail opting instead for standard ragdoll effects so to see a game from 97 pull this off even with their goofy low poly design is still impressive but it's the mission structure that really makes gold and ISO enduring when going through the game for the first time players are limited to the standard difficulty option called aging which typically only requires the player to complete basic objectives like saving a hostage and escaping but after successfully completing missions players then unlock access to two more difficulties secret agent and double O agent both of which offer increasingly more challenging enemies and several more difficult objectives to complete to accommodate all these objectives the environments are massive with lots of winding halls and wide open fields to explore some areas throughout the game don't even serve any purpose at all an aspect that serves to make the world feel more believable Golden Eye is also the first game in the series to offer secret bonuses to unlock including additional levels and a special cheat menu only further adding to the games replay potential but a lot of gamers picked up a copy of Goldeneye for an entirely different reason the split-screen competitive multiplayer this is arguably one of if not the most important aspect of the entire double-oh-seven video game franchise goldeneyes multiplayer is incredibly simple by today's standards where's plug in two to four controllers boot up an arena-style level with some match modifiers and then proceed to blast each other away but these brilliantly simple level designs coupled with a robust a list of match settings and character miles to choose from made this mode one of the most popular multiplayer experiences in the late 90s aspects of its design can still be found in shooter games today with the most recent example being the Golden Gun mode added to Ubisoft Rainbow six siege goldeneyes revolutionary multiplayer coupled with its brilliantly designed single-player component took the world by storm it was met with over bun ly positive reviews with many praising the game for its solid level design beautiful officials and addicting deathmatch mode the game became interactive art and sciences game of the year in 1998 and sold well over eight million copies becoming one of the top three best-selling games for the n64 gold and I stood tall in the sea of repetitive doom clowns and marked a new era for the first-person shooter as developers everywhere began to incorporate more realistic mechanics like reloading and headshots abandoning the old-school shooter style popularized by its software thanks to Goldeneye double-oh-seven had finally found its place in the gaming scene and other major players in the industry took notice seeing the untapped potential Electronic Arts purchased the license to use the double-oh-seven James Bond property the first project under the EA banner was handled by a small studio called black ops Entertainment who have previously worked on small fighting and vehicle based games recognizing the overwhelming demand for a follow-up to rares masterpiece black ops started off development on a new first-person Bond game with a competitive multiplayer mode only this time exclusive for the PlayStation instead the game was intended to be a follow-up to the film Tomorrow Never Dies and even featured unique scenarios like a scuba diving mission however after hearing complaints from their focus groups about their projects lack of iconic moments from the most recent Pierce Brosnan flick the team was forced to scrap a lot of their work and start over with a more simplistic third-person shooter style instead the games planned a multiplayer mode was canceled and the finished product released in 1999 under the name double-oh-seven Tomorrow Never Dies just like Goldeneye before it Tomorrow Never Dies is based heavily around the events in the film of the same name players need to navigate bond through ten levels as they investigate the media mogul Elliot Carver who's so desperate for good stories that he's resorted to staging a third world war unlike Goldeneye Tomorrow Never Dies is a third-person shooter with players able to walk around linear environments and lock on to the nearest enemy with a new auto aim system holding down the r1 key does allow players to access a stationary first-person viewpoint but it's difficult to control and often not worth using weapons include a silenced PPK with infinite ammunition along with a few more powerful weapons like the ak-47 the Manek 9-millimeter in oszi and a sniper rifle equipped with a special infrared scope like before players have a health bar that can be protected by equipping armored vest hidden throughout the environments but there's also first-aid kits now which can be collected and used at the players discretion and a new extra light token system the last purse to blink back to life after being killed the stuff action elements popularized by Goldeneye returned only slightly with silenced weapons and new takedown animations being technically possible but difficult to pull off with the sha dai but tomorrow whatever dies does offer a few new elements like the ability to ski in a couple levels a drivable BMW with front mountain machine guns and rockets and even a level where players control the female Chinese operative of Wei Lin still despite its few interesting moments Tomorrow Never Dies was a noticeable decline in quality from rares Goldeneye and fans everywhere took notice the game received mixed reviews with many citing poor performance updated graphics and the removal of the iconic multiplayer additionally the jump to the PlayStation platform was an unusual step as Goldeneye had amassed a huge following on the n64 Electronic Arts was off to a rough start with the property and set to make things right with their next attempt with their next double-oh-seven game ea aimed to address all the concerns raised with the previous title including a return to a first-person viewpoint a competitive split-screen multiplayer mode and a simultaneous release on the ps1 and n64 to accomplish this latter goal EA contracted eurocom to create the n64 title while black ops entertainment was given another shot at the ps1 release euro comms version of the game was more ambitious thanks to their advanced 3d capable graphics engine allowing for superior lighting draw distances and enhanced explosive effects all while maintaining a solid 60 FPS meanwhile the black ops version was more simplistic featuring the same engine as Tomorrow Never Dies and still not including any form of multiplayer mode by the end of the year the world is not enough was released for both systems and while the ps1 version didn't turn very many heads the n64 version was a notable return to form for the series as usual the single-player story for this double-oh-seven video game is based heavily on the events shown in the the same name players assume the role of James Bond his pursuit of an assassin in Spain leave them on a chase to Kazakhstan and Istanbul to stop an ex KGB agent from detonating a nuclear device via a submarine it's a much more complex story relative to other Bond films in that era and one that wouldn't translate as well to the overly simplistic gameplay design of a game like Golden Arm but well does that enough manages to pull it off thanks to much more immersive level designs and new fully voiced dialogue sequences that more accurately capture the spirit of the movie levels also resemble the locations of the film more closely with many areas being pulled directed from set photographs and blueprints to give it a more authentic feel the gameplay design is inspired heavily by rares in 1997 classic with a return to the fan-favorite first-person perspective and along with it a massive arsenal of weapons to utilize weapons include bonds PPK a desert eagle the ak-47 AUG tempe p90 spas-12 and the powerful sentinel rocket launcher that can be guided directly after firing it's a decent lineup of weapons but it still isn't quite as robust as goldeneye and the ability to dual wield weapons is not available to make up for this the world is not enough features much more varied gameplay mechanics the first mission sees players casually walking into a bank in Spain and getting through security without ever needing to pull the trigger the gunplay kicks off almost immediately afterwards but it's still a nice change of pace that's demonstrated a few times throughout the gains 14 missions one mission in particular called Night Watch requires players to sneak around Electra's of della late at night avoiding detection and obtaining Intel that was stealth in Goldeneye but not quite to this degree where being detected by certain NPCs can instantly fail the mission and players can now manually attach silencers to their pistol sacrificing power for stealth the world is not enough also puts an even heavier focus on bonds iconic gadgetry with new devices like x-ray specs safecrackers lock decoders wireless bugs and of course the famous wristwatch that comes complete with a grappling hook laser and stun device to more easily incapacitate guards the experience feels significantly more like a proper James Bond adventure with plenty of intense shootouts and scripted action set-pieces balance down by some slower-paced covert espionage at that of course there's the multiplayer that again takes concepts that worked in Goldeneye and attempts to build off of them with more game modes a robust list of map settings to tweak and even the ability to incorporate NPC BOTS into the action making for even more hectic death matches the world is not enough was met with mostly positive reception upon release many applauded the game for its beautiful visual design along with the new voice acting performances some of which were delivered by real actors from the film like John Cleese some outlets took note of the increased level variety eurocom incorporated praising sequences like the sinking submarine at the end for being hugely innovative however not everyone was impressed with EAS new bond game a few criticized it for being overly linear and scripted as opposed to rares game that offered much larger environments and more ways to approach objectives additionally the game suffers from much less intuitive controls with the vertical aim now severely limited as it automatically adjusts when going up and down stairs and can only be manually adjusted temporarily when holding down the aim button meanwhile the ps1 version was met with even harsher criticism it was criticized for its stiff controls repetitive gameplay in updated visual design it's still incorporated some of the new gameplay mechanics like an increased focus on gadgets but the lack of a multiplayer mode made it a forgettable experience anticipating backlash from the shortcomings associated with their second PlayStation double-oh-seven game EA contracted another studio to work on a separate bond game to release alongside of it this project created by a British development studio called new technics would focus on an often neglected aspect of the bond property the iconic car chases and resulted in the PlayStation exclusive double 7 racing contrary to what the games title may suggest double 7 racing is not a racing game it's more of an objective based vehicular shooter experience celebrating the franchise's long history of modified superspy vehicles but instead of just recreating every car chase from the movies double 7 racing offers an entirely new story told mostly through briefing screens and short cutscenes at the beginning and end of missions the plot involves bond tracking down a stolen armed men around the world and ultimately leads him to preventing a weaponized virus from being released by the end it's not the greatest story and feels a little bit forced in order to incorporate the more vehicle centric gameplay but it still offers some decent variety and even sees the return of iconic characters like jaws whose storyline is continued from his final film appearance in Moonraker much like the past feat bond games double 7 racing is built to run completing specific objectives only this time from behind the wheel of a car the controls are fairly straightforward allowing for acceleration and reversing along with a handbrake to quickly change direction but being as these are bond cars they can also make use of a number of tools and weapons all the gadgets you would expect are feature including forward mountain machineguns rocket pods armored panels smoke screen and even a deadly laser but these devices and weapons aren't always available to use each mission opportunity gameplay mechanics and vehicles to master with some requiring players to simply raced through a jungle using turbo boosts while another has you maintaining a high speed to avoid detonating a bomb there's even one mission that has you remotely piloting a BMW from a hectic CCTV camera and disrupting a storage facility from the inside there's some truly creative ideas incorporated here even if it's a bit rough around the edges meanwhile the competitive multiplayer offers a new take on the classic split-screen action here players can choose from any of the bond vehicles and battle it out twisted metal style with weapon pickups and health items spawning and set locations around a series of small theater arenas this mode only supports up to two players but still offers a little bit of customization allowing players to tweak which items will spawn and the wind conditions but of course its focus on vehicles and the PlayStation 2 limited hardware capabilities keep it from being as robust of a multiplayer experience as its n64 counterparts overall double-oh-seven racing was met with mixed reviews across the board it was criticized for its outdated visual design and frequently compared to the likes of Need for Speed and driver both of which had superior driving controls however a few did note that some of the missions were well designed and some praised the voice acting performances especially John Cleese who reprise his role as are once again well it's certainly not one of the better bond games double 7 reason is a unique and interest entry and the first double-oh-seven game aside from that one mission in Tomorrow Never Dies to attempt to capture the film's iconic car sequences using 3d graphics setting the stage for future Bond games to incorporate similar concepts later on as development wrapped up for the world is not enough and double-oh-seven racing Electronic Arts had already begun to set their sights on next-generation hardware including the hotly anticipated PlayStation 2 the original PlayStation had proven to be a significant roadblock for the double-oh-seven franchise and ea were eager to deliver a proper James Bond experience to PlayStation gamers to create this next-gen Bond game ea turns their own internal teams including AI Canada and EA Redwood Shores the latter of whom would eventually be known as visceral games the creators of the dead space series the goal for both teams was to create PC and ps2 ports of the world is not enough featuring even more impressive graphics and gameplay mechanics development started off smoothly with both teams utilizing its software's popular quake 3 engine in creating various character models weapons and environments based on the film but as production continued investors began to note that the window for the project's profitability was closing as the film it was based on was no longer relevant to account for this ea decided to cancel work on the PC port and instructed the development team to rework the game into a brand-new standalone Bond experience with an entirely original storyline with less than a year left the production team scrambled old assets were redesigned to create new characters and locations and talks with voice actors like John Cleese and even Roger Moore to reprise their roles fell through resulting in less recognizable stand-ins instead by fall of 2001 development for the newest title had finally been completed and double-oh-seven agent under fire released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 in November with an additional GameCube and Xbox released the following year agent under fire features an original storyline independent from any double-oh-seven motion picture though it may be one of the most silly storylines in the entire franchise it starts off said blown up with Bond rescuing a damsel in distress and recovering a briefcase filled with mysterious vials very quickly spirals out of control with an evil villain kidnapping world leaders and creating clones of them to help facilitate world domination it's a very Roger Morris Bond experience that would have made more sense had they actually managed to secure a contract with him but we're instead left with a hastily written story that feels to join it and forgettable thankfully the gameplay is a remarkable improvement over the past several entries to the series it takes practically everything that worked well in the world is not enough and expands upon it with an even smoother free aim control scheme similar to Goldeneye along with much more expansive level environments timur built for creative approaches to the action thanks to the use of the quake 3 engine combat in general feels more smooth and responsive making the series's signature auto a mechanic less of a necessity than it used to be most of the weapons incorporated in the game are repurposed from the cancelled world is not enough pork so weapons like the ak-47 desert eagle Susie and Aug all make a return but there's also a few new guns like the g11 and the Coleco m9 62 helped mix things up gadgets have also been improved upon with tools like the grappling hook now capable of pulling the player instantly rather than requiring them to awkwardly climb a hard-to-see string first can even use their cell phone to hack terminals remotely allowing more direct interactivity with the environment in fact environmental interactivity in general is one of the most dominant themes throughout ancient under fire levels are loaded with far more explosive props and breakable structures and triggering some of these traps can reward the player with the new Bond moment award encouraging players to think and act more like bond wood the stealth action elements from the past games have also seen some tweaks with where's now capable of incapacitating unaware enemies with a single melee hit to the back of the head and levels now features stealthy alternative routes to bypass cars unfortunately a good chunk of the game is occupied by less interesting Bond Rails shooter moments requiring bond to shoot as a K from the top of a vehicle while an AI drives them around though these moments are redeemed by some excellent vehicle driving sequences that improve in every way over the week driving mechanics in double-oh-seven racing encourage even more replay value agent under fire expands upon the bonus unlock systems from Goldeneye with new weapon upgrades like a gold-plated PPK mix in with additional unlocks like new multi-part levels and characters meanwhile the multiplayer has also seen some welcome improvements including more competitive map designs faster more satisfying shooting mechanics and the incorporation of new Bond gadgets into the action including a grapple hook that can reliably pull players anywhere in the arena and the jetpack allowing for some truly chaotic battles there's an undeniable influence from quake 3 arena here and it's surprising just how well it plays on the console platform granted the aim and controls are still stiff by today's standards but at the time this was a massive leap forward for the Bond series and an effective follow-up to the split-screen mayhem fan slot from Goldeneye despite the solid multiplayer in no case single-player campaign agent under fire was met with a familiar lukewarm reception the chief complaint among reviewers was the weak narrative and the outdated concepts with this being the fifth major Bond title since 1997 audiences were quickly growing tired of the superspy new original shooters were beginning to crop up on consoles including Medal of Honor Rainbow six and Perfect Dark a rare developed game that was initially intended as a goldeneye sequel before EA sudden acquisition those same developers eventually broke away from rare and developed yet another popular shooter series again building off of the popular split-screen multiplayer mayhem that fans have fallen in love with meanwhile a new behemoth in the console shooter market was beginning to stir that would soon prove to be even more popular than Goldeneye would the competition steadily mounting the next entry to the bond series would need to be on an entirely new level while agent under fire certainly wasn't the Goldeneye killer EA intended it at least managed to stabilize the series a bit encouraging the publisher to invest heavily in a sequel allowing for improvements to the visual design story musical score and gameplay they reached out to eurocom entertainment once again to how the main console releases along with gearbox software who handled the first ever EA bond release on PC the eurocom console title started development in of 2001 around the same time that agent under fire was being developed it was built using the same quake 3 engine as its predecessor though because of its increased funding and longer development cycle was provided an extra level of care and attention this new project given the working title Phoenix Rising would again feature an entirely brand-new adventure with locations like Tokyo and Romania along with more vehicle centric levels made possible by a separate team at savage entertainment the level designers push the hardware to its limits of what they thought was possible with a beautifully detailed environments unlike anything the series had attempted before along with plenty of enhanced effects like rain snow and impressive lighting to helping the locations to life pierce brosnan himself even agreed to lend his likeness to the game again only this time with a more advanced laser scanning process that paired with the higher poly count made for a much more believable bond after only 20 months of development all the pieces were in place for a revolutionary new double-oh-seven experience an EA released double-oh-seven night fire for the PlayStation 2 Xbox and Nintendo GameCube alongside a separate PC beliefs that I'll talk about more in a bit the double-oh-seven nightfire sees fun investigating a man named Raphael Drake the leader of a large nuclear decommissioning company that mi6 suspects of being a front for something more nefarious whereas once again assume control of bond exclusively though there are quite a few more fleshed out supporting characters this time including lead antagonist Raphael Drake is mistress and undercover French intelligence agent Dominique and even a return appearance from Zoe nightshade from the previous game make fires campaign is still pretty short but has much better pacing than agent under fire with expansive and intricate stealth sequences unless monotonous action set-pieces wears go from implicating a castle under the cover of night crashing a fancy party and ultimately end up in a huge vehicular battle on an ice lake a clear homage to die another day there's even a few references to classic Bond films like The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker but rather than trying to recreate those stories Nightfire stands as his own entity and while it's short-lived and predictable it's still one of the first actually memorable original double-oh-seven video game campaign and that's due mostly in part to its brilliant gameplay design Nightfire is one of the first entries to really bounce out all of the aspects that make up the double-oh-seven property it's still a first-person shooter like the past few titles but it doesn't seem to lean too heavily into the first person shooter concept and bounces it out more effectively between some great stealth action sandbox moments and exciting vehicle action set-pieces neck fire in general feels like the first attempt to make the video games feel more cinematic which is made evident by the inclusion of the iconic double-oh-seven barrel sequence and intense opening action scene followed by a title theme performed by Estero but nothing more properly exemplifies the design of knight fire than the exchange and the missions directly connected to it this first act of the game involves bond sneaking into a heavily guarded fortress in Romania to spy on Drake during a secret gathering and confidently combines everything that makes the double 7 game series so enjoyable the first mission highlights the game's sandbox stealth action elements allowing first assign lead dispatch guards find secret routes and even stow away in a wine delivery truck to enter the castle on scene but the game quickly transitions into some close quarters action followed by an intense series of chases all culminating in an epic showdown in the Aston Martin Vanquish each aspect of this opening act is expanded upon throughout the course of the game providing an incredibly well-rounded double-oh-seven experience far exceeding anything done previously as far as the movement and controls go Nightfire improves significantly over the previous game player and AI movement is slowed down a bit to feel more natural and weapons now are more satisfying to shoot thanks to the louver times a kill and higher accuracy weapons once again include classics like bonds PPK and a few returning weapons like the mp5k in Tikal and sentinel rocket launcher though there's also some crazy new weapons like the samurai laser and the ames rifle that takes up nearly half the screen many of the gadgets appear to be based off of the designs first introduced with the worldís not enough including night vision and x-ray specs laser watch and stunner though they're put to much better use here with more optional uses for them to help make the player feel more like the AI also shows a few signs of improvement like a more reliable detection system and new mechanics that allow players to hold them hostage and force them to drop their weapons but the actual bullet impact and death animations are noticeably dated and aren't quite as impressive as the ones used during the n64 days Knight fires multiplayer again expands upon concepts learned from past games with the over-the-top fast-paced action in agent under fire being toned down to provide a more grounded multiplayer deathmatch experience the jetpack does not make a return though the grappling hook is still available to use Albia only at fixed points in each map forcing players to learn the maps properly rather than just finding ways to break them overall double 7 knight fire was a remarkable next step to the series it improves in just about every aspect of its predecessors with incredible visuals great gameplay pacing and a more interesting story along with a fully fleshed out multiplayer component the game was met with mostly positive reviews many of which applauded eurocom for the beautiful graphical design and well and commending gameplay mechanics however many found that the campaign was too short and tapered off after the excellent first act and relied too heavily unscripted vehicle sections towards the end others complained about the lackluster bot AI especially regarding their passing in the various multiplayer maps but the bulk of complaints were directed towards the PC version of nightfire that despite the name and cover art looks and plays nothing like the superior console version the PC version of nightfire as I mentioned before was built by gearbox the very same studio that was responsible for both the PC port of halo and the infamous aliens colonial Marines rather than directly porting over a euro comms version of the game gearbox built their own version using the original half-life engine gold source and while some aspects of the game are similar like the style of the various locations the PC version isn't nearly as well face for immersive none of the great vehicle sequences are present and instead are replaced with stealth missions like this one that require a lot of pieces to get through you're not because it's challenging but because the AI feel so incredibly broken simply put the PC version of night bar is a dis asked her and received significantly worse scores overall and has ultimately tainted the reputation of the far superior ps2 Xbox and GameCube titles of the same name but even if the PC have received yura comes filled with a game there was no hiding the fact that the double-oh-seven game series was struggling to compete in the market bungees halo was all anyone wanted to play in the early 2000s and for PlayStation gamers unable to play it there was time splitters double 7 had become a relic and despite all the Polish hero complet into nightfire and his fantastic multiplayer EA saw little reason to try the same move again and decided that their next title in the series would need to go in an entirely new direction with the reputation in the franchise now at stake Electronic Arts decide that they would go all-out with our next game and put Redwood Shores in charge of the project redwood having just finished work on a third entry to the popular word of the Rings video game adaptations it's all potential in the third-person perspective and decided early on to bring the James Bond fantasy back to the perspective used in Tomorrow Never Dies the team once again used the quake 3 engine to build an entirely new double 7 cinematic adventure only now with way more funding and support everything about the development for this game was set for a triple-a release with more advanced motion captures improved driving mechanics and revolutionary graphical technology for exceeding anything possible in the series previously on top of that yeh even managed to not only get Pierce Brosnan's face in the game but for the first time his voice along with an impressive lineup of other stars like Judi Dench John Cleese Heidi Klum Shannon Elizabeth and Wilma Defoe who blamed the lead antagonist finally in February of 2004 EA released James Bond double-oh-seven everything or nothing quite possibly one of the most ambitious and expensive entries that the series has ever seen like night fire everything or nothing is structured very similarly to a James Bond movie with an action-packed intro sequence followed by an original theme song this time performed by R&B pop singer Maya the core story follows James Bond as he investigates a lead regarding stolen nanobots the narrative takes bond to plenty of unique locations including a speeding train in Egypt the streets of New Orleans and Moscow and again features a number of connections to past Bond stories including the return of the iconic villain Jaws and a reference to Christopher Walken's max Zorin character from a view to a kill everything or nothing is one of the few games in the series to feature a story that feels truly unique and original thanks largely in part to the games writer Bruce Fierstein who was involved in penning the screenplay for most of the Pierce Brosnan movies meanwhile the gameplay innovates in an entirely different way rather than improving on the already excellent first person shooter design that had been slowly evolving since Goldeneye everything or nothing brings the series back to the third-person camera giving players a full view of a bra sand look-alike as they move through enemies but unlike Tomorrow Never Dies shallow design everything or nothing it incorporates several new mechanics that have become a commonplace in third person shooters today the game still utilizes a similar auto-aim system though players can now use the right joystick to directly aim the weapon within the targeting reticle allowing players to carefully target weak points along with this players can also dive forward or to the sides shoot from cover and even seamlessly transition to a new hand-to-hand combat system complete with dodges and several different flashy takedown animations to help players identify the popular Bond moment opportunities everything or nothing includes a sort of slow-motion inventory screen that highlights objects of interest in the environment this can also be used to swap between weapons and select various gadgets that have also seen a complete overhaul instead of relying on old overused concepts like the laser watch bond is now equipped with new coin base grenades a remote-control spider drone and improved grapple gun that allows players to travel up and down vertical surfaces and a twist on the cloaking technology that doesn't just turn bonds card invisible but bond himself these gadgets are mostly awarded based on mission progression but special bonuses can be unlocked by earning high scores on missions again encouraging players to make use of as many signature bond moment opportunities as possible in terms of pacing everything or nothing follows the same basic principles as Knight fire the game mixes a healthy dose of stealth missions in with some intense firefights and car chases rather than featuring all these aspects in their own distinct mission the game seems to blend them together more seamlessly with players able to finally get in and out of their car during some missions the end result is an even more exciting any mersive James Bond experience and one that thankfully lasts much longer than the previous title the multi-part portion of the game has also seen a complete rework everything or nothing doesn't go for the traditional split-screen competitive multiplayer but instead is the one and only entry in the series to deliver a co-op campaign to avoid players fighting over who gets to be bond this co-op forces players to use one of four different secret service characters none of which talk or have any personality at all the co-op mode instead throws players to a gauntlet of enemies with some basic mission objectives and occasional boss fights and outside of some moments where you need to press buttons together or defuse a bomb while the other player defends this co-op mode really doesn't seem to take advantage of its unique concept and feels fairly lackluster as a result players can also unlock a competitive arena mode but instead of being handled like a traditional split-screen deathmatch arena utilizes a single fixed camera forcing players to awkwardly run around shooting each other and setting off environmental traps it's a huge step back from the likes of nightfire still despite its subpar multiplayer everything or nothing is often cited as one of the ultimate James Bond video game experiences its campaign perfectly captures the spirit of the Pierce Brosnan Bond era with plenty of action south beautiful women and fast cars along with a healthy dose of cheese the switch to the third-person camera was a bold and risky move but it paid off beautifully providing a more cinematic take that arguably suits the license property far better and the extra effort that went into providing accurate character models a star-studded cast and fully fleshed out game play mechanics really shows everything or nothing was met with mostly positive reviews it was praised for its creative gameplay design fluid controls and gorgeous officials and many applauded it for genuinely feeling like a real movie others praised it for its voice acting performances and excellent animation work giving actors like Brosnan a real presence in the game that few other games can match however the game's lackluster multiplayer hurt its lasting appeal and despite being nearly twice as long as is previous to bond games it was still criticized for being too short and offering little replay value in the end everything or nothing still managed to be a notable success and as Pierce Brosnan's final run at the akan ixia agent unfortunately following Pierce Brosnan's departure from the character the video game series would inevitably head into a downward spiral that would begin only a few months later with everything or nothing succeeding in terms of providing a solid single-player double-oh-seven experience the EA games saw far more potential in the growing multiplayer space halo 2 was set to release soon and cold Duty had begun to make a name for itself on the PC platform to stay ahead of the game ea assigned their Los Angeles studio to begin working on their ace in the hole a direct sequel to Goldeneye the game that would supposedly take everything fans loved about the first game but build upon it with better graphics controls level designs and an entirely new story for the story EA reached out to Danny Bilson and Paul DeMaio the former of whom came up with the idea for an alternate reality where bond is defeated and all of his enemies reign supreme the development team entered into full production using a modified Medal of Honor engine and fully expected to create leave weren't a sequel to the iconic classic with gameplay focused entirely around the first person shooter mechanics this meant no distracting vehicles or old-school Bond gadgets and improvements to the AI align them to intelligently adapt and learn during combat partway through development the team decided to drop the two in the title and add in rogue agent to better describe the nature of the game and by November of 2004 EA released Goldeneye rogue agent a title that would unsurprisingly not deliver on its ambitious promise Goldeneye rogue agent takes place in an alternate reality where James Bond dies during the attack on Fort Knox and various villains like Goldfinger and dr. know are bitter rivals locked in a battle for control players assume the role of an unnamed X mi6 agent who lost his eye dealing with dr. know and is given a new cybernetic eye by a team of scientists working for Goldfinger this eye is the only reason the game is called Goldeneye as the story has absolutely nothing to do with the film or the game of the same name the story sees players traveling to various locations like the Hoover Dam and Hong Kong but it's ultimately an incredibly forgettable narrative with the only notable performances coming from Judi Dench and Christopher Lee who both replies to our kind of characters the gameplay also attempts to innovate quite a bit from the core double-oh-seven game formula with a number of interesting shooter mechanics incorporated to make the action mark citing the first major feature is the new dual wielding system unlike the original goal tonight players can mix and match weapons freely by holding down a button and selecting the hand that they want to use the weapon with this works for all one-handed weapons and finding the right combination of firearms helps to make the dull repetitive level designs more tolerable on top of this Goldeneye rotation also features a new hostage system allowing players to stun enemy AI and use them as human shields but the most important change is the new Goldeneye abilities as players progress through the game players are rewarded with Goldeneye powers including one that can see through walls and another that can deflect bullets combining all these aspects alongside some fairly interesting weapons mix rogue agent tolerable though its lackluster AI awful movement and controls and boring level structures demonstrate just how brushed the overall experience really is the multiplayer on the other hand is a bit of a saving grace for the game while many of the same issues like sloppy controls present themselves here rogue agents multiplayer maps are a lot of fun to fight in just like everything our Nothings arena mode rogue agents maps features special trap buttons that can directly manipulate the environment and kill players not paying attention additionally most of the maps are based on iconic scenes throughout the film franchise including Carver's press from Tomorrow Never Dies the top of the Golden Gate Bridge from a view to a kill and several maps inspired by the space training facility in Moonraker rogue agent was also the first game in the series on consoles to make the jump to online competitive multiplayer though its small community cost the server's to shut down only a short while after launch and that's because rogue agent was received terribly fans and critics alike recognized exactly what EA have attempted to do using the Goldeneye name however based on the developer interview with the lead director behind the game it does seem as though the team firmly believed that they could make an even more entertaining first-person shooter and unique features like the mag rail that could shoot through walls and the entertaining deathmatch hazards certainly demonstrate that potential well but unfortunately it just wasn't enough to compete with Halo soon that also happened to feature an even better dual wielding system then released only a few weeks before rogue agents resulting sales were miserable and as a result EA games finally abandoned the prospect of recapturing the series's multiplayer magic churning back towards the third-person narrative driven concept instead with rogue agent performing miserably EA decided that their best course of action was to retrace their steps and mimic the success of everything or Nothing Redwood Shores was put in charge again Fierstein was asked to write the story and they push for another cinematic third-person shooter with top-of-the-line visuals and professional voice actor performances provided by the actual actors from the film series but with Brosnan finally stepping away from the role for good EA was left in a difficult position and decided that instead of making an original story they would fall back to one of the many classic Bond stories from the past one that was never given the video game treatment before by April a decision had been made an EA reached out to none other than the original Bond himself Sean Connery to reprise his iconic role EA had decided to base her next game around the 1963 film From Russia With Love and would incorporate various other elements from the other 60s Bond films to help expand upon the atmosphere the studio spent a solid year in development reworking rebellions Azura engine to incorporate similar gameplay mechanics used in their past game and in November of 2005 EA released from Russia with LOD for the PlayStation 2 Xbox and GameCube with an additional PSP police a few months later from Russia with lot for the most part follows the plot of the film very closely only with a few liberties taken to make it more exciting for gamers players assume the role of a 60s Bond fully voiced by Connery himself track down a decoding device called the lek door before a mysterious organization referred to as octopus can interfere the story itself was written initially by Ian Fleming and has been reworked by Fierstein to make it more exciting with the incorporation of jetpacks car chases and shootouts sprinkled in on the surface From Russia With Love looks a lot like everything or nothing the game is played in third-person and makes use of a similar auto aim block system for its shooting but in practice the experience feels like a slight step back the lock-on system for example no longer features a manual aim cursor for precision shots and automatically aims at center mass prayers can activate a new focus mode to target specific weak points but this doesn't feel quite the same the melee combat was also reworked and no longer features a wide variety of moves and counters but rather a much more basic quick time event prompt that will appear during a fistfight to initialize a knockout animation the game setting also directly impacts the types of weapons and gadgets available to the player bond is still equipped with this iconic pistol Albia a much older variant but the mp5 spas-12 and desert eagle are replaced with the cronin SMG the plump shotgun and a magnum revolver the repel gun from everything or nothing has been understandably downgraded to fit the time period and is now simply a repel belt that needs to be thrown onto compatible ledges though the game overall doesn't seem to make much use of it with far less vertical environments to traverse the queue spider has also been reworked into the Q copter that functions roughly the same only it can fly instead of crawl and things like the Nanosuit and Aston Martin Vanquish are replaced with a briefcase turret old-school laser watch and the iconic Aston Martin db5 complete with all its usual hidden weapons like dual front mountain machine guns and rocket launcher the game as a whole is decidedly less ambitious than its predecessor though its faithful recreation of iconic scenes from the original film along with plenty of fun Easter eggs from the classic Connery days will be sure to please fans of the series From Russia With Love also sees the franchise's very first third-person competitive deathmatch option and surprisingly it offers a robust set of features first can fight across several different environments from the single-player campaign come huit with lots of player triggered hazards and not only allow players to fight using conventional firearms but also with vehicles and jet packs one of the very few instances of full-scale vehicles in the series is multiplier additionally first Canal purchase upgrades using a post-match store greatly encouraging continued play in an entirely offline split-screen mode sadly EA's final Bond entry didn't fare quite as well as the past few double 7 titles it certainly was a return to form after the dreadful rogue agent but its oversimplification of well-received gameplay mechanics from everything or nothing was questioned by fans and critics alike additionally while it was great to have Connery back in his most iconic role his older voice just doesn't match up with the character at all with a Scottish accent that substantially thicker than ever was back when he was shooting bad guys with harpoons it's still incredible that he lent his voice to the role and I wouldn't have it any other way but it really just feels off in every one of his scenes by the time the smoke is saddled From Russia With Love managed to sell a mere 270,000 copies and with that disappointing return EA decided that it was time to abandon the idea of making licensed games despite having a license to make double-oh-seven games straight through to 2009 they decided to prematurely cut ties with MGM allowing a different publisher to lock in a new deal with EA now finished with the series and Pierce Brosnan finally hanging up his bowtie uncertainty loomed over the future of double 7 video games licensed titles in general were falling out of style with publishers seeing far more potential in original in-house properties but in fall of 2005 Daniel Craig was announced as the newest James Bond and Activision acquired the worldwide rights to create double 7 video games for all current and next-gen consoles marking the start of a new era for the series for their first project activision contracted Treyarch to produce a direct movie tie-in to the upcoming casino royale news of trey arks involvement came in summer of 2006 around the same time the studio was hard at work on Call of Duty 3 but with their resources already being strained by Call of Duty threes eight-month development deadline they were ultimately forced to cancel the planned Casino Royale game as it would have never been released in time to profit off of the movie success after releasing call of duty 3 Treyarch switched from their own engine architecture over to IW 3.0 the same engine Infinity Ward had used to build call of duty 4 and reworked the gameplay mechanics and assets so that they could be incorporated in a new James Bond adventure this time based on Craig's second turn as the British spy Quantum of Solace but rather than just skipping over Casino Royale entirely they decided to combine the two projects with locations and events from both films being represented in one seamless gaming experience to help the new project reach as many platforms as possible activision reached out to several development teams including Vicarious Visions and even eurocom again to piece together various ports finally in fall of 2008 Activision's first Bond game released under the name double 7 Quantum of Solace Quantum of Solace is probably one of the more confusing narratives in the history of double-oh-seven games as it tries to awkwardly stuff two different movies together with its first and third act being based on scenes from Quantum while it's much larger second act revolves around key action sequences from Casino Royale players assume the role of daniel craig's bond whose stoic personality brings a much darker take on the iconic character for those that haven't seen the film's Casino Royale is the first entry starring Craig and C's bond trying to disrupt a man named the Sheep from financing terrorists by beating him at a high-stakes poker match a lot of the biggest action scenes in the film are recreated for the game including the intense parkour chase through the construction site but several sequences are expanded upon to feature more explosive gunfights like the train ride where Bond meets Vesper that according to this game also saw bond blowing up other train cars and ripping off Sam Fisher from Pandora tomorrow as we've seen with past Bond games this isn't too unusual Bond films really don't have that much shooting when compared to your typical first-person shooter video game so of course missions in game are going to be featuring a lot more action though the more serious tone and style of the Daniel Craig era Bond films doesn't seem to lend itself as well to the over-the-top action and Sothis more formulaic than charming like it did in the past as far as the gameplay goes quantum feels almost nothing like the EA bond games it's played primarily in first-person with controls and movement that feel eerily similar to your run-of-the-mill Call of Duty game though to help it stand out it does incorporate a unique third-person cover mechanic similar to the design used in ubisoft's Rainbow Six Vegas players can now snap to cover to avoid incoming fire and can either blind fire or pop out of cover to aim with more precision if players are injured during a fight their health will now regenerate automatically meaning there's no need to worry about a health bar or armor pickups anymore to accommodate this new combat style environments are no longer open-ended and instead feature a very linear paths with plenty of cover to take advantage of between firefights players can make use of some light stealth action mechanics with a basic hacking minigame some security cameras to dodge and a few enemy patrols to deal with but a majority of the gameplay involves all-out firefights using a fairly limited arsenal of weapons firearms include the return of bombs pistol along with easily recognizable guns like the scar-h mp5 UMP and even an m60 though because this game takes place in a more grounded scenario there's no crazy sci-fi weapons or over-the-top gadgets to play around with and the popular vehicle sequences that have helped to define the series over the past decade are nowhere to be seen the game's multiplayer is even more disappointing with a few uninspired map designs and your typical competitive modes that back in 2008 were made redundant considering the overloading success of the Call of Duty series there's a few interesting features here like an asymmetrical one v6 mode the has players controlling a slightly more powerful bond while the rest have to try and wipe them out but it's otherwise a lackluster addition and the missing split-screen mode feels like a huge disservice overall Quantum of Solace was met with a mixed reception it was criticized for its weak visual presentation clunky controls confusing narrative structure and over reliance on quick time events changes made to the core formula were of course to be expected especially considering the more serious tone of the movies but Quantum of Solace fails to capture that more gritty atmosphere and instead delivers a tone-deaf shooting gallery without any substance quantum was a disappointing start to Activision's run with the series and with their next project they would take a move straight out of EA's playbook after quantum activision saw little promise and trying a direct movie adaptation again they looked back at what EA had done in the past and recognized everything or nothing as one of the more successful attempts with the property but Activision also recognized the increased potential of the Call of Duty series and decided not to bog down Treyarch with another double 7 project they instead contracted a small British development studio called Bizarre Creations who had just completed a decently received third-person shooter game for sega called the club using the club's engine bazaar began working on a reimagined third-person Bond experience with more modern cover based shooter controls and elements taken straight from other stealth action games additionally they decided early on to incorporate driving mechanics a feature they felt was necessary to fill the James Bond fantasy after two years of development Activision released double 7 bloodstone for the PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 PC and Nintendo DS bloodstone story is the first original double 7 video game since everything or nothing and follows daniel craig's bond as he investigates a string of clues regarding a missing scientist in Istanbul the story features a few interesting set pieces and exotic locales but it's overly predictable and offers no distinctly memorable villains or supporting characters again just like with Quantum Craigs more serious take on the character provides a more gritty atmosphere and while it works great for the film's it really doesn't translate too well to the field of game with little to nothing to break up the monotony of the non-stop shooting gallery but unlike Quantum at least unlike its main next-gen console release bloodstone is played entirely in third-person with a much greater emphasis on stealth environments are much more open at at this time allowing for a bit more freedom in terms of taking down various cars and the new and improved cell phone gadget allows players to hack cameras remotely and identify the location of guards more easily takedowns can now be performed without the need for a pointless QuickTime button press and now Awards players with a new focus aim point which can be used to instantly aim and fire at an enemy with a lethal shine this focus ability can be chained together to dispatch up to three enemies in quick succession and appears to be a blatant ripoff of Splinter Cell Conviction x' mark and execute system only with a much less slick animation tied to it outside of some basic third-person cover based shooting mechanics bloodstone also sees the return of the series his signature car chases that take full advantage of the studio's experience making racing games like blur the vehicles have a much more believable weight to them as they slide around corners and the linear set pieces offer some exciting cinematic moments unlike anything that the series has managed to accomplish before there's actually a lot of really cool moments throughout this games campaign but the basic stealth action and noticeably weak shooting mechanics detract quite a bit from them multiplier also returns in bloodstone but within the first week or so of release Bloodstones online community only consisted of about 1200 players with the few players that did manage to try it complaining about boring level designs lag terrible hit detection and a removal of the more interesting modes featured in quantum overall bloodstone was only a minor improvement over Trey arks title the inclusion of driving sequences and original story and major film actors were a nice touch but it simply wasn't enough to make up to the poor third-person shooting mechanics and overall lackluster design the game sold miserably and as a result Bizarre Creations was dropped by Activision forcing the development team to close their doors for good and the double-oh-seven series drifted even further into obscurity but bloodstone wasn't the only double-oh-seven project in the works discussions regarding a rerelease of the original gold and I began to surface with both Nintendo and Microsoft looking for ways to bring the original game to their digital marketplaces but with Activision holding exclusive rights to the series they decided to take matters into their own hands and set out to create a brand new Goldeneye experience they initially reached out to free radical that consisted of veteran goldeneye developers but unfortunately nothing ever materialized an Activision turn take eurocom entertainment instead eurocom no strangers to the Bond series combined their game engine used for dead space extraction with assets and animations from iw 3.0 creating a truly next-gen Goldeneye experience and one that would take full advantage of the Nintendo Wii unique motion controls they again reached out to fierce team to write the script who had to make some serious changes to accommodate the more serious tone of Daniel Craig and many aspects of the story had to be reworked to feel more modern in 2010 Activision released Goldeneye double-oh-seven exclusively for the Wii without the S 3 and Xbox 360 port called Goldeneye reloaded a year later the 2010 version of Goldeneye is a complete retelling of the film and game of the same name with many of the same locations characters and concepts being reimagined in a more modern tone everything about this experience feels remarkably different with more expansive environments reimagined characters and a more modern control scheme resulting in a drastically different adventure altogether both versions of the game despite the new lush controls on the we kill remarkably like a Call of Duty game with a lot of the same movement mechanics and combat controls but unlike quantum there's significantly more opportunities for stealth action mixed em with a new radar system to track enemies some advanced first-person takedowns and detection indicators to warn players that they've been spotted whereas can wield a number of conventional firearms including aks mp5s and sniper rifles and can now use our cellphone to photograph secret plans to help give the gaming more spy oriented twists it makes excellent use of the popular Call of Duty gameplay design and reimagines many iconic scenes from the original game to be more grandiose and impressive though it unfortunately falls into the same trap of over relying on QuickTime events for it's more important moments and many of the changes made to the original story feel a bit too extreme and take away a lot of the charm of the original the main villain Alec for example is no longer played by Sean Bean but instead Elliot Koen who has a far less intimidating presence that being said a few key moments from the film are better realized in this version thanks to the advanced animation work that gives it a more cinematic presentation the game's multiplayer does a few things right as it allows for a split screen play and incorporates a wide range of classic characters and goofy gameplay modifiers but with console shooters having evolved significantly since 1997 it simply doesn't hold the same charm that the original had and as a result saw its online player count rapidly decline within weeks of release but regardless golden light from the Wii was met with a glowing positive reception upon release reviewers praised the game for its excellent motion controls and applauded it for its smart rework of the original environments however it's ps3 and 360 counterparts weren't quite as well-received with the motion controls out of the picture many noted the glaring downsides of the game's design calling it out for being a cheap knockoff of a Call of Duty experience activision had now for the third time provided a subpar double-oh-seven experience and decided to give it one more shot before calling it quits with only a year left before the movie series is 50th anniversary Activision decided to cash in on the franchise one last time and had a girl come take their well received at Goldeneye remake and apply the same concepts and mechanics to remix of other classic double-oh-seven films the plant moving into this project was to create a series of mini remakes to commemorate each era of the bond cinematic collection meaning one film from each actor this betrayed the master spy but rather than waste time acquiring the licensing agreements and modeling a separate bond for each mission they decide to simply incorporate Daniel Craig into each story instead and after less than a year of development yurikano leased their final video game double 7 legends the official end of the series is nearly 30 year long run double 7 legends is a collection of short stories based on classic double 7 adventures the game kicks off with a retelling of Goldfinger that sees daniel craig's bond attempt to thwart a plan to alleviate the gold at fort knox the second series of missions is based on the only film to feature George Lazenby on Her Majesty's Secret Service in the story bond participates in an assault on bull Feld's mountaintop lair in an attempt to stop him from releasing a bio weapon tied to several brainwash women the third set of missions tackles the much darker story in license to kill where bond seeks to avenge his murdered friend Felix by tracking down a Mexican drug lord to his secret lair built underneath an ancient temple the fourth story covers the only Pierce Brosnan film to never see a direct video game adaptation died another day and follows bonds investigation into Gustav graves at his remarkable ice palace in Iceland and to the game's fifth and final mission is based on Roger Moore's Moonraker that famously has bond travel into space to face off against Hugo Drax in a zero gravity showdown the game spot is predictably a disjointed mess built around the idea that bond is recalling all these events in a coma after being shot off a speeding train in the film Skyfall but unfortunately the actual final mission based on Skyfall is no longer available to play as it was only made available for free as a temporary digital download before being ultimately pulled from digital stores leaving the game at least the ps3 and xbox 360 versions without a true ending though four players still interested the mission is included directly on the disc for the Wii U port of the game in terms of gameplay double 7 legends once again piggy backs heavily off the well-received shooter design associated with the Call of Duty series the game is played entirely in first person with a decently large arsenal of weapons to equip and each mission involves a combination of stealth action and all-out warfare though surprisingly this works really well double 7 legends is often recognized as one of the worst titles in the series but there's some genuinely smart design choices incorporated into the gameplay the stealth action mechanics for example are more fleshed out than they were in the Goldeneye remake with a more clear detection system and several new hacking minigames and mechanics to help make the player feel like bon-bons cellphone still serves as the primary gadget throughout the game but it can now swap between three different modes including a fingerprint scanner backing app and a camera to acquire evidence bond is even equipped with a pen that can fire specialized darts and a new version of his wristwatch that can be used to ping nearby enemies on radar and can fire a laser on top all this Legends also features a new upgrade system accessible at special weapon crates throughout each level weapons can now be customized with new attachments to improve their capabilities and gadgets can also be improved to be more effective even the iconic vehicle sequences make a return though there are even more scripted than they were in bloodstone and then there's the new first-person melee combat system that allows players to target different sides of the head and body this was incorporated to make encounters with classic villains more meaningful though after a few fights it does become apparent that the system is just a predictable set of QuickTime events and its constant use really takes away a lot from the game's pacing and finally there's the competitive multiplayer that's about as generic as you could imagine with a basic player progression system weapon unlocks and player buffs all inspired by Call of Duty's design while it was a nice touch to incorporate classic movie environments and bonds gadgets the online community was pretty much dead on arrival double 7 legends as a whole is a fairly generic and disappointing final entry to the series the few interesting stealth action elements do little to distract from the blatantly obvious Call of Duty gunplay mechanics and both fans and critics alike took notice the Kolbe Duty series was already beginning to feel stale too many and having yet another double sevens spin-off using the same endless AI reinforcements and basic level designs but proved to be the final straw the game received abysmal reviews some of the very worst in the series is history with many accusing the game of being a cheap cash in cod clone with hastily designed missions and little replay value others complained about the mission choices claiming the film's chosen were some of the worst in the cinematic collection while some fans found to be tellings to be disingenuous and faulted Ericom for replacing the holly berry character jinx with a more generic unrecognizable model instead with double 7 legends of Bismil review scores and miserable sales numbers Nirupam was forced to shut down for good and Activision lost their exclusive licensing deal to the double-oh-seven property forcing the studio to pull all of their release double-oh-seven games from digital storefronts in early 2013 effectively ending the franchise's 30-year run the double 7 video game franchise has had a monumental impact on the first person shooter seen rares 97 masterpiece is often cited as one of the most important console shooters of all time it could be tied directly to the creation of Medal of Honor and subsequently call of duty as a result but as the series matured under the EA banner it became more evident that the double-oh-seven name wasn't what made goldeneyes such a classic but rather the brilliantly designed gameplay and mechanics build a nice smooth first-person gamepad controls combined with the open-ended mission structure and enjoyable split-screen multiplayer were unprecedented back in the day and the series never managed to recapture that spirit even with its strongest entries additional concepts like intense scripted car chases and improved stealth mechanics were certainly a nice touch but the series suffered stiff competition from the likes of Halo and Call of Duty that it simply could never get in fun of by the time activision had finally acquired the license there was little that could be done the double-oh-seven series while increasingly more popular in movie form no longer influenced the sales of its respective video games as gamers became more interested in original experiences instead something that along with the cheap cash grab entries inevitably killed the game franchise but over the course of the past eight years there has been glimmers of hope regarding the future of the series some fans for example have recreated the classic multiplayer experience from Goldeneye using the source engine additionally a few years back information regarding a cancelled double 7 Goldeneye remaster leaked online which would have featured higher res models and textures all while retaining the original gameplay that Vance fell in love with this was of course canceled as Activision held exclusive rights to the license at the time but it inspired another fan remake of the game that is currently shaping up to be an even more faithful adaptation of the classic shooter the project titled Goldeneye 25 is currently in development by a couple of developers using the Unreal Engine and is set to release exclusively for the PC to commemorate the game's 25th anniversary from the footage that the team has shared so far the project aims to merge the original style of gunplay and mechanics with a significantly improved visual style with advanced lighting texture quality and more dense environmental decoration the project started development as early as 2017 and is slated for a summer 2022 release and so if you're interested in following their development process the team has been fairly open about their work on their social media accounts which I'll provide links for below and while this is great news for fans of that particular game the big question still remains what's next for the James Bond double 7 video game series we're at a strange point right now where Daniel Craig is set to officially retire from the role after no time to dive releases and Aon has yet to announce an actor to take his place once a new actor is chosen a video game publisher could possibly show interest in the series again and attempt another reboot so if that does end up happening what style game do you think should be made should it be a first-person shooter game like Goldeneye or nightfire or should they attempt another third-person experience like everything or nothing as we've seen in the past both styles of gameplay have the potential to deliver an engaging double-oh-seven experience so long as they adopt aspects that take advantage of what makes James Bond so unique incorporating high-tech gadgets and fast cars are key and tying that in with more social stealth aspects and environmental interactivity can provide a gaming experience unlike any other imagine for a moment a game built around the concepts introduced in the old text-based adventures and Delphine's operation stealth where players can more directly interact with the mission investigating clues and interrogating key witnesses coupling this with smooth shooter mechanics either first or third person along with the robust selection of gadgets and vehicles could result in something really special without trying to bank on a film releases success despite what ei thought when they dropped the bond license licensed games still have a place in the industry Rocksteady's arkham batman games and avalanches Mad Max provide more than enough evidence of that but the reason those games are so enjoyable is that they provide something entirely different from their respective films Rock Steady's Batman games for example aren't overly dark and grounded like the Nolan films they've released around resulting in a more fun and creative gameplay experience take several aspects from the property a double a 7-game could adopt a similar approach with more open-ended environments to explore freely maybe on an island like in dr. know along with NPCs to talk to or interrogate and a wide range of different approaches to objectives to let players feel like they're really James Bond this could be enhanced further with an on-site hit and q lat kind of like the Batcave allowing players to unlock new weapons gadgets and vehicle upgrades and the game's combat could offer plenty of opportunities for epic bond moments to help complete the fantasy the multiplayer of course is an even more challenging prospect as we've seen countless iterations of online death matches over the past couple decades though really leaning into bonds unique gadget build arsenal his vehicles and the trap filled environments could perhaps be what helps it stand apart but regardless of what comes next there's no denying the impact this long-running game series has had it has spanned generations with its catchy theme song varied gameplay designs and addicting multiplayer modes and as a result everyone seems to have their own favorite from Goldeneye to EAS original stories straight through to Activision smart called duty s titles and so whoever takes over the series will have a real challenge on their hands to not only appeal to old-school fans but to also make something interesting and unique enough to stand on its own but what do you guys think which game in the double-oh-seven series was your favorite and how do you feel future games on the property should be approached let me know in the comments section now I want to
