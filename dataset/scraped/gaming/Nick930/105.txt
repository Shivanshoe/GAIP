welcome back everyone I'm Nick 930 and this is my found review for Capcom's recently released Resident Evil three much like the Resident Evil 2 remake that released early last year resident evil 3 is a complete reimagining of the original 1999 classic of the same name with vastly improved graphics completely redesigned level structures and an entirely new control scheme and while many of the elements of this remake feel reminiscent of the original resident evil 3 remake is a completely different experience with some classic areas being removed entirely while other areas have been expanded there's a ton of changes that have been made most of which have been covered already in my comparison videos so for today's video I'm gonna try and treat this as its own standalone experience and give you a good idea of what you can expect if you decide to pick this up so to start off let's talk about the narrative Resident Evil 3 takes place in the fictional Raccoon City prior to the events of last year's Resident Evil 2 players assume the role of Resident Evil veteran Jill Valentine who has just recently been suspended from her job at the our PD after pushing for a more in-depth investigation of umbrella cores shady business dealings the game starts off pretty quietly with players able to explore Jill's studio apartment and first-person but the seemingly slow intro has turned on his head almost instantly as a massive creature bashes through the ball and forces the player through some cinematic escape sequences revealing soon after that the entire city has been overwhelmed by zombies it's an unexpectedly fast reveal for the lead antagonist though the game's sudden start does share a similar feel to the way the original game dropped player straight into the action after about 10 or 15 minutes of scripted linear set pieces the game does begin to open up a bit more resembling your typical Resident Evil experience with the story only being delivered through abandoned diaries and the occasional cinematic after completing objectives but unlike with past games re3 spacing feels a bit too erratic after a great first act the game seems almost as if it skips a beat with one intense encounter with the nemesis leading to another without a proper buildup the game does swap over to Carlos another playable character allowing players to explore the inside of the police station again but by doing this the inventory is separated and any gear uncovered is useless when the game inevitably which is back to Jill for an almost immediate follow-up boss fight with the nemesis the game doesn't necessarily leave you unarmed and provides you plenty of ammunition to prepare for this but it feels a little bit unearned to go from such a climatic battle at the end of Act one into another battle almost right after but with those pacing issues aside I'm still pretty satisfied with the narrative Jill Valentine is a solid lead protagonist there's a few moments where it feels like they're trying a bit too hard to show how strong and independent and it does feel like the game is constantly taking control away so that Joe can talk on a walkie-talkie but as far as a story of an epic struggle against this ferocious monster goes it's plenty interesting and has a nice payoff now of course the original AR III has a lot more depth and complexity to its story with more environments to explore and build the atmosphere up and more spaced out encounters with nemesis to help him feel more special but the added depth to each individual character thanks to their fantastic motion capture cinematics really helps to build on their personalities more and the big Easter eggs sprinkled throughout are definitely a nice touch next let's talk about the design of the game play Resident Evil 3 is at its core a third-person survival shooter game first we'll spend most of the time searching the environment for key items and supplies while also dealing with deadly enemies the mechanics are built strongly around the design used in last year's game with slow overall movement speed and limited ammunition that needs to be used on fairly Brazilian zombies and just like the original AR III this remake adds a few more gameplay mechanics that provide a much faster paced action-oriented tone the biggest addition of course is the Nemesis who will appear as scripted events and Percy the player until they manage to reach a checkpoint the Nemesis can not be killed though he can be easily stunned by shooting his weak spots on his chest additionally a well-placed grenade can drop him instantly even on the hardest difficulty which is highly advised as he drops valuable loot at certain points throughout the first act but this isn't always the easiest task as Nemesis has quite a few powerful abilities like a tentacle to grab in trip players or a terrifying - that almost always catches me off guard what's disappointing about this enemy is that everything he does is predetermined on repeat playthroughs you'll find that he'll do the exact same thing every time he'll always match through a certain wall or fly in from the sky at select points in the city so there's no sneaking around him or avoiding the chases to begin with now these scripted moments are fine and often necessary for the sake of the game's narrative but it would have also been nice to see nemesis incorporated as a more dynamic enemy adding a little bit more randomness to his appearances but of course nemesis is only one part of the equation our a3 is also populated with tons of zombies that while not flooding the screen like Dead Rising or other zombie games we're still far more threatening a single zombie can drop a player's health down to almost nothing if they're not careful and unlike Resident Evil 2 remake there's no way to counter a grapple using knives or grenades so you're guaranteed to take damage each time they successfully grab you to counter this re 3 adds in a new dodge roll mechanic that can be easily initiated with a spacebar or right bumper depending on your input device the dodge roll makes the game insanely easy and can be used for practically every enemy in the game if time properly the player will avoid all incoming damage around them even explosives and can even initiate a slow-motion auto aim to target the attacking enemy this also works on nemesis with players capable of chaining multiple dodges together to avoid all this incoming attacks the move is based on a similar dodge mechanic added into the classic 99 game but feels even easier to perform here and makes scenarios that should be extremely challenging a breeze to pass through our e3 also introduces new environmental traps to take advantage of including electric generators that can stun large groups of enemies or classic red barrels that can be used to blow up several zombies at once again just like the dodge roll these props make the game a little bit too easy the barrels seem to be placed all over the place and leading a group of zombies towards them helps to save a lot of ammunition considering both the nightmare and inferno difficulty modes relocate enemies and items and more challenging configurations it would have been nice to see these environmental traps also relocated or even removed entirely to add to that challenge and then we had the design of the game's levels re3 despite taking place in a sprawling metropolis feels strangely small and linear the initial act has you exploring streets and alleys filled with storefronts and zombie which at first glance look great but after collecting a few key items it becomes abundantly clear so restricted the play zone really is there's only two main streets accessible here with stores that zombies can't even seem to chase him inside off all the items and safe rooms are still placed in smart locations and provide a nice flow to the gameplay as you weave back and forth and deal with increasingly more challenging configurations but it feels like a missed opportunity to not make this area significantly larger with more puzzles and enemy variety our e3 remake sees the return of almost every enemy from the original game but outside of the zombies and the Nemesis many of the unique enemy types like dogs and these bugs are now limited to very specific areas again having a larger area to explore would have allowed the developers to implement these enemies in more areas throughout the game which would have greatly improved the pacing and replay value of the experience now all these criticisms aside our e3 is still a lot of fun to play searching around these beautifully detailed environments for supplies and carefully planning your next move at safe rooms as you manage a tiny inventory space is at the core of what the Resident Evil series is all about and our e3 delivers what you'd expect in this regard and because of its surprisingly short length I found myself replaying this game more than any other entry in the series thanks mostly in part to the new unlockable store options that become available after completing the story for the first time there's a ton of gameplay buffs that could be applied here or with XP earned throughout your playthroughs including additional inventory space early access to key items and even damage buffs that can be stacked to nearly one shot headshot every zombie all these buffs can be used together without penalties allowing players to continue to achieve faster completion times and achievements trying to find the best combination of these buffs to handle crazy challenging difficulties like Inferno mode makes the game even more enjoyable so to summarize our e3 score game is short easy and suffers from some major pacing issues but it becomes more and more enjoyable with each repeat playthrough as the many quirks and tricks you learn along the way make it more endearing but of course the resident evil 3 remake isn't the only thing you're getting when you buy the game to compensate for the short play time players are also given access to a new competitive multiplayer game called resident evil resistance an asymmetrical experience that has a group of four survivors trying to reach a goal while an opposing mastermind player spawns in traps and obstacles now on paper this mode sounds like it could be really interesting the mastermind is essentially given the role of a game designer dropping in specific traps and enemies around corners to make it as challenging as possible for the players the mastermind has access to a handful of different classes each with their own powerful abilities to become familiar with the mastermind can view the game environment through set camera networks and can spawn in enemies using earned credits their goal is to either kill all four survivors or prevent them from reaching the goal within the time limit meanwhile the survivors also operate on a class-based system with each character having their own special abilities strengths and weaknesses Becca for example is proficient with firearms and can activate a temporary infinite ammo ability to deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time other characters like Tyrone and Sam are more melee centric and can deal more damage using blunt weapons like baseball bats the concept isn't necessarily unique as many games like evolve Friday the 13th and dead by daylight previously attempted a similar style of gameplay though Resident Evil resistance offers a much more claustrophobic feel with lots of narrow environments and focused action sadly it does feel like this game out is already dead on arrival I very rarely was able to find an active session online without having to wait upwards of 5 to 10 minutes and when I eventually did find a session I found that players that we're losing would often rage quit halfway through and closed the entire session down on top of that from the little I was able to play it does feel as though there's some slight bouncing issues here along with a needlessly long grind to unlock upgrades for characters to continued play now if you have a group of friends that are all big Resident Evil fans then it's a mode that will undoubtedly be fun to play together now and again but if you're looking to join in solo especially on the PC platform you'll probably leave disappointed finally let's talk about the presentation just like Resident Evil 2 before it resin evil 3 and it's spin-off multiplayer modes look great character models are beautifully detailed and have great motion capture performances and the game's environments look gorgeous issues I had with the previous game like the excessive bloom and really poor screen spaceman flexions are technically still present here but they're not quite as noticeable however our III does seem to be downgraded slightly from its predecessor with much less impressive physics especially concerning enemy ragdolls and some major tech streaming issues in the multiplayer mode in terms of performance and stability Resident Evil 3 runs beautifully with little if any technical hiccups I never once found myself getting stuck in the game world or witnessing any major bugs outside of maybe a zombie body clipping through a door now and again it feels like an extremely polished experience and any deaths throughout could always be attributed to my own mistakes rather than a fault of the game's design overall resin evil 3 is a decent but flawed experience the game looks in place beautifully the story is interesting and replaying the game has been a lot of fun but it's hard to ignore all the missed potential with this new entry it doesn't necessarily build off the 2019 s resin evil - the rather seems to be taking advantage of a success nemesis is quite literally a risk and mr. X with identical animations and core design elements and giving him some scripted rocket launchers and flamethrowers boy doesn't make him any more scary but these negative points aside where isn't evil 3 is still a lot of fun to play I'm already on my fifth play through once again experimenting with the bonus unlockable buffs and looking for more efficient ways to shave off time but for players looking for something with a little bit more substance you're better off checking out last year's game instead and the game's multiplayer mode certainly doesn't make up for its shorter life as it already is suffering from a low player account in a mode that gives a little rough around the edges again there's the workings of a fun online experience here and it most definitely will be fun to play with a group of friends but if Capcom wants to keep this experience going they're going to need to consider making it free-to-play and ensure that any premium content is restricted to cosmetics only but what do you guys think are you liking Resident Evil 3 or its online multiplayer component let me know in the comments section and don't forget to Like and subscribe for more videos posted every week [Music] [Music]
