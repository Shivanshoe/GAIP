welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at two of the most popular grand theft auto games of all time the most recent entry grand theft auto 5 and the fan favorite gta san andreas and see how they compare in regards to their visuals their gameplay and their available features now when comparing these two games directly we're obviously going to observe visual improvements across the board with everything from asset complexity lighting design and environments to the effects and animation quality there's nearly a decade separating these two games after all so while i'll still be pointing out these changes briefly for the sake of consistency i want to spend a bit more time covering the various gameplay differences including how the open world functions what features and activities are available to participate in and whether or not gta 5 both online and offline has managed to live up to the fan favorite classic as always both games are being played on the pc platform with the settings pushed up as high as reasonably possible at a native 4k resolution and any motion bar options will be disabled to ensure cleaner image captures also if you haven't already heard i am currently working on a big documentary that covers the entirety of the grand theft auto game series in the coming weeks so be sure to subscribe to the channel and set up your alerts for that video among other gta related projects in the near future so to kick this comparison off let's start by talking about the visual presentation now as you can probably already guess the old versions of the renderware engine used to create the worlds of the 3d era gta games stand no real chance against rockstar's advanced game engine better known as simply rage the rage engine introduced a ton of incredible visual aspects to the gta series including extreme jaw distances various post-processing effects far more impressive lighting and shadow rendering and along with it the incorporation of various middleware components like euphoria and bullet that allow for some really impressive animation and physics effects it looks amazing even eight years later thanks to the increased capability of today's hardware and of course it greatly outpaces the visual design of san andreas in every way but just for fun let's take a close look at some of these aspects starting with the character models the character models are probably the area where san andreas the worst over the years it's something that i've noticed throughout all these gta games as i've been replaying them the past couple weeks the environments more or less hold up and in the right light can still look pretty impressive but then you get a close-up of the characters moving and talking and the illusion really starts to tear itself apart san andreas back when it released was a big deal coming from its predecessor vice city as the campaign offered a more cohesive story with tons of fully scripted sequences and animated cutscenes to help add a more cinematic angle to the experience character animations were suddenly more expressive and facial expressions were becoming more apparent adding actual emotion to the scenes fast forward to gta 5 and the evolution is plain to see cutscene animations are now incredibly fluid with an insanely wide range of emotions being more effectively represented on screen and of course the character models themselves are substantially more detailed with more polygons higher fidelity textures and even appendages like fingers being rendered independently from each other it's pretty wild to see just how far these character miles have come over the years and as we've seen with rockstar's latest work they're still making huge improvements to this day then of course we have the environments this is probably one of the most intriguing aspects of this comparison to me as both games happen to feature the same stylized interpretations of famous los angeles landmarks things like hollywood boulevard santa monica the watts towers the la river and even the various mountain ranges northeast of the city are all locations recreated in these two games but as you can clearly see the gta v versions come a little bit closer to matching their real-life counterparts in fact i visited los angeles a few years back for the first time and was surprised by just how much gta 5 got right about the general look and feel of the city sure it's not nearly as big as the real thing but the layout is pretty faithful the san andreas versions of these locations however are even more scaled down they're still easily recognizable but they feel more like nods to these landmarks as opposed to one-to-one recreations now all that being said san andreas does have a big advantage when it comes to the scope of its environments unlike gta 5 san andreas features not one but three major u.s cities all within the same playable space the game does start off in los santos but after the first couple of acts players can then visit a decently large interpretation of the san francisco bay area complete with its crazy steep roads the piers and even the golden gate bridge later on players can then explore a recreation of las vegas or los venturas as it's known in game and can even gamble at casinos and pull off a big casino heist between all this there's a large amount of forest areas farmlands and desert regions to explore only further adding to the impressive level variety and while it's technically not as large as the gta 5 landmass it's smart use of the playable space helps give san andreas an undeniably larger feel now like with the character models the visual quality of the environmental assets that make up these worlds are obviously superior in gta 5. geometry is more complex making hillsides and mountains appear more natural surfaces utilize significantly higher fidelity texture maps and the inclusion of more dynamic props and details only further enhance the realism of every inch of the environment another big reason for this obvious discrepancy and quality is of course the lighting and shadow effects lighting in san andreas has a very disconnected and unnatural feel to it there doesn't appear to be any direct lighting on the world itself but rather baked effects that will gradually change with the time of day this is even more evident with the interior cut scenes where character models feel superimposed onto pre-lit backdrops and feel incredibly out of place that being said i do greatly appreciate the effort that went into the game's sky boxes and ambient lighting effects with the draw distance cranked up san andreas does a really good job of wiring the background details with different color tones to help add some nice depth to the image and sometimes it can look gorgeous with its stylized color tone especially out in the desert where the sky will often turn purple it's not necessarily the most realistic looking lighting but it has a unique style to it that fits well with the game's feel gta 5 on the other hand aims for much more realism with its lighting design the game world is now properly lit with global illumination and with the help of volumetric lighting enhanced screen space reflections and a slightly cooler color tone the world of los santos feels more real than ever the shadows enhance this even further with practically every single prop in the world casting an appropriate soft shadow based on their distance from the ground whereas you'll find in san andreas that there's practically no shadows at all and then finally there's the effects like explosions fire water and the physics these two are predictably more impressive in gta 5 with more complex fire effects that will propagate and even follow oil trails when ignited explosions will utilize more intricate alpha effects and are combined with some image blur and screen shake to help sell the illusion more convincingly meanwhile the water which is really not featured all that prominently in san andreas is now vastly improved upon with full wave simulation out in the ocean and even a surprisingly complex network of coral reefs under the surface that put to shame the scarcity floor of san andreas but the physics are the real game changer and probably one of the most critical visual components that separates these two titles things like the damage models in san andreas are all just layered scripts that will trigger based on certain conditions but gta 5's damage model rendering is more dynamic with pieces that will realistically break away and crush in different ways each time thanks to euphoria character models will also stumble around dynamically when they trip or fall it's certainly not perfect and as we'll see in a later video gta 4's physics effects are arguably much better but it's still miles ahead of what san andreas is capable of with everything feeling static and stiff by comparison but this is all to be expected it's pretty obvious grand theft auto 5 is visually superior as there's been over a decade of graphical evolution since san andreas released and while it's fun to see how things have evolved since then the real reason i wanted to compare these games is to take a look at the available gameplay features now when i created a poll a few weeks back excluding gta 5 it became clear that san andreas was the most popular entry prior and i think a big part of that is because san andreas was just so insanely ambitious in what it offered back in 2004 i mentioned how there's actually three cities instead of just one which is pretty crazy on its own but the amount of open world activities and features that rockstar crammed into this game is mind-boggling to the point where i found myself typing up multiple pages of notes just to keep track of it all and because i plan on covering all this in more detail with my documentary i just want to highlight some of the most critical changes that i discovered so let's start off easy by covering the basics of the campaign and the mission design gta san andreas follows the story of carl johnson as he rises to the ranks of the criminal underworld and pursues answers to a big conspiracy in los santos along with its neighboring cities to maintain the pacing of the story san andreas open world is restricted early on preventing players from traveling to los venturas or san fierro by means of roadblocks and automatic wanted levels which are later removed after reaching critical points in the narrative gta 5 however is a bit more creative in its approach to its pacing it follows the story of three completely different protagonists franklin michael and trevor as they set up and execute major heists around los santos and the northern blaine county and while the game does restrict the availability of these characters early on there's nothing about the map itself that's really out of bounds the missions are also much more cinematic in gta 5 with a ton of scripted moments making things like car chases and combat more exciting this heavily action-oriented scripted style was technically part of san andreas as well but not to this extent one small change that helps deliver this experience so effectively is the way the camera behaves in gta 5 zooming in smoothly on key focal points without interrupting the action even activating these missions feels smoother with the fade to black being replaced with a smooth scene transition once a player passes over a mission start area another key difference in the mission design is the freedom of choice given to the players san andreas is a very restricted experience you can only complete missions one way with the only exception being the few times where you can utilize some stealth to take out patrols gta 5 on the other hand greatly emphasizes player choice with players able to swap freely between characters at will and even decide on specific mission parameters like the crew members and overall approach this usually only applies to the major heist missions but you get a sense of player choice in every facet of the game with even seemingly meaningless interactions with npcs having interesting outcomes depending on the decision that the player makes but arguably one of the most popular aspects of any grand theft auto experience is the quality of its unstructured sandbox gameplay something that both games handle very differently one of the reasons that san andreas still remains a fan favorite to this day is that its world feels so remarkably deep and involved there's so many different types of stores to visit and activities to participate in from barber shops clothing stores and restaurants to gun stores tattoo parlors and even digital horse bedding and while some of these features return like vehicle customization and more intricate ammunition stores other interior locations like restaurants surprisingly didn't make the cut restaurants like burger shot and clucking bell were used previously to restore the players health but are now only featured as decorative structures in the world with no way to interact with them players instead need to get their health by other means like vending machines or first aid kits or they can alternatively visit liquor stores to buy snacks and heal up on the go another feature that is frequently brought up when talking about san andreas is the way player stats are handled in gta 5 player stats are increased through normal gameplay by performing basic actions like running shooting or driving making the character progressively more effective at these actions as they get further in the story san andreas however takes things a bit further and actually introduces a system to maintain cj's strength and weight eating too much fast food will make the player fat and thus impact their ability to run while working out at the gym will increase their strength and alternatively reduce their body fat other features exclusive to san andreas include dancing mini games burglary missions graffiti tagging basketball billiards and gang related activity including survival mode based territory control while exploring the los santos area gta 5 however offers its own set of unique activities including a full golf and tennis mini game hiking hunting submarine exploration base jumping impromptu store robberies visiting the movie theater trading stocks and even browsing a fictional version of the internet it's remarkable really how many features have been incorporated into both of these games and gta 5 in particular continues to add even more content at least to its online mode as well including lots of missing features like hydraulics for cars dance clubs and casinos it's just a shame that these features aren't similarly being incorporated into the single player without the use of mods moving on let's talk more about the core gameplay mechanics like the combat and the driving this is where i think gta 5 really gets a chance to shine as fun as the grand theft auto games are playing through them all recently has highlighted just how long it's taken rockstar to really nail the feel of the combat combat in the original 3d gta games is incredibly awkward with either a lock-on system that focuses on center mass or a free aim system that is inconsistent and hard to control even worse is the way drive-by shooting is handled that requires players to look either hard left or hard right and fire perpendicular to the car relying on a slight auto aim to take enemies down gta 4 was the first game in the series to incorporate cover based shooting mechanics along with an option to freely aim weapons while driving but gta 5 improved on these systems even further making the cover shooting feel smoother and more reliable while also increasing weapon accuracy and adding in the ability to shoot from the hip without zooming the camera in san andreas doesn't have any form of cover system and relies on players running in and out from behind walls either auto locking onto enemies or manually aiming but trying to run backwards while in combat will awkwardly have the player shooting up into the air which can be extremely annoying when dealing with a more difficult combat encounter the driving has similarly been overhauled a great deal since the san andreas days back when the games were still running on render ware the vehicles in gta felt extremely light and easy to whip around corners at high speeds they weren't necessarily realistic at all more often than not hitting a corner at high speeds would cause it to flip and explode shortly after but gta5 has since improved the vehicle handling adding more weight to the cars and and making them easier to control while airborne churning at high speeds can be slightly more difficult requiring players to adjust their speed more carefully and vehicle damage can even impact the way that the vehicle behaves with severe damage causing the vehicle to pull in directions or slow down it's not necessarily as realistic as the vehicle handling in grand theft auto 4 which again i'll discuss in more detail later on but it's still vastly superior to the vehicle handling featured in san andreas now there's a ton more we can talk about here like the difference in the police response the interaction of the ai and the many different ways to earn money in game but i think i'll save that for when i covered the entire series in a little bit for now let's wrap up this video with a brief sound comparison like with the visuals we should expect the sound quality to be an improvement across the board for gta 5. but still what do you guys think which game do you think has the superior audio quality and design what a great buddy friend hey man hi there greetings [Music] ah original baller gang yeah [Music] sweet jesus [Music] amen [Music] yes uh [Music] [Applause] um [Applause] [Music] uh and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall gta 5 is expectedly a far superior game when it comes to its visual presentation its character and vehicle models are more detailed the environment is more impressive looking and the effects still hold up remarkably well against even some of the newest games today however san andreas still offers a surprisingly deep and immersive open world gameplay experience that many feel rivals that of gta 5. there's an insane amount of things to do throughout its wide-reaching world and it's fascinating to see what features that the developers decided to keep over the years and which ones they felt the game would be better off without but what do you guys think if they were to add more features from san andreas to gta 5 what would you like to see brought back or do you prefer gta 5 just the way it is let me know in the comments section and don't forget to like and subscribe for more videos like this posted every week
