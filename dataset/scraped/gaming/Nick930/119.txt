welcome back everybody I'm Nick 930 and a few weeks back Ubisoft invited me out for a special event in San Francisco to demo what they cryptically revealed to me as the future of division 2 now going into this I expected to just play some of the new Coney Island episode 3 content but instead Ubisoft revealed a major new expansion for the game called warlords of New York that not only kick-starts division 2 season 2 content but also brings the fight back to the roads of Manhattan and today I'm excited to finally share with you what exactly I played and what you can expect when it releases on March 3rd so first off let's talk briefly about the general premise behind this expansion in case you haven't already seen Ubisoft official trailer for it warlords of New York is focused around hunting down the rogue agent from the first game Arin keener who is now armed with a new strain of the devastating green poison and is hiding in the ruins of lower Manhattan but Keener's not working alone as he's rallied for other rogue agents to his cause each with their own unique backstory and personality your job as a division agent is to travel back to Manhattan defeat Keener and as other rogue agents and stop the release of the new biological threat according to Ubisoft you could expect five main missions to play through each with what they described as epic boss battles that highlight that rogue agents unique skill ability in the demo that I played we had to face off against a tech-savvy rogue agent that loved to use things like automated turrets and drones along with new hologram devices like alibis Prisma gadget from Rainbow six siege what's cool about this is that after you defeat each of these four rogue agents you can steal their skill to use yourself new skills include the Holograms shock mines and the return of the sticky bomb launcher from the original division which has been tweaked to fire faster and can even be modified with different ammunition types like incendiary shells outside of the main missions players can also participate in eight side missions capture eight control points and hunt for collectables across the lower east side of New York City and just to be clear you will not be revisiting any of the areas from the first game the map in warlords of New York is completely brand new according to one of the lead gameplay designers at massive the entire play space was built from the ground up with new locations like Wall Street Chinatown and a partially destroyed Manhattan Bridge to explore the city looks quite a bit different from the last time we visited it with overgrown foliage and Brewin structures contrasting heavily with the snowy streets from before to give you a rough idea of just how big this map is there's four new safe houses along with a new base of operations called Haven it's definitely not as big as Washington DC or even the original games play area but it's easily the most ambitious expansion in the series today and of course along with the familiar terrain are some familiar faces including factions like the Rikers and the cleaners but the which have seen some pretty big changes war wards of New York will also add a ton of content to the endgame for players to enjoy first off the level cap will finally be increased from its current max level of 30 up to 40 on top of that players can now continuously level up a new form of progression called the SH G level giving dedicated players a way to track their experience more effectively there will also be a new difficulty mode called legendary for players that are looking for an even more suicidal challenge and just like every other game nowadays division 2 will be getting a new battle path system called seasons double stretch out for about three months and introduced a whole new calendar of activities leagues and global events along with opportunities to unlock unique skill mods and gear if you never had a chance to jump into division 2 when it came out last year all this can seem pretty overwhelming especially considering the progression prerequisites to access certain content but according to the developer sent massive this is very much a key focus moving into season 2 their goal is to not just expand on the content already available but make it easier to understand for newcomers the stat system for example will be getting a complete overhaul with a removal of the stat budget system new god rolls more valuable loot drops and a more useful stat recalibration system the dark zone will also be getting an overhaul the developers brought up multiple times that they felt division twos dark zone failed to capture the magic of the dark zone in the first game and I can definitely relate to that myself I rarely found myself hunting rogue players are trying to defend myself while extracting Lu in fact what I booted up the game just this past week I regularly ran into players just minding their own business and I never felt like I was under threat of being attacked by anybody season two's dark zone will likely not be so easygoing Luke will return to being mostly contaminated gear requiring you to execute a loot extraction and they hinted that players will have even more incentive to go broke than ever unfortunately it doesn't look like the new Manhattan play area will be getting a dark zone so you're still going to have to fight it out in the three DZ areas in Washington DC but the suggested reworks should make it far more interesting and finally we need to talk about the elephant in the room the pricing while Division T's postgame content for season 1 was all free with an optional season pass to get 7 date early access along with some other goodies season 2 won't be quite as forgiving division twos warlords of New York will cost $30 for existing players for players who haven't picked up division 2 yet Ubisoft will be offering two different bundle options a $40 standard edition that comes with both division 2 and World Ward's of New York or the $60 Ultimate Edition that comes with division 2 all the year 1 content the new warlords of New York the classified assignment missions and some other great starting gear like three instant specializations if you're a new player that picks up either the standard or Ultimate Edition you'll also be given an instant level 30 character to use so that you're not stuck leveling up and can join your friends right away so the real question now is will this expansion be worth it is this the reason to reinstall division 2 or even pick it up for the first time if you missed out last year from what I was shown and what I played it certainly seems to be ambitious the new Manhattan map is huge and looks interesting enough to explore and the content seems to be more engaging than any of the other season 1 content I'm also looking forward to the rework of the dark zone as I was pretty disappointed with how it turned out last time but what do you guys think is warlords of New York a big enough reason to return to the division 2 or were you expecting something more from the next season let me know in the comments section and if you have
