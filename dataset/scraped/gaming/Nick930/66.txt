welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the recently released need for speed hot pursuit remaster and see how it compares to the original version of the game released almost exactly a decade ago for this comparison both the remaster and the original game will be played on the same pc with the settings cranked up to their highest available options at a native 4k resolution however the motion bore options will be disabled to provide cleaner still images all right so let's take this comparison off by first looking at our car models starting with the porsche boxster spider now surprisingly not much has really changed at all in the past 10 years it appears the developers that worked on the remaster stellar entertainment limited have decided to retain the exact same models used before this means that the poly counts the texture surfaces and other details are virtually identical between versions however there are some subtle differences that you can probably pick up on as a result of the slight adjustment to the game's lighting effects while this tweak does make some of the reflective surfaces stand out more prominently it does also seem to hide some of the finer details like the corrugated ridges along these headlamps or the leds in this tail light this degradation and quality can be observed with pretty much every other vehicle in the game though to make up for it the remaster does at least offer far superior anti-aliasing options that greatly helps to reduce the amount of jagged edges along the body of the vehicles and i also found that some of the vehicle decals like the number on top of this cop car now appear more crisp but other than those few changes these vehicles look and behave identically to the original version so now let's take a look at the environments the environments like the car models appear to be virtually identical at first glance with the same level geometry vegetation density and design however upon closer inspection there are a few small tweaks that can be found throughout the surface textures for example actually appear worse than the remaster than before especially the road and the dirt surrounding it it almost feels like it's using a lower quality texture but i did confirm that the max setting was enabled when recording this what's even stranger though is that this isn't necessarily the case everywhere some textures like this one outside of the playable area actually look a little bit sharper and then there's environmental props like this tree that seem to sport higher resolution texture maps now there's even some new bushes that while retaining the same general shape appear more dense and a little bit more blurry the entire makeup of this track area is just a mixed bag and it's difficult to really decide whether it looks better or worse but there's nothing about it that's actually different from a format or gameplay perspective which should appeal to purists the only change that i think is actually noticeable though is the lighting the hot pursuit remaster has a much brighter appearance to it with ambient light more effectively illuminating surfaces like roads environmental objects and of course the vehicles bloom effects are more noticeable now and darker scenes like nighttime races are much brighter and easier to see even without changing any of the game's brightness options car reflections also reflect more clean high resolution images rather than the very blurry indistinguishable reflections used before it's nothing necessarily groundbreaking but it's an improvement nonetheless shadow effects have also seen a few minor improvements with softer edges that appear a bit more naturally especially with things like bushes and tree leaves and you'll even notice that some props that didn't cash out as before like these power lines now do cast shadows in the remaster the effects are another area where the developer decided to make a few changes first the particle density for collisions has been increased a significant amount so sparks while scraping against the guard rails and the small metal fragments and paint chips from high speed collisions are all much more dramatic now there's even more water particles that will kick up from the tires when driving on wet pavement though it is a little bit more blurry now additionally the damage model has been altered a bit with more complex scratch marks and a complete rework to the broken windshield effect however i do think the broken windshield looked a bit better in the original version that's enough offer that nice variation with different shades of blue and green and the overall look of a vehicle after a direct head-on collision is disappointing in the remaster with barely any vehicle deformation at all finally let's wrap up with a few sound comparisons which version do you think has the superior audio quality [Applause] [Applause] so [Music] standing by [Music] [Applause] [Music] snowflake has entered the construction site [Music] [Applause] [Music] here [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] negative on the top the vehicles [Music] this is an emergency situation [Applause] stand down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall i'm pretty disappointed with the quality of this remaster need for speed hopper suit was a pretty decent looking game when it released back in 2010 but its visuals have most certainly not held up since then there was a lot of room for improvement here from the car models that are fairly basic by today's standards to the environment that feels incredibly stale and lifeless even the lighting could have benefited from some improvements with things like biometric effects or even real-time ray tracing options being potential options that could have been pursued what's more there's some areas that inexplicably look worse like the road and dirt textures or the vehicle damage effects now if you haven't played need for speed hopper suit it's definitely still worth picking up and playing as it's a great arcade racing experience that shares a lot of its dna with the classic burnout games including the easy to handle drifting mechanics and the ability to sideswipe and take out opponents in spectacular ways but considering the remaster actually looks worse in more areas than it looks better i can't say i'd recommend this version of the game at least not on the pc now if you're playing on console you can look forward to some nice improvements like more stable frame rates and a higher resolution but if you already own the game on origin or steam then you probably won't see much of an improvement upgrading to the remaster the one nice feature that is worth mentioning though is the new cross play option which allows players on the pc to participate in online activities with players on other consoles though unfortunately the pc version is also needlessly locked to 60fps a decision that many enthusiasts pc gamers will likely be disappointed with but what do you guys think do you like what the
