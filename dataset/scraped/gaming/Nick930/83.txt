welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the upcoming remake for destroy all humans and see how it compares to the original game released by pandemic studios way back in 2005. now for those of you unfamiliar with this title destroy all humans is an action adventure game that lets players partake in an alien invasion of earth during the late 1950s players take control of a big-headed alien named crypto137 and need to travel across america blowing up barns throwing cows and even manipulating the populace by assuming the identity of politicians it's a pretty creative and fun experience but the original game hasn't aged quite as gracefully due to some awkward controls and some expectedly outdated graphics fast forward to 2020 and black forest games have decided to resurrect this cult classic with a massive visual overhaul along with some major reworks to the game's controls and gameplay mechanics and after having some time to play through it this past weekend i have to say that i'm pretty impressed with what they've managed to accomplish for reference the new remake is being played on the pc with the graphics settings pushed up to their highest values at my monitor's native 1440p resolution meanwhile the footage of the original game is being recorded on the xbox one x which should provide the highest quality visuals of the original title so let's kick this comparison off by first taking a look at some of our character models starting with the game's lead protagonist crypto137 now the general design for crypto in the remake is based very heavily on pandemic's original design form back in 2005. he still has his big head small body and large red eyes but there's a ton of great new enhancements that have been made to help bring krypto to current gen hardware first the model has seen a huge uptick to his poly count giving him much smoother edges and more definition additionally you'll notice that his coloration is a little bit different now krypto was always intended to be a little grey alien and this concept is frequently referenced throughout the game as humans will shout out little green man when he very clearly isn't green but what's ironic here is that in this first level he does look a little bit green the lighting here gives him a very green tone which ruins the joke a bit but in the remake he's very clearly gray with a little bit of a blue gradient mixed in you'll also notice that his eyes reflect the light a little bit more naturally than before eliminating that constant glossy white look from before and appearing much darker but some of my favorite changes are the new animated details along his head on the side of his head you can now faintly see his brain pulsing through his translucent skin and on the back of his head you can now see ventricles flaring as he breathes which gives him a very outer worldly look his outfit has also been updated with a new pattern texture gloves and shoulder pads along with a more elaborate neck piece but if you prefer his classic outfit you can actually unlock it by completing optional missions later in the game crypto's commanding officer pox has also seen a faithful update with all the crazy details along his head being preserved only with some slightly changed scaling he also has a less boxy body shape that feels more consistent with the design used for crypto and while these alien characters were faithfully recreated and come close to matching pandemic's art style the same can't be said for the human characters when looking at the original game it's pretty clear that pandemic was aiming to create very realistic looking character models with soft shadows subtle facial details and normal looking hair but black forest decided to target a much more cartoon-like aesthetic with their version and has given all the human characters a hugely exaggerated look this becomes even more apparent when looking at the in-game models this farmer looks entirely different now with uneven teeth a straw hat and a much dumber cliche redneck appearance miss rockwell is sort of the same way with an unnatural head shape and much wilder looking hair each human character has essentially been reimagined as a caricature which i believe was probably the right call considering how goofy the game's premise is though it does seem to drift away slightly from pandemic's original aesthetic next let's take a look at how the game's environments have changed while the general layout and look of each level seems familiar at first there are a number of pretty significant differences the opening mission alone almost looks completely different with lots of new props thrown in and far more texture variety than before even the level terrain has been modified with a lot more complexity than the often flat fields featured in the original unsurprisingly the texture quality of similar objects in the environment has been increased tenfold with more tangible depth to things like trees and rocks and some fantastic looking ground and grass texture work i'm actually pretty impressed by how good this game looks not just in relation to the original but in general and the amount of detail crammed into some of the larger areas like cities is commendable another great improvement is the extended draw distance in the original game distant objects are often shrouded in a thick blue fog but thanks to the much more powerful current gen hardware this is no longer necessary and so the larger towns and farmlands can be viewed in full detail from far away with very little noticeable pop in that's not to say there isn't any popping at all though i did find things like grass to kind of pop in and out when focusing on it very closely but it's not enough to be distracting when actually playing through the game next we have our lighting here's another area where there have been some pretty major improvements lighting in the original 2005 game is incredibly flat and unnatural with lots of baked in effects and practically no real-time shadows but with the remake all this has been changed the lighting not only directly impacts the environment but also provides a much more colorful tone to each scene light will now pour in through the trees and will properly illuminate environmental objects based on the position of the light source and there's a lot of specular lighting and bloom effects added in to enhance the image further the bloom can be a little bit extreme at times but the overall result of these changes gives this remake a far more modern look the remake even changes up some of the mission time of day settings with some missions that used to take place at night now taking place in broad daylight and vice versa while this may seem like a pretty major change it actually makes much more sense in relation to the missions themselves it makes way more sense that the mayor would hold a public meeting during the day then late at night and it also makes more sense to try and sabotage a neighborhood's television signal at night when they're all likely at home watching tv but either way you can expect a very different tone during many of these missions because of this change to the lighting the shadows are even more impressive though thanks to the improvements to the lighting the shadows are no longer just baked in and appear more realistically than they ever did before krypto shadow in particular is now softer and more detailed rather than the simplistic low poly mess that it used to be and you'll find similar improvements with the environmental shadows as well with things like crypto spaceship the trees and buildings all casting similarly soft shadows that diffuse more naturally along the surface of the ground next we have effects destroy all humans has always featured a lot of crazy effects from crypto's alien weaponry to the big explosions and buildings collapsing and the remake improves on all of them the psychokinesis power that previously only featured some faint blue energy auras around controlled objects now features a much more clear red and blue radiating effect and the objects themselves especially npcs feature improved ragdoll physics making tossing them around way more fun the zappomatic used to send out a beam of electric energy now has some nice bloom effects associated with it and the skeletons of characters being attacked with it now glow rather than just the entire character model glowing but my favorite updated effect are the explosions explosions in the old games are simply a combination of big red and yellow fireballs with some dark black smoke lingering for a few seconds the textures used to make this up are all really low res and there's no associated fire attached to the object afterwards or any sort of dynamic lighting either but in the remake explosions look fantastic with tons of particle effects some soft fireballs mixed in with large blooms of smoke and lingering fire afterwards that properly illuminates the ground around it the effect is even more impressive when destroying larger structures with kryptos flying saucer with huge explosions enhanced by a lot of bloom and some decent physics the effects themselves aren't the best out there but thanks to the more cartoony art direction they fit in perfectly with the rest of the game world and will probably age more gracefully i also appreciate how the saucer's primary laser can now manipulate more of the environment you can set trees ablaze create massive scorch marks on the terrain and even create large splashes and bodies of water now let's talk a bit about how the gameplay has been evolved now while the remake retains all the same general gameplay mechanics and functionality as before the controls have been greatly simplified to improve the flow of the action the requirement to hold down the right trigger in order to select abilities for example has been removed in favor of simply using the shoulder buttons to trigger things like psychokinesis and cycling through weapons which previously was done by pressing a face button can now be done with the left shoulder button and you can even hold down the left shoulder button to access the circular inventory screen to select a specific weapon to use the entire user interface has been given a huge overhaul with smaller icons on screen taking up less space and more accessible controls that require less button presses to access the game's combat has also seen a few changes with a new target lock-on system for firearms though if you want a free aim you can still do that as well the disintegrator's ammo that previously needed to be picked up around the environment can now be replenished by harvesting brains from humans and throwing objects with psychokinesis is now much easier to control than ever before krypto's jetpack has also been modified as it seems to last a little bit longer without upgrades and allows players to glide further when the engine overheats then there's the flying saucer previously the flying saucer was really simple to control you couldn't control things like pitcher elevation so all you had to do is use the left joystick to move around along a single plane while targeting with a long red crosshair but in the remake both joysticks can be used to move the ship more freely and aiming the ship's weapons is more responsive as you can even hold down the left trigger to aim directly below the ship allowing you to blow up buildings independence day style one of the best changes to the game though is the removal of the dna requirement previously in order to unlock a new mission players would need to run around an open-ended environment and collect dna either from ripping brains out of humans or completing lackluster challenges like races while the ability to explore unlocked environments and complete challenges is still in the remake they're no longer a requirement once you finish a mission no matter how poorly you execute it you'll have access to the next mission in the story right away without the tedious grind that being said it's not a bad idea to spend some time in these destructive sandboxes every now and again as the challenges have been redesigned to be more enjoyable and the points earned from them allow you to unlock items at pox's shop faster speaking of which just like in the old game players could unlock upgrades to both krypto and his saucer but there do appear to be more upgrades available than before along with some bonuses like special skins for completing certain objectives finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you think has the superior audio design mountains [Music] oh not another blasted alien invasion and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall the remake of destroy all humans far exceeded my expectations black forest games has taken a beloved cult classic and completely revitalized it with some gorgeous new visuals much better controls and improvements to a lot of the more outdated gameplay mechanics everything from the character models the lighting environment and effects have been totally overhauled to bring the game to a new generation of fans i think the only thing fans could potentially be divided on would be the rework to the art direction specifically in how the humans appear but i personally feel it fits in great with the humorous 1950 settings that the game aims for and it blends in nicely with the designs used for crypto and his companions what's more this remake even features a completely brand new mission that was previously intended for the first game but never made the cut with all the changes that have been made there's no denying that this version of destroy all humans is the best this game has ever played and it could open the door for new entries to the series in the future but what do you guys think are you happy with the remake of destroy all humans or do you prefer the design of pandemic's 2005 classic let me know in the comments section and if you like
