welcome back everyone I'm Nick 930 and this is my final review for sucker-punches recently released ps4 exclusive Ghost of Tsushima gusta Tsushima is a third-person open world action-adventure game set during the Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century the game is built strongly around its expansive open end environments and complex melee combat along with lots of stealth action and noir PG mechanics at first glance it's incredibly similar to the likes of Ubisoft's hugely popular Assassin's Creed franchise but the overall experience has a very different tone than those titles with an absolutely gorgeous artistic Direction well-thought-out narrative and some excellent pacing there's a ton to go over here so we're gonna start by taking a spoiler-free look at the game story the story is based loosely on the real-life Mongol invasion of Tsushima in 1274 the game kicks off with the samurais desperate defense of comodo Beach where they're overwhelmed by the Mongols ground forces led by the imposing Kadam Khan with the samurais supposedly defeated the Mongols established a firm foothold on the island slaughtering civilians burning villages and setting up shop in Castle Canada with their prisoner Lord Samara the leader of Tsushima players assume the role of shimmer s nephew Jen Psaki a fiercely loyal young samurai who was orphaned at a young age and looks up to his uncle as a sort of father figure jin starts off as a fairly basically protagonist whose drive to save his uncle and friends results in him making some foolish decisions but after linking up with a thief named yuna jin slowly begins to adopt new tactics to defeat his opponents tactics that directly go against his uncle's teachings and the way of the samurai this internal conflict is one of the driving forces behind the game's narrative providing a unique theme of tradition versus change to the mix and combined with plenty of inspiration from classic samurai filmography ghost of Tsushima provides an incredibly abridged and unique experience over what could have easily been a very redundant plot structure the characters themselves are pretty interesting especially Jin's childhood friend Rizzo who helps add some much-needed depth engines personality but I do feel as though the lead villain cohdon Khan was mishandled there's moments where he'd really does feel ruthless and intimidating and I like the idea of him trying to psychologically manipulate the characters but his appearances throughout the game are rare and he comes off feeling more like Bowser from Super Mario constantly running away and hiding in a new castle when you catch up to him but aside from a few cliched tropes here and there gusto susheela's narrative is fantastic and there's a few moments throughout that are beautifully done especially in act two and three what's more go sister Shima even offers a healthy collection of side missions to complete that are surprisingly really deep and interesting it reminds me a lot of The Witcher 3 side quest design where every story felt fully realized and expansive the plots of epic moments around even the original III demo from back in 2018 that we talked about in my recent comparison is actually just one of several side missions for only one of the characters there's hours upon hours of mission content here and it's totally worth playing through it all in part of the reason for that is the fantastic design of the gameplay Ghost of Tsushima doesn't necessarily mean that the wheel it's a very by-the-numbers open-world action adventure game that borrows heavily from the likes of assassin's creed but it does so in a way that blends in perfectly with the game's unique feudal Japan setting making for a confident and immersive experience that I couldn't pull myself away from so first let's talk about the type of mission content you can expect in this game first there's the main missions that of course follow the story of Jin and his attempt to repel the Mongol invasion then their side missions that follow unique stories that help to expand the Jin's friends and allies and as I mentioned before they're pretty extensive on their own then there's my favorite the mythical tales where you listen to a musician tell a story and then set out to discover the truth behind it often rewarding the player with a really cool ability or set of armor alongside these more structured missions there's also several open-world activities to discover most of the island is made up of enemy outposts that function exactly as he'd expect you go in kill the enemies inside complete some objectives and all of your allies move in afterwards to give you a convenient fast travel point and while I enjoy these usually the hostage saving objective does feel incredibly tedious now and again you'll have an outpost usually a farmstead or village where you need to carefully eliminate enemies to avoid them executing prisoners the problem with this is that if you learn any of these enemies start to swarm a prisoner and initiate a countdown before they execute them and give you an instant game over screen I'm all for encouraging stealth action in games as I often opt to take a sneaky approach whenever possible but this mechanic really doesn't seem necessary I think a better method would be to award bonus xp for players that can successfully protect all the hostages but an instant game over screen especially when a hostage is being threatened far away with an incredibly small window to rescue them just seems excessive the same issue persists when allies are injured in combat where you're forced to awkwardly attempt to revive them before a timer expires and gives you another game over screen I think a better choice here would have been just to make the Allies invulnerable having to constantly babysit computer-controlled allies during a big epic battle sequence really hurts the flow of the action there's also some instant failed detection events too but these make sense in the context of the story and I'm not really opposed to this as much while a good chunk of Tsushima xylan consists of these enemy checkpoints there are a few other activities sprinkled throughout to help mix up the gameplay loop first there's two different types of shrines Inari shrines that are usually well-hidden and can be uncovered by following a friendly wild Fox around and Shinto shrines that are located high up on the top of mountains requiring the player to do a little bit of rock climbing and platforming to reach them the platforming is a little rough in this game if you've played any of sucker-punches earlier games especially the infamous titles it handles a little bit like that cliff faces often consist of really obvious ledges to jump and grab on to and you simply need to hold the joystick in the direction you want to go to awkwardly hop upwards the jumping feels a little wonky as well almost like it's automatically guiding the character model to the next platform after you jump and now but again transitioning from two different elevations doesn't function properly resulting in an unintentional plummet but once you get the hang of it the platforming is extremely easy providing a nice relaxing break from the constant assassinations and sword fighting what's more reaching the Shinto shrines at the top also award the player with a golden charm that can unlock some powerful passive benefits other open world activities include random encounters usually involving saving a civilian from some bandits in exchange for information and looking for collectibles of which Tsushima houses but since he'll be spending most of your time in this game with your sword drawn let's take a deep dive into how the combat mechanics function Costa Tsushima is built heavily around two types of attacks light and heavy light attacks as you could probably already guess are less powerful but much faster and can be used to rapidly attack any open opponent by contrast heavy attacks deal more damage but are slower and can leave the player more vulnerable to a counter-attack to avoid taking damage players can hold the l1 button to block or can alternatively tap the l1 button right before an enemy attacks to deflect it and follow up with a powerful counter there's some caveats to it like unblockable attacks that must be parried or dodged but it's all pretty straightforward however one of ghosts most important combat mechanics is the stagger most enemies have a stack or meter that can be filled by landing heavy attacks once the stagger bar is broken the enemy is temporarily vulnerable allowing for multiple uninterrupted hits and a potential elimination the catch is that each enemy type is only vulnerable to a specific fighting stance a shield wielding enemy for example is vulnerable to players using a heavy tack while in the water stance while the Spearman requires players to be in the wind stance each of these four stances can be quickly swapped between by holding down the r2 button and pressing the corresponding face button this makes each combat encounter a sort of puzzle as he carefully target specific enemies to focus on while swapping between stances to remain effective you can always try and use the wrong stance on an enemy but their stagger bar will take much longer to fill and you'll find yourself quickly overwhelmed it's an interesting fighting system though I do wish there was a smoother way to swap between the stances as holding the r2 button every couple of seconds breaks up the otherwise very smooth combat sequences another important aspect of this game's combat is resolve resolve appears as the little yellow circles above the players health bar it could be used to initiate special abilities like healing resolve can be slowly recovered during combat by defeating enemies but can be replenished much faster by performing more brutal kills like assassinations executions or slaughters another great way to earn resolve is by successfully winning standoffs in classic sim my movie fashion players can challenge unaware enemies to a standoff where a letterbox effect appears and a single enemy confronts the player of one-on-one the goal here is to only draw your sword right as the enemy is about to attack and if done correctly Jin will slice through the Challenger with a single swing of the sword and can even follow it up with additional kills depending on the characters upgrades I really like this function and I love how enemies progressively get more tricky with this and begin to fake out the player but I do wish the camera wasn't always locked into the same exact position and angle each time as it gets very repetitive gusto Tsushima also offers a few boss like combat scenarios called duels well you're placed into a restricted arena to face off against the challenging swordsman often with a very cool back job to help set the mood duels are the ultimate test of your combat abilities as the enemies have some really unique combinations of attacks that requires some careful dodging and parrying to outmaneuver these are some of the coolest moments in the game and I absolutely love the different settings and homage is to classic samurai cinema but just like with the standoffs the opening cinematic is pretty repetitive and one tool in particular was so crazy dark I couldn't even see what I was doing now let's take a look at another major aspect of this game the stealth action this part of the game handles about as you'd expect bars can crouch down and sneak around enemy camps avoiding enemy cones of vision and stealthily eliminating soldiers when an opportunity presents itself to help keep track of enemies parts can click down on the touchpad to survey enemies through walls and the game world itself is filled with secret paths and hiding places to help avoid detection while there are plenty of ways to stealthy assassinate soldiers I do feel that there's room for improvement here including more contextual takedowns like pulling guards into water or around corners along with an option to hide bodies especially considering how easy it is for enemies to discover a body and immediately begin requesting reinforcements the ghosts of Tsushima does at least offer an extensive list of tools to play around with none of which are technically necessary but when used properly can be hugely helpful first there's the bows there's a half bow useful for rapid medium-range attacks and the longbow with a much slower draw time but the ability to effectively snipe enemies from far away along with these ranged weapons are some useful diversionary equipment like wind chimes that can learn a single enemy firecrackers that can learn an entire group and smoke bombs that can be dropped at the players feet for a quick getaway players can also throw kunai blades sticky bombs and black-powder bombs that again I frequently forgot existed but once I started toying around with them more I found them hugely useful especially when upgraded which brings us to go cisu chimas extensive upgrade system this game has a huge number of things to upgrade from player stats and abilities to enhancements for both weapons and armor as he because further across the island your character's Legend will grow unless that can be spent on new techniques in the upgrade menu this menu is split into three categories samurai which can improve the player's ability to deflect evade and explore the open world stance which improves each of the four fighting stances with more powerful heavy attacks and ghost where you can defy the way of the samurai and improve your stealth oriented tools and tactics on top of these skill trees there's a number of other player buffs to cheat by exploring the open world like hot springs that can increase your max health or bamboo stands that can be used to increase your resolve but a big part of the players progression is tied to the quality of their weapons and armor both weapons and armor need to frequently be upgraded using found resources like supplies iron and winnin in order to ensure that they're effective against the increasingly more challenging enemy's armor in particular is especially important as each set is tied to a specific style of play samurai armor for example is built sturdy to withstand punishment is intended for players that prefer open combat while armor like that worn by the Ronin offers a few stealth based benefits like reducing detection time swapping between these armor sets is essential as you encounter new challenges and collecting resources to upgrade their effectiveness becomes especially important towards the later half of the game while you won't be finding any additional sword sets throughout your journey weapons can also be upgraded to improve things like their damage it can also be equipped with special charms each with an additional passive benefit there's also a bunch of non-essential cosmetic upgrades to discover like clothing dyes hats masks and saddles for your horse providing plenty of opportunities to personalize your experience it's a robust collection of gameplay mechanics all designed to capture every aspect of the samurai experience and it's all done so confidently that even the few minor hiccups I mentioned aren't easy to forget about and this is partially because of just how beautiful this game is gusto Tsushima is quite possibly one of the most visually impressive titles on the PlayStation 4 platform it may not always go the most realistic route with its art direction but it more than makes up for it with some vivid environments loaded with dynamic vegetation and some fantastic simulated wind effects the game on the PlayStation 4 Pro runs mostly stable at a checkerboarded 4k 30fps with some fairly major dips in framerate during the more intense combat scenarios though it never dropped to an unplayable level and these moments were few and far between I think moving forward I would like to see a few things improved first there's the facial animations that after playing a game like The Last of Us look incredibly stiff and outdated here then there's the physics that while they look great for things like leaves feel completely off for the actual characters jumping feels really awkward and the lack of ragdoll physics for enemies is surprising I also freaked when you ran into some weird collision based bugs like enemies Spears spinning around on the ground and NPCs getting stuck in a strange falling loop but like the framerate jobs these issues aren't too common that they become a problem and most of my experience on the technical side was incredibly positive I absolutely loved the range of environments available in this game there's big open valleys filled with flowers dense autumn forests with hundreds of leaves cascading down and even snowy mountain tops and you can really appreciate all these beautiful landscapes even more thanks to a robust photo mode filled with all the options you could ever dream of and even a special Kurosawa filter in the game's visual menus the game's visuals aren't necessarily the most photorealistic out there especially with Naughty Dog churning out some incredible looking projects lately but sucker-punches artistic style nails it and I couldn't help but jump into the photo mode every now and again just to appreciate it overall gusto Tsushima is an incredible experience with a very well-written story a robust collection of solid gameplay mechanics and a gorgeous open world to explore it's certainly not perfect with some fairly basic stealth mechanics and a few technical hiccups here and there but I found myself enjoying every moment of this game more than any other title that this studio has produced before Sucker Punch has more than succeeded in creating the PlayStation 4 swan song ending a great collection of first party exclusives for the platform and I'm very much excited to see what this studio has planned next but what do you guys think did you like goes to Tsushima let me know in the comment section and don't
