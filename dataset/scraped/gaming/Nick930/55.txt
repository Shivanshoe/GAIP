this video is brought to you by odd world inhabitants welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a break from all the next gen games and check out a remake that is all too often gone under the radar oddworld new and tasty and see how it compares to its original 1997 source material oddworld abe's odyssey before we get started we're obviously going to see improvements visually in almost every way but i wanted to at least explore these updated visuals and point out all the changes that have impacted the general feel and mood of the experience we'll also go through the biggest changes that have been made to the gameplay along with a few samples of how the sound has been updated for this video we're going to be comparing captured footage of the newly released switch version of the game and compare it to the original console release of the game on the classic playstation 1. though if you are interested in trying out this remake and don't own a switch it's also available on other platforms like the pc playstation and xbox as well and if you're interested in new and tasty or any other games in the odd world series you can find more information about it in the links i've provided below alright so let's kick this comparison off by first looking at some character designs starting with our lead protagonist abe abe's overall design is more or less the same as his original 1997 debut with his signature stitched mouth big yellow eyes and fist-shaped head but thanks to the vastly superior hardware available nowadays the visual improvements are impossible to miss from the huge increase to the poly count to the improved shading and lighting abe looks like a character in an animated feature film as opposed to the pixelated impression of one that we saw before that's not to say that the original cutscenes necessarily look bad though in fact they're still pretty darn impressive with some beautiful renderings and really creative art style but the updated cutscenes especially this intro sequence do a much better job of setting up the game's unique atmosphere and setting when in game the improvements are even more apparent abe his friends and all the alien enemies were originally represented as much more simplistic two-dimensional sprites that were captured from 3d renders using the same silicon based processing systems as rare's hit donkey kong country series while an incredible visual feat at the time it predictably hasn't aged very well with models like abe and the sliggs lacking the resolution to display the finer details you can make out the general shape along with key colors like this enemy's red eye but your imagination is forced to make up the rest with the remake this is no longer a problem as the characters are now rendered in full 3d with a decently high enough poly count to capture all the details you'd expect from their relatively simple cartoonish appearances details previously only visible in the cut scenes like the purple specks on abe's head or the individual appendages along his hands and feet are all clearly visible and hold up nicely even when introduced to the new dynamic camera system then there's the animations one aspect of the original that i think has aged the best is undoubtedly the character animations despite its low target frame rate abe and the rest of the characters in the game move really fluidly through the game world with smooth running animation loops that have really nice flow to them all this coupled with the pre-rendered 3d obstacles in the environment established a 2d platforming experience unlike most in the late 90s with this remake the character animations are built to mirror the style and timing used previously with all the same moves and abilities only with a few minor tweaks to the control scheme that i'll talk about more in a bit abe still smoothly sneaks around with his exaggerated tiptoe animation and glides over gaps when timed correctly but now with the help of new ragdoll physics the brutal death scenes are even more gruesome than before adding an extra layer of dread to your failure i think overall the characters perfectly embody the artistic style and direction established by the original creators back in 97. each model despite the drastic increase to the amount of detail still feels strongly based on the conceptual design that we were only given a brief glimpse of in the original's pre-rendered cinematics and the signature cartoon-like yet still-grim art direction is very much intact which is made even more evident by the redesign to the game's environments the environments have seen an absolutely gigantic overhaul not just in their visual appearance but in the overall layout and design like with character models the environments are no longer limited to two-dimensional pre-rendered backdrops superimposed underneath the moving objects and characters but are now fully integrated into the experience this opening area for example which used to appear incredibly flat with only a few barrels stacked in straight lines next to the playable space now stretches way off into the distance with multiple layered structures to create a nice sense of depth to this large factory setting these backgrounds are also no longer static you can now make out assembly lines in the background like barrels moving along conveyor belts or distant enemy patrols doing their own thing one trick that i think was really clever in the original was the way it utilized forced perspective to create this illusion of depth walking through a door would sometimes have abe appear way off in the background as a tinier version of himself making it appear as if he traveled a far distance when in fact all the developers did was create smaller platforms and character models in these areas to make it look convincing but there's no reason for that kind of illusion now with the remake as the world is a fully rendered area with actual distance this is also benefited by the new dynamic camera system that will seamlessly follow the player from location to location without the all too frequent fades used in the past this keeps players in the action for longer and cuts down on the distracting load times while also making it easier to plan future moves especially when dealing with enemies nearby and then of course there's the more obvious improvements like the increased level of detail and the texture quality that as expected is hugely improved and new and tasty making it easier to read the funny advertisements and other site gags that are barely legible before moving on we have lighting this is another aspect that should stand out pretty easily when playing through the remake being a simple 2d platformer game for the 90s the original didn't really need to rely on any sort of direct lighting or other special effects each area was pre-lit and colorized in a way that allowed the developers to show off all the detail that they wanted and there was no need to provide real-time shadowing bloom or enhanced volumetric effects as the world was relatively flat anyway but with this new 2.5 d camera design used in new and tasty the developers had to up their game and added in a slew of great new lighting effects that despite first releasing in 2014 still hold up remarkably well today effects like bloom and biometric lighting look fantastic especially in these beautifully silhouetted sections and additional lighting effects from things like spotlights or the factory's many blinking status bulbs helped to embellish on the game's atmosphere what really impressed me though was the added shadow effects abe and his friends will cast real-time shadows against the background in some areas relative to the small spotlights hidden throughout then there's the effects abe's odyssey features a decent amount of effects most of which seem to trigger after screwing up a jump and dying horribly from electric coils to huge explosives abe's odyssey on the original playstation manages quite a lot this sequence in particular was very impressive as there's a lot of little particle effects on screen at once to really emphasize how dangerous this meat grinder is to the player thanks to the added physics effects this same meat grinder is even more intimidating now as the meat will now drop and roll around in the grinding blades randomly and the particles appear more three-dimensional as opposed to the many 2d objects used prior but of course all these visual improvements were expected so now let's turn our attention over to some of the more important changes that have been made to the gameplay one thing that players who've experienced abe's odyssey may remember all too well is how insanely difficult this game is there's no room for error here as even the slightest slip up will cause abe to either explode get shot or get trampled by razor sharp claws it's a brutally difficult experience and one that requires quite a bit of trial and error for players new to the series in the remake the developers decide to add in three new difficulty options with easy and normal offering increased player health slower enemy reaction times and more resources while the hard difficulty provides a more classic unforgiving experience regardless of which mode is chosen new and tasty also offers a few other distinct changes throughout every level environment while similar is designed a little bit differently some paths are longer some are shorter some puzzles take place later than before and instead of saving just 99 madokan slaves players are now challenged to rescue 299 with at least 150 of those being required to get the good ending there's also a number of new paths to explore expanded secret areas and other small changes like the ability to move stealthily while crouched and the ability to throw bottle caps which can be used to distract enemies and lure them towards traps more easily there's also a number of new voice lines added in for both abe and the rest of the characters which i'll demonstrate next finally let's wrap up with a sound comparison which game do you think has the superior audio design [Music] uh great [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] what what [Music] [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall odd world new and tasty is a phenomenal reimagining of an often underappreciated 90s classic the developers responsible for this remake clearly demonstrated a lot of creative restraint when updating these characters and environments as the general atmosphere remains perfectly intact there's a few small changes here and there like the redesign to the madokan pops that isn't quite as violent and the layout of the levels that aren't identical but it still feels just like i remember from 23 years ago and for the most part it plays great on the nintendo switch i did find a few performance slow downs here and there and the resolution is predictably not as great as its counterparts on other platforms but it's a great version to have just to be able to pick up and play portably when i'm waiting for a project to finish rendering or for things to download it also offers a really nice quick save option in the menu that the original 97 game didn't offer at all but what do you guys think are you impressed with the visual improvements that were made with new and tasty or is there something about it you wish wasn't changed let me know in the comments section and if you're interested in giving the odd world series a try remember that you can pick up three entries to the series right now on the nintendo switch along with several other platforms and that the latest entry out of world soul storm is set to release in early 2021 for the pc and playstation 5. and i'll be sure to cover that game when it finally releases and of course if you want to stay up to date on all the latest releases don't forget to like and subscribe for new videos posted here every week [Music] you
