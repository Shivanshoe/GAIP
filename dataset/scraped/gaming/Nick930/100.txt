welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison for today's video we're gonna take an in-depth look at the trailer that was recently unveiled for the upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 & 2 & see how this must recent remake compares to the test & 12 digital only remake Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD now before we go any further I want to give just a brief explanation of what exactly these two games are for those unfamiliar with the series the original 2 Tony Hawk pro skater games released back in 1999 and 2000 respectively and were hugely popular thanks to their intuitive gameplay mechanics catchy soundtracks and brilliant level designs in 2012 the original two games were remade by a small developer called Robo moto under the name Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD that was released digitally for the ps3 xbox360 and PC along with an additional Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 base DLC a little while later this game was built using the Unreal 3 engine and despite looking noticeably better than the originals it failed to really capture the feel and spirit of the classics fast forward to 2020 and we have yet another remake of the original two games only this time created by Vicarious Visions the very same group responsible for the recent remakes of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon alright so hopefully that clears a few things up so let's jump straight in with an in-depth look at the reveal trailer the trailer kicks off right away with some close-up cinematic shots of Tony Hawk doing some slow-motion kick tricks at some easily recognizable locations the first shot appears to be the upper area of the school from the first game while the next several shots are from the corner of Venice in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 now the first thing I wanted to point out here is that this new Tony Hawk remake will be a complete collection of the original two games every skater every level and a good chunk of the original soundtrack is set to return whereas Tony Hawk HD only included a handful of each school one for example never made its way to the 2012 game and we instead were only given about three to four levels from both Tony Hawk 1 and 2 along with three extra levels for Tony Hawk 3 now the next important takeaway here and probably the most apparent is that massive improvement to the visual claw the lighting looks absolutely gorgeous here with examples of biometric properties all throughout along with some nice reflective surfaces and enhanced bloom it really does have the sort of next-gen feel that even for 2012 Tony Hawk HD failed to deliver the way the board reflects light here looks absolutely gorgeous and with all the new skateboarding video games creeping into the market lately it's nice to see the original king of skating games will be one of the better looking skateboarding experiences come this fall one of the most interesting impacts that these new visuals have on the game though is how the ambient lighting has altered the look and feel of the environments Venice for example is now much closer to dusk with lots of long shadows and a more distinct golden glow warehouse by contrast is now set during the daytime and light pours through all the windows greatly change in the original feel and making it feel a lot more open as a result the environments look to be beautifully detailed with lots of graffiti tags on ramps and some nice variety to things like pipes and kickers though up close there are some fairly flat textures the lack the type of depth you'd expect it's unclear exactly which version of the game is being shown here so I can't imagine this will look much different between the three platforms upon release still it's well beyond the quality of the texture mapping used in Tony Hawk HD and locations in general look to have way more personality than they've ever had before I especially love the look of school 2 that has this new collegiate gothic architectural style making it one of the most visually interesting interpretations created so far the leap of faith has also been colored white and has more scratches and marks along it whereas previously it was just some shade of red or pink with very little detail to go along with it the shadows in particular really helped to make the image look more photorealistic a fantastic artistic choice as the more cartoon like cel shaded appearance in Tony Hawk 5 really felt cheap and unappealing now at the twenty second mark we do get confirmation that the game will be outputting at 4k on the Xbox one X and on their website they also confirm that the game is targeting 60 frames per second which is incredible news considering how gorgeous the game looks from these few clips Tony Hawk HD can run at Ultra HD resolutions on the PC put on the console platforms it's one by the older hardware like be sitting in at around 720p I'll explore this in more detail towards release but the new Tony Hawk remake looks substantially better in every conceivable way now moving on we have a look at downhill Jam of one-way course with lots of big drops and dangerous rails interestingly this particular level was set at night in Tony Hawk HD a very strange choice considering how challenging the level already was especially when trying to reach that secret 8 but with this latest remake the level returns to bright sunny daylight and the canyons are now gorgeously detailed with some great-looking rock surfaces and foliage hanging off the side school one is also shown and we get a great look at all the nice soft shadow effects and extra detail like the dried leaves sitting alongside the planners that can even be interacted with partially as we'll see in a little bit here we get another great wide shot view of school 2 this time demonstrating the enhanced draw distances along with the fantastic texture variety and lighting effects it all feels like a genuine photorealistic overhaul of the original game rather than al a quest to remake like before and this is made clear by the much more wavy feel to the skating mechanics one of hd's biggest problems was its handling skaters felt floating and trying to perform a complex combo was made difficult by the awkward spins and unnatural Ollie's according to an interview between IGN and the head of Vicarious Visions the game skater controls are being built on the original code by Neversoft ensuring that players will feel like they're playing a true Tony Hawk game rather than a cheap knockoff there's of course new animations that look more authentic like characters leaning during grinds and more realistically reacting to large drops but the field the game should be much closer to that of the original games that being said this next sequence demonstrates that the new game won't necessarily be a one-to-one remake of that classic game part as the skater here lands from a judo it appears that performing a revert at the base of the ramp a move that was introduced in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 to allow players to string together ver tricks into their combos this move did make its way into Tony Hawk HD as well with the Tony Hawk rebirth DLC but was initially not available forcing players to make use of the level environments just like players did in 1999 in 2000 so it's interesting that Vicarious Visions felt it necessary to change up the formula with this change point based schools will be much easier to achieve perhaps meeting the values of these goals will be adjusted to compensate I for one would love to have multiple difficulty modes to encourage more replay value but we'll have to wait and see what they plan on doing here next the trailer begins to get into the available features starting with the skaters unlike Tony Hawk HD this remake will see the return of every pro skater from the original two games the character models have all been created using a sophisticated laser scan technique next we get some fantastic wide shots of the environments including school 1 the warehouse Minneapolis downhill Jam and Venice again all brought to life with enhanced lighting more complex geometry and beautiful texture work then we get a brief glimpse at the artists involved in the soundtrack now this is a big one Tony Hawk games and their soundtrack go hand-in-hand and one of the reasons we haven't seen re-release of these games sooner because of the difficulty involved in obtaining fresh licensing agreements with all the artists that provided their talent in the past so far Vicarious Visions has confirmed the return of classic songs like when worlds collide by Powerman 5000 you buy Bad Religion and of course Superman by Goldfinger but they've also confirmed that they weren't able to get everything most of the soundtrack is still intact but there will be some exceptions and it's likely that the developers will try and fill that hole with new artists the exact same problem presented itself when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD was revealed with Goldfinger and Bad Religion agreeing to license their songs again while some others held out forcing Robo moto to incorporate a few new tracks like pigeon John's the bomb after the soundtrack listing we get a few more shots of downhill Jam revealing some incredible background decoration like extended power cables and towers that then smoothly transitions into a scene in the Minneapolis level now this scene is very interesting first there's the lighting that again has new volumetric properties and reflective surfaces given the environment and more real appearance then there's the trick itself which surprisingly seems to feature some meno extensions a feature that was introduced in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 again demonstrating that this new game will be the original gameplay mechanics now this next section may seem like a bit of a stretch as it's likely just an editing trick but it does feel as though this skater is performing an acid drop into this pool a move that wasn't introduced until at least Tony Hawk underground again very likely this is just a stylish edit but it would be a nice addition if we saw things like acid drops and spine transfers added in as well now this next scene confirms two things one there will be online multiplayer a feature that was also available in Tony Hawk HD and the original modes will also return including the highly requested split-screen local play a feature that was desperately needed before online multiplayer is great but you can't bring back the Tony Hawk series without resurrecting classic split-screen trick attack and horse so I'm very happy to see that Vicarious Visions included this option also it's worth mentioning that in this clip we get a pretty clear look at the new heads-up display that is much cleaner with a new board icon in the top right corner to indicate the player stance it's a really slick UI and the high resolution font gives the game a really nice polished look next we get a brief look at Kareem Campbell sliding down a rail in school - along with a pivot up on the roof that stirs up some leaves though it's unclear if this was just done for the sake of the trailer or if the leaves will actually kick up when riding through them finally the trailer ends with a fantastic homage to the move to help to start it all Tony Hawk's 900 from the clip shown here the animation worked for this move looks way more realistic than the version used in HD a trait shared by all the animations demonstrated throughout the trailer at the end of the trailer we're treated to the name of the game and the official release date Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 & 2 will release this September for Xbox one Playstation 4 and the PC via the epic game store a switch person is not confirmed currently though if Crash Bandicoot and Spyro or any good indicator I wouldn't be surprised if Tony Hawk finds its way to the switch within a year of its release and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall I'm extremely pleased with what's being shown here this is a beautiful reimagining of two of my favorite games and from the few clips of gameplay and images shown so far it's clear that a lot of care and attention is going into this remake the beautiful graphical design returned to the classic controls and feel and the robust feature set are all great signs it's of course disappointing that they couldn't get the entire soundtrack but it's also unsurprising and is still a major improvement over all the cut corners in the last attempt at returning to these games with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 effectively ending the franchise on a brutally sour note it'll be nice to have a proper revival for this once iconic series and hopefully if the game does succeed we'll see the return of other entries to the series as well but what do you guys think are you excited for the new Tony Hawk pro skater remake or did you prefer the older versions of the game let me know in the comment
