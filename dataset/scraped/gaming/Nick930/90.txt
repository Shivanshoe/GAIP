welcome back everybody i'm nick930 and this is my final review for naughty dog's recently released ps4 exclusive the last of us part two last of us part two is a story driven action adventure game set in the northwestern region of the united states like the first game in the series part two focuses around a small cast of characters and their experiences during a devastating viral outbreak that turns humans into bloodthirsty zombie-like creatures while the survivors are forced to do whatever it takes to stay alive players will find themselves exploring semi-linear environments carved into the dilapidated remains of wyoming and seattle all while dealing with the growing threat of the cordyceps virus and the increasingly more unstable factions of human survivors like the first game part 2 offers an ambitious narrative storyline with high quality cinematics excellent performances and memorable characters though there are some questionable choices when it comes to the overall structure that distract from an otherwise brilliant gameplay experience now before we go any further i want to warn you that this first section will deal with the game's story and while i'll try and remain vague you may still find that it contains some light spoilers so if you don't want anything spoiled i recommend skipping past this section using the time stamps in the description alright so let's talk about the game's story part 2 takes place several years after the events of the first game with ellie now living peacefully within a large community in jackson county wyoming this community is bustling with activity with kids playing around in the streets winter dances and the like though there still remains the looming thread of the infected outside the walls and patrols are frequently sent out to ensure the surrounding areas are safe ellie now about 18 years old has matured a great deal since the first game she's more independent has established a new romantic relationship with a girl named dina and has even taken up playing guitar with the help of the previous game's protagonist joel but during one of her patrols disaster strikes jackson county and ellie's forced to travel to seattle to make things right upon arriving in seattle the game opens up considerably players are free to explore large areas on their own and the focus is shifted directly onto ellie's character development as she struggles to deal with the events in jackson it's a dark and painful story but one that's done beautifully at least at first the story takes a drastic churn part way through and essentially halts the pacing entirely in order to try and explain itself with a series of flashbacks and flash forwards and the decisions made by the characters are already incredibly difficult to justify distracting from an otherwise really enjoyable experience but as i proceeded further down this rabbit hole the newer characters started to grow on me it became clear that the story is a lot more nuanced than the original and is significantly more ambitious overall with twice the length and much more challenging moral dilemmas the original game story is a crowd pleaser a coming-of-age story with a dark zombie apocalypse edge to it but the sequel isn't quite as simple and will challenge the player to question everything they knew about the first game overall i ended up loving the story to this game but it wasn't immediate like the first game it grew on me as i played further and i appreciated it even more upon a second playthrough it's definitely not perfect as there's a few moments that feel forced for the sake of making all the narrative threads click together properly but for the most part it's a thoughtful and incredible emotional experience that you won't find anywhere else while many may have their own thoughts on the quality of the story there is no denying the absolute brilliant design of last of us part 2's gameplay the first game is probably one of my absolute favorite games sitting right between the likes of bioshock and chaos theory and while it's excellent storytelling is definitely a major reason for that its gameplay was what helped seal the deal as it perfectly blended together environmental exploration thoughtful stealth action and intense combat in one immersive package the sequel takes each of these core pillars and expands upon them the game starts off a bit slow with a really long introductory act but it picks up by the time you reach seattle with a massive downtown area to explore filled with lots of interesting locations the sheer scope of this game's exploration is much larger than i expected with tons of optional areas to uncover usually populated with resources leftover notes and even occasional objects to look at all for the sake of making the world feel more believable i especially love how ellie will open drawers more realistically holding on with one hand and grabbing objects with the other it's still not technically an open world game so don't go into this expecting the entire game to play with the opening seattle area but it does a great job of easing the player back into the groove of the last of us's gameplay loop and introduces more challenging enemies like the infected at a manageable pace traversal is handled roughly the same as the last game you'll spend a lot of time running around on foot climbing over debris and crouched down to keep a low profile but now you can squeeze through narrow paths swing from ropes and crawl on the ground to get under low hanging obstacles each level environment feels like a playground with plenty of opportunities to take advantage of all of ellie's new capabilities and when combined with the game's excellent combat functions it becomes even more enjoyable the combat is built heavily around guerrilla warfare going in guns blazing is often the worst choice as you're always outnumbered and even on the standard moderate difficulty enemies can mow you down with only a few powerful shots instead the game greatly encourages a stealthy approach with enemies typically unaware of your presence at first allowing you to sneak around through tall grass and quietly dispatch one enemy at a time but unlike most stealth games last of us part 2's enemy ai can be incredibly aggressive their line of sight is wide and long almost forcing you to always crawl around on the ground like you're playing metal gear solid 4. and i found it increasingly more difficult to avoid detection when patrols would constantly bump into dead bodies and start investigating with all the great stealth mechanics incorporated here i would have loved to see an ability to hide dead bodies but it seems the only way to accomplish this is by taking them hostage first and then pulling them around corners a less than ideal option when trying to move quickly through an area part 2 also introduces new dogs to the gameplay that can follow your scent trail when they're within range of it this new mechanic is a smart choice as it forces players to constantly move to avoid being detected though i do feel it's a bit overused later on with several dogs thrown in at once in some really claustrophobic areas a lot of times you'll find that you'll have no choice but to engage in open combat and the game's great weapon design and enemy ai helps to make these encounters really enjoyable every firearm at ellie's disposal feels incredibly powerful and when upgraded their handling is improved considerably allowing you to easily pick off enemies with only a couple of well played shots one of my favorite new additions to the combat is the enhanced gore system a shot from a rifle for example can blow off an enemy's leg or arm causing them to scream out in pain it's unsettling to hear but it's such a great attention to detail that helps make the action feel more visceral and realistic all these weapons can be upgraded further using workbenches in the environment where players can watch as ellie actually breaks apart each firearm and screws on new upgrades realistically another example of the developer is really going the extra mile to make the experience more immersive item crafting also returns and functions pretty much exactly the same levels are littered with different resources like cloth blades tape and alcohol and these items can be combined together using found recipes to create useful tools like health kits molotov cocktails and the new improvised suppressor that can be attached to the pistol for a few silent shots these tools can also be upgraded using a reworked player skill tree that is now broken up into different categories each with prerequisite upgrades to unlock using found skill points i feel this new prereq requirement kind of limits the player choice offered by the first game a bit with some less interesting upgrades like extended listen mode distance feeling like a waste to me personally but the large number of unlocks do make the new game plus mode more enticing and it's definitely worth the time searching for skill points to improve things like the durability of suppressors and the effectiveness of health kits another great new feature in part two is the reworked melee combat system players can now press a dodge button to avoid enemy attacks which will then open up opportunities for a counter-attack there's a lot of animations that have been built for this some of which are pretty grotesque but it feels so much better than the often hit or miss system used in the original game then of course there's the design of the artificial intelligence both friendly and enemy ai behave much better than they did before enemy soldiers will flank realistically give accurate call outs and are often unpredictable performing moves i didn't even think were possible meanwhile friendly companions will regularly assist during combat also flanking and assisting with multiple stealth takedowns when an opportunity presents itself one of my favorite moments in the early game was when i discovered a group of infected clickers inside a nearby building which i then used to my advantage as i opened the door and word the group out towards a nearby squad of human enemies it all worked exactly how i hoped it would and these types of moments present themselves frequently throughout the entire game without ever feeling scripted however the ai isn't perfect and i did run into a few major issues throughout my playthrough like my companion blowing my cover by stupidly standing in the path of an enemy patrol and this enemy that for whatever reason kept running away from me and then got stuck standing in place unsure of what to do next but aside from those two or three occurrences the majority of my 25 to 30 hour playtime felt incredibly well polished and remained challenging enough to keep the experience interesting without ever feeling frustrating or cheap now the only real major disappointment i have with the last of us part 2 is the lack of multiplayer as i mentioned in one of my past comparisons the development team decided that in order to fulfill the ambitious scope that they had planned for the game single player they were forced to hold off on releasing the planned multipart content it's a real shame too considering i love the multiplayer design of the first game and i still feel it's one of the strongest playstation exclusive multiplayer modes available right now thankfully there does seem to be a plan to introduce multiplayer to this game possibly even later this year and i'll be sure to give it a separate review if and when that happens finally let's talk about the presentation last of us part two is simply put one of the most incredible looking video games i've ever played everything from the insanely photorealistic cutscenes to the beautiful environmental detail and lighting effects helped to make this one of naughty dog's crowning achievements i was blown away by the dense foliage most of which dynamically interacts with both players and npcs and i love the extra level of detail that went into everything like the animations for ellie looting shelves and the way enemies react to being shot at specific points and all this comes together to create an unrivaled visual presentation the game appears to be outputting at a 2k resolution on the ps4 pro with a locked 30 fps and for the most part this 30fps felt incredibly stable with only a few rare instances where the frame rate dropped down a bit especially during the more scripted action sequences but even these moments do little to detract from the gorgeous presentation overall the last of us part 2 is pretty darn close to being a masterpiece the gameplay is engaging all throughout the visual presentation is unbelievable and the story is certainly ambitious i think the biggest issue that keeps this game from being perfect is the structure of its campaign especially considering how the game was advertised it reminds me a lot of metal gear solid 2 which is notorious for its unexpected second act and it did feel a bit long in the tooth but by the time the credits rolled i walked away satisfied with the overall experience and keep finding myself wanting to return to play more but what do you guys think did you like the last of us part 2 let me know in the comments section and don't
