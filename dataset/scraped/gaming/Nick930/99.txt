welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's video we're gonna take a look at halo 2 that just released on the PC as part of the Master Chief collection and see how it compares to the original PC version of the game from 2007 now for those of you that don't already know halo 2 first released for the Xbox in 2004 and was then ported over to Vista naval pcs in 2007 as a way to encourage users to upgrade from Windows XP unlike Gearbox's halo combat Evolved pc port that I analyzed back in March halo 2 was ported over by an internal team at Microsoft Game Studios and incorporated a few new features like new multiplayer maps and map editor and even the ability to earn achievements via the infamous game for Windows Live system in 2014 halo 2 was remastered by saber interactive using several models and effects from Halo Reach and then released as part of the halo Master Chief collection for the Xbox one this version of the game features overhauled cutscenes improved environmental textures effects and far more advanced lighting on top of this players can also revert the settings instantly back to the classic graphical style at the press of a button for this comparison I will be running both versions of the game on the PC at a 1440p resolution with the settings pushed up as high as possible for the original Vista version of Halo 2 I'm running the project cartographer mod which helps to bypass the broken gains for Windows Live client while also introducing a few modern enhancements like widescreen support fov adjustments and multiplayer functionality also bear in mind that 343 are aware of some of the issues currently plaguing the halo 2 anniversary release on PC and you can find a complete list of known issues in the link provided in the description alright to kick this comparison off let's begin by taking a look at our character models starting with the lead protagonist Master Chief now right away we can see an absolutely huge improvement to the quality and complexity between the original PC version and the more recent anniversary version of chief the helmet is more clearly defined with all the same details now sporting actual depth along with an increase polycount help round out the smooth edges but interestingly despite looking much better this updated model features absolutely every single detail incorporated originally tiny indistinguishable paint scratches all returned along with a few small extra details to enhance it further it's a great reskin that delivers a more visually pleasing version of the character without taking away any of its original style practically every other character model however has seen a complete overhaul with redesigned armor very different facial structures and hair lines and more realistic shading and shadowing they still are easily recognizable and are based strongly on the original designs but the aren't quite as loyal to the design as the Master Chief model is now when we swap the visual style back to its classic mode we in theory should expect to see an identical image on both sides and for the most part that's very much the case but there is one distinct difference here the aliasing both in-game and in cutscenes chief now appears more jagged in the new version than he ever did before it's almost impossible to notice especially at higher resolutions but it's still odd that there's no setting in game to help boost the AAA a bit higher to fix this the same problem persists with every other character and object in the game which can be seen clearly when looking at the edges or when focusing on small details like Avery's Purple Heart badge though it is worth noting that this badge offers a lot more detail than it did before despite its jagged edges next let's take a look at the changes made to the weapon models starting with the battle rifle so the first thing that really jumps out here are the enhance is made to the lighting and texture work lighting now more properly interacts with the weapon that the players holding giving it more of a presence in the atmosphere and the new shaders and textures play a huge role in giving it a more slick presentation then we have the additional ammo display that now has a slight bloom enhancement added in to make it appear more like an LED screen these enhance effects combined with the increase in the level of detail to a great job of improving on the model without changing too much the only real change to the design here is the charging handle that replaces the round knob with a straight textured cylindrical piece instead it's also worth mentioning that much more detailed texture work that has been applied to chief's hand here when using the classic graphical settings we also see some fixes to bugs from the original game the battle rifles muzzle flash previously doesn't seem to render properly after the initial shot but in the Master Chief collection it seems to render just fine a similar effects can be observed with the plasma rifle that in Halo 2 Vista doesn't render the blue discharge effect properly like it does in the original Xbox title but it now renders properly in the Master Chief collection so overall there seems to be improvements all around when it comes to the weapons regardless of which graphical style you choose to use environments have received a massive overhaul with the halo 2 anniversary visuals with high quality textures improved foliage and more complex geometry all while retaining the exact same level ants as before but when swapping to the classic visual style there's a large number of changes some good and some not so good so first in the initial mission when looking out the windows of Cairo station the players can see distant ships fleeing earth during a covenant attack these distant sprites trigger after it becomes clear that the Marines are under attack and an NPC even points them out at one point however in the Master Chief collection these sprites trigger prematurely and one of them seems displaced appearing directly outside the window by the elevator in all of its low res glory 343 has confirmed that there's a number of issues with the environments that they're currently looking into including low res environmental textures some occasional flickering on AMD GPUs and some LOD poppin but I really never experienced anything like this on either visual mode in fact some sections like this temple on the Delta halo feature even more detail in the classic settings than the original Halo 2 Vista release with leaves now rendering properly on the trees surrounding this temple similar to how they appear in the original Xbox release but the biggest changes can be found when looking at the lighting effects the lighting suffers from a number of problems when using the classic visual style in the Master Chief collection the Sun for example is no longer visible in several levels throughout the campaign this means the harsh light rays incorporated previously are now missing and all we're left with are the old-school lens flare effects and the pre-baked environmental lighting there's still a couple of spotlights in each level but even these are not rendering properly another issue that 343 is actively investigating but it's not all bad the anniversary graphics mode features some beautifully reworked enhanced lighting effects including simulated HDR bloom specular lighting and even some screen space reflections when viewing pools of alien blood at certain angles toggling between these games graphic Styles reveals just how much work went into reimagining each environment with more believable lighting effects with bright white shafts pouring in through the gaps in the ceiling and casting deep dark shadows on the floor below drastically changing the look and feel of each scene shadows have also been greatly improved with softer edges and a much darker tone that blends more appropriately with each environment but they're not perfect and suffer from some differing and pixelated edges an issue that I noted previously with combat evolves release next we have our effects effects app for the most part remained exactly the same between releases fire for example uses the exact same sprites to make up the effect and the only real improvement comes when flipping over to the anniv settings the explosions look virtually identical between both games with all the same particles fireball effects and Whiting's still intact and when we swap over to the anniv graphics we get even more impressive looking fireballs that contrasts more drastically with the darker environments and light up the scene more vibrantly the same can be said for the water effects that seem to be ported over directly for the classic graphics but are improved significantly in the remastered option the only effect of this really change then are the snow particles towards the end of the game in the original game snow particles can be seen falling around the skybox in addition to directly around the player to help provide depth to the effect but in the Master Chief collection the snow particles are only appearing outside of the playable zone the particles appear properly in the remastered setting so this is definitely not intentional and 343 has added this to the list of issues that they're looking into finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which version of the game do you think has the superior audio and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall halo twos latest release on the PC platform features a number of improvements of the original 2007 version there's improved character textures some fixed environmental rendering and best of all native support for higher resolutions and unlocked frame rates without the need for any community made modifications but unfortunately there's still several big issues that need to be ironed out including broken lighting bad aliasing and the Sun missing in almost every level though if you're only interested in playing the game with the new remastered visuals everything looks great with significantly improved lighting shadows and an incredible overhaul to the character models and weapons now that we finally received a remaster versions of these two titles all eyes are on halo 3 which will finally make its PC debut sometime later this year and I'll be sure to provide a detailed analysis for that title when the time comes but until then what do you guys think are you happy with the
