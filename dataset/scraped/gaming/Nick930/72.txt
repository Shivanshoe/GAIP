this video is brought to you in part by gog welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take a look at the recently released first person shooter game sirius sam4 and see how it compares both visually and from a gameplay perspective to its predecessor sirius sam 3 bfe for this analysis both games are being played on the pc with their settings set to their ultra presets at a native 1440p resolution though for the sake of capturing cleaner still images the motion blur options will be disabled also if you like what you see here and want to play the game for yourself you can pick it up drm free at gog.com using the link provided in the description and if you're one of the first 500 people to use that link you'll also get a bonus free code to sirius sam the first encounter you can find more details in the description below alright so let's kick this comparison off by first taking a look at our character models starting with sam sirius stone himself now the first thing that really stands out to me with this character model is sam's hair not only does it appear shorter than before but it also looks a bit grayer giving him a slightly older look and this is odd as sirius sam4 is supposedly a prequel to sirius sam iii sam also doesn't have quite as many visible scars along his face and his upper lip no longer protrudes weirdly from his face like before you also notice that his t-shirt has been updated with new visible buttons along the collar and much higher resolution textures that look significantly better when playing at ultra hd resolutions and this high quality texture enhancement is something we're going to see a lot more of throughout this comparison as this game was clearly built to take advantage of higher end displays more commonly available today now the characters in the game still don't look amazing the shadowing is lacking and the animations still feel noticeably low budget but it's an aspect of the visual design that's easy to ignore considering you'll spend about 99 of your time looking down the barrel of a gun at hundreds of wacky alien enemies all the enemies from the previous serious sam games returned for this latest entry including gennars soldiers biomechs and of course the beheaded kamikazes and they've all been given a huge makeover sporting similar ultra hd textures to sam some of the enemies like the biomex have even been redesigned to appear more alien-like with big tentacles replacing their typical pronounced jawline and exposed brain tissue there's even a bunch of brand new enemies to contend with like these possessed grunts that will run at you with wolverine style claws the space mummies that were first introduced in the vr exclusive the last hope and this guy the medic anthropolog that can belch up acid if you get too close and will explode after hitting him enough next let's check out some of the available weapons starting with the tried and true desert eagle the deagle from a gameplay perspective remains unchanged from sirius sam 3. it has infinite ammunition and still packs a decent punch capable of one-shotting most weak enemies with a headshot but sirius samfor's version of this gun does look a little bit different with a new chrome finish different iron sights and some higher res textures but it's the firing animation that i found most interesting unlike sirius sand 3's short and simplistic firing animation sam forced eagle feels like it has some real power behind it now the gun kicks up higher and at a steeper angle allowing players to see the next round being chambered additionally it seems serious m4 also renders the bullets in mid-air this time suggesting that the game may finally be abandoning the old hitscan method for its combat however there are a few problems with this animation that i wanted to point out first the bullet leaves the barrel before the muzzle flash appears which looks a little bit off i think technically this is supposed to happen but the delay between the two effects still seems a bit too high you also can no longer see the bullet casing eject after firing despite it working before in sirius sam 3. next we have the pump shotgun like with the deagle this gun handles the same but has a completely new look to it the pump handle is now an aged wood finish the side saddle has been removed and there's now a new extended rail on the top but the best change with most of these weapons is the increase to the texture resolution the double barrel shotgun for example has roughly the same design as before though the increased texture resolution has allowed the developers to incorporate much finer details like etchings along the barrel and the wood stock the rocket launcher that previously had a lot of muddy texture work is now much more impressive and the firing animation appears to similarly be more complex with pieces around the barrel extending when firing a rocket as opposed to before where the whole launcher just kicked back on the screen overall the big takeaway here is that sirius sam4's character and weapon models all feature some decent improvements to texture quality and complexity and are probably the most noticeable visual improvement that have been made between the two titles next let's talk about the environments the environments in sirius sam4 are kind of similar in structure to those offered in sirius sam 3. the levels start off very narrow and claustrophobic at first with players needing to roam the battle torn streets of what i believe is supposed to be cairo in modern day egypt but as more enemies are introduced and the player gets their hands on bigger and badder guns the environments slowly begin to grow in size eventually culminating in the massive open canyons and courtyards in the final act sirius sam4 is built around this same general principle only instead of the dull browns and grays of the north african cities from before this new game takes place on the italian peninsula in and around the vatican this change in scenery makes for a much more lush and vibrant location to fight in with dense forests and tall mountains along the backdrop and like with the character and weapon models all the texture maps here are beautifully detailed with the only recurring issue i ran into being some annoying flickering that occurred after some map loads but it's the sheer size of these environments that really impressed me some of these locations are massive with big sprawling open landscapes filled with a mix of tree objects and distant sprites to help complete the illusion don't get me wrong these aren't the best looking game worlds today in fact they look pretty dated but they're still a big step up from what we saw in the last game and what's more a lot of these environments are semi-destructible with trees walls and stone pillars all collapsing when hit with enough force sirius sam 3 featured the same level of destructibility but because of the big empty desert setting it wasn't quite as prominent now let's take a quick look at the lighting effects here we don't see quite as big a leap in quality the lighting is still completely static and baked in with no form of volumetric effects or global illumination at play and staring towards the sun typically causes the entire screen to light up in a way that just feels weirdly artificial however i do appreciate the much more vibrant color tone in this latest game sirius sam 3 has a tendency to look really bleak and unappealing most the time with a sea of brown and grey only occasionally being broken up by more colorful enemy models and gore effects but sirius sam4 takes the series back to its more colorful roots with bright green valleys and blue skies combined with similarly bright and colorful enemies and all the additional dynamic lighting effects from things like enemy lasers and fireballs help to enhance each major battle further but as far as the actual lighting techniques at play here go sirius sam4 isn't that much better than its predecessor shadows also have seen very few improvements you still get some nice projections from complex environmental props and enemies but you also still get this really bad dithering that still is plenty noticeable even when the game's settings are pushed as high as possible then of course we have our effects now there's a lot of different effects in the series sam games mainly explosions gore and destruction and it looks like this newest entry borrows a lot of those same effects created for series sam 3. dirt still kicks up with big textured particle effects and enemies break apart the same way each time depending on the weapon used but the explosions on the other hand have been tweaked a little bit first the fireball is now much brighter and more prominent consuming much more of the screen when detonated from the same distance and the smoke effects have similarly been reworked with thicker plumes of black smoke as opposed to the low res dirt texture used before granted the terrain this explosive is detonating on is different and we should expect the dirt to play a bigger role in the effect in the older game but the black smoke still looks much more believable than the dirt cloud used before i also like how they preserve the way vegetation reacts to these explosions so grass and trees will still blow back in the same way sirius sam4 also greatly improves the way water reacts to the player in sirius sam 3 water is practically motionless and you can only trigger basic ripples when firing at it directly there's no wave simulation and no sense that you're even in the water itself but sirius sam4 improves this a little bit with some slightly better reflective surfaces and great new fluid effects that react to the player enemies and even projectiles it's rare to cross over water like this throughout the game but it's still a nice touch either way but one of the most impressive feats in this game and the earliest thing you're going to notice when you boot up the campaign is the absolutely insane scale of some of the battles this epic battle is easily one of the biggest on-screen battles i've ever seen in a game with thousands upon thousands of individual npcs spread out for miles around it's simply incredible that it even runs as smoothly as it does all things considered serious sam 3 had some large groups of enemies at the very end but nothing even remotely close to this scale huge skirmishes like this have always been a signature of the serious sam series and this sets the bar higher than i ever could have imagined now if you break this sequence apart you will notice that a majority of the enemies are very basic foot soldiers with only a handful of unique enemies tossed in like biomex to help add to the scene you'll also notice that only the frontline soldiers will actually fire their weapons which minimizes the amount of necessary rendered particles at any one time but regardless it's a pretty wild sequence and certainly sets the bar high for the series now before we get to our sound comparisons i did want to mention a few important changes that have been made to the gameplay design first there's a new skill tree system throughout the game you'll find these big red orbs that can be collected and spent to unlock new abilities including abilities like regaining health from melee kills extra supplies from defeating enemies and best of all the option to dual-wield almost anything in the game including the cannonball launchers this adds a totally new angle to the shooter mayhem and gives players a chance to customize their experience a little bit while also encouraging repeat playthroughs as well another new feature in sirius sam4 are optional side quests these will appear occasionally as you progress through the world and are often small detours off the main path that feature unique enemy configurations and rewards that feels a little out of place for a serious sam game but like the skill tree it does provide a bit more incentive to retry levels other new features include new weapons new enemies and to help traverse the larger environments rideable vehicles including a motorcycle and a gigantic mech suit that can be used to completely decimate the alien horde sadly the game's multiplayer mode in its current state is pretty limited there's no death match options and the co-op has been scaled back to only four players but the developers have expressed interest in expanding on this aspect of the game at a later date finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you think has the better overall sound quality uh um [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall sirius am4 has a few minor improvements to its visual design over its predecessor all the character models now sport high quality textures and slight redesigns and the weapons are significantly more impressive looking than before the environments and lighting could still use some work as these do look a bit dated at this point but the absolutely massive scale of some of the combat encounters is absolutely worth trying out but what do you guys think are you impressed with sirius sam4 or do you prefer serious sam 3 let me know in the comment section and don't
