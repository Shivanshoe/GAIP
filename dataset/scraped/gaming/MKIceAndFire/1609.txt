[Music] you guys are nothing but a bunch of pushovers well might as well put the three of you out of your misery what was that where'd that spaceship come from yes it's Goku you finally made it attention we have a life on planet minute I gotta find those three fast please be alive you guys please be safe go Coogs heroic arrival huh huh go on and krillen they're in trouble they're hanging on by a thread they're really close right where those three huge powers are come on my way guys hang on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like it's time to show what I can do after training under a hundred [Music] and Clough [Music] Kakarot you finally show your face go on here you go it's a sense of bean give some to the others - I'm gonna fight these guys on my own huh you wanna fight me what's a puny little guy like you gonna do there's no way you can beat me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right I think it's finally time to show you my best stuff [Music] [Music] sorry you were wide open so I just went for it then how is that possible he's already gone beyond the same power level but how what kind of training has he put himself through to achieve this weight what other stories more than legends possibly be is he the legendary sane warrior that appears once every thousand years is he actually a Super Saiyan what about you guys you gotta go back to your own planet or what or do you want to end up like this guy over here whoo ha ha ha ho he that bad huh this spiky head whip must be out of his mind yeah he actually believes that he has the power to take down Riku oh he just got lucky raccoon wasn't fighting at his best that's all yeah that was a fluke I mean his power level didn't even go over five thousand give me a break here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] who was raised on earth [Music] what you're doing [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Kakarot rapidly increasing his power level at the exact moment he lands a strike he must be trying to conserve his energy that power spike is probably too quick for even their advanced Scouters to detect his power level is unbelievable okay where is all this power coming from do you understand now just give up already this must be some sort of nightmare how can we elite warriors be soos but powerless against this guy your naivete makes me sick why would you let them get away with that you may have grown stronger but that doesn't make you a Super Saiyan far from it Super Saiyan I can see that you're proud of how much you've increased your power but there won't be nearly enough to defeat Freeza Freeza huh that's the guy King Kai told me about wait so even after all the training I did you're saying I'm still not strong enough to beat him that's exactly what I'm telling you Frieza possesses more power than you could ever possibly imagine yeah maybe you're wrong I mean you saw what Goku can do right I mean those guys couldn't even lay a finger on it Goku is unstoppable then fight him and find out for yourself but that's not all breezes probably already used the dragonballs to wish for immortality no I don't think he's done that yet what how would you know if it's like using the Dragon Balls on earth the sky should get really dark and shin rot appears but it's been bright this whole time which means he probably hasn't made his wish yet Shen what what the heck's is Shandra you mean something comes out of the Dragon Balls oh yeah that's right he probably doesn't know how to summon Shenron that means we still have a chance to make our wish appears we've got some company arriving looks like Jace has brought captain ginyu along with him wait where's Frieza I thought for sure he'd be back at his ship with the Dragon Balls the captain didn't you brought him I'm sensing some massive energy over there that's gotta be Frieza over there oh we're in big trouble now that's where guru is well no freezes probably gonna force guru to tell him how to make a wish with the Dragon Balls yeah and once he's figured that out he's gonna kill guru for sure he doesn't know he won't be able to use the Dragon Balls if guru dies what that settles it Krillin and Gohan you to get the Dragon Balls me and Vegeta go stop Frieza right and if we don't hurry guru is done for we have to find boma and get the dragon radar yeah good idea good luck guys and be careful come on Vegeta let's go we're gonna go greet those din you guys fine you [Music] a lot stronger now that you've recovered from a near-death experience so you know about that huh [Music] I could really go for some food right about now it's time to eat Kakarot [Music] [Music] you've got some real Koch in there there the cat was gonna make you pay for what you did really this is the guy huh his power levels around five thousand fists like we said make those things right absurd relying too much on your scanner as a rookie mistake don't be a fool most likely he has the ability to instantly increase his power from while I can tell I'd say his true power level is somewhere around sixty thousand fifty sixty thousand science don't have that much power hirama see this'll be an enjoyable battle the first in a long time all right let's do this Vegeta you take that smaller guy over there Kakarot and Kinue are more or less equal in terms of power if I'm lucky enough maybe the two of them might take each other out [Music] this is the end of a line for you farewell Vegeta here I go I guess he's probably [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] now your life [Music] [Music] No Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are you no no you can't be are you are you a super saiyan p'tina said something about that too I have no idea what you guys are talking about super saiyan gary warrior the only thing in the universe did even Lord Frieza is afraid of I don't know about that but what I do know is that I'd like to avoid fighting if I can so listen up just leave the planet I'm saying this for your own good right are you joking no I'm serious I don't want to kill you guys if I don't have to I've heard that the super saiyan is the ultimate warrior one that lives only for battle and bloodshed oh I get it you're not actually a Super Saiyan are you but be that as it may your power is still far greater than my own power [Laughter] what's funny Jase take my Scudder what are you doing that body of yours is pretty strong yes and I think I'll take it what what's going on what what am i doing all the way over there we've made a trade your body is mine now I can't here's just geared up right now back to the ship it's possible Lord Frieza may have returned already so this is why he damaged his own body it all makes sense now I'm in serious trouble if I don't hurry him wait no he's gonna meet up with Crillon and the others that's it guys wait a second even if I make it back to earth tgd probably wouldn't be all too happy seeing me the way I am right now [Music] he seems to have sniffed us out it won't be much longer until he's here you must gold in their unholy those Earthlings need you okay I understand but please don't die grand elder guru [Music] [Music] I suppose I let this one live there's no sense wasting my time with a single speck of dust [Music] what do you want greetings and salutations my name is Frieza and I've come to your humble little planet in search of the Dragon Balls fear not as I have already managed to gather all seven of them though it would seem I am unable to draw upon their power which is what brings me to the lot of you tell me what I must do in order to grant my wish I suggest you leave we have no intention of telling monsters like you I would be more forthcoming if I we although I do not intend to kill you I will use force if necessary there are two of you years I don't care which one of you it is but one of you will tell me fine if that's how it's going to be then we'll fight but no this [Music] grand elder guru the creator of the Dragon Balls resides here if you kill him the Dragon Balls will disappear as well hmm no my son you must hold him off as long as she can understood my lord I see but I'm curious don't you wonder if he'll still refuse to tell me what I need to know when he sees that you're about to die I won't go down as easy as you think but we're not grande Delta guru doesn't have much longer to live fighting here would only hasten his end oh very well then [Applause] oh my that's quite impressive you've somehow managed to raise your power level to 42,000 such a feat for the likes of you but just to give you a sense of scale allow me to inform you of what you're truly up against my power level you see is five hundred thirty thousand rest assured however I haven't the slightest intention of fighting you with my full power how kind of me [Music] [Music] where are the dragonballs they're either hidden somewhere or freezes holding on to them wherever they are those Earthlings are sure to find them with that contraption of theirs but before they get the chance I must mask my power they'll quickly realize I'm here otherwise this should work once those runs summoned that Shenron creature I'll kill them and get my wish granted it won't be long until I run into them I should change into a new battle suit while I have the chance [Music] ruin the dragonballs are over there gotcha let's go go on [Music] right fills our chance my dad's alright course he's alright he's go blush Vegeta's with it yeah that's true radar showing that the dragonballs aren't in the ship somewhere near it looks like no one's around now's our chance to look for the Dragon Balls so they actually buried them in the ground huh we've got all of them now ah so that's where they are hurry and summon that Shenron creature you fools once that thing makes an appearance I'll trash the kids and finally make my wish for immortality a runga appears oh here goes great come for Shenron and grant our wishes but nothing happened what's going on where's where Shin Ron maybe the phrase you use is different to summon him here yeah that's what the hell are those two doing joining so what's coming this way two of them and they got some wicked power one of them's that ginyu guy does does that mean my dad lost what that Goku did you beat gain you and before they dug up the Dragon Balls how did you do that what do you mean obviously we use the dragon radar a dragon radar so did you already make your wish well it's the craziest thing we tried to summon Shenron but it just won't work you know there's something different about you Goku I can't quite place it that's a Scouter isn't it why are you wearing one of those Goku Krillin that's not my dad go on what do you mean it's not your dad I don't know how to explain it but I know it's not him this body no longer belongs to that Saiyan I couldn't resist its power so I took it wait what did you say Wow you actually made it this far that's correct I am the mighty leader of the ginyu force captain ginyu no it can't be that's my dad he swapped bodies all this really complicates things go on drilling I know you do have what it takes to get rid of this guy hold anything back really let him have it I can't you're talking as if you think they can win remember this is your body yeah you're right about one thing yes that's my body not yours as long as my mind is separated from it you can't unleash the full power it's capable of you fool the great captain ginyu will not fall for such tricks let me join it if boy captain boy you totally make these lowlifes suffer trust me well then if you're looking for a fight why don't you try me on for size what the gia we win take you I think it's finally time to test this new body of mine out powered as long as my dad's night [Music] body shut up [Music] yeah you stand a chance against us [Music] no this can't be happening Jase couldn't have been defeated so easily you're next he's gonna do it [Music] dare you looks like I'm back to being me again what the hell just happened what was that just now that feels like my dad all right my dad he's back in his own body this time I'm taking for Gina's body oh he switches places with patina we're all done for not good now your body is mine Vegeta perfect [Applause] [Music] what just happened yes I did it I turned him into a frog [Laughter] [Music] tell me how to use the Dragon Balls tell me and I'll put an end to your suffering I may not be able to kill that elder of yours but you on the other hand are expendable consider this your final warning tell me how to grant my wish or die Dendi is on his way to meet the Earthlings he he's going to tell them how to use the Dragon Balls what what [Music] you [Music] a little worm from before us you you are merely wasting my time weren't you picking up a signal from the canoe Falls no all five of them couldn't tap they couldn't have all been defeated no something must have happened between Vegeta the Earthlings and the ginyu force and Dragon Balls I the old Mikey Frieza will be the only one to make any wishes not little light boards like this medical machine here it should put you back in prime condition before you know it oh and might as well give you some battle suits while we're at it that way you'll at least be somewhat protected battle suits you mean like that one I don't really like how it looks whoa this is crazy it's super lightweight it feels like I'm not wearing anything at all and these shoulder pads don't really get in the way we have all sorts of room to move go on we should head over to gurus place while Goku is recovering if we don't find out how to summon Shenron that we came all the way out here for nothing right let's get going go find out how to activate the Dragon Balls I am going to rest up before this fight with Frieza okay [Music] so we don't run into a curse [Music] [Music] [Music] how long it's gonna take for my dad to fully recover daddy no time so hopefully not too long someone's on the move that power it's did day gone what are you doing here yeah well we finally collected the Dragon Balls but we can't do anything with them so we thought we'd head to gurus place and ask him what to do I knew it this is perfect grand elder guru told me to find you two and tell you how to use the Dragon Balls you won't be able to make a wish unless you say it in the namekian language namekian huh I guess that would explain why it didn't work before we need to hurry grand elder guru doesn't have much time Frieza might be on his way here as we speak right oh yeah what about Vegeta he said he was gonna rest up right yeah he's probably still sleeping good we got to make sure we're extra stealthy on the way back [Music] made it so how's Vegeta [Music] ha he's still sleeping well he's been in his fair share of battles recently now's our chance to leave him here and go make our wishes we got to grab the Dragon Balls and make our way out of here without waking him up even if Shenron wakes him up we should still have enough time if we're far enough away all right it looks like Vegeta doesn't even know we're here yeah someone's coming this way they're super fast yeah hurry today do what you need to do to help us make our wishes and the sky it's getting dark let the Dragon Balls on earth [Music] state your wishes are so crunchy three wishes that are within my power whoa that namekian Shenron is one generous dragon hurry tell me your wishes before but you don't freezing out here oh right first ask him to bring back everyone on earth who was killed by the same person as a time what Oh No hmm it seems they could only wish back one person at a time hey let me talk to Gohan hurry okay okay place your hand on my shoulder to talk to him Thanks [Music] listen up and listen good okay I know what's going on there that first wish see yours use it to bring me back if I'm back then commie will be as well you have to trust me on this we can use the Dragon Balls on earth to resurrect everybody else we can bring them back yeah that's right I totally forgot about that and as for the second wish you have to make him send me to Namak I want to make that wretched Frieza suffer slowly for slaughtering my people I'm a lot stronger now thanks to the training I've done I know I can beat it you have to okay good for the third wish he wasn't [Music] call me piccolo what is this what in the world are you up to second wish please ask him to take piccolo the guy we just brought back and then warp straight here dynamic okay headroom up aa a quarter to stand on a thorough are so grab your second week so this is Planet Namek the home of my people it's not sure why but there's something familiar about it it's now's not the time to get emotional I need to find Gohan and the others I'm sensing a mass of energy in the distance oh it must be that monster Frieza I sense three huge powers near there they've got to be Gohan in the others I thought for sure Frieza was on his way here but what the hell is going on why is the dark outside there's no night on this planet what the hell is that monstrosity it's Dragon Balls and those twerps they're gone that beast must be the Shenron creature those two were talking about duh I can't believe they took the Dragon Balls right from under my nose damn them your second wish has been granted now stitch your final wish wait he Crandon our wish then where's piccolo well you did ask to have him sent to this planet but but you didn't say where did you want me to have him sent here no no what are we supposed to do girl oh you actually thought you can trick me you're going to pay for that how could you be so stupid get it through your head Frieza can't be defeated unless I'm immortal oh wait we get three wishes so that means there's still one left what are you doing go on well now that's what I like to hear now that make me immortal freezes already on his way here [Music] man we're out of options at this point hurry today grant Vegeta's wish I hate to admit it but he's our best shot at getting out of this mess okay I'll ask Perugia yes finally Frieza has no hope of beating me now even if I don't have the strength to beat him I'll eventually wear him down okay here goes what the Dragons disappeared and the Dragon Balls sir the stone grand elder guru he's gone he finally died what do you mean what about my immortality sorry oh no it's Frieza well you've really done it now haven't you you have destroyed my dream of attaining true immortality in the most spectacular fashion as for the lack of response from the ginyu force now I suppose I have you to blame I don't fully understand what has happened but this is a rather surprising turn of events how could I have foreseen the Dragon Balls turning to stone just as I was about to make my wish a reality I can only imagine Vegeta's disappointment though pales in comparison to my own this is a first to be sure no one has ever been foolish enough to make a mockery of me on such a grand scale I'm going to make your deaths long and painful none of you will escape my wrath but there to experience hell where we're doomed what is this power level there's no way we can beat someone like this of course did you really think three measly ads could defeat a dinosaur we can beat you there's enough power between the three of us to take you down the power level of those two keep rising and the kid still has a ton of untapped power ready to go not to mention I'm getting even closer to becoming your worst nightmare a Super Saiyan I grow tired of hearing about that preposterous myth please you are no Super Saiyan it's no myth I'm strong enough now to take on even that freakish transformation of yours transformation you see transformations what are you talking about Vegeta a small number of people throughout the universe have the ability to transform when needed some camouflage themselves with it while other beings use it to conserve their energy my transformation serves another purpose I'm afraid you see my power is so great that I struggled to contain it at times what did you just say he's bluffing relax he doesn't have that much power oh you think so you know I recall when I took over planet Vegeta I hadn't a need to transform in order to subdue you simian barbarians and your king that's right Vegeta your planet was nothing special not even your father I wouldn't be so cocky if I were you my father strength back then pales in comparison to mine now ah so it was freezer that destroyed the Saiyan planet go on transform show us what you really look like Frieza anywhere if you wish to die that badly then I'm more than happy to oblige you're in for a rare treat not many have had the privilege of seeing this form the power level it's it [Laughter] careful now this won't be like before and I won't be gentle perhaps you've noticed my massive increase in power in terms of power level I would say it's over 1 million what no way oh my you look rather scared Vegeta what's wrong you weren't expecting this for me to be this powerful damn you freeze out now then who shall I send to hell first [Music] [Music] [Music] Snow's right [Music] how surprising that little attack of yours just now actually managed to hurt but you are no match for me or you succeeded in doing is angering me further got no youth damn it so much for that plan of ours [Music] the energy from before is larger now fries appears to have finally made his move there's an energy nearby [Music] just like me must be namekian so you're the namekian the earthlings were talking about they got their wish it's good for them you seem to know a lot about what's going on you probably also know these Earthlings called me here to help them not to talk to the locals sorry but you're on your own but I don't know what kind of training you pull yourself through but your power it's unbelievable it's too bad it's not enough you you might have actually been able to take on Fraser if you recombined with your other half what you mean I could stand a chance against freeze if I fuse back together with commie is that what you're telling me that's right there was no match for Frieza but I got a sense of his power there's no way in hell I joined back with that dried up dolt besides then then fuse with me if you do you'll increase your power tenfold maybe more what is with you there's not much time but I only have a few moments left your mind will still be your own quickly place your hand on my body fine I'll do it make Frieza suffer for what he did to our people oh I'm planning on it [Music] [Applause] this this is unreal this power it's unbelievably incredible so this is way he was talking about I'm on my way go on [Music] you [Music] [Music] you
