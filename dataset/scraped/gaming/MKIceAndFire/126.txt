who can explain it better than me luis torres first arrested at age 11 for theft lived in foster homes since his mother died at age who the hell do you think you are i'm your second chance there's a chance to become more than your past a chance to become the hero that will save blacklist in the war against global risk you don't know anything about me lady you couldn't be more wrong i've seen your future torres global risk has too maddox didn't raid your town to kill some petty thief he's scared of what you will become he's scared of the weapon you will become the ghost what the hell no no screw you and your slideshow [ __ ] i'm gone didn't you wonder how you survived that crash i injected you with an experimental technology called nanodyne it's repaired the damage but it's quite unstable you'll be dead in a matter of weeks assuming that is we don't stabilize it first how dare you put something we don't know us i get that but this is a chance to do something meaningful don't tell me you've never wanted that i'm with you until i get fixed then i'm gone so how do i get fixed we'll get to that first we need to find you something to wear and show you how to use a weapon our mission is to steal an eoe from the global risk base this powerful energy source will both stabilize the nanodyne inside torres and provide a valuable resource against maddox in the coming war torrez may have refused to become our ghost but he'll assist us in this mission it's crucial the eoe is brought here for the operation the eores are kept in a secure vote except for when they're being created tonight [Music] foreign out [Music] tours and i will head to the eoe cora find the relay station and disable the electricity for us nicholas watch your six the rookie is gonna get us killed

mission let's move the eo is being charged in the station entrances at the other side of these transporters the switches aren't switching careful in there [Music] oh oh so how does your boss know my future is just some kind of fortune teller not exactly an old super computer called the cattle has created highly accurate predictions of the future which say i turn into this ghost soldier and that you saved blacklist from being utterly destroyed no pressure [Music] [Music] it's locked up time really you call that hacking listen you need to turn off the security system and faster is better i kind of have a thing about lasers oh yeah what kind of thing i kind of hate everything about that [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] i'm starting to understand your laser phobia there laces are off

happened to the eoe back there don't know science ain't my field but right now we need to focus on saving our team they're not my team [Music] you blacklist terrorists always forget how outclassed you are tell me what what's it like being an endangered species what's it like being a sociopathic prick uh take him to the prison to await execution rest of you search the area rats never travel alone mission is a bust we need to rescue nicholas what no i need to get an eoe to fix me [Music] open up [Music] logan [Music] drop your weapon [Music] i've always been caught and the eoe was destroyed what should i do damn it you need to find another ear meter as it's the yeah yeah i remember i'm detecting electrical surges at your position the eoe explosion must have blown these loose you said global risk had more eoes in a vault right where is it it's in their rng departments on the upper floors the security is considerable besides i always did work better alone so [Music] you have incoming yes [Music] keep going taurus [Music] uh no i'm going after another eoe fontaine told me fontaine doesn't listen torres we don't know what those eoes will do we should damn someone's coming

elevator behind the weapon it should take you to global risk's r d lab get the eoe from the vote there you global risk is ready for war as the catalyst predicted just as it predicted our savior the ghost it has to be you taurus i won't be your weapon stop asking have it your way i won't ask again get the eoe then we'll get you back to base [Music] [Music] ever since you had to call the law of mine down so you're under the impression that the eoe will save your life fontaine's messing with your head boy it's not your cure in fact there is no cure because there is no disease you've been food plain and simple oh making a run for it good makes the hunt much more interesting fontaine i have an eoe excellent return to base immediately so you lied to me the eoe won't fix the tech you put inside me will it you don't understand i'm going to kill maddox that's the only way to get global wrist off my tail for good uh [Music] [Music] oh my god [Music] but there's no room i won't wait any
