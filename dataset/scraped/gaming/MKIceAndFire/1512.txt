pardon with my friends it's hard but for them Colonels death signaled the end of their journey and the beginning of a new life on the shores of Lake Baikal for me the loss became a threshold between the order and my own life between duty and my dream to see Dad again and like Artyom before I chose to pursue my wild dream along the way I sometimes felt the trees ruins of Leaning wire posts vanishing behind just endless movie projected onto a ragged screen just for me only a late night viewer an empty theatre yes every morning the Sun rising dead ahead brought another change of scenery making sure that I was in fact give him closer to the Pacific one step at a time slowly but steadily no matter the obstacles on the way one day sitting in a recliner on my dad's porch it might actually be tempted to start a book about this yourself one day but not here not now I see the town that's to become my springboard for a leap across the ocean nice smell salt in the air if there

my happiness name's Tom nice to meet you too Tom the sheep yours follow me let's talk so where did you want to go San Diego one way California Oh truly a heaven on earth I say for the traffic in LA of course that was hell look man remind me what was the name of your baseball team Padres right our team used to play them often I'm from Seattle you know Mariners if you think any further check is an order nothing personal lance corporal these are tough times of course trust but verify exactly by the way Sam this is Glen my right-hand man he's in charge of the applied force department of my business here hello Sam watch in pre-op no Klim limbs boys couldn't invite you here at a better time the doctor flex the wind somewhat but still just look at that yeah had I stayed there I'd be halfway to Kansas by now not that I wanted to go there where do you want to go wait how about we have a good smoke and hear your story first and don't say no to a smoke even though there isn't much of a story really Middle East Afghanistan and Moscow I was on the embassy guard detail happened to be in the metro and [ __ ] hit the fan a lot of people survived there then you just sat in the tunnels for twenty years thinking we were the last people alive in the world I'll come a perimeter of jammers the leaders were in the know but kept it under wraps for twenty years but why haven't got a clue really friend of mine learned the truth with him the whole squad I was with we had to run across the continent we had a train at Lake Baikal we split I went further east and kept going until I ended up here if my dad is still alive he could still be waiting for my return he'd be over 70 now I haven't got much time I see so you're looking for someone to take you home yeah people don't just sail across the Pacific nowadays unlike the old times but I can take you there on this sub it's rather cool down count on your right Glen can I help somehow Tom and how did you get this submarine in the first place it's a long story perhaps just an executive summary well I am in a hurry but not to such an extent in that case I'll start from a farm oh by the way I almost nailed Tennessee sour mash here no proper aging of course the flavor is basically right what's a drink with us Clem felt bad you know but suit yourself of course to our meeting to our meeting Wow Curtis sure what did I tell ya so ready to listen now I'd been doing business here before the war and mainly on the international weapons market the locals had lots of money and opportunities but no connections and style whatsoever I came in Clem handled the relations with our local partners just before the war our enterprise was starting to gain momentum but then the bombs fell you can guess the rest yep our company had a competitive advantage though warehouses full of weapons and Clem's boys in charge of guarding those warehouses then we entered a phase of dynamic growth and a few years ago learned of a flourishing settlement here and the Divo stock the place was governed by the ex-captain you met before he didn't do a decent job of it I must admit but was not ready for the ongoing war against bandits oh that's what we offered to help with the captain took the deal and was not disappointed the Klim find a radical solution to the bandit problem yeah you can still see some hanging right and then we learned that the sub was operational all along and the captain never even thought of using this immense opportunity how is he supposed to use it obviously you're not a businessman but just like him naturally to everyone's benefit for so many years after the war mankind has been barely holding on to life because there was no force left to unite the survivors in pursuit of restoring the civilization but we we could create such a force a new state the true shining city on a hill to lead the whole world to new accomplishments to turn the apocalypse into a new beginning we won't even have to shoot just drop the anchor and view of any settlement open our missile ports and they will readily give us everything and accept our poun do you find this inelegant it would be just a statement of fact we are power here we are the force to lead everyone into the future I see so what are the captain's say oh he went ballistic and tried to get rid of us but when he saw his game was up for good he ran away which means you get to decide where to sail now right certainly there's just one slight problem the subs are right but it's reactors need to be refueled but only the X captain knows where to get the fuel rods and can control the procedure regrettably after our falling out he wouldn't even talk to us no matter what yeah a lot of things starting to make sense now great then I can offer you a deal Sam I'd like you to be our negotiator make that fossil understand if he helps us get the fuel we leave the settlement to him we'll find a better base in no time anyway of course he's also welcome to have all crew members who won't follow me and once we get the fuel San Diego will be our first destination deal deal Sam you'll need some protection is our burly man it'll send my best guys thanks Klem but I prefer working alone that's some true grit right there leave Sam be clam II can handle it whatever you say boss so we have a deal still if you are going to represent us in negotiations we'd better equip you to our standard a Klim please set Sam's radio to pick up our frequencies sure here now for the important part the map of the area it's as exact as it can be all things considered plus it shows all the captains hideouts we know of you should check those first done spasibo Klim well radios taken care of as for the rest of your gear and drop by the shooting range you'll be issued everything have some rest first though you had a long day thank you but I'd rather go now I prefer to strike iron while it's hot thanks Tom yes I'll be going now storms already over after all good luck rookie course just leave oh just leave ah bye I know you're clean Liam quietly boys [ __ ] up for good when they let him get away the captain himself where's the others what'd I do he survived he survived there and then he came here I certainly do tell them to be on the lookout for our guest how the Uncle Sam you're expected at the shooting range Moses orders it's that way cross the bridge hi American Oh Terry I think I got this time to check ignition this is ground control to Major Tom yeah your circuits dead there's something wrong damn it I knew I was forgetting something let's see if which works now engines on you really made the grade it's closed but why it's just closed this Y is a Klaus man closed for special service what the hell I only need to zero my gun in won't take long well it will just have to wait look I won't take long if I could I'd let you in but I have orders all right ha ha here's our guest come on in spasibo hey welcome you let him through wait didn't you hear the announcement this guy just came from America to see the boss oh [ __ ] how did he get here he was para dropped from the orbit all his stuff burned up on re-entry so the boss wants him to have our best gear to prove his hospitality oh damn that's so awesome I've been expecting you my name is daniela i'm tom's gunsmith the boss want you geared up ASAP sam so i'll cut straight to the chase first your universal detector there are mines all over the ruins so never leave home without it you can also detect spare parts weapons lots of things actually nice indeed now your new rifle this looks familiar but different it's a local make optimized for our home brands of incendiary ammo it accepts regular ball right just not the standard max don't want our idiots ruining their old rifles with the hot stuff thanks I'll take good care of it glad to hear that I guess you're all set now you can test it here my assistant has a couple of mags ready here good luck this one should not just feel familiar it's the real McCoy a 45 automatic straight from Tom's premium stock we've sold quite a few of its siblings here but this one's been fine-tuned to the max and hasn't seen a day abuse past its shakedown so it won't fail my mother what don't mind if I do simplify look I can appreciate art of shooting like nobody else here thanks for the show Thanks that was truly amazing here's your prize all in a day's work well I won't be holding you any longer good luck sir thanks Denny uh see you around sure did you get it up weapons zeroed in and all that stuff yep and everything's fine great good luck to you them [Music] lady but the game charge now just gives one man kisses everyone else the bandits outside take it all in you if they feel generous you get to die quick the cats are she takes his Cutlass see the deal to the air and make sure the final buyer treats us fair so what do we do now now we just wait for the cats man to come check out cargo good I can do that they're looking right at us very sure so he did let you pass after all not before wearing my patients theme like his black soul hello there are American gasps how'd they do I heard you saw the captain how is he don't answer I know it's tough for him if you see him again tell him tell him we haven't forgotten the thing he's done for us and we're ready to follow him anywhere we're still checking but yes there's definitely some missing many suspects yeah there's this clown maybe face she took off as soon as we came to check on him and locked himself up in his cabin the guys are trying to get him out I know him I always thought he was suspicious I will check up on them all right we'll carry on here so you don't like Tom's new direction look I know you're trying to provoke me but I'm best caring now so I'll just tell you straight I don't like Tom and his business stick but that's not what's killing me it's the way he took over it's the way he got rid of the captain and all the officers and it's clean and his goons that I hate I also think captain was right nooks mustn't be used no matter what and it's good that the subs are the fuel you can run to clear now and have his flunkies drag me away to his torture chamber there I said it now piss off you don't have to shout like that I'm not going to report you or anything Yeah right tell that to the others they already took away hello again American North feelings right no hard feelings great the boss told us to find a nice boat and he or she is looks nice enough just take the wheel and use the remote box like the stick on a car and you'll be fine we even stole the compass yeah don't leave it unattended though it's got your spirit inside also mind the inertia at full speed it takes some time to stop even if you switch to reverse and please bring her back in one piece yeah she has a lot of sentimental value for him I still can't believe we got one more American here sorry none of us really expected to see any American Seifert on so how's it going any progress no nice the [ __ ] got a good lock on this door you no matter we'll get him soon enough yeah I like your tail let's hear some more yeah I guess I'll stay and watch that get some popcorn it's gonna get really exciting when we open this parking lot well she's all yours good luck and calm seas to you goodbye Thanks let's put something educational on for a change friendship and cooperation damn San Diego but also major scientific cultural and political centers that it played major historical roles as a whole in our turbulent times when the Hydra of reactionary forces is once again raising its multiple heads we must make every effort to further strengthen the cultural friendship between buddy Vostok and San Diego we believe that friendly support and mutual understanding will undoubtedly replace hostility and distrust in international relations and the cooperation of our twin cities is a shining example of such understanding and an important milestone on the way dad I'll be home soon just wait a little longer [Music] [Music] oh my grafica jammed you again yes me Lance Corporal Samuel Taylor US Marine Corps well thank you Uncle Sam it was burning off ex-captain glad to meet you yet how'd you end up in this mess this is one of my ports usually the traps downstairs were enough the Fargo is here know well enough to stay away let's go before some more arrived stupid beasts you kill a bunch but they just keep coming help me move this you got it oh we did it which is a good sign means I'm alive so where was I ah yes then they banned it from the cinema decide to throw a party for the local gang bosses I think far enough ahead to chase a pack of uglies away from the ruins next door for extra security so the poor mutants arrived here and got sandwiched between the bandits and the other parks in the vicinity the only way open for them was off I could beat them but that Jam you're welcome I've been looking for you did you talk to Tom yeah he suggest sad eel yes he's fond of those all right my own personal Savior let's set sail come aboard we have a long way to go I'm over here Sam tell me at what happened here during the war doesn't look like the city took any direct hits so why is it in such a state the warheads fell into the sea all in I need you to lie my sub didn't even shoot all the targets were destroyed without our help we called the bench for orders but there was no reply the brace was hit naturally so we sailed here that's when the HQ was when we reach the city we couldn't recognize it it was even worse back then of course just the smell alone there were very few survivors and frankly we were surprised to find any we picked them up from the roofs organized somehow and ended up settling in the dock the place in the pretty cozy at least we had no problem with electricity with the reactors running and by the time they ran out of fuel we had a floating power station ready all this luxury ended up generating rumors so the Bandit started coming by to check us out finally one day Tom with an offer of uniting our forces and setting up an effective defense perimeter mmm that bastard sniper get out Dennis did he get you I'm fine keep your head down looks like we're safe did you see where he's shooting from I'll handle this later you stay here are you sure go get him there guys we're getting [ __ ] trout [Music] easy easy man I give up no I I see you are serious people going about your business so I won't give you any trouble anymore [Music] edie Sam here sniper neutralized this is a real price yeah who were those guys ah these are the bandits I told you about they came to make a profit by robbing or settlement to the dock but it didn't pan out I must give credit where credit is due but bastard Tom did bolster the defenses all right these losers have long since stopped trading a few years back they made one last attempt cream gave them a lesson they were so terrified they didn't even cut down bodies of their hind pals all over the ruins they couldn't read didn't have a place to go so they turned to traffic they catch mutants in the ruins those human-like ones they're beasts are dumb and shrewd but strong quite good for dragging cars or boats on the rivers turning wheels and stuff they don't eat much either so using them lets you save a bunch of fuel so the bandits catch them train them a little and then sell them off to traders those come from the south a couple of times a month the paying weapons ammo rice all the things you need for a decent life in the world they visit settlement too mostly buying restore generated engines and other machines our maintenance guys are real wizards after all oh and right fish too so that's the region's economy in a nutshell why did those trappers shoot us the whole city is divided between them he took a lot of fighting to define those borders so now they open fire at anyone approaching without proper insignia guarded turf wars the primeval edition you got it all right we're here Sam let's move this thing and I'll show you my backup base cool so care to tell me the essence of Tom's offer simple he offers to leave you the settlement along with everyone who won't follow him and what does he want he wants you to deliver fuel rods for the submarine come on in sir don't worry the lifts fine my friends and I took our time preparing this base there's a generator on the roof the staircase is just an emergency ate too many fog lives in the lower floors so the lifts no longer they just have to keep that generator boy so the guys didn't get caught back then after all but if they did they wouldn't talk what guys when Tom had shown his true colors my closest friends and I decided to refuel the soul and take her to see the plan was strictly need-to-know only Alex my XO and alex second torpedo officer and Volodya the life support guy were in they left to recon the field and stayed in contact for two weeks they found the Hume and we arranged for me to pick him up in the night but it was claims people who met me there and I barely escaped do you think they were captured I don't know but seeing claims people there was hardly a coincidence yeah and we're there come on in sir make yourself at home sell cake arrest there's a storm outside anyway Jeremie Sam what's your angle in all this mess I just want to go home ed nothing more and Tom said he'd give me a lift before starting the nuclear war all over again or after Sam the sub is a terrible weapon a weapon that was entrusted to me to protect my country not to be used in pirate raids or even something as Noble as creating the kingdom of heaven on earth can you see that I didn't use it in the last war so could anybody have any right to use it in any capacity now when we barely survived him after that one ed Thomas a reasonable man I don't think he goes so far as Tommy is first and foremost a businessman and he will get what he wants one way or another can't you see that his offer to let those who wouldn't follow him go is a threat what is going to happen to them should I choose not to bring him the fuel I think you're being too negative here really okay let's do it this way I ring him up you talk to him directly fine by me Tom Sam here the captain agrees to talk captain so far if we stretch the definition but that's besides the point even if I believe you I don't believe him did he tell you the three bandits are working for him I have no proof but the friends I left with went missing did he tell you anything about them said he was looking to them I had my doubts for quite some time already and now they're solidifying Polydor cannot carry double any longer once the fuel is here Glen will be taken care of anything else no just that we have a deal we do them I know I'm going to regret this but we do thank you for trusting him Sam I don't trust him not even for a second no matter what he says I can't trust it but but you have no choice exactly I really don't have a choice here then that generators out again let's go check it before we go let's do something about my knee it is swelling up already hmm sure thing yet do you have anything for the pain I don't drink really but I do have a crate of molotovs there moonshine and fish oil should do the trick I wish we had some food to chase the dream gown with Oh here wow that's a nice surprise all right no point in putting it off any longer now Cheers not so bad here you'll have some too are you sure yes I am come on let's get it boom disgusting all right I'm ready poly tars hold on your head oh I don't think it works let me catch my breath and get one for yourselves - Cheers still awful okay pull again put your back into it all right damn that was awful thanks for the leg I feel better already cheers Cheers I say let's not go anywhere tonight okay let's go check the generator he sure when my ex overseer shouts where the hell is my jet machine I think I got this pull that lever Sam I ain't gotta hear that what the music [Music] but we heard some music amen to that I definitely got started [Applause] [Music] here to tell me your story sure come on on vine sure why not when we bury the kernel I just knew I had to leave where's the snow dad it's waiting thanks for telling me self around the ropes by they're hard to take the deal and that bastard wants to save the world he's going to become a pirate with nukes that's it I don't know I don't think it's quite like that he has ideas I'm telling you Sam you're a nice guy I don't know he's not a madman I know but still to hell with him that strange [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but you like [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] Oh what happened and blind are we drinking you are not blind you're sleeping face down and stop shouting my head that's why I don't teach oh it's terrible but I feel better now you finish this it will help a bit okay if you say so okay while you're recovering let's go back to the conversation we had yesterday I don't know where that fuel is and it's not even that far in another ground submarine base the tunnels are half flooded but still accessible the entrance is in the naval HQ building radiations off-the-charts there go so I wouldn't even try without a protective suit this building used to be a fire department and I know they've had some suits in case of an accident with one of the swords now the place is overrun by bandits so it's not going to be a walk in the park I guess think you can handle it okay I guess some fresh air will do me good I'll go get those suits thank you Sam I'll be getting ready here too you should take the stairs down there and through the door oh I almost forgot while going downstairs could you reload the traps the mutants do visit this place from time to time I'll try to read there's one Molotov left take it there are many dead bandits on the Lord's floors they should have the materials for more if you needed to talk to you just give you something to think about I think you know what you're working directly under so you know him even better is bad news they do just bury people that cross them they do so that the bastards have enough bring them into this world yeah it's nice to be on their side you're right there the thing is the guys have been thinking while these two are together we're golden but what happens if they have a falling-out we don't have any say in anything of course once one of them comes out on top he's going to count everyone who didn't support them as enemies which means they're screwed so you understand who the hell are you named Sam I'm working for Tom I know you I saw you there so you are second American huh I heard you're supposed to be around well come here we'll show you what's what we aren't cold scouts for nothing after all so first of all beware of the batwing roaming about we haven't seen it just heard it and judging by shouts it's huge and angry as hell and probably its wounded thanks I'll keep that in mind next where did you need to go to the fire Depot you can see it from here the red building with a tower it's about half a klick from here as the crow flies right but you don't look like a crow it's close but it's gonna be hard to get that yeah close have it easy in these parts look that unfinished building from before the war you need to go through it that's the only way to the upper bog was a fire Depot's right now there's a gang that set up shop there though they used to do some slave trade but lately they switched to the latest thing and started catching those human-like mutants can you imagine that we've been at odds with them since forever and anyway they never liked strangers they're sure to open fire as soon as they see you don't expect the warning so try to remain unseen thank you I will what else have we got here ah here look this way now see that two-story tar-like building on that islet it used to be a police post before the war now it's taken over by a gang to complete mad lads with others busy catching the fugly is now like the others that business is on the rise over here you know what they have that is warehouse of sorts so there should be some good loot there that little island supposedly houses a cache of thoughts a few years back a new gang appeared in this town those were some crazy bastards but they were good they went and demanded tributes from gangster eyes their numbers and murdered everyone who didn't pay up they have trainings it's not like they also had gear like in the movies armed with guns each of them had night vision too they had a good run ended up controlling a huge swath of the ruins even with their numbers then the other gangs decided they had enough got together and smashed them completely so all that remains of them today are their caches marked by their sign a skull wearing night vision goggles so watch out for those why I bet all those places were looted long ago I wouldn't be so sure those guys do real show-offs each of their caches is like a puzzle box the chosen ones in the know are supposed to get it while random shows like us are not the boys did find hidden buttons opening doors a couple of times but all through sheer luck they never got the principle perhaps you get it after looking at the situation with your unbiased American eye I might you forgot the foggy ah yes watch out are not the eyelet with the cash the fog Lee's are especially large and tough there I have no idea why and I don't care but these large ones are in demand so the hunters don't clear them out they just catch a couple from time to time and leave the rest to repopulate got it so that's about it we've been told to observe and render assistance if needed we told you what we know that should count thanks guys good luck here [Applause] my Weather Service reports a storm ruling again so it search for a place to hide if I were you thank you Tom [Music] [Music] are you talking to me is totally cuckoo these things I got to take over his share of our business we own a car dealership right to drive you slip on these cars best quality we built a booming business from scratch and he went mad we even shared 1/4 safe box he knows half I know we have to be proud of fact sure an accountant and Gellin know both halves otherwise we both always have to stay at office but we trusted each other do you understand and then the apps were kicked me out and took my half of the business reducing me to eating these racks shut the [ __ ] up not only that he also went off his rocker says it's me who's taking over nothing can you believe that I want to bring him back to his senses I want someone to find out his half of the code sneak into the dealership take the papers from the safe box and bring them to me so that I could show him he was listed as the owner there and prove it was him who kicked me out not the other way around maybe his sanity back okay listen my half of cold-eeze one for just one piece of the code and get with those people [Applause] giving huge subfactor to make them and for these [ __ ] knees I would never believe it if somebody told me what I could use that yeah a dog is man's best friend but keeping these pets thank you very much but the [ __ ] hey oh look I've been thinking here you don't top of that thing ain't you so you're sitting on the top of a tall tower and frankly you're not too nice so you know what that makes you it makes you a dick on a stick shoot your ass doctor oh oh I'm done for guys if I don't come back you all know who is to blame for my untimely death [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] moonshine to their sonar operator that guy the President appeared Oh like just like before the war and said don't you dare open fire on our strategic partners and sub just turn Big O that's how they found out that the president was a lizard man Wow that's how it goes you heard the one about cores and the plane no so one scourge was take himself out to sea by a really bad storm with the storm over he went about making sail when he saw plane leaving a trail course started shouting and pointing at it but he only had be hordes with him that time so they didn't even get what that was of course what is that a plane a huge one that there imagine how much fuel it needs I believe a ship but the plane well it's up to you to believe it or not there was a seaborne gang and one day they got a huge ship just drifting along roasted it was dead silent they boarded it and found lots of stuff canned meat crackers clothes anything you could imagine about the dead crew and the crew all but still manning their stations as if they died while working and never even noticing yet the guys should have understood something was fishy there when they saw the reaches they lost all caution split and started jamming their backs with stuff the youngest of them went up to the bridge stations just like the rest of the ship the captain was standing there too and heard something rustle back and saw that the dead sailors was this deadly where they were but not quite in the same losses they all were facing him stretching their arms towards him I would have [ __ ] myself right there that's what he did and then he leant back he reached their boat and called out to the rest of the guys but got no answer he thought he should go look for them but heard rustling again and saw a dead guy standing right next to him like he was always there and so you know the Sun was already going down so the boy without taking his eyes off the dead guy tied the rope around his waist and left overboard into the boat she was down and cut the rope loose it was yanked up there switch to full steam ahead I think the captain was short on hands so he just bought them to screw that way things happening at sea yeah tell me about it I'm still thinking about that story of yours which one about the powers the other about course and it's plain if they do have planes out there in the south why didn't they use them to come here just look around and you had a plane would you want to come here you'd use it to get as far from here as humanly possible [Music] let I have this [Music] [Music] Edie Sam here I have the suits got a show at the HQ building Sam out [Applause] [Music] observation journal you are most important spotted the s cap armed heading east hasn't noticed us we updated the base and are waiting for the hunters for he's getting away we gotta act let's get him with a pincer movement just the two of us is enough some said it clearly we must wait for the hunters Tom always Tom soon you know a curiosity Jesus order to he didn't put everything exactly we should have called commune he was saying orders nor exert wind wave which is crap yeah your darling claim would have told you get him we'll all have your head end of story the captain isn't your average Joe what would you do if he gave us the slip you're just a coward that's all you and your Tom you must take risk so you want to achieve anything Yeah right explain to me then why the scheme work for Tom and why do you work for me yeah we'll see about that you'll see watch the captain you idiot I'll [ __ ] you up if you lose him we will see you both heard now I wasted the tape because of you [Music] edie Sam again I'm in position Roger that ed Sam out as soon as you left the whole core Dubuque is decided to crash my party yeah these parts are dangerous yeah that's right here's you sue that Thanks I better put it on the right now hold on to this I'll be quick how did it go good I still put it down in regulation time so are you ready to enter the lair of the beast always ready how do we get there we can take the boat right to the spot the access tunnel is half loaded we'll have to open a few gates though so we'll need to split up at the entrance he was the bunker plan I marked everything I know on at the spot we load the rods on the boat and make our best speed out we'll take a shortcut this eternal goddess we expect any hostels just observe spiders what was that huge freaking spiders they accumulate electric charge and hit you with it they can also switch off lamps stop motors but if you chase them away everything comes back online getting them is hard but in silly areas worked wonders spasibo just what the world needs more kinds of huge freaking spiders here welcome well well here Sam see that gate first of all we need to turn the backup power on using the panel in the garden that should be enough for the lights and the electric
