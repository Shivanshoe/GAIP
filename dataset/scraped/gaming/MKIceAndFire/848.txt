so ah uh what is it you do here again we're fishermen my granddad and me and we could help with anything you need bring us fish you find out there and we'll pay you for them but if i'm being honest we can't do a thing until we have a place to work if you've got time we'd love it if you could build something i have to go see you soon come visit again soon always nice to see a friendly face so if you see any about send them my way what do you have to have you got a contract for me finally someone reliable to get some serious work done monsters i do it myself i must take my leave go with your god here this marks fewer members of the order ah good i hope this one did not give you too much trouble as a token of my deep gratitude i want you to have this keep this up i have to go then go in peace tell me about what you do here if you want to deal with your raiders you come through me i'll make sure they're ready for you and keep them in fighting shape you need to build some barracks otherwise these raiders are going to get soft and we can't have that goodbye award [Music] foreign [Music] now i can build the most vicious crew ever to sail the rivers of england and arrival i wonder if bulkers among them our warriors now have a place to rest and train a fine shelter it is when work gets out it should attract many young suicide to fight with us which reminds me a few of your raiders are jumping at the bit in hope of becoming your second you ought to pick one [Music] there you go okay i would like to reorgan all right done i'm all with my blade at your side all will fear are wrath brave with me warrior for plunder glory and valhalla i would like bed [Music] thank you a4 this this is the place we needed dory and i have some new designs what have you got for me today [Music] [Music] all right if you're done so long that is actually a very good idea you look what word of our growing settlement has reached outside ears so have a look around you may see a few new faces we are allied with the danes of grand bridge shire there ya'lls gonna soma has pledged an oath well done a war these early victories will pay off well they will in more than one way one of soma's finest fighters vietnam has pledged her blade to us she's a powerful fighter and a charming spirit i think she'll fit in nicely glad to have her good work [Music] at one time the title yarl referred to a man second only to the king but that use has softened now a yarl may be a chief a leader or a man with broad wealth and influence the world is bigger now and broken into many pieces it seems our language must do the same to keep up an interesting thought jail bed your father sent you here to learn not teach then you must start avor give us a summary of our recent gains for instance the clan is thirsty for knowledge you want me to give a speech my friends hearken to me and hear a tale of triumph and toil i have traveled far since we landed and seen much on the roads and fields of this new england and for all my travels strong alliances have we gained the honorable chairwolf king of mercy and our caught his friend and to the south somayal's corner and the danes of grand bridge have pledged their oath to us by sigurd's hand and my own we have strengthened the ties of you seat yourself as secret equal in these tales of yours would sigur do the same if he were here secret knows what i have achieved and he was celebrated more roundly than i have but this takes nothing from you all of you for i sit among some of the staunchest wills and strongest fighters i have ever known and so i raised my horn first a cigarette may he return to us soon and to the raven clan the best of friends and fighters to sigurd to siegel may he return and relieve us of you and may all of you enjoy the ale as much as dick has skull you think me drunk avor would it soften my blows if i was your words are blunt enough but it would explain your boldness my eyes are clear and open and i see before me one eager to claim a piece of sigurd's glory there's enough glory in the world to go around for all who earn it and i have no doubt how much i am owed just as i thought your attackers from the river they look to be danes stains how many too many now come the battle roar is already bloody curse what quarrel have danes with us those who can fight take up your weapons all others stay here with me there is nothing for you here but death shut up paid them [Music] does this stir your thirst for battle randry is that the last of them the rivers are clear if more were coming they thought better of it by their colors and markings i believe they come from gitland are there none left alive to spill their secrets we may never know why here is one this vermin was crawling to the river hoping to float away ah have mercy friend and you may find an ally with us mercy is earned by the quickness of your tongue where do you come from and what is your quarrel with us we are settled in east anglia newly arrived and hungry for silver you drifted off course this is mercia as we were ordered by whom you bore me useless hound scratching your ass in search of silver put an end to this one your silence earned you no kindness geet so i'll ask you once more who sent you the wind sent us and the rivers will take us home he begs for death evor give it to him or send him home with a warning let him tell his people what death awaits them should they sail this way again go and do not return i thank you this is not mercy it is death deferred whoever sent you warned them of the slaughter that awaits should any return oh what tales i will tell send one of your scouts to follow him you will find to show mercy would endanger us soil our reputation as cowards this was the only end possible we could have learned something by tracking him now we know nothing sigurd would have actually decided that is all the justification i need security is not here to make such a call but i am and if you cross me again you will know about it i see you avor and i know what you are [Music] put no stock in what dag says his blaster may be loud but it blows softly get this cleaned up and we'll talk of next steps [Music] looks like i have a new letter good day avor gilbert are you well i am but i wish i could have risen to the challenge but before us instead of just hiding here in the longhouse you were exactly where you needed to be defending the people and yourself i know i just our forces outside were sufficient and your father would have many unkind words for me if anything had happened to you i know i only wish my father's long shadow didn't darken my prospects here i want to learn from you not watch you i have no doubt next time then i want to see the alliance map those dane invaders they came from east anglia is that right yes dane invaders who serve a man called ruid he seems to be sowing discord among saxons and friendly danes alike years ago the sons of ragnar hoped to pacify the land they appointed a steward named finner to find a suitable saxon king but the kingdom has fallen into ruins since with no king and violent raiders ravaging what little peace remains i suggest you make for east anglia and find out what their steward is doing wrong i will make the trip east and speak to this vineyard myself a good plan [Music] so [Music] all right if you're done so long [Music] they will attack on site [Music] uh show me what lies ahead [Music] so [Music] stop i wish my life had been a carnival of drinking a hill and pissing it could have been i'm sure no we have not reached such a point i used the order to live a life of ale drinking but the price of my ale was murder sad really keep your eyes open will likely hear about this before [Music] whoops so uh avor what a pleasure to see you oh dear it feels like it's been so long welcome my friend you're most welcome here are you well better than well i am present and your mother my mother has found her peace at last she walks through a world seen only in dreams and will forevermore that is all any of us can hope for indeed come how was your passage exhilarating the waves and the wind were with us from the start we flew like sea birds and how are you in spite of your stoic look there is a brightness in your eyes that warms me it may be a kind of hope a settlement is growing the people are happy and i am looking forward to more and your visions they come and go but leave all that aside let me help you with your things this way we found a fine spot for you at the foot of the hill every hour we traveled i tried to contour in my mind some vision of this place and how close were you i saw the trees and the water and the rolling hill but i could not foresee so much green it is a magnificent and calming color a bound for sea salted eyes welcome godzilla what brings you hope there isn't a curse on the settlement or some such the only curse on this place is their great loud of a blacksmith it is a rare feeling to travel across the sea and still find oneself at home this place feels powerful alive do you foresee great things for us no need for foresight i feel it in my heart is that vulca i see what took you so long to follow wanted to ensure the place was up to snuff we must talk again soon randy once i'm settled and before my arms fall off what is this i'm carrying my heaviest reagents of course let whale whalebone flux of gold put this one to honest work that is what i like to see all these people you have brought here this life you have built on these stranger shores does it please you it does to know that i've built this place and kept these people safe it's a gift you speak first of yourself when i ask this question which says more than you intend i think good day and who is that fellow octavian a strange man i think you'll like him you see there your home is just ahead tell me about your visions they are as they've always been little has changed save their clarity with every return the things i see feel less like dreams and more like memories and thus the all fathers still appear before you from time to time yes he speaks to me as well but it feels mad to say such things aloud i understand you can put those just there thank you this we do thank you anything to help you feel at home i am most at home helping others may we return to the subject of your visions we could if you think it worth something i need one more ingredient to finish an elixir for you look around the pond there you will find what i require once brewed this elixir will help you dive deeper into your visions to see them more clearly so in my eyes too guide me so foreign i have the plans you need good good once added to the elixir it will be ready to drink in taking this you will have access to the all father's wisdom you will walk the path of odinn and live as he lived so long ago prepare yourself for a journey into another time another plane the elixir is ready it will taste like misery itself but it will open your mind to the sights and sounds of the nine worlds so [Music] huh [Music] oh the prophecies of the nordia are as clear as daylight the ac are doomed all asgard is doomed repeat the last passage brothers will fight one another and kill one another the home of the gods turns red with gore it will be an age of storms an age of walls not this further along the foretelling of a wolf a great beast the wolf fenrir howls terribly before the gates to hell the beast will break its ponds and run and my part what about me then comes the second great sorrow when the harvey goes to fight the wolf and falls to fendrik and falls to fenrir it's there you see you have foretold my death your harvey will die we speak what we see we know your fate your destiny have you cleaned enough a wise one you three spin our destinies as a thread in fabric but threads may be unraveled by snags and catches not all can be foreseen but loose threads can be rewoven or restrung at this end the tapestry will be preserved i am no string to be plucked or tied i am the high one the lord of ecstasy the enemy of the wolf i am eternal rittled words only cloud my thoughts a storm is brewing not in the clouds but down below does our final battle draw near is this how ragnarok begins [Music] [Music] the heart must devise a strategy to deal with these invaders thor you cannot smash your way out of certain deaths who crushed a skull of trimmer king it is our future we must decide you don't decide the future you strangle it fine i will hunt down these invaders to the ends of asgard if i must and leave our halls undefended without your hammer we'll soon be overrun more danger more glory who is balls we are as guardians we don't skulk around like elves we fight we are fighting for our homes for our people but some problems can't be solved with the hard end of a hammer name one harvey break our stalemate what is this another invasion warriors from huertenheim they attack from all fronts while we sit on our trembling hands and scratch our bums not so thor many asia have been sent to the four corners of asgard leaving we four to defend the great hall javi lend me a score of your warriors and i will lead them into jotunheim myself we cannot afford such a loss the ain harrier must hold back to defend our city i would bring them here to hold the great hall itself this invasion is too large to spread ourselves around all this prattle solves nothing battle or death silence all of you who will take the fight to the enemy before they cross the beef rust well said raven feeder name those who may fight beside you i need only one you thor lord of thunder together we'll [ __ ] the enemy before they grow too bold browse every warrior who can hold axe or hammer we're hunting their heads the rest of you stay back to protect the great hall were any creatures among the jottner drago trolls or wolves what troubles you heavy does your far side tell you something more invaders they gather at the defrost bridge where's loki he should be guarding that door warn the others the fight begins [Music] here is the battle you died to attain for heavy and for asgard [Applause] welcome to your doom lead us to glory heavy with me i give this battle to myself we will drown our enemies in blood hello [Music] go uh uh look at that all right you're finished cut them down uh uh you break too easily i must wow [Music] so loki was charged with guarding this gate wait no you're you're mistaken i was only passing through from one land to another would your song be the same if the yacht now had won this fight yes of course of course are you calling me a liar harvey i found this one lurking in the shade shying from battle shall i extract some teeth to get him talking or pluck out an eye you were told to guard this portal loki what happened the portal opened and these soldiers came bleeding through so i sent warnings straight away and i captured this one the soggy child sheepherder [Music] what is your name stranger i am called the builder by most he wants your name not your trade if i have another name it's not within my memory filter it's been for as long as i've been building things do you come from johtenhand i do or i did that is to say i passed through but i am not off that place which pleases me well for i hated it had you any dealings there as a builder yes for a time but they took a dislike to my methods which are shall i say magical in nature hurry when someone gives you a horse you ride it i put a bridle on this one [Music] is that right builder are you a gift host or a secret curse neither i won i am only a tool one with hopes to be well used this portal has been a source of misery for some time i want it sealed with respect this is not the only way the yetna can enter asgard may i propose a more encompassing solution quite a coincidence that you came when you did at the tail end of a brutal attack that i came when i did was by design i have been among your enemies for so long i know how they hunker for your demise if you doubt me i could offer a demonstration demonstration yes and if he fails to impress we hoist his skin as a sail i'll accept these terms with the last condition i would need water from your well of what you know of our sacred well it's a place of great power and vital magic a source of spirit it's the water there that will power your shield i'll collect the water harvey keep this one clear of our sacred sites loki halt i will go to the well you must find this builder clearing for his display no no it's no trouble harvey the damp in the dark appealed to me go with the builder then return to the great hall with news of our next step as you command an interesting offer a curious [Music] coincidence you
