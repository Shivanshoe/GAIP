[Applause] you have arrived at your destination you got here just in time the university is working on an improved gps but the street racers say it will never be as good as local knowledge i've programmed the route using ana but you're going to try to find shortcuts i'll watch the telemetry and evaluate it using an efficiency algorithm does that make sense tech versus god oh speaking of gods has been working on the gr supra yeah i noticed again again much faster i'd be able to shave up a few seconds [Music] [Music] [Music] according to the telemetry and my efficiency algorithm that was a lot of fun especially street racers have their shortcuts but without gps technology there'd be nothing to compare well i'll let you get back to the streets adios i i try not to take sides [Music]
