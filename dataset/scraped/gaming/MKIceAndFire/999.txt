utah resident did you feel an earthquake this morning the united states geological survey measured a 4.1 quake just to the west of the escalante desert advanced idea mechanics who has a factory near the earthquake's epicenter reported no injuries or property damage they dismissed persistent online reports that they were testing experimental explosives as baseless conspiracy theories [Music] all right that is more like it doesn't look amazing jarvis take my picture well done sir finally feeling like my old self along with the fabrication machine i've managed to route power to various other areas including the inventory vault i'm detecting some old equipment in your vault sir should i incinerate it what no that's not trash jarvis it's my stuff i'll go take a look as you wish see not trash indeed i'm sure you'll use this to store many more treasures so representatives from our friends at shield are now aboard the chimera agent morales is in the command nest she may be able to help with the parts needed for the ship great look forward to meeting her hey avenger i got a job for you hey there i was told shield was in the house i'm agent ellis sunday morales i'll be your point of contact for shield day to day if you ever have any spare cycles come see me there's plenty that needs doing very nice to meet you morales i need to find some parts to get this old girl in the air maybe i can kill two birds with one stone help out my old shield pals while i'm at it here's the info we have hopefully it's enough i knew we could count on you excellent thank you you'll help seriously this is really going to make a difference good work keep this up and i might start sleeping a new shield representative has joined us and is now stationed in the commons area we need all the help we can get against aim so thanks hello avenger ready for the new you think of me as your second closet isn't that one amazing so worth it agent levine is on the hanger deck if you have a moment he can likely assist in further upgrades of your equipment oh my gosh hey there avenger ah darned maybe next time so my heat signatures scans have detected two potential sources of initiator cause potential wide potential unfortunately due to aim security systems determining the actual source of the heat signatures at this range is impossible uh another word i don't like okay and we double our chances bruce kamala meet me at the war table we're on our way how do i look kid presentable no charming you cleaned up nice smell a lot better too ouch i was hoping for a better first impression oh no it was pretty good you earned a lot of points with that scrappy suit stunt wait you liked me the first time we met what does it take to get on your bad side well tarleton and monica tried to kidnap me hulk chased me through the chimera and oh uh bruce took my blood while i was unconscious okay important life lesson write this down hang out with people who have low expectations very funny you too still can't believe they found this thing miss you buddy the big guy's looking a little peaked something going on with him it's complicated i can whistle and do multi-variable integrals in my head at the same time man try me uh long story short cap's death really affected polk wait are you saying the big guy is depressed unstable confused um not as focused okay let's keep an eye on that situation um all right guys we've got work to do nice suit touche how can we help jarvis has found a couple heat signatures that might be concentrations of initiator cores but they're in completely separate locations since time is of the essence we're going to need to hit both locations simultaneously bruce you and kamala need to search the outskirts of the badlands while i investigate a city on the eastern seaboard hopefully one of these spots yield us those initiator cores you got it jarvis how much longer approaching the location shortly sir great we've got to find those initiator cores and get back to fixing it's only a matter of time before aim pinpoints the chimera's location and we need our base of operations up and running oh i look so good in this suit dashing sir you are right where is everyone seems aim has evacuated the city due to heavy inhuman activity sounds like an excuse to experiment on dangerous technology maybe your heat signature hunch was right a giant stash of initiator cores could power their experiments the facility is heavily guarded expect resistance upon your arrival you mean they won't be happy to see me shocking this place is a ghost town jarvis how far is the facility a few meters up ahead please evacuate the area a shield ally is in trouble nearby needs your help alright [Music] civilians evacuation began this morning good we can't let anyone get hurt this time uh tarleton was all about clean energy but i'm gonna bet monica was involved with this somehow she handled the redistribution of stock assets within aim save better there is an elite aim unit near you defeat them and you may gain something useful emergency status has increased to a code red [Music] hover scout platforms is there anything didn't steal from me right now meltdown uh 10. drop everything as easy let's me [Music] ah everything uh is here times [Music] uh stay in range of the junction and keep aim away i'm through the first firewall so i'm nearly there huh huh [Music] huh finally so now that i've reached the ames security systems my improved readings of the heat signature suggest that this may in fact be a much larger power source so not initiate a course it's difficult to say but our detected intrusion has caused aim to initiate a self-destruct sequence and based on the size of the heat signature let me guess it could level a few blocks that is correct sir well aims not destroying another city on my watch [Music] okay let's see what all the fuss is about shall we you can assume it will be well protected no welcome banners [Music] yes [Music] whatever's behind these [Music] oh no not good not good at all this is my arc reactor technology but super sized this could lead to cities what is aim thinking oh hello there handsome so the reactors are becoming increasingly unstable you must shut it down taking out those amplifiers thank you good job one of these days would not come unappreciated ah almost done we get out of this place congratulations you've successfully destroyed the ark reactor well that's not something i ever expected to hear you say let's salvage what we can and get out of here are you all right yeah yeah just you know i made it for all the right reasons that's what i told myself look at what happened the terrigen reactor aiding now this i can't control what other people do with my tech but i can't pretend it's out of my hands anymore i'm proud of you sir yeah proud of me too speaking of trouble bruce kamala any luck with those initiator cores uh working on it [Music] tony we've been searching for hours but there's one area i've been avoiding we're just about there it's a bit of a hotbed frame activity i'm gonna have to bring out the big guy [Music] okay kids counting on you finding this second heat signature hopefully it yields us a bounty of initiator cores it won't be long till lane pinpoints the location of the chimera and without a base of operations yeah well we won't have much of a chance so don't let me down and good luck um that's a lot of pressure no it's yeah definitely okay i can't let mr stark down jarvis where should i start the second heat signature has a few scattered spots surrounding a rather large center suggesting a significant concentration of potential initiator cores it must be stored in a single location the structure perhaps got it there is a chest with gear close by got eyes on anything all clear here hey i've seen that symbol before this is a memorial in honor of those who gave their lives for the resistance they were here i know not the mission alpha bravo and charlie teams go dark for now stay off this channel unless you find the targets huh again jarvis yes miss khan is it me or is the hulk not his bright green self it appears dr banner has been struggling with the passing of our beloved captain ms khan from his recorded memo he returned to chimera determined to solve the events of a day but instead grew more frustrated with his perceived failings of course bruce feels guilty it seems they all do miss khan anyone feel the ground shaking is that what i think it is [Music] uh there's a chest with special resources [Music] ugh ugh huh [Music] you're approaching more aim equipment hopefully behind we need no course here then let us keep searching position uh uh [Music] huh uh oh uh they burnt out the core you're trying to destroy as many as possible then we must hurry oh a radical anti-superhero organization cool thank huh [Music] oh do it uh here we go [Music] ah [Music] huh we have scavenged every part of this desert by now hey it's not gonna be enough am i alone what where are all the other inhumans why aren't they fighting back i i've seen the resistance symbols i've heard rumors of a rebellion but still nothing i don't feel sick at all i've never felt more alive what if i'm wrong i know what that feels like these powers are part of us and all i do know it's a lot better if you just embrace [Music] that or something like that my dad used to say the same thing hell he's a more guy [Music] the best he said head back to the chimera okay stay where you are come on man a kid and an old guy right dr pim we'll see you now hank pym hank bruce what are you doing out here gonna ask you the same thing oh that's good to see you mancy uh kamala this is dr hank pym ant-man that was uh another life follow me okay so this is the heat signature we've been searching for we have been salvaging weapons robots aim tech anything we can to build up our defenses think you could spare some of these initiator cores you know help out a helicarrier in need of some tlc i imagine we can make some arrangements thank you very much what is this place we call it the ant hill oh not my idea i think it was one of our anonymous hackers tiny dancer no way so so they're all inhumans yes many of them were prisoners at a name facility i guess they were fighting back after all make yourself at home we've got lots of [Music] ketchup you
