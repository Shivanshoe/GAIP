our enemy is on the run you have done well titan squadron but in order to stop them i need you to break off from the overseer and fly ahead of the enemy fleet to set a trap lt 514's calculations indicate that the remains of the nadiri fleet is attempting to reach the new republic capital of chandrala to do so they must navigate the junkyard of scrapped imperial ships they've been using to build that monstrous star hawk poetic isn't it we've detected several reactor cores in the junkyard titan fly ahead of their fleet and use the cause to create a minefield on their path active cores will detonate when shot and devastate any ships nearby that includes you wield disadvantage cautiously destroy any republic star fighters attempting to scout the dangers of the debris field your ties alone may struggle against the fleet's larger ships detonate the cause to take them out if all goes according to plan the starhawk will either be destroyed in your minefield or be forced to divert into the deadly ringali nebula either way we win i trust you see the wisdom in our strategy come now even damaged the rebel fleet still presents a legitimate threat we can't simply attack it in the open to exposed exactly sabotage is the answer we pick the fleet apart thinned their numbers and leave the starhawk right where we want it defenseless precisely if all goes to plan you and the rest of titan squadron will have a clear run at the starhawk lyndon james and the vanguard ah yes vanguard squadron continues to be a vexing anomaly in my calculations a problem you two are happily well positioned to correct good luck i'll be monitoring you from here i don't know how you can be so calm i've never been more ready for a mission in my life good ride the adrenaline but remember yes farco don't die you've said it a hundred times none of us are replaceable actually i was going to say i need you alive because if our plan works there's a good chance we'll be fighting the starhawk in the middle of a nebula if that's how this ends then i want that good old von rig fury covering our backs we came so close at nadiri and they slipped through our fingers not again not today pace yourself make sure that fire's there when i need it can we just get started for this mission you're otherwise to fly a thai bomber or a thai reaper [Music] [Applause] overseer titan is outbound and advancing ahead of the enemy fleet excellent dismantle their fleet in the debris field they'll die here or divert the starhawk into the ringali nebula squadron on me we're approaching the junkyard now this isn't just a junkyard vodka it's an imperial graveyard how many different destroyers do you think they left out here and what did the republic do to their crews it doesn't matter we can't change what happened all we can do now is deliver vengeance before we're done today this will be a rebel graveyard too overseer we've reached the target destination the enemy is advancing as expected you have time to prepare our trap copy that let's find those reactor cores and the rest are useless duds understood [Applause] that core isn't active so it's useless to us destroy it and move on [Applause] how exactly are we bringing these cores to explode we're not the active cores are volatile it only takes a few shots to detonate them so the rebels inadvertently created their own minefield i love it explosive core located inactive that one's useless the proximity sensors on active cores will alert us to enemies in range of our explosives if you hear the alarm a ship is inside the kill zone that's when we attack the cause and detonate active core located stray shots could cost us our calls precision above all else pilots souls right titan three let's cut down these fighters attack that target titan engage that target fire on my target what's behind enemies fire on my target thank you later then we need to pick up the pace i'm here let's go yes fire on my target that's the last of the fighters like moose to the slaughter corvette's inbound regroup and be ready to strike detonate the cause precision above all else their fleets must not reach chandrila nice safe look at that crack sharp titan the strategy is working perfectly we're with you this is the fun part foreign let's get more aggressive enemy destroyed another convoy is inbound we don't have much time to re-arm our minefield it's like this that will do nicely perfect enemy fighters have arrived hunt them down good find no good that one is active you're welcome thank you here i am couldn't have done it without you all that swings destroyed the cores are safe another convoy of corvettes have arrived tighten regroup and prepare for the ambush we're ready wait better they're only offensive lucky i was here let's get this done attack taking damage only one regroup these fools they underestimate imperial superiority superior strength superior ingenuity the starhawk couldn't cross this field without knowing what it was flying into if the new republic is willing to sacrifice this much what does that tell you about the value of the starhawk they're going to be devastated when we destroy it stand by reloading you're too close to the core to ensure it's active confirmed [Music] this is our last chance titan 3 [Music] they're almost here get ready the frigate is almost in range of the cluster someone picks me up leave it to me wait for the right moment then give him hell titan three nicely done friggin destroyed that's an understatement overseer what's the situation return to the overseer for refueling we have them right where we want them the star hawk is changing course they're terrified of you titan squadron we've diverted the rebels towards the ringali nebula this is where lyndon james and his wretched starhawk will die [Music] but no matter what path we took we'd lose the fleet i know it so the commander took ardo's second choice we're heading into the ringali nebula no long distance coms sensors are almost dark it's a gamble but it's better than no chance at all when those missiles hit us back at the dockyards i thought the temperance was done for full shields and they still almost tore us apart but we got tarisa and titan squadron to chase us instead of destroying the dairy for good that's what matters our next steps are unclear like walking into fog better get to the briefing room let me speak plainly vanguard squadron we're in trouble we have the overseer behind us and imperial reinforcements moving to cut us off there's no way we'll fend them off we need to send a distress call to our allies in the new republic and hope they can reach us in time the problem is we're wounded outnumbered and the ringali nebula is already disrupting our long-distance communications luckily general sindullah has located an old broadcast hub that once orbited a nearby moon called galatan if we restore the galaxy broadcast hub we can send a distress signal to new republic forces outside the nebula chief mechanic zerelda sage will lead a repair team to do just that she'll also locate communication satellites in the area to boost our distress signal the more active comsats we have the stronger our transmission will be theresa surely knows this too we can suffer minor losses with the comsats but the more we have working the faster we can signal chandrilla for help but the empire's fighters must not destroy the broadcast hub we lose that we won't survive keep zerelda and the comsat safe i'll call for aid as soon as you get the signal strength high enough from there all we can do is wait and hope when i left the empire i tried to leave behind their views on morality and certainty the core of imperial doctrine is being certain that what you're doing is right doubt is seen as disloyalty now i understand that you have to look at your decisions with a clear heart and ask what more you could do should do for those who lead doubt is necessary the starhawk project represents hope for an entire galaxy it's bigger than any of us i know you'd rather be defending the starhawk but i promise that reactivating the broadcast hub is the best thing you can do to ensure the project's survival good luck i know you won't let me down this will work vanguard squadron has handled dangerous assignments before and performed brilliantly a deadly nebula on one side and a crumbling moon on the other that gives us a slim margin of error it's this where we come up with something more drastic you know me ardo there's always another way trust me general i'm aware i'm just letting you know that my crew is feeling the strain note it but i trust my people you include it to make this happen sorry not now you know after endor i wasn't sure about staying with the new republic i'd fought the good fight even shaking that death mark i didn't see the point going legit so to speak figured i'd cash out then get back to doing what i do best how was grace who changed my mind the day i was set to leave she pulled me aside and told me something i'll never forget she said i'll miss you frisk i'm back home on dosh my clan and i never got alarmed you're too loud ferrous why don't you like hunting ferrous as soon as i could fly i left made my own way on my own until i met vanguard the only thing better than pulling one over on the empire was flying with my vanguard buddies it had never occurred to me they felt the same way the point i'm trying to make is whether it's a life or death mission or just helping a transition feel at home we make it work so yeah things look bleak but when vanguard flies together there's nothing we can't do especially with you around and if we fail we fail together and no one will ever know because we'll be dead now that's a win in my book ready to go when you are you're in a u-wing which is great news for me i'll need all the support i can get out there all these years on the temperance i've never deployed on a mission i just fixed up what came back i might be nervous scared even but i've seen what you and vanguard can accomplish together i'm ready i won't let you down out there you wings keep the squadron flying this is a support fighter specializing in disabling enemy fighters and empowering the squadron you're gonna like that prepping emergency [Music] okay vanguard the broadcast hub is close i hope it's still in one piece look what the nebula has done to that moon i tried what i could do to our ships could be worse we could be back in the xavian abyss we're dead in the minefield see zarelta gets it uh there's our broadcast hub beginning docking procedure i'll have this old relic up and running in no time let's get this done before the empire notices we're out here i'm shaking in my boots you're not nervous keo i've seen vanguard squadrons like countless missions what am i supposed to be worried about vanguard i'm in it's a mess in here stand by while i get this hub up and running hey looks like the broadcast hub works it works but the system is a wreck i'm gonna need some time to get all the concepts back online be quick we have ties headed our way i think the empire has figured out what we're up to [Music] pal giving you a tactical shield you can always count on me i'm alive blow that up go get them blast that target to work when i'm getting shot we got bombers coming our way giving you an extra shield i'm with you have a tactical shield shoot them blow that up bombers are done for but the rest of these ties gotta go we'll destroy them all blow that up got an extra shield for you lucky i was around huh that's the last of the ties they'll be back with friends no doubt good looking out team when you work together it really is a sight to behold you got that right what's the situation zerelda may i join you i've got it all concerts are now active keep them safe the more we have the stronger our distress signal need a shield of course you do we need time for the comsats to strengthen our signal then i can broadcast our distress call to the new republic gotcha we'll keep the empire away from the concepts exactly because if we lose them all we lose everything you heard keep the empire off our comsats that's not good taking fire blast that target tactical shield for you you're good now they're not going anywhere shoot that signal strength amplifying keep it up go get em teamwork shoot that stay alive have a tactical shield got a lock on me blow that up i'd love to be the hero hey you did your job pieces [Music] incoming blast that target tactical shield for you bye blow that up blast that target destroyed i'm not saying thank you let's get the concept one blast that target blow that up [Music] imperial jamming ship just entered the area [Music] we're on it destroyed their reinforcements are running scared looks like our work here is done yes signal's back at full strength ready when you are commander james attention this is commander james calling from the ringali nebula requesting emergency thanks we couldn't have done it without you get them right on your wing commander james regrouping with zarelda and heading back to you okay the temperance is headed to the far side we'll meet you there commander where's the star hawk he was more badly damaged than we thought general sindola has evacuated all personnel to the temperance we can't abandon it we can lose our starhawk prototype but not the people who built it you're gonna help them escape how boss the tampering says hyperdrive is busted they're working on it but don't worry i'll buy you enough time [Music] moment friends years ago the rebellion welcomed me today i feel honored to join the fight sir you can't have faith besides if there's one person who can keep jerusalem's attention it's me i need you to lead our defenders the future of project star hawking maybe the new republic itself is in your hands all due respect sir you won't last a second out there alone hello no but thanks to you i've been able to call in some help commander james this is anvil squadron we got your message we're here to help good luck vanguard and may the force be with you [Music] when i was a police officer on parkella i'd spend weeks fighting red tape to arrest a racketeer or a slaver gang people who were obviously guilty i enlisted with the empire because it gave me the power to do what was necessary delivered justice to the galaxy flying ties is more dangerous than chasing crooks every time i fly out of this hangar i know it could be my last but i come back time and again i'm so tired of arguments about imperial morality i've heard pilots question our empire they wonder if our methods were right but they always forget one thing the simple fact is this we have the power so we have determined what is right when you're out there never forget that you get to decide who lives and who dies you've earned that power let's go the captain is waiting we've done it with vanguard squadron backed into a corner lyndon james has made his last mistake we have confirmation that lyndon has joined the fray that's not all he's leading the same rebel squadron we decimated at monkala this is a calculated move lyndon wants me to do something reckless he thinks he knows me but he's wrong we're not going to take the bait titan squadron will focus on our real target the star hawk admiral sloane is counting on us i wish i could deal with lyndon personally but a commander's true weapon is a squadron not a starfighter go complete your mission and if you get lyndon in your sights strike him down once and for all this is it titan squadron our moment of victory is at hand the temperance has broken off from the rebel fleet but no matter our focus is the starhawk and thanks to the reinforcements from admiral sloane we now have it surrounded the starhawk suffered catastrophic damage from albaradium assault and has had no opportunity for repairs if i'm correct a careful strike to the ship's tractor beam core should turn it into a floating time bomb reaching the starhawk will not be easy the rebels managed to call in reinforcements of their own and bill squadron to be precise lyndon james is handling anvil squadron's tactics personally anvil took heavy losses at moncala but they still have starfighters and a grudge destroy them they're also fielding a nebulon b frigate we have a raider on hand to assist you once you reach the starhawk you must breach its armour to attack the core scans indicate there's an undetonated baradium missile lodged somewhere in the starhawks hull exploit that with the hull breached a single fighter can fly inside the starhawk to attack its tractor beam core we have no idea what to expect on the inside do what you must to start a core overload and then escape to the overseer while there's still time all our work and sacrifice has led to this titan do not let lyndon james stop you now i would be remiss if i didn't point out that our odds of success are substantially lower than usual are you saying titan squadron is no match for a broken down rebel fleet oh no not at all your record is very impressive it's just that these rebels are desperate that makes them especially dangerous a valid observation lt 514 i expect you will keep it in mind i took this pasting to see how squadron tactics really work in the field and i discovered how little i really knew but now i have enough material to submit an entire intelligence data bank on titan squadron and yourself in particular watching you hunt rebels has been very educational and rather fun thank you it's been an honor to observe you've made yourself indispensable titan squadron would not have been the same without you when i called you to serve you answered without hesitation i won't forget it the battle is waiting do not disappoint me this is it destroying that starhawk makes us heroes and heroes have influence a smart person could parlay that influence become admiral sloane's aide perhaps once in the heart of imperial power you can guide it from there anything's possible even the foundations of a new senate now all we have to do is win oh don't worry i'm not losing sight of what we must do but this is about more than ending a war a true future for the empire beyond death stars and rebels is within our grasp that is what i'm fighting for whatever you're fighting for remember it today anvil squadron makes no difference once the starhawk is gone we'll be one step closer to ending this war but the end of the war doesn't mean the end of our duty does it captain carol may be satisfied with destroying the starhawk but it's only one ship enemies of the empire exist all across the galaxy i'll deal with them myself if i have to sounds like a good retirement to me let's finish this the war goes on didn't stop it indoor won't end with a star hawk whatever's destroyed rises again i've lived it they need soldiers pilots always have always will rebels or republic we know our duty take strength in that you fly i'll follow this is it then captain carol needs you in a tie fighter bomber or interceptor your choice here [Applause] titan squadron is ready on your order to imperial raider help titan break through the republic lines yes ma'am move into position [Applause] heads up incoming fighters titan destroy those fighters now you should have wiped this out thanks for the second chance and if you're looking for me charissa i'll just be over here with the rest of that bill taking out this star destroyer it's a shame you will come face me how dare you talk to us about shame titan is my weapon poised to deliver the empire's vengeance right all in one place take them apart tighten engage that target enemy behind you stay sharp under attack joining up owe you my life i'm in position he prepares over here you're welcome attack that target great work titan engage that target thank you later [Applause] [Applause] all fighters destroyed good now focus on that forget radar here moving to support titan squadron these were public fools trapped outnumbered and they refused to accept it they'll call us weak even as the might of our empire sweeps them aside your primary target is the enemy frigates this is the fun part all right titan engage that target taking enemy fire focus your fire i need to reload bring it fire on my down i'm under assault wait for me to reload enemy bring it down the path to the starhawk is clear you'll need to breach the starhawks hall to get inside a moment i'm picking up something on radar [Applause] titan stay alert more enemy capital ships are incoming titan split up an attack let's go it's their funeral squadron rally around our reinforcements you can still surrender titan to scum like you in coming to our location they're desperate in time one left fire on my target i'm hit i need repairs attack that target got it enemy frigate is destroyed titan leader to captain carroll we've wiped out most of the enemy capital ships it's and they thought we might surrender will do we've lost our capital ships anvil fall back to my position roger now for the star hawk titan squadron how is it still flying because they built it from imperial durasteel and we'll be back too late to save their battleship you'll need to breach the star hawks hall to get inside make your way to the baradium missile end the starhawk [Applause] [Music] three if you need to but remember the tight space will make that tricky don't forget to give yourself room to decelerate commander a titan starfighter just reached the starhawks hall they're inside copy and builder teresa what are you up to i'm finishing what i began as a dairy take three throttle down i'm reading strange gravity effects inside that core you should be close to the court emitters zero win and fire reading a spike in the call emitters are offline center yourself with the entrance you can ride the shock wave out it might be tricky relax stay nimble and the gravity fluctuations might knock you off course titan 3 brace you did yourself the starhawks core has become a time bomb nothing can stop it from overloading now starters dryer down more of our people saved and we're just getting started with me yes sir it's time to end this don't you dare by james without me you'll have to go through us first titan three we're pinned down it's in your hands now titan three i gave you a chance at foster haven i wish you'd taken it better than that his shields are depleted not good enough [Music] lyndon i underestimated you not just your talent your willingness to be used by an emperor that will destroy you you never knew me at when this is all look at the empire you serve and ask why betraying your people for principles doesn't make you noble not in your in the eyes of eyes that i've seen his shield regeneration is disabled he's vulnerable all right enough no repairs no shields just like my first time let's see how good you really are quickly if you just left and foster our haven teresa think what you could have achieved wreckage over a broken world [Music] it's done thank you titan three so perish all traitors imperial ships prepare to withdraw they are refusing captain they plan to eliminate the rebel fleet fools with admiral sloane's unerring support we have left project starhawk in ruins vanguard squadron is doomed imperial ideals have prevailed loyalty duty discipline and with our latest champion we shall ascend to even greater heights titan iii has been promoted to flight baron with full well done your future with the empire is bright i take pride that the death of lyndon james sends a message to all who would betray us that wherever the enemies of the empire may arise titan will be waiting no matter the cost this war is our crucible we will emerge triumphant and bring this new republic to its knees [Music] come join us cardo confirmed what you already knew the commander is gone yeah you know he did the right thing though the civilians needed us the commander sent vanguard where we were needed most of course this is what he fought for that's why it hurts so much whatever happens next this is the end of the line i just wanted to say i know we haven't flown together very long but if i'm being honest it feels like you've always been here i speak for everyone in vanguard when i say it's been a pleasure fighting beside you i know we have a mission but we also have each other to lean on and to protect you've got my back out there and i have yours no matter what okay general syndulla is waiting for us in the briefing room shall we i'm sorry that our first real meeting is under such tragic circumstances we're all feeling lyndon's loss but we're cornered you and vanguard have held back the imperials but we must get those civilian engineers out safely i need you focused and ready to go lyndon saw you as a leader an inspiration even that's the courage i need right now let's get you and the others briefed there isn't much time thanks to your work on the comsats anvil squadron heard our call and with lyndon james bought us time to repair our ships for escape but now the imperial fleet has anvil ships pinned down they can't get out so we're going back into the fight because we need to buy everyone time to escape no one left behind ardo thinks we have one chance it's drastic but here it is the moon is highly unstable and the imperial ships are positioned around it if we crash the starhawk into the moon's core the shockwave should destroy those imperial ships and let us escape if we're fast how the ship's tractor beam is firing uncontrollably as it overloads if we can get a couple of corvettes into that beam we can tow it up to speed vanguard squadron you're up first we're counting on you to clear the path and take out the closest star destroyer corvettes will then enter the tractor beam and if ardo's plan works get the starhawk moving it should have a straight shot defend our fleet in case the imperials get wise to what we're doing when the starhawk collides with that moon the shockwave will hit every imperial ship in range and you unless you outrun it it's risky but sacrificing this starhawk will save our fleet and the engineers will build the next one and the next the future of the new republic depends on it let's finish this we were able to evacuate all personnel from the starhawk engineers technicians mechanics we took a big loss today those who died at nadiri lyndon it won't be in vain so long as we survive so does project starhawk and with it the future of the new republic fortunately the imperials didn't seize control of nadiri they were too busy chasing us off i've already sent meteor and hail squadrons to secure the dockyards now all we have to do is make it out of here to your fighter there isn't much time you should know lyndon always speaks spoke highly of you he never forgot what you did for him at foster haven i know war takes its toll even when the imperials attacked moncala i had to keep my head lyndon was a friend he knew exactly what he was doing when he challenged teresa doesn't make it any easier the overseer has fallen back but the other imperial ships still have us pinned down you and vanguard are our last chance i believe in you but more importantly i believe in vanguard squadron lyndon bought us time i know you'll all make it count get your ship every moment matters now come on look at me i'm not scared we'll get through this we always do how do you know because we never let each other down that's why so after we pull this off because we will what are you gonna do this isn't the end of the war frisk it's just one more battle yeah but we've earned ourselves a whole pile of day passes you ever been to the last hand on narsada best cantina in the outer rim what a relief for a moment there i thought you were taking this seriously it's strange where conscience leads you it took me from being a daughter of imperial lackeys all the way to this tipping point i'd be lying if i said i didn't miss my family regardless of their loyalties they are still my parents my sister but in vanguard squadron i found a family i could stand beside proudly until the very end whatever happens next will be our legacy and i'm proud to share it with both of you you gunny keo you're all acting like this is the end am i the only one who remembers where vanguard squadron we have to survive the galaxy ain't gonna save itself let's go and every day you crash a star hog into the moon you'll need to be flying your best for this one x-wing y-wing u-wing a-wing pick whichever fighter you need [Music] for the boss one hell of a place to fight i've never seen anything like it those imperials better enjoy the view while they can did anyone else hear that probably just a calm glitch focus on the star destroyer okay they missed their chance eliminate that star destroyer so we can move the starhawk into position any advice general hit the subsystems first to weaken it under them a better chance oh of course stop it i really don't want to die shield's down now's our chance they're down not out blast that target reloading blast that target shoot that [Music] me taking damage take down those turbo lasers that would make this easier enemies locked on got one behind me blow that up all shield generators are down it's time vanguard blast that star destroyers hall with everything you've got right we're investigating standby blow that up better than expected the star destroyer is out of the fight good job everyone now warm up what's next regroup with the starhawk for stage two of the plan vanguard looks like that signal is coming from inside the star hook what it's been evacuated we have to be sure head to the single origin point before it's too late are you what's our status the starhawk has a straight shot at the moon sending in corvettes to get it moving give them some cover for vets to throw the starhawk into the moon and take out every damn imperial ship in range then count me in let's finish this together imperial how so coming in blow that up joining formation keep an eye on that lucky we're getting there blast that target nice shooting let's get rid of them before we lose [Music] protect this for me [Music] it's up to you now vanguard count on us general all right the star hawks picking up speed but it's still vulnerable vanguard defend the star hog at all costs leave it to us once the starhawk reaches that point there's no turning back prepare yourselves i'm not saying thank you it's too bad we're losing the star hawk like this it was built to stop imperial fleets and that's exactly what it's gonna do thanks to jarissa though i know she'd like the irony we're picking up an incoming imperial cruiser stay alert that's an enemy lockdown you don't need to advance if you think you've already won no matter what [Music] enemy is persistent keep them on their toes we're almost there you heard connie bring it down is no difference a second imperial cruiser is heading to your location another one well we're warmed up already bring it on blast that target shoot that just a little further blow that up is almost there keep the starhawk in one piece until it's in position enemy fighters close again shoot that blast that target should have stayed home you did it there's no stopping the star hawk now time to fall back we're gonna make it out of this right kio follow me stay with me no room impressive is this might take us through i'm burning up in here no time to get careless all these rocks look the same there's light follow me i did it i mean we did it let's head home chandrila's ahead our people will be safe and we can plan to rebuild you did it vanguard project star hawk is only just beginning vanguard punch it [Music] hope is like the sun if you only believe in it when you can see it you'll never make it through the night we know our new republic faces great challenges but thanks to vanguard squadron peace is closer than ever general syndulla sacrificed one starhawk for the chance to build a fleet from nadiri commander james will guide our best and brightest forging the strength to challenge an empire the war goes on but we face it with renewed courage inspired by heroes who fly for freedom as we emerge from the darkness of imperial oppression into the light of a new era [Music] you
