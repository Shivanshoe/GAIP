us what you know thank you we really appreciate the assistance good luck [Music] you [Music] I've been waiting for you this way please thank you for your help today please make yourself available if another incident arises farewell to you and please take care your that hero we encountered before yeah we've been running into each other a lot lately oh hey we just passed the hero certification exam and also finish the introductory seminar huh as of today Janice and I are bona fide heroes I will take my leave of you here master right see ya you had known too Oh looks like we're headed in the same direction shall we get a move on [Music] well if it isn't the association's newest eager beaver's in this business there's a thing called rookie crushing a lot of us heroes hate to be out ranked so we crush the newbies early on like this time for part three of the seminar who are you again it's time to do this for dinner now you stand among the ranks of the straw [Music] dad home [Music] Hey what are you writing over there my diary I am recording the details of your lessons and training regimen crap he's raising the bar again I can't think of even one single thing that can actually teach the guy I feel bad scamming him or something come on think just make something up like techniques are a spiritual theory clap and blinking there's nothing else I actually do strange changes all I've got I know jenos won't be satisfied with that by the way at the seminar they said if you are a Class C hero and you have no hero activity for a week your name will be removed from the hero registry will you be all right master hey you really said that yes with Class C being the largest category in the bar being so low those who cannot be used or constantly weeded out but I was watching TV and there wasn't anything going on the news only reports major incidents large-scale events such as natural disasters terrorism and dangerous monsters you may not be aware of it because you have only confronted powerful monsters and evil armies that no one else could handle but Class C Heroes primarily take care of purse snatchers robberies and random attacks it is quite difficult for a Class C hero to survive without actively looking for cases to resolve I hear many of them get discouraged and changed careers like a salesman offering his ware store to door nothing will come your way without doing the proper legwork this is no time to be reading manga we are going no you stay here if I'm with a class s hero the Class C like me won't get any credit I'm sorry but you can't come along on this one Janos but as your disciple Janos from the beginning my intense desire to be hero was what drove me to strength training that's how I made it this far for you perhaps things will change if you aim higher as a hero and you set a new goal frankly speaking you're a cyborg so training your body won't do a change in mindset may lead you to greater strength so in other words it's not about having raw power or technique it's about training your mind to do that you must first fight your way through the professional hero industry jenos aim to break into the top ten of the class s heroes I believe that should be your goal for now oh man I'm just making all this crap up as I go but I can't stop now I understand I will do as you say he bought it awesome I believe in you jenos good luck in your training [Music]
