phew that was really quite close for angela she was almost lost to a fate worse than death not that there's anything particularly wrong with death well done not a soul lost so far things could have been quite different as the stakes seem to have been elevated that gun might prove to be a lifesaver don't you think or the precise opposite the boys have some interesting theories maybe you're choosing to believe daniel's theory that they're already dead my dream was lengthened after life oh then began the tempest to my soul i passed me thought the melancholy flood with that sour ferryman which poets write off onto the kingdom of perpetual night it's possible i suppose maybe the bus driver can shed some light this must be very confusing for you right now doppelgangers witches ghosts death and demons what could possibly tie all of these souls together i dare say we'll find out hm i have been granted permission to give you a single hint tempted okay then we will once again turn to the bard for some cryptic inspiration i met him once you know i meet everybody once act five scene one where cleomanese begs leontes to forgive himself for causing the death of hermione do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself go on then as terrifying as it might be you should get back to it [Music] wait [Music] what in the name of holy [ __ ] was that i've never seen anything like it it was like something from a nightmare did you see the way it looked the gaping mouth those dead soulless eyes whatever it was it's gone now i was nearly gone if that thing had caught me it was so close you've had the crap scared out of you we all have but at least we got the [ __ ] away from it we did thank god we're all okay right now we're safe that thing whatever the [ __ ] it was is still out there could be hunting us as we speak it was in chains just like the woman who went in the water i don't believe that's coincidence either of you see what happened to taylor and daniel they can't be far behind us [Music] let's just get out of here can we keep moving i don't feel safe here [Music] so let's stay away from that bridge i'm all for putting as much distance between us and that hideous thing as we can pretty sure daniel and taylor will be thinking the same thing [Applause] out of sight quick [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] best to keep out of his way i reckon we should talk about what the woman said before they drowned her the little girl has to be stopped she was talking about stopping the witch trials right i'm not sure come on let's go i'll go in and take a look around [Music] how you doing i'm wondering if that thing could be coming after us don't think it's coming after us what makes you so sure you and me gotta stay real close now when you say close how close exactly this close a little closer a little bit more what's that noise didn't hear anything [Music] i don't like this i want to go another way don't think there is another way quite the tourist trail not a place i want to revisit [Music] hey over here you gotta check this out that thing could still be around here in the water no we left that thing way behind we must have [Music] oh [ __ ] you're going first right you a half what i do better if you lead i'm not crossing this crapped out bridge no way to find the others we got across we got no choice fine i'm heading across you can follow me if the bridge is still standing okay then what the hell is that you see this let's get out of here daniel get your hands off it [Music] mary mary i am over this way mary the fountain of all evil is here what what evil you know what's going on here we sure as hell don't you scared us after death speak to me of death this day i have pulled my wife's body from a watery grave and buried her in the ground with my own ants and all this because of her mary who in the hell are you why do you look just like john i have no answers for you perhaps i'm already under a witch's spell it lies i found him how did you come by this fashioned with my own hand i take it to protect you suspicion and betrayal walks side by side in little hope no one is safe [Music] please have let me keep here nothing no working phone anywhere okay so it looks like we really are trapped here still no sign of him nope not yet i just hope they're both okay i figured we'd have found the bus driver by now i wonder where he's at why can't you leave us alone i think she wants us to go after her you want to follow her she could be leading us into danger even a trap the two girls we've seen one is from the past this one is from here and now maybe the girl we're seeing here is somehow a mirror image of the girl from the 17th century don't you want to wait for daniel and taylor if they were coming this way they'd be here by now [Music] stay loose who knows what's up ahead hey wait for us ugh disgusting guys you there [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] it's not stopping oh please god uh [Music] oh angela [ __ ] no what did she do to deserve that [Music] it's just you and me now until taylor and daniel get to us [Music] hey there's something blocking the door give me a hand will ya this place is a museum of some kind she in there relax this doesn't feel right stay focused we're not having a rerun of what just happened to angela you sure about that i'll do whatever it takes to keep us both safe once we're out of here we'll hook up with the others that's if they're still alive why is this kid out here on her own it's strange maybe she's linked to mary somehow gotta be though how and why i'm not sure of yet so um hey take a look at this i've seen this before where on the road outside that shitty little bar we stopped at angelina saw it laying there picked it up right before that kid mary scared us for the first time interesting you think she maybe led us here wanted us to see this let's take a proper look what the hell professor [Music] there are many many stories about how spirits can attach themselves to objects sure in movies take it easy will you what if mary's spirit is somehow attached to this thing we burn it and this could all end right here at it another way maybe by burning her precious things it's just gonna piss the kid off you might be right yes this is what the truth is it's so real people are right there it's with the devil right and this kid mary who snitched on everyone that's got to be the girl we're seeing we can get out this way where'd that little girl get to she let us in here and then disappeared maybe that was her plan all along lead us to the puppet job done i'm not sure about that almost out of juice no signal out here anyway you hear that maybe hurt something not sure what guys professor that you in there can we just get out of here where the hell are the others probably as lost as us you think they're looking for us could be angela's got no interest in finding me that's for sure she's got a mean streak all right but she's got some heart you sure about that yeah i've known her for a long time longer than any of you all right ten bucks says no one's home i'm not touching that still first place we've seen in a while find a way in like you found a way into that store you a burglar in your spare time no but i wasn't a past life not getting through this way hey taylor check this out check what out don't think anyone's visited for a long time oh yeah and that's ten bucks you want me don't owe you squat i never took the bat fair enough it's loose i can jimmy this open no problem we can have a big power but who goes in first but we both know what's gonna happen right sure thing easy now tough guy don't beat up the scary doll funny get your ass in here come on this way these things look so real they're freaking me out what's up i just i just saw something where the hell are you going you sure this is a good move nope [Music] [Music] huh [Music] where are you [Music] [Music] [Music] taylor [Music] taylor you okay what's going on [Music] god come on god [Music] oh what happened i heard voices i saw my [ __ ] self looking back at me dressed all weird speaking funny i mean what the [ __ ] [Music] well you go walking around on your own like that and [ __ ] happens off daniel i thought you had my back this is so [ __ ] up this woman the one who looked like me they just dragged her out like some kind of criminal i mean [ __ ] let's get out of here i hear that you
