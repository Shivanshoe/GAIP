peter what are you doing here i'm here to get you out of this asylum but you put me here and with good reason i can't i know it's crazy but time's running out connors something bad has happened something really bad progress hey there hey thanks for coming with me pete you're brave we're gonna have to be careful here i'm not supposed to be here after hours i hope it's better than the first time i snuck in that was not fun we're not sneaking we're investigating weird things happen here after hours stuff that dr smythe is trying to get rid of he's not a bad guy you know he wants to turn this company around sure that's what the video says so what exactly is rotten in the state of oxford i think they're continuing dr connor's work cross species experiments come on whoa now like making more lizards making more everything i'm not sure but we're going to find out tonight oscorp has the geniuses and the resources why can't it be a benefit to people that's why i came back and dr smythe wants to change things i know his brilliant research will usher in a new era for all humanity okay just wait a second nature to man keep your head down wow look at all this i knew dr smythe was the nanobot guy but i had no idea he had big bots too i can't believe you get to play with this stuff every day it never gets old [Music] whoa what is that oh my god this could be proof they're continuing connor's work you were the one that had the sedative how can he still move like that i'm sorry i gave him everything we had is everyone okay when are you all right yeah thanks dr smith hey you kids are in big trouble what are you doing it's okay it's okay they're with me what are you doing here gwen you know you're not supposed to be here after house especially with a guest dr smythe i am so so sorry this is my friend peter parker peter parker i've heard about you i'm hearing a lot about you tonight so why are you here i'm totally to playing doc i uh i'm amazed at what you've done with us corp i when i heard about the changes you were making you know uh nanobots i wanted to see them for myself you worked with connors right funny finding you here now as i waste my time trying to dispose of these cross species so this is across species you promised me that all of conor's work was over how many more do we keep here i told you the truth gwen the experiments have stopped just not as early as i'd hoped no more humans turning into animals like connors did but what you see here is what happens when an animal gets a nice dose of human dna here follow me i trust you'll keep everything you see in the strictest confidence another one of these cross species this is crazy the lizard almost destroyed the city what rational mind would continue to create these things changing the ethics of a large corporation takes time now some scientists argue that these pathetic creatures have some benefit but they lost that argument as of tonight these cross species disappear we're shipping them to our bio lab for safe disposal out of sight out of mind uh has this thing eaten today it always looks like that they went farther with connor's work than we realized the species in this room are incredibly dangerous and highly contagious hence the containment units hey where'd he go come on out little fella that little fella is a walking disease any direct contact with it leads to infection infection leads to death or becoming a cross species yourself i want to keep you human parker let's keep moving is there a cure well for these things no they were never human to begin with they were born in a petri dish for the poor humans it infects unfortunately not attempts to develop an antidote have been unsuccessful i don't want to seem cruel but you have to understand that thing is pure vermin creatures like this brought europe to its knees with the plague wow i don't think he likes me that's strange it only reacts like that when it's around other i mean other handsome guys like me i'm used to it not like robots biological creatures are unpredictable i much prefer things i can control unpredictable huh what is that an iguana this has to be the strangest office tour i've ever been on don't worry parker our next stop is the nanobot lab once you see it you won't want to leave excuse me dr smythe i need someone with special clearance to help me take this down to b sector i don't have time for this gwen maybe it's a good thing you're here you can deal with some of this bureaucratic nonsense a punishment for trespassing go with him and catch up with us when you're done uh doctor i think i'll escort her you know make sure she doesn't get eaten i understand the beast is as enthralled by beauty as madness meet me in the lab when you're done and don't wonder it's an order miss stacy sure dr smythe come on pete i'm great meeting you doctor likewise partner is that you got to be kidding me that's taking things a little far isn't it it's a terrible legacy but dr smythe says we're putting it in the past i believe him what the what what did you do to it i i didn't do anything peter i think it senses your blood it matters it's clearly reacting to something i've never oh my god you've got to clear this area what do we do emergency shutdown this can't be happening no no wait look at me gwen three when help me [Music] [Music] gwen are you okay uh i'll be fine thanks get into the quarantine area i can help you save the other scientists from there these robots look like they want to eat me for lunch they've been programmed to defend us against cross species which i guess you technically are so yeah watch out pete [Music] oh my god did you see that one get you out of here you can web swing across these things get out of oscar i don't want to think about what else right now more robots watch out [Music] does every robot have to attack me [Music] how about this okay gwen i'm a light packer i have to get out of here [Music] [Music] the door's been sealed we need to find another way great oscorp security system quarantine's on the other side stay here gwen i'll come back to get you find a way to open the sealed door from the other side [Music] ugh uh [Music] engaged [Music] [Music] here we go how you like [Music] thanks pete [Music] i need to get the others before this really gets out of hand pete i think we both know that this is already out of hand dr smythe will have some answers find him i'll try but gwen i have to ask what's going to happen to you i don't know but it's not going to be good i'm infected pete we all are you remember what happened to connors this only leads to one thing but but what about the antidote if it worked before connors was exposed to an earlier strain you couldn't even call it a virus back then it's evolved it mutated there's no antidote to cure this what if i stop all the cross species there's no question they should be stopped but even if they are there's there's still a risk that the virus will spread gwen stay calm i'm not gonna let anything happen to you okay we'll figure it out i'll find dr smythe and the others hopefully it's not too late wait peter take the oz phone on the table the what it's the name of the ozcorp phone it's still a prototype but at least i'll be able to call you okay i'll get back as soon as i can [Music] did smythe make it yes i got him and the other scientists to the quarantine but they're all infected and the cross species where are they i tried to stop them but they escaped well you caught me the lizard why should these creatures be any different ah you have no idea [Music] [Music] [Music] peter gwen you okay i don't know [Music] i know someone who can help be careful pete dr smith is programming his robots to capture all cross species what is that i think i'm gonna love this phone [Music] as you can see the creature has stopped its rampage in the center of the park now that we can have a good look we can confirm the same reptilian creature that recently terrorized manhattan strangely foreign okay hey come back i'm pretty sure he's talking to you right this is not good had enough what's wrong um [Music] [Music] i need to get out of here it's now or not hit this guy [Music] about that strength all right was it something you ate how do you like them nice now for the other one i'm putting an end to this any last words before i put you in the scrapyard and here it comes open your mouth nice so my fellow biologists are responsible those vultures i wonder if michael morbius led the charge nice enough guy but no one else seemed more interested in my research always insisted i focus on bats instead of reptiles for some reason uh no batman out there doc that's just ridiculous there is a rat though and that rhymes anyway i'll bet that one's particularly contagious you see it's not the new cross species themselves that alarm me so much as the deadly virus that's resulted as a side effect and you say it's infected half my former colleagues and gwen and gwen and our only hope is what ask to smythe and his band of killer robots to destroy the city worse than the virus could ever hope to there has to be another way well you don't think i broke in here just to tell you the good news do you wait what are you talking about i'm gonna get you out of here really spiderman breaking out the lizard from his cage who's the crazy one here i'm through discussing this time to make a decision wait if you do this you must promise me no matter what happens when it's all over you must bring me back here now let's go before my medication wears off and i realize how insane this situation really is as soon as i get this door open you run as fast as you can okay right got it [Music] [Music] now so breaking out one of the biggest threats we've ever seen from a mental asylum this will look good on my resume [Music] [Music] [Music] this looks like the one connor's getting time off for good behavior hey get away from there no no it's emergency unlock i i can't override it patients can leave their rooms this is your fault you gotta help me i had to help you you tased me bro what the hell are you even doing here spider-man okay i'll help you clean up this mess but make sure your friends don't shoot me in the back i should shoot you right now get out of here i'm going just don't expect a friend request anytime

way around this place time to get these guys in their cells and play nurse to the injured oh i thought you were one of them they're everywhere you need to help the others they said this job would be easier don't hurt me oh god now [Music] i don't care over here i'll open the gate talk about be careful this place is being torn apart i hear you meet you up ahead i'll be there i check the security monitors looks like the corridor is clear good at least some of the doors are still locked getting tired of this circus [Music] a security system failure lock mechanism disabled let's dance spiderboy [Music] that didn't look pretty [Music] what why are you crying they have nothing to do with it but you don't believe you never believe me stop that dad will hear and the blame will fall on me again again just stay there pal [Music] already i think the situation is under control it's time to leave you're right my good deed quote has been filled let's give our goodbyes good news we're almost out once we clear the storage room we'll be in the inner courtyard was there bad news doc we're not the only ones trying to escape my friend and do you think your time here has been beneficial to your mental health and the spectacular spider-man freeze the dashing damsel in distress i'll thank you later hey come back you know you can thank me by getting back to yourself [Music] [Music] you want a taste [Music] seems like it's your turn to let me through [Music] uh could you please ask them to stop shooting at me hang on doc i'm on it [Music] [Music] the spidey keep looking at me like that i dare you [Music] yep you already went to the bathroom [Music] see how squishy you are here's some for you here you go thanks pete i thought we were done fall there's a lot easier breaking in than breaking out looks like everyone's breaking out great i'll have to deal with them later come on doc where are we headed as much as i'd like to take a vacation we need to get back to my apartment cops of course fasten your seatbelt connors [Music] never thought i'd see manhattan this way beautiful city huh city i almost destroyed the past is the past connors let's focus on the future at least the present let's go to my apartment oh yeah yep [Music] okay there you go door-to-door service it's not much but it's a quiet place to work while you develop the antidote you live here are you kidding i couldn't afford to rent the closet in this place it belongs to an old friend of my aunt may his name's stan i'm house-sitting for the summer i don't know about this well the other option is going back to the lizards lab and the sewer oh this'll do where should we set up the lab uh over here i guess we start with getting whatever equipment you need to work on an antidote there's the computer kind of old but it works a few books for reference over there not much oh there's a copy of splice of life over there and the television i guess we should see if we've made the news we're stunned today when kirk connors the lizard himself escaped from the beloit psychiatric hospital with the aid of costume vigilante spider-man there's no clear motive for the breakout but police have started a city-wide search for these two extremely dangerous fugitives now i guess that's a yes brilliant now they'll think you're the villain peter this is all my fault doc if you help me come up with a cure we'll both be heroes i'll contact gwen and see what's happening wait will you tell gwen about me i have to just another reason to create the antidote right now what are we gonna need to set up your lap for starters all my research i stored my files on a tablet with an oroboros insignia on it but it won't be easy to locate no problem there i broke into oscorp once i can do it again peter be careful if oscorp was continuing my work in secret we don't know what to expect this is not the same serum that infected me it's a virus now so i've heard so ready to play god you do remind me of him your father oh uh gwen's calling pete gwen i'm glad you're all right listen i'm with connor's now i know peter the whole city knows you broke him out of person it's a mental facility are you out of your mind you know what connors did to the city he created this problem to begin with and he can create an antidote this isn't the lizard this is dr connors can he bring my father back gwen i trust you peter but i can't trust him i'm sorry i had no choice but he's the key to getting you better and right now i need you to gather his research for me i can't dr smythe sent it to oscorp's archive facility just hold on a little while longer i'm on my way hurry pete i know we're quarantined but it feels like we're prisoners smith says he's working on a solution i'm gonna get you out of this gwen i hope so gwen's been through a lot i murdered her father peter you didn't kill anyone it was the lizard i want to believe you let's make gwen believe it hope you don't mind me setting up shop in here so peter wait what are these things oh yeah i was working on those before everything went down i call them my spider tracers long story short if i stick this on a police antenna i should be able to listen to everything they say should i haven't exactly had time to try them out yet no time like the present though huh i'll make a detour on the way to oscorp archives the cover price has gone up but still worth it the antenna hunt begin i'll need to connect all three to get the coordinates [Music] that's one two more to go bingo new antenna [Music] it takes two to tango but three to triangulate okay that'll do it just stay where you are little antenna i'll come to you who's failing their antenna quest not this guy we got a possible 10 22 here battery reported over coming through i repeat huge rhino like creature climbing to the rooftop of the parking lot a rhino huh should be on my way then knowledge is power this is not working these trucks are heavier than cars [Music] opportunity only knocks once as often as i can easy as 10 20 potential theft reported over there's no such thing as a small crime reported aggression in a back alley over now i know what they're up to they won't know what's coming all right huh i want this wagon surrounded at all times is that clear as you can tell ladies this ain't no ordinary load of trash dr smith himself has instructed that this goes straight to the incinerator no matter what happens along the way the freak spider-man is still on the loose so keep an eye out for anything suspicious from the floor to the ceiling now let's roll the only thing outnumbering us here are the mocks weird stuff yeah i heard that too smite's dating all the interns right yeah laugh it up tough guy i'm telling you something's going down [Music] [Applause] ah um stay down there okay well yeah i mean there's absolutely nothing to do i bet a parking lot security guard gets more action than us right now okay you win now show yourself stop it stop him and we'll be next yeah get some more hurt if i never see another air vent why did they need all of us just to babysit a bunch of boxes these boxes belong to the guy that nearly wiped out the entire city so i'm guessing it's pretty heavy i'm just saying they couldn't get the janitors to throw this stuff out here what i just said whatever's in there could blow us all to kingdom come relax man i'll relax on my own time after this stuff is destroyed all right packing on top of what we already got here four guards this guy's in charge those two on lookout some grunts packing things up and what's this guy doing taking pictures for the oscorp calendar let's get this stuff to the incinerator asap good now get it move on sir yes sir don't go little shutterbug i hardly knew you i have to stop this convoy before they destroy conor's research [Music] hey uh danny told me a lot of people are getting sick in the ozcorp tower dr smite's one of them they should send me over there i need a sick day i need a sick week [Music] so how's the view from up there well i can get a good look at you slacking off uh um don't believe you he was right there right there searching up bricks with spider powers was not the job destruction i'm gonna enjoy hurting you um just remember you can surrender at any time okay houdini you win now show yourself this the pay is the only thing keeping me here did anyone bring it down cards or something look pretty [Music] try to get a better idea [Music] you're good [Music] ah [Music] ugh i've got to get to connor's data before these idiots destroy it maybe this guy knows what the house cleaning's all about he sure seems to be logging it well spiderman but you're that reporter on tv whitney chang what are you doing i was gonna ask you the same thing well good to know you like to be on top but i don't usually go this far on a first date the network know you got a potty mouth help me up now please hey hey what are you doing easy so you know who i am who's the man behind the mask you want the short answer or the long after you pull that stunt busting connors out of the asylum everyone's wondering about your true intentions you think his research was shipped here too what do you mean by two you're here for conor's files well it's not for the fresh air and conversation there are rumors that all's corpse new facelift is a scam they continued the lizards experiments and now they're trashing the evidence i'm calling it the ozcorp conspiracy for my story what do you think i told you to stop hey give me that back stop intruder what the heck are you doing i'm in uniform i can play my role i'll play yours it's spider-man was that necessary come on spider-man aren't you gonna fight back push me in the next room get me out of here my turn [Music] before it gets obliterated i'll go over there i want to take a picture not without your camera [Music] wow isn't this incredible ah what's wrong my camera you took it okay so you're gonna have to do it what we can work together and who can get better angles than you i'll tell you what to photograph you know how to use a camera right i can probably figure it out i could make a career exposing the stuff buried in here time to make yourself useful spider-man grab that camera or you think i work for the daily bugle or something okay let's see how about that shelf it's pretty close so you just have to frame it and put it in the picture box i might need to frame the composition better any day now here we go you know what the more proof of oscorp's involvement i could get the better the second you see one of those logos snap some shots and send them my way sure no problemo we're really gonna nail these guys well i have to open the door for you huh i guess chivalry is dead chivalry's taking a time out until these cross species are stopped it's like the whole platoon showed up stay up high use the ventilation dots i do love me some ventilation ducts yeah good luck with that bro [Music] ah [Music] [Music] dude uh [Music] uh ahead spider-man i see the controller i'm going in now hey it was a sidekick around here make sure we get everything here yeah we got everything can't wait to get rid of whatever's in here it's freaking me out oh uh [Music] um [Music] tonight look everywhere and today would be good too uh [Music] with yeah [Music] [Music] uh did it work no now the system's on lockdown it won't respond [Music] wait here i have another idea she needs her own costume so hey what the hell are you doing move i'm not the droid you're looking for oh you're a real comedian and you

you didn't try to kiss me did you i wanted to but you were drooling so what are we waiting for let's go what now i'll see if i can stop the incinerator you're gonna have to try and grab the container before it's all extra crispy okay are we looking for the same thing connor's research it's on a tablet computer has an orobora symbol on it okay i'm going for it don't let him shoot me [Music] um [Music] [Music] get some more hurt [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] don't worry i'll get you out of here ugh my hero it just nicked me okay i'll be fine [Music] you know i was thinking that

something oh i don't normally give out my number to mass vigilantes if that's what you mean the research a deadly virus infected a lot of oscorp scientists that thing's got data that can help create an antidote i've rest my life to get this just as much as you did you need it for a story i needed to save innocent lives not so fast i'll hand it over on one condition here we go fine i agree keep my camera and take pictures of everything you can everything newsworthy especially anything that can help get to the bottom of all this keep me posted this is something that people deserve to know about fair enough it's a deal thanks whitney well you did save my life spider-man now get going don't forget to send me updates you wouldn't want me to tell people you're a no good liar how would you i'll think about it see you around or come and fight me [Music] i've got enough uh [Music] [Music] that looks like a good read we got a possible 1022 here battery reported over 10 30 mugging in progress over hey spiderman whitney tang here you took some awesome pictures with ozcorp and i decided i'm not done with you yet things are pretty hectic out there if you could take some pictures to support my articles we can really let people know what's going on i'll email the details including what pictures could work best i knew i could count on you thanks yes perfect now we're in business uh doc very good very good did uh you go shopping while i was out what i had a few essentials delivered a few essentials you said yourself your computer is six years old where'd you get the money i used the credit card credit card yes there was one on the bookshelf you said it yourself we need to turn this place into a proper lab but that that was stan's she's gonna kill me how much did you spend what oh i'm not sure i just used it till it didn't work anymore don't worry i only need one more thing don't say a jacuzzi a sample of dna from one of these new cross species it's the final piece to complete this puzzle from looks of things you'll have plenty of samples to choose from i'll take care of it just keep working i'm gonna call gwen gwen it's me spider-man i didn't know you were close to gwen she's sleeping doc i don't know what you heard but i'm trying to get you a cure i heard that you helped kurt connors escape from an asylum i heard the guards in my archive facility have broken noses here we are quarantined we have fever nausea it's difficult to focus and my robots say a cross species is still in the building so after all this spider-man you tell me you have a cure connors can get you the serum you don't have smythe we're your best hope i do have an antidote and it's almost finished and it's made with nanobots they enter the bloodstream and destroy the monsters at a cellular level the only way to stop this plague is to completely annihilate the host mike listen to me that's a poison not a cure connors is there with you isn't he tell you what spidey if you and connors make an antidote before i finish my nanobot cocktail feel free to try and cure these things but connor should know the dark side can never be cured only destroyed yes my weight please hurry the dna is the most important element we need source dna to finish that cure i went to the sewers last time i saw it keep at it and i'll eat your face uh there's a warm asylum waiting for you sir [Music] uh we checked the register and you're these secret agenda inquiring minds want to know i only have the coordinates but from what it gathers it contains something that could be very useful to you of course it's also heavily guarded good luck thanks for the tip i'll look into it that's for sure whitney asked me for some shots if i remember correctly [Music] they won't know what's coming i i gotta get a better angle of distractions [Music] all right [Music] [Music] fantastic all right [Music] i'm neglecting my side job as a freelance unpaid photographer [Music] something's familiar here what can it

will get all snippy is that a word snippy it is it is um i love the fresh smell of sewers in the morning come on out cross species needs your dna yes i brought some cheese [Music] give me a break all

it spreads even more maybe my web can get me a good vibe on his location all right that's enough running i don't want to hurt you i just need to take one small sample i'll give you a lollipop when it's all over huh i promise [Music] you um you down or can i join it hmm just made some new friends what's the problem the people up there some of them are changing of course the only thing we can do

one's for you look free that one's for free oh posting background huh that's interesting if i could somehow link this frequency to my spider tracers i could eavesdrop on smythe [Music] [Music] let the antenna hunt begin i'll need to connect all three to get the coordinates my signal's only gonna work if i use it on another antenna [Music] that's enough finally that looks like a good read another clipping for my scrapbook one for the collection antenna time nice one it takes two to tango but three to try it all right that didn't look pretty see everyone later [Music] knowledge is power just stay where you are little antenna i'll come to you touchdown i got the dna that robots down i have to hurry back to connor so we can get that enemy we have an outbreak on our hands sending in

sure does peter is everything okay are you okay is the question i'm getting better good just another day at oscorp huh i can't believe you had the strength to reprogram that robot the newer models still attacked you though they must be operating under a different protocol smythe probably had something to do with that kept enough robots under his command to keep control of the situation not sure if anyone's controlling this situation where's smite now he disappeared after he sent out the so2 the snake robot to kill you i guess oscorp is reevaluating his job performance you think we can try and hack through the computer system and shut down the rest of the robots alistair smythe designed the codes himself not likely thought you'd say something like that well get some rest we'll be out of here soon okay a little heads up gwen webb slinging indoors is a little different than outdoors so hold on tight and we'll be in my place soon peter i'm fine gwen you almost died you need time we need

here i can't take your call right now because my phone's not working so so that's what's been bugging me say hello to the scrap heat mister are you the new candidates for the spiderman confirm it before letting you know i'm listening well now you're the two top people on dr smith's most wanted list spider-man and peter parker i noticed you used awesome intel to find out where you're staying someone saw connors enter thanks gwen [Music] i can't help feeling something bad's about to happen i better check up on connor's [Music] this guy deserves some web in the face [Music] they won't know what's coming [Music] okay hello doctor connors doctor connor dc upgraded it to an outbreak level disaster people all over the city show symptoms of what we now know as the cross species virus following attacks by the creatures what have i done in the meantime oscorp industries has released a statement distancing itself from dr alastair smythe who was fired shortly after peter parker great just don't mess up the furniture these things are there so unknown caller uh hello it must be something to swing wildly around the concrete canyons of new york feeling the wind at your back peter parker smythe how do you know that peter parker and spider-man is the same person please doesn't it affect you parker you sided yourself with kurt conners the man responsible for these monsters rampaging through the city and i don't need cars you want him i'll send you the coordinates i'm putting an end to this are you ready i mean i don't go through all this trouble so you can ignore me you know just kidding it's my pleasure to help and let me guess it's potentially life-threatening right but hey i'm spider-man what am i complaining about taking over oscorp hi alistair it sure is some determination shame it's used to such destructive ends we have to find connors before alistar does something stupid but killing him it's not already done uh the world doesn't need an antidote against evil commerce it needs a weapon this nanobot serum is my greatest breakthrough a new era of nanotechnology begins today it will change everything my legacy will be eternal and i want you connors to see it all unfold serum did more than take your legs you've lost your mind smith don't apologize my mind has never been clearer i have a responsibility why did you want to use a poison on innocent people if you just don't speak to me like i'm an idiot connors by presenting a solution to the problem you created you're welcome back to oscorp like the prodigal son no my work will shape the future not yours i will save the city i could probably get access to the elevator and reach connors through here as long as there's movement in there the assembly line's locked bedtime for you pally [Music] i've got to shut down these mechanical arms they don't look like they know how to give a good massage that's it for you [Music] the matter ugh maybe i can stop them if i smash those electric generators and you're out oh he got real sleepy all of a sudden uh [Music] uh uh foreign [Music] as long as there's movement in there uh just remember you can surrender at any time [Music] [Music] yes [Music] smite's got his spies out in full force [Music] [Music] what's the kind of hospitality i was expecting and he sent some escorts very nice they didn't add a web proof code to a giant fan let's find out [Music] get out of here there's no way out here [Music] way to reach the lower levels [Music] no wonder it was a trojan horse the longer it takes to find you dr smythe the more fun it's gonna be taking you down i have no doubt that your work is important that one day it will revolutionize the world but not this way i am destroying monsters that threaten to annihilate the city what is more pure than good against evil think of einstein think of oppenheimer they unlocked the secrets of the adam to save the world not destroy it their work was corrupted by others but you you have a choice and you had a choice as well you chose evil you're either with us or against us doctor don't make the mistake i made you have to know there's only one way this will end understand you injected yourself with wasn't ready you still have the cross species virus inside of you i can help you and who will help so so [Music] ugh so what are we doing with my life i should be studying flirting with cheerleaders and playing wow instead i'm about to get killed in a robot factory uh do you think spider-man will come to your rescue i hope he does it's too bad he isn't here to share this moment with us this moment our trial run it was your failure to test your sample that led to such an unfortunate fence i will not make the same mistake funny i feel them sometimes as if they still work but they don't you've lost it you belong in the nighthouse alastair i'm sure you can recommend it cool off a bit as i prepare the net about syrup think about what you've done [Music] seems like i'm always breaking you out of places peter you shouldn't have come sorry i'm late robots rush hour traffic [Music] now everybody stay calm i'll get to each of you individually let's keep going let's go i can't leave you behind smite is doing this because of me so here we all are what a meeting of the mind species detected go get to your old lab bad memories or not you have to go [Music] you mind if i borrow these spiderman connors is right you shouldn't have come but i knew you couldn't resist what would people say if spider-man couldn't save his friends you'll find out soon enough i'll give you one last chance smith stop all this oh what connors did his part and now you will do yours and in time this will all come to an end what are you talking about i had no real interest in connors i wanted the bigger fish but let's not spoil [Music] soon oscorp will regret turning their back on me it's gonna be hard getting your job back unless oscorp has a work from prison program well once i save the world from the threat of the cross species it won't matter what people think of me my nanobots are the future you're still infected smite and i don't have much time do i and now my guinea pig just relax i won't unleash this on the world without testing it first i'm not crazy [Music] so how would you like your tombstone to read spider-man or peter parker wakey wakey spider-man what's the matter can't handle a few million poisonous nanobots in your bloodstream i'm i'm still alive give it time the fun's just starting you took my legs but you will never take my genius my genius created this and this will pound you into are oblivion hey a little warning next time huh i'll find the door this is gonna hurt or not they're not reacting to me that can only mean alistar succeeded and i i'm no longer spider-man of course the nanobots are altering your cross-species dna [Music] that's easily remedied with a few simple commands they can just as easily be programmed to attack powerless just when i was starting to like them my arms aren't long enough to activate those two levers [Music] my web shooters can't leave without those and my phone too i'm too weak to swing on a web but i can still shoot a few so [Music] scaffolding [Music] god [Music] searching detective [Music] its control panel [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] onward and upward here as long as i get out of here [Music] [Music] [Music] you may see yourself as a valiant hero spiderman truth is [Music] peace [Music] you're in no condition to deal with what's coming if you could help me with your powers i don't think you'll have much luck without them [Music] um [Music] yes [Music] [Music] here we go [Music] [Music] that reactor's still hooked to these railings maybe there's a way to move it [Music] [Music] this part of the wall seems weaker than the others [Music] so i could use this giant reactor to make a door ah [Music] ah i have to find a way to get over there like a normal dude what would flash thompson do right then knuckle sandwiches for everyone [Music] [Music] oh [Music] um what's going on here looks like getting ready to launch this thing on the later city sometimes [Music] [Music] is

almost got killed [Music] [Music] [Music] peter if you're hearing this we have to go underground to continue production of the antidote it appears this is safer than the surface at least for the time being i'm at my old laboratory putting things back in order meet me here bye oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] as the city's nightmare continues the question on people's minds is where is spider-man despite numerous sightings at the outset of this crisis including by yours truly there has been no sign of him for hours leading many to wonder this tragedy is now another victim we can now see spider-man himself making his way out of rubble [Music] hey peter this is stan my bank hold there's a large amount of activity on my cart apparently someone bought a ton of lab equipment lab equipment boy i hope it's not you parker but something tells me it is you live in some amazing fantasy kid and it's time you started living in the real world what am i gonna tell you around may call me if he's angry about the card he's gonna flip when he sees his apartment [Music] gwen peter thank god you're all right you didn't answer my messages and i i didn't know what to do so i came here looking for

outbreak is now being called a hero by city officials and the public yes you owe me i'll write you a check we've learned that spider-man not only fought the robots and crossed species holding the city under siege but also helped develop a cure for the outbreak hey what about me whitney what about you i bet you wind up in a secret underground lair of some other mad scientist by the end of the day and i'll have to save you oh is that what i am a damsel in distress i don't know but you're definitely distressing me another cheesy line to go in your collection going to such dangerous lengths is to break the infamous dr kirk connors out of the beloit mental facility in order to develop a cure i know conor's helped you but i'm still missing a father i know as officials monitor the situation and ensure that the infection is not spread i'm sorry i'm being told that i'm being told that dr smythe who was arrested earlier today for his involvement in this crisis has apparently escaped police custody a guy in a wheelchair ran away from the police i gotta do something tomorrow deal with it tomorrow [Music] i can feel my legs again i'm turning into one of them they think they save the city
