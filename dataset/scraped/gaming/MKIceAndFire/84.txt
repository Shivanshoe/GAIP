opponents first accompanied by kevin nash from gainesville georgia weighing in at 218 pounds [Applause] always on the hunt for glory [Applause] he is the consummate in-ring competitor aj styles is a great competitor but hardly professional come on byron you can't argue with aj's success the prince has arrived a decorated champion who has truly reinvented himself and his partner from gray county wicklow ireland weighing in at 190 pounds the first ever universal champion a multiple-time intercontinental champion nxt titled what can't the prince do it seems like year after year finn balor just reaches greater heights in his career the wwe universe has been shot ever since aj styles annihilated an entire roster of wcw legends and things turned even darker when kevin nash joined forces with styles and finn balor they sure did especially for the superstar originally responsible for the ill-fated that superstar will try to get even with styles as he comes up with a wgw icon who's ready to fight back against this emerging alliance of outsiders if they take them down then aj would be on the hook is getting dominated aj's got to slow this momentum down i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the last ride off into the pin only a one count before the kick out his determination he's a projectile now [Applause] you have to think this match is starting to take its toll boom nice i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the last drive kick out just before two look at the look on his opponent's face cole he can't believe it oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet striking combination lethal styles there's no control here aj's gotta find a window to fight back great response to aj there [Applause] tag is made and here we go this is just an overwhelming amount of offense on him he's got to reevaluate his approach at this point of lethal strikes was what more can be said i don't even think finn knows how he kicked out there will that be the last opportunity is there what a gutsy performance getting tossed poking it up here what's next [Applause] retaliates able to get the advantage here and he makes the save for his team styles getting out of the ring the hard way uh-oh a long way up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] caught the leg good night what a stunner oh victory here are your winners sub zero scorpion smoke and goldberg this pairing pain strong dividends with an impressive tag team win for my money these two just might be the best tag team on the roster today oh yeah i am pumped for this guy the following contest is a steel cage match making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke the killer instinct of the mma cage is part of this competitor's dna word is he was actually banned from competing in one mma organization but he's adjusted well to the rules of the wwe rank tonight just became phenomenal a terrific striker a master purveyor of high-flying innovative offense aj styles has competed at this level for decades such a special and his opponent from gainesville georgia weighing in at 218 pounds [Applause] always on the hunt for glory [Applause] sometimes aj styles might be indeed arrogant and also opportunistic well you're phenomenal as aj styles there's nothing at all wrong with being confident confidence is let him atop the pecking order what started as an attempted tribute to wcw's larger-than-life pledges here tonight between two superstars looking to leave their own marks on wwe and they'll have to do it in a steel cage match which means no more invited guests and no uninvited guests either after what we've seen recently i'm not even sure a steel cage can contain this issue but we're about to find out for him oh my gosh slam [Music] taking it by surprise [Applause] picked up the first ddt end of the road answering back he's lost some of his win now oh that could be a knockout blowing boom he's now trampling the opposition styles gets out of the way and here we go he's headed up the cage he's one step ahead there oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet barrage of lethal strikes and that one's scouted there's return fire on aj he turns it around [Applause] zero i don't think anybody will question the toughness on display here tonight takes a lot of guts to even set foot in the cage but to win is even more impressive i'm not impressed at all by aj styles effort tonight well i mean he tried me with today's technology i can watch wrestling anywhere at home when i'm out on the toilet come on everyone does it shorter matches are best to watch in the bathroom otherwise your legs fall asleep anyway as a favor to me and my circulation think you can wrap up your next match in five minutes or less me mvp has been trying to get the crew to follow a dress code of wearing suits says it's good for business for everyone behind the scenes to look as sharp as the superstars but i lug a camera around on my shoulder all day and the suit is not sweat resistant can you get him to back off mvp has been trending what are you expecting from this superstar tonight guys well he did say earlier that he's going to attack his opponent with a renewed hostility that we've never seen before yeah he also said he's going to make the competition beg for mercy but he's facing a man who's excelled in cover here oh come on what is he thinking you had him down where you wanted [Applause] look at this lock open suplex vicious [Applause] mvp brushed up against some resistance there the veteran didn't have an answer taking on some offense do you expect it as much great reaction from mvp oh look at their knees just unloading just sending a message there and the pressure on mvp continues to mount now mvp has to plot a way to get back into this mvp managing to get some control back now mvp needed that to get himself out of jeopardy great wherewithal on the counter mvp all set up we're going ballin you know nothing [Applause] what a gutsy performance in serious [Applause] scorpion so oh [Music] [Music] [Music] huh oh [Music] ah [Music] oh [Music] ah me here we go as montez ford takes on the superstar who earlier today at literally got into it with kane backstage it takes a lot of gold out mayor kane especially when you're in his neck of the woods but that's the kind of confidence this superstar brings to every city he goes confidence more like a death wish [Applause] and he saw that coming from montez he saw it coming taking advantage [Applause] good contact oh perfect kick he's struggling a bit here not a bad place to be in but the longer this goes the more trouble a superstar exposes himself to clothesline look at him totally fighting with the wwe universe right now he's doing a whole lot of gesturing and it could cost him three [Applause] if this guy's day can't get any more interesting i might have an idea what this is all about yeah after what we heard happen backstage it's kane and not mayor kane it's the big red machine the demon has been awakened he's been put on notice [Applause] weighing in at 323 pounds one of the most dominant destructive forces in the history of wwe multiple world and tag team championships and more destruction to come last week raw ventured south to knox county when one superstar traveled further than any other into the flaming inferno known as keynes hell and now the demon is here for revenge the big red machine may have just come alive but kane's choked slam last week may have broken something in his opponent i'm just saying kane prevents the attack from connecting and responds with a cow [Applause] this match grinded him down a little if he can hold the line here he'll be in a good position arcane counters the devil's favorite deep gets him with the counter and down with the suplex the big red machine is now under heavy pressure kane has to turn this around and click got it scouted there's a snapmare and a basement dropkick target in the chest very effective oh he knew what was coming i don't like the look in his eye here folks ddt delivered [Applause] what's it gonna take to keep this guy down kane gets out of the way good grief and he's able to fight kane that was a huge win tonight over kane hold on is this what i think it is it's the undertaker the phenom is here on raw he called take her out on social media now he has to answer him face to face let's see how tough he is now undertaker's not going to wait and there he goes he wants nothing to do with the dead man he just took down kane i think he's had enough of the brothers of destruction for one night they are ready for battle the following contest is a tornado tag team match and at a combined weight of 519 pounds sub-zero scorpion and the viper randy orton this superstar had some success in mma but never reached the top of the mountain he said it was due to politics wwe's the land of opportunity so there'll be no excuses here sink or swim pal and at a combined weight of 622 pounds the undertaker and kane the brothers of destruction gentlemen this has all the makings of an all-time classic match and i fully expected to deliver on that promise [Applause] you feel the electricity in the air because the undertaker has returned for a tornado tag match that will turn monday night raw upside down what an atmosphere the brothers of destruction together again facing randy orton and his partner who are looking to go legend hunting many have tried most have failed let's see what happens here tonight he can do it take all the wind out of you i think this man still has a ways to go can he do it here by kane he is certainly sending a message getting his shoulder up before two by the haymakers foot just stomping down gets out of the way well placed kick to the gun another damaging he's getting a little better now oh hooked up oh [ __ ] breaker he was elusive there drop kick watch the quickness on this ripped over he's got the answer for that one [Applause] oh was almost finished there's still fire in the runs of kane like a ruling movie monster that can't be killed and there you see the undertaker checking on kane wait a minute from behind for the chair on undertaker and orton's got one too they are laying waste to kane an undertaker [Applause] well this is an extraordinary sight goosebump inducing [Applause] darkness has completely engulfed this entire building admit it byron you're scared a little bit we are seeing a legend in the flesh and his opponent from death valley weighing in at 299 pounds the the magnificence of the phenom truly a mesmerizing scene the legendary phenom creates an atmosphere unlike anything you will see talk to anyone who's ever been in the ring opposite the undertaker and they will tell you nothing prepares you for this the stoic walk of the dead man come on let's go you know undertaker is a time-honored warrior of the ring no matter what you do i'm not sure there's anything that prepares you for the undertaker so many superstars have stood across the ring from the dead man paralyzed with fear abandon all hope the dead man has risen with the undertaker taking on a superstar who stared the dead man right in his cold dead eyes and didn't even blink helen a cell has been the undertaker's playground throughout his career but his opponent is hoping to end that story career tonight and gain the recognition that he thinks he deserves well he wants attention he's going to get plenty of it here tonight it might just not be the kind he's looking for [Applause] out of the ring and even closer to the chain lincoln closure fishing for something beneath the ring and he's going with the great equalizer here the steel chair [Applause] there are so many iconic names attached to this sort of match shawn michaels stone cold big boss man triple h rikishi the rock i can go on and on and on but that faithful night between the undertaker mankind oh man just one right after the other can't be stopped and each of these lethal maneuvers have got to be taking a toll these are the kinds of attacks that can put a superstar now i'll leave this aggression in the corner yeah right in the jaw able to sidestep it man right across the chest undertaker counters what makes him pay with a counter a career-changing win inside an important victory for him in this match the dead man has just been buried undertaker lost and i can't believe it we we we now this should be fun the loser of tonight's match will be forced to wear a mask of the winner's choice for 30 days that's a long time to have to carry the shame it sure is byron we're in for one heck of [Applause] he's going for it all oh my god [Applause] great counter impressive ring iq on display there he's reminding his competition that they'll only ever be second best samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian draw oh big kick boom on the jaw and landing with the double axe handle oh my devastating impact in the back systematic attack on that with that springboard he's looking a little off balance no need to panic he's still swinging [Applause] vicious stop after stop relentless strikes with a kick he's going for the pin this could be it [Applause] zero well here is a great star with a ton of potential a graceful flyer you're right about those things cole but unfortunately potential doesn't pay the bills can carrillo turn it around we find out right now and his opponent from monterey mexico weighing in at 198 pounds a lot of people have questioned just how far umberto carrillo can go but he assured me that he is as confident as he has ever been [Applause] i've seen some wild matches over the years in wwe but never anything quite like this ladies and gentlemen i present to you chicken korea roberto carrillo and his opponent have said some pretty ugly things to each other but it can't get any uglier than this chicken mask anything's possible with these two in the ring saxton away the damage he's taken is starting to pile up stiff kick boom the adrenaline is pumping and the wwe universe is on his side well scouted by umberto quick strike for the lower body and oh my god what a [ __ ] job emphatically delivered [Applause] here is your winner sub zero look who it is the following contest [Applause] boom and here we go tag team action in store there's a science to being a successful tag team and code i would know all about that hey what [Applause] evading offense he went right into that turnbuckle while he knew what was coming korea gets reversed and um he's absorbing some tough hits now yeah this is exactly why constant frequent tags are so important in a match like this to keep fresh headed to the top rope fighting back by the counter antiguary finds his mark nice striker tag is registered into the turnbuckle tagged into action here he goes [Applause] here are your winners submission match you have to take signature maneuvers that result in a pinfall out of the equation it's about making your opponent tap out to win the superstars will use that move to weaken their opponent but they must be able to lock in a submission okay you're right saxon it doesn't have to be a submission move the competitors known for one that's been declared before the match we can very well see some of the deepest tools in the toolbox tonight he knows how to avoid contact nice takedown [Applause] evades their offense ziggler may be in trouble here he looks as good as ever so far though he's been able to avoid any debilitating holds at this point in the match man a little extra luster behind that kick and set right into the car on the second rope [Applause] well measured good contact dolph gets out of there down on the chest good night what a stunner oh [Applause] the end of the track for him could be near nowhere feeling like it's over for ziggler ddt zigler now lacking any signs of resistance dolph's got to find a way to defend him can he shut the door on this one attack just to smidge quickly good night what a stunner [Music] [Applause] this was as dominant a win as i've ever seen future me me this highly anticipated confrontation is under submission match rules no pinfalls the only way to win is to tap out or pass out your opponent i've got a feeling we're about to see these superstars bust out submissions that we haven't even seen from them before he switches it back around big kick oh what a kick really just laying it in he moved this match grinded him down a little the submission match is all about wear and tear coal he'll do well to remember that moving forward oh stinking kick connects on the kick and eric escapes danger oh definitely blow to the chest catches the leg quick exchange of counters there that kick will stop you in your tracks ducking out of trouble you can't quite get in there and he saw that cut [Applause] this was as dominant a win as i've ever seen guys an absolute statement by the victor here tonight what a steamrolling the boy wonder has arrived i can hardly contain myself and his opponent from new york city weighing in at 235 pounds he is the best in the world [Applause] mcmahon was born with a silver spoon but there's no doubt will take any risk to win this match-up we never thought we'd see as the former mma competitor takes on shane mcmahon in a raw underground style match which started weeks ago with a tbt post from dolph ziggler ends here tonight with the raw underground ring master fighting under these conditions for the very first time you gotta respect shane oh mac's courage but he's in way over his head tonight counter after counter look at that this has got to be it zado mack felt [Applause] he gets out of the way all right fight shane back samoan dropped oh kick connects slips out of the way nice ddt [Applause] he manages to escape it samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian drop oh dropkick mcmahon manages the counter he's got the answer for that one jumping knee straight down shane mcmahon able to avoid mcmahon in a distressing spot shane has to find an opening [Applause] and that seemed like a pretty easy day at the office right there that's why they call it light work cole barely even broke a sweat the following contest is scheduled looking into the eyes of this competitor tonight you know he understands the significance of this match this is an opportunity to make big headway on always enjoys throwing himself headlong into combat and feasting with a large hunk of meatball certainly doesn't have a zest for right about his level combat a few superstars look as at home in the ring as i bar you can tell this viking was born for bound producing a trampling oh look at this oh kicks turn your lights out omar did his homework there he's in a little bit of trouble now yeah but you can't count anyone out yet this match could still go either way

kick now trampling the opposition oh you can tell he's feeling it now this fight is pumping him up ddt a flurry of brutality that's mounted with punches and not oh a nasty stop to finish it off

disqualification matches we've seen in wwe over the years no doubt michael triple h versus brock lesnar in 2013 the rock versus mankind in 1999 both classics but the all-time best has got to be undertaker versus sean michaels at wrestlemania 26. yeah i hate to disagree with you corey but stone cold steve austin against the rock at wrestlemania 17 was the greatest no disqualification match of all time in fact it might even be the greatest match in wwe history let's just agree that all those matches are great and i'd argue this one could live up to that same hype guys [Music] samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian draw oh really just laying it in and cedric expected that implanted by the ddt oh man he's able to sidestep there cedric has him mitchunoku driver wow and he saw that

this match is finally over [Applause] here are your winners sub zero scorpion smoke and murphy two great superstars that go great together and that win is proof that was a great example of what a tag team can do when it's firing on all cylinders sure me [Applause] here we go with austin theory mustafa and the jewish recruit taking on cedric alexander in one of the most lopsided handicap matches we've seen in some time you have to ask yourself where will seth rollins disciples stood to next whatever it takes to win saxton if this lands it might be all over [Applause] face first now he's been put on the defensive great reaction from cedric dropped right on their face and he barely evades follow a moonsault wow and cedric expected to fall directly to the body dodge is out of the way elbow smash gets him with the counter oh check out this power this is ridiculous dominance powers for him he must have seen that coming oh god me meets face [Applause] austin theory and mustafa ah lee batman we so [Music] the royal rumble is right around the corner but for some reason you've been unusually silent about it i'm still deciding what i want to do if you're going to be even loosely associated with us then we need full transparency so are you going to attempt to qualify or no i think it would be a mistake if i didn't okay well good news i already spoke to mandy rose and got you in a 10-man royal rumble qualifying match tonight it pays to have friends in high places yes it does the royal rumble is right around the corner which means spots in this year's match are getting harder and harder to come by but tonight 10 wwe superstars will fight for the chance to pursue a career to fighting eliminated michael who found his way into this match thanks to an assist from the wwe champion must be nice to have seth rollins on your speed dive it sure is saxton but as usual you've missed the forest for the treats there are a lot of hungry competitors in the mix tonight including future hall of famers aj styles and samoa joe and i guarantee you those two don't want to watch the royal rumble from home with the reversal [Applause] get ready he defies it right back here he is guys aj styles has been eliminated he better keep his head on a swivel one mistake and he could be out of here just as quickly [Applause] big kick kick oh what a kick who's it gonna be fellas [Applause] ah look who we have here things are really heating up now [Applause] to behold take a picture while you can everyone and if you're looking for a difference maker well you may have just got one benjamin answers back he counters this could be an opportunity [Applause] and look who's coming to the ring now guys this could possibly change the complexion of this match michael if this lands it might be all over [Applause] find a way to respond quickly there he is he looks focused on the task at hand you can see the fire in his eyes from here [Applause] he is truly feeling it right now as well he should look who it is [Applause] [Applause] absolutely no respect on his opponent you gotta love it [Applause] me [Music] you
