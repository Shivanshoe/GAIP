her lost baby boy which i've just put together is silas oh [ __ ] it's a long story no it's not there was a fire silas the wolf boy escaped but a bunch of your family you failed to stop him burn what happened in the past doesn't matter right now uh it kind of does actually we need to know what we're up against at least what we're up against is a feral boy turned werewolf for the last six years has avoided being found no matter what we did every full moon we were out there looking every single one now the son of a [ __ ] is finally here so what we're up against is my only chance to end this

some uncool vibes podcast didn't do it justice you know half of it this is where i saw her her i thought she was i thought max hit her but then i was out here and she was something else who the woman the old woman she was saying something over and over again oh my god she was saying silas that's impossible who you're talking about i saw her too in the wrong tunnels it's eliza voris salz's mother i think who was she she ran a traveling sideshow called harem scarum came here six years back she kept her son in a cage called him silas the wolf boy died in a fire some say she never left the heck of heck it's corey we've been looking for silas ever since how did the fire start really you're still hiding stuff now you blew half the head off my niece kaylee hack one of the kindest gentlest souls to ever walk this earth all she wanted to do was help that little boy locked in a cage by that freakshow [ __ ] what did she do she just wanted to help him travis she convinced caleb to start a fire it was just a distraction it's may bails give him enough time to get silas out of his cage and give him his freedom that's not what happened no because within minutes everybody was dead never see hey burn liza old crew kaylee managed to get silas to freedom but caleb got bit in the process that's why you've been hunting him silas i mean every full moon for six [ __ ] years some hunter you are listen this is all that's left jesus christ man any sign negative damn i never saw any of this i didn't even know this was here ryan [Music] [ __ ] i'm sorry if that was close we must be close did you

you all night and i'm not about to stop now just because the nights come to an end no whenever you hear a noise in the dark of whisper from the shadows the breath on the back of your neck that's gonna be me i'll be there now i will never leave you i'll never leave you bodies recovered in summer camp murder mystery what do you make that anton bad journalism murder mystery isn't that just an unsolved murder yes i suppose that is what most journalists would say but perhaps the journalists of north kill share my supernatural suspicions hmm yeah i guess there wouldn't be much competition in north kill probably not getting the best writers there okay can we at least start the podcast before you completely resign yourself to cynicism i thought we'd done the whole hackett's quarry thing not this hack it's quarry thing what was this like three months ago old news dude anton introductions first we are bizarre yet bonafide the podcast of the paranormal i'm grace and i'm anton and together we explore the possibility of supernatural involvement in real life everyday occurrences and that's exactly what they are real-life everyday occurrences with a shadow of spiritual supernatural occurrences no okay so i hope you've got hat insurance anton because i'm about to blow your mind did you just ask if i had hat insurance yes it's responsible to ensure those things which mean the most to you a hat yes okay i know where your priorities lie go on anyway there actually is a real reason that we're coming back to hack its quarry there have been some developments and i've sourced some information i remain skeptical but i'm all ears under my hat i was hoping you'd say that oh god why why are you smiling stop it i hate it why i had braces i have to make use of them sometimes you do have very pretty teeth thank you that's something that a lot of podcast listeners might not know about me so it just so happens i've got someone on the inside so today's episode is going to have a bit of a show-and-tell vibe to it who do you know on the inside the inside of where what you know someone on the inside don't we all have someone on the inside you know an inner critic that says stop doing a podcast no one's listening you should listen to that voice grace okay well what i really meant is let's call it an anonymous donation you know we're not the only ones who flagged this as a bizarre situation someone actually reached out to us they sent us a package did you you didn't open it anyone who i don't trust anyone who listens to this show oh i couldn't wait to open it surprise anonymous donation okay you've always promised me since day one of this podcast that if you could see true evidence you will consider all options right did you not say that i did say that yes knowing for a fact that we would never see any evidence i did say that okay well we've been sent information and we need to decide whether it's bizarre or bonafide okay fine let's do this for anyone listening at home we are about to open a package from a mysterious person who listens to this show if you are the one who sent us whatever it is congrats you got us sorry the tape is just really really there's just so much tape on the package sorry can you help me with this do you have like a key i could like slice at it with no i don't want you to dull my key just use your fingers but just give me your [ __ ] key anton no give me your [ __ ] key no get your own key not like you lock your door of course i lock my door what are you what are you hiding what am i hiding do you not lock your doors no i have nothing to hide you think that ghosts are real but you don't lock your doors no ghosts couldn't open my doors they could walk through my walls anton okay you need to be more concerned with murderers so remember those missing hikers yeah what if i showed you leaked photos from one of their cameras photos that show them at hackett's quarry supposedly where the camera was found i would think that maybe they went there and they dropped their camera okay anton let me ask you real quick what makes you drop your camera uh tripping over a root um being jostled uh in uneven uh row of cobblestones what about being murdered if you dropped your phone you wouldn't go missing where are they now i don't know people get lost in the woods all the time there's like hundreds of people a year they could be anywhere that's not all no i'm about to lay a little something else on you my sources also tell me that their backpacks were found at the summer camp really then okay well then shouldn't this be public knowledge why aren't the hackett's prime suspects exactly my point maybe they would be if anyone knew where they were is it all just a big cover-up operation yeah that's where it falls apart a bit in my opinion so we've got to talk a little more about the hackett family right so these guys are like the heritage landowners right mm-hmm yep their great-great-great-grandparents were trappers who claimed the land way back when they just claimed it yes they did they put their flag on it just like the man on the moon the hackett family flag right well apparently when they claimed it they found quartzite quartzite okay i was hoping you would ask fun fact every building in the whole of new york is made of quartzite that's not fun or a fact most of them are but i digest digress it was the pun they dug the quarry and hit great heights of success before septimus hackett classic bad guy name the seventh son of the trappers the number seven has great supernatural powers closed the mine down okay so then they only had the land to live off yes you say only but this land actually spans acres that's a lot of forest a lot of unexplored darkness oh okay a great place to hide to have all these dark secrets for this strange reclusive family and this is where we start to get a little more into paranormal territory okay here we go acres of haunted woods if you say so [Music] the podcast of the paranormal welcome back to bizarre yet bonafide anton today i'm actually going to pass you some light writing okay you're going to make me read this all right um this is what you're seeing now is a copy of a letter that kaylee hackett wrote to her grandma allegedly all right uh this seems like more of a you job but i suppose right but i feel like if some of the evidence comes from your mouth it will have more clout right okay here we go gammy how long we gonna drag this [ __ ] out i know family is the most important thing but i wanna know what's outside the forest outside this damn house and camp and i sure as hell no that ain't about to happen cause of who we are maybe we can explain what's going on [ __ ] show people then they'll know we got no control over it i know you just trying to protect us but one day you won't be here no more and right now it feels like we stuck in a dark hole i can't sleep gammy or if i do i dream about that [ __ ] fire we were just dumb-ass kids back then i wish it never happened love k exo exo that took a turn yes dream about that [ __ ] fire does that not read us the haunted scribblings of someone who saw something that they shouldn't have seen yeah no i'm fully creeped out she was clearly going through some stuff and this is legit i mean i don't know why someone would fake it then again i can't verify any of this so you've got to suspend your disbelief slightly man this poor girl yeah there was something going on something eating away at her and that's what i want to explore okay well consider my disbelief suspended for now so i don't think that's gonna be a problem for this next one oh god why holy [ __ ] this is a cease and desist letter and it's addressed to us dude why didn't you tell me about this well it was never actually sent that's mad [ __ ] fam what signed by travis hackett we're not doing anything illegal aren't we think about it i guess it wasn't technically sent to us cease and desist letters come from people hiding stuff hmm okay and next we have this empty vile thing now to me empty implies that it was once full same zs blood stains maybe filled with blood looks that way freaky some kind of ritual thing do i detect a hint of belief love a good ritual kind of [ __ ] up that these guys know who we are though okay but putting the hackit family aside for a moment there's more to this are you ready for some real spooky [ __ ] i'm ready for real spooky [ __ ] i don't know if you can provide it but please try don't get too freaked out i'll try my hardest okay do you want to hold my hand no okay do you need someone to comfortingly pat your back please just say what you're gonna say do you want me to turn all the lights on so you don't i don't want you to do anything i want you to say what you have okay so what's this what are we looking at now a photo taken by one of the counselors i'm a mountain bank downloaded from her phone oh my god is that real this is what we're here to discuss it looks sharp i mean doesn't it i don't think so look at the eyes and tell me that's not real danger what the hell is that bizarre yet bonafide what the hell happened more than what we're being told man there's something else too yeah look what happens when i put it through a negative filter what is that it's her the hag of hackett's quarry see full circle i mean that could be anything dude it barely even looks like a person what's what's that thing where your mind makes you see faces and [ __ ] i can't believe you're still questioning this what do you want me to say ultimately unless i experience something myself the most likely reasoning is that it's fabricated okay then what do you think of this ew is that skin skin fur whatever you want to call it really it looks human hmm wait is it apparently it belongs to whatever creatures supposedly caused all this do we have the actual thing can i see it in the flesh so to speak no just the photo whoever got in touch was smart enough to not risk actually stealing evidence oh convenient that we can't see the real deal come on man just saying okay you know what it's weird i'll give you that oh my god i just said it was weird don't make a big deal out of it oh my god i've done it you haven't done anything i said it was weird i've done it i've turned you you're i've converted you to my side you're a believer now right i will never be on your side i won i won you did not win this is a contest and i have prevailed you have not look i just mean i can see it the lack of details in the news report and this stuff i don't know whatever it means there's merit to the idea that something strange went down strange interesting word choice so what are you saying shut up come on no give me what i i'm not giving you anything you've practically given it just give me the sing sound by i so desperately long for okay i never agreed to this title but i would agree that for the first time ever this case could well be bizarre yet bonafide ah this is the best day of my life and that's sad why is it not yours no so what now we got to send this stuff to the police they can decide whether it's useful or not i just wish we could know more i wish we could just look into a crystal ball and see how it all played out yeah but what fun would that be sure we could speculate but we weren't there we didn't go through what these kids went through there's no way we'll ever really know what truly went down at hackett's quarry um who the [ __ ] even are you i'm being genuine that was beautiful thank you you just launched into precisely the kind of content i've been trying to make it's just the first time we've had a coherent thought on this podcast [Music] [Music] you
