[Music] boy I must admit I'm impressed mortals like you were able to defeat the akan I must commend you for such an achievement but this is as far as you will go I will be your next opponent [Music] margin revival imminent if mama D is already resorting to dispatching his right-hand man he must be getting quite desperate hmm that's quite enough of your useless chatter now come at me all of you wait a second [Music] it's my turn to fight next come at me what did you say how Lord poverty please transport us to a more suitable location I must show this mortal my power very well [Music] all right time to make short work of this guy and save piccolo and krillen [Music] prepare to witness the power of the king of the demon realm ah here I go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wouldn't dilly-dally for much if I were you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] mas anca [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] surprisingly strong crap this guy's a lot tougher than I originally thought still Gohan shouldn't be having this much trouble he's gotten weak he was much stronger than this one he was a child yeah I guess he really has been slacking off on his training [ __ ] I'm starting to get pissed [Music] as Gohan continued his fierce battle with Deborah Fidel made her way back to the world tournament arena Oh [Music] Goten what are you doing here Oh jump said we should try to go find the others my dad and everyone else are off doing something cool that's not fair you know it's not like they went off to have fun okay fine I guess I will clear you both in on what's happening [Music] so that's what's going on [Music] wizard Majin whoa did you hear that go ten yeah throw me down way right wait a second you two aren't actually going to hurry if we are quick our dads are gonna beat all the bad guys no way no way no way I want to see that majin buu guy let's go meanwhile the violent confrontation between Gohan and devorah raged on [Music] Sam this is taking too long [Music] I'm going to end this right here right now hang on a second Regina give go on a chance it's nothing more than enough of these games I want to get this done and over with so I can finally settle that's the whole reason I joined that stupid tournament to begin with Lord Ganpati I've just made the most amazing discovery majin buu will be revived in no time at all hey running away I no longer have a need to fight for I've found a much more suitable opponent what did you say [Music] what is this discovery of yours Devorah [Music] among those four one of them possesses a great deal of evil in his heart with a heart that evil we can most certainly turn him to our side oh I see we can cause them to fight among themselves and reap the resulting energy that should be more than enough to revive majin buu [Music] what what did he just say I'm not entirely sure but it sounds like he's found someone better to fight me found someone I wonder what do you mean by your body and mind am I now [Music] he's actually doing it Vegeta Baba Dee's using the evil in your heart to control you clear your mind remove all evil thoughts from your head yes yes that's it you belong to me now well I have control of you allow me to push your power past its limits fujita no don't let that monster take control of you [Music] Vegeta it's too late yes yes very good let's give you a more interesting place to fight [Music] hey this is the world tournament arena who are those guys think they just appeared out of nowhere right then now what was your name again ah yes Vegeta fight all of those cretins with everything you have I want their energy shut up I only want to fight tacker art what's going on here how is this buffoon still not completely under my control this is a first hmm oh well I suppose it doesn't matter [Applause] [Music] this Vegeta now fight me Kakarot that is unless you want me to add more bodies to the growing pile no Goku don't do it if you fight here you'll be playing right into Baba T's hands your energy will be absorbed and majin buu will be revived I can't believe this you let bobbidi take control of your mind on purpose just so I'd fight you with everything I got that right are you serious this is the only way I could get you to fight me you're only here in this world for a single day and now now we're being dragged into this waste of time and energy you mean you're doing all of this for such a petty reason every single opportunity big the once-mighty the what crowd principe Saiyans I've even had my life saved bites buffoons will never forgive him for that not Romani think of somewhere with no other people around and about to go head-to-head with Vegeta don't do it if you absolutely must fight him that you will have to go through me first [Music] dad [Music] I understand at the doorway I'm sorry a huge how transport you somewhere else you to fight to your heart's content gohan and i will break through this entrance and confront bhavati and de Bourgh ahead on we may risk causing majin buu to be revived in the process but anything's better than him absorbing energy from you two and reaching full power with any luck we may be able to prevent majin buu from being revived at all I don't think so Vegeta stop them eradicate all those that stand in my way [Music] fields obey your master I refuse the Supreme Kai can do whatever the hell he wants as long as I get to fight Kakarot what I come at you one more time Oh baby kill the supreme I do it Vegeta I've heard told you I like Java is settling the score with tacker art would you be talking to I am the proud Prince of Saiyans like you you may have taken my mind and my party but there's one thing is saying always teeth is bride unbelievable I didn't think there were any mortals that could resist father Dee's mind control I see so that's how badly you wanted to fight me Vegeta his pride is unlike anything I've ever seen his disobedience is of no concern to us Lord poverty after all his sole purpose is merely to steal the energy we require it may be prudent to allow the Supreme Kai and the other to come to us it would be most unhealthy indeed [Music] welcome Vegeta [Music] [Music] let's do this [Music] well this place seems pretty dull are many people around feel free to browse [Music] [Music] go back real soon [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is the perfect location wouldn't you agree Kakarot I don't want to take damage and give majin buu more energy so I'm going full force and ending this right away very good I'm quite eager to see just how hard you've been training another world impressive you're even more powerful than go on was that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] during that little bastard [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] huge blow to my that you enjoy delaying [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] just to become a cold hard and ruthless Saiyan once more and to fight with of inhibitions and not be ruled by foolish emotions I grew to hate myself before I realized today I'd become soft like all of you I of all people came to have a family and it actually felt good that awful drunk comfortable living here on earth and all that it included and that's why that's why I needed to return to my villainous self and now that I had I feel absolutely wonderful do you really [Music] you well Deborah are you confident you have what it takes to defeat that earthly of course I will have no trouble at all exterminating that trash Oh No impossible where did all that energy come from that's right Vegeta and my dad are both fighting at a level beyond Super Saiyan damage they're each taking must be massive well then I might as well try to do what I can to stop him [Applause] oh it's empty come out Martin to come out right now [Applause] too bad poverty majin buu matt is and with that last attack I'll hold bobbity at bay Gohan you take care of dobrze once we've done that we'll have finally put an end to Bobby DS evil plan I I can feel an incredible key it's swelling up it's it's the smoke that came out of the ball earlier and cloud no it's the smoke from before what is that [Music] [Music] you [Music] wait is that thing majin buu yes I could never forget that that menacing face [Music] [Laughter] that's majin buu I'm a virgin boo and poverty the son of your creator Peabody you've been sealed in then for for a very long time but I've gotten you out I am your new master Hey what are you doing have your master don't you ignore me what a buffoon I'm not exactly sure what happened but it seems we have failed after all that trouble we have nothing but this powerless sack of fat to show for it you want to challenge me the great Devorah [Applause] the dreaded demon of destruction margin Lu [Music] that was incredible very good majin buu his key majin buu zki just skyrocketed it's huge - she's too powerful I don't believe this this wasn't how things were supposed to go I was confident we could defeat poverty and prevent maje and booze revival if only if only I had known from the beginning that you mortals could have achieved so much more power far beyond that of my own we could have made use of that method huh that method what do you mean Martin do listen to me Martin boom are you really sure you want to ignore me I've read my father's news I know how to seal you back in that ball yes yes good that's right listen majin buu here is your first order I want you to kill those two over there I don't know if I can win but one thing's for sure he can't be left alone Pete gets out of here the body-count could reach catastrophic levels [Applause] it's now or never [Music] handle this guy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is this guy invisible or something [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] my thank God mas ANCA [Music] [Music] [Music] he's unbelievable nothing's hurting them drugs which one's the Majin it's me I don't know any of these guys Oh in margin boo feel free to finish the Supreme Kai off [Music] Devorah you're still alive lord bhavati this creature margin poo is not like the others he will not serve you as your loyal servant he must be eliminated immediately what's going on the spells broken what are you two doing here what about you guys what are you doing here well we were statues until just now but it looks like that creeper spit on us died and everyone's back to normal hmm [Music] what is this unbelievable energy no it can't be is that majin buu majin buu devour this fool as well [Music] Vegeta was empowered by poverty spell and more determined than ever remained locked in fierce combat with Goku in the midst of the battle the two Saiyans began to sense a massive energy that suddenly appeared in the distance realizing the energy must belong to majin buu Goku pleaded with Vegeta to stop the fight so they could focus on defeating the new threat Vegeta knew Goku would no longer be able to concentrate on their battle so he agreed or so it seemed it was just a lie to make Goku lower his guard with Goku distracted Vegeta knocked him unconscious he then made his way to majin buu z' location ready to fight the Menace he helped bring back into existence margin boos free because of me so I'll be the one to get rid of him [Music] I'll settle the score with you after that that is if I make it back alive right time to go meet this majin buu face to face [Music] [Music] Gohan's Energy's already gone this is my fault [Music] that's it huh I might as well destroy it while I can [Music] Oh blast it what in the world is going on hey there Vegeta what have you done I don't recall telling you to destroy my ship so that fat bastard with the ugly mug is majin buu huh you you killed Gohan didn't you [Music] it means he thinks you have a strange face I'm not going to hell on my own [Music] I'm taking you all with me prepare yourself [Music] prepare yourself [Applause] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] freak [Music] prepare yourself prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] Oh majin buu needs to be taken care of but you're the real cause behind all this poverty ah [Music] [Applause] are you okay Vegeta dad hang in there thanks my son take good care of your mom for me what are you talking about dad what do you mean take good care of mom you need to get as far away from here as you can I'm going to fight majin buu on my own no way we're gonna fight too the three of us can take him down for sure trunks I haven't given you a single hug since the day you were born have I huh come here son what are you doing dad cut it out you're embarrassing me take care trunks why'd you why'd you do that why'd you hit drugs take these to as far away from here as you can I'm counting on piccolo you're prepared to die aren't you just tell me one thing if I die will I be able to seek a corrodes in the other world I'm afraid not you've killed too many innocent people when you die you'll lose your body and your soul will be carried off to a different world I see that's too bad now get out of here hurry wait majin buu you're going to have to defeat me first you got that fight me you brain-dead balloon I finally know how to get rid of you once and for all hey what in the world is Vegeta doing he's gonna get himself killed for the first time ever was finally fighting to protect someone other than himself throwing his life away to make sure you can't put yourself back together I'm going to blow you into microscopic pieces [Music] farewell [Music] here take these two I'm going to see what happened okay I see so if majin buu only takes a small amount of damage his cells can regenerate to prevent that Vegeta sacrificed himself to blow majin buu into a trillion pieces we were saved by him of all people poverty you're still alive guess I'll have to fix that don't tell me Majin booth fragments there Marcin Boo is still alive Harry up and heal me what what are you waiting for would you want me to seal you up again [Applause] good we're done Barton bill that green fool and those two rats have messed with me for the last time they will learn to fear the great poverty and Martin boo reduce this planet to a desolate hell escape margin boo yes many of the pigs as it takes to flush those cretins out of hiding he's not dead what your booster did wait Vegeta sacrificed himself for nothing it's not safe here on the surface get the kids and everyone else to commies look out right now these two are the planets last chance the slim as it may be [Music] our [Music] I can sense ma jambu's energy but I can't sense Vegeta's anywhere don't tell me Vegeta couldn't have gotten himself killed I don't sense Gohan's energy either what's going on piccolo and krillen are both alive they aren't stone anymore okay they should know what's going on I'd bet on that where would they be a commies lookout maybe [Music] majin buu wonder what kind of monster he is Hey Goku is that really you Goku you're alive yeah I was hoping you could tell me what's going on [Music] [Music] unbelievable go on in the Supreme Kai this is too much even Vegeta was taken down budget boost power it's far greater than the Supreme Kai initially feared it would be if we don't act fast all life in the universe let alone here on earth will be completely wiped out of existence well not all hope is lost we've still got you Goku if anyone can beat majin buu then it's you I'll be honest that's not gonna happen I can't beat him yeah me and Vegeta were pretty much matched as far as power goes majin buu he had no problem taking everything Vegeta threw his way there's no way around it I don't stand a chance [Music] really wow man this stinks if either Gohan or Vegeta were still alive we might have had a real chance to do something I don't think so no we're gonna need more than just numbers against this guy he really is that strong yeah that's not what I meant I'm talking about fusion fusion what's that fusion warrior two people merge right that's a special technique used by the meta morons you know about that and you're right I learned the technique from the meta more and I met another world two people are about the same size and roughly equal and strength they can combine with each other do you understand what this means two people can form one person with way more power than either of the original two are capable of by themselves there is one thing you really need to keep in mind apparently you can only stay combined for 30 minutes now it makes sense I think I understand you were hoping to fuse with either Gohan or Vegeta if one of them was alive you'd form the ultimate warrior and be able to fight majin buu but fortunately go on to Vegeta they're both gone [Music] so this is the worst-case scenario isn't it so tenant hops they could fuse hey that's a great idea mr. Popo [Music] yeah we could do that that'll work piccolo I'm gonna do whatever I possibly can to teach the fusion technique to the kids it's gonna take some time at some point in all of this I'll need you to take over for me fine we got it [Music] this is good there's hope for us yet [Music] those kids might be able to pull this off right but understand it's going to take quite a while before go tenant trunks are able to perform the technique the time this will take something others don't have a lot of people could die before that happens everyone on the planet even the planet itself might be wiped out before then this is a long shot but we've got no other choice you're right about that even if all of humanity gets wiped out we've still got the Dragon Balls to bring everyone back [Music] what's going on you got dark all of a sudden [Music] wait is that it's someone summon Shenron wait but who pull ahead all of the dragonballs last right but she doesn't know the situation what's she doing of course yeah that's right Vegeta killed a bunch of people at the world tournament Palma's gonna ask Shenron to bring them all back oh no if she makes all three wishes now we'll have to wait another year I'll go try to stop her just as Goku had predicted Bulma and the others had summoned Chevron to bring back all those killed by Vegeta the first wish had already been granted but Goku was able to prevent the last two wishes from being used Shenron disappeared and the Dragon Balls scattered inert for the next four months Goku then warped the confused group to commies lookout where they would then all be safe from Majin boos onslaught you [Music] here we have an individual brought back to life with the Dragon Balls I'm certain I was killed by da Barra but was I brought back to life how can that be what's going on work where is the supreme kai who brought he's still alive [Music] no Supreme Kai Supreme Kai thank goodness I wasn't too late what are you doing here I saw you die you were born to pieces indeed I too am uncertain how I was able to come back that's right capito we have to hurry go on Xin danger oh we have to prevent Gohan from dying at all costs [Music] hmm it looks like we've come to his aid without a moment to spare thank goodness Kabhi doh we should restore Gohan strength once we're back in the land of the Kai's huh do you mean to tell me we are going to allow a mortal to step foot in our holy land yes now we need to hurry he doesn't have much longer right right kai kai what what the huh [ __ ] am i this is the land of the Kai's our homeworld wait what your whole world yes this is a holy land that even the gods and Kai's let alone mortals were not to enter wait I thought you died do you have the ability to revive yourself unfortunately no my revival is just as much a mystery to me as it is to you why am I here we hope you'll be able to use the Z sword to defeat majin buu [Music] you should have what it takes to utilize that sword and its power huh the Z sword are you sure about this supreme kai Versys sword is not a weapon that a mere mortal could ever wield not possible neither I nor countless other supreme Kai's could ever make use of the legendary sword as you were dead Kebede oh you haven't seen how truly remarkable Gohan's power is at any rate we should at least try come with me you'll need some more suitable clothes [Music] huh capito and i are wearing matching outfits that's kind of embarrassing [Music] that's the Z sword this is the Z sword huh now please try to remove it to the best of my knowledge no one has been able to remove this blade so I just need to pull it out huh sounds like something out of a storybook so I'm supposed to pull out this Z sword but then what happens legends say you will be imbued with immense power perhaps even enough power to destroy majin buu what really I guess that means this thing's pretty sharp conness you can't remove the sword so you have nothing to fear [Music] kebede oh please be quiet Gohan miss concentrate please go on try to remove the sword huh all right here goes it's no use I won't budge all right let's try this then [Music] Super Saiyan well I doubt that'll change anything yeah it's no use several Supreme Kai's before you have tried and also failed to remove the blade why would a mere mortal succeed hmm look he did it but I can't believe it [Music] [Music] I'm just gonna cut straight to the chase okay Goten and Trunks are both fine but Dohan and vegeta they were killed by majin buu vitina no he can't listen to me people I [Applause] am using magic to speak to all of you telepathically now close your eyes I have something I'd like to show you my name is poverty and I am a terrifying and powerful wizard and this here is my loyal servant but even more frightening majin buu what is this are you seeing this too hey what kind of freaky crap is this I've run into a bit of trouble today you see and now I'm looking for three troublemakers this one this one how did this one if we cannot find these three fools to show you what will happen alright majin buu do it monster what has he done I will warn you one more time you must tell me where those three are if you do not we will exterminate every last one of you five days from now [Music] damned bug-eyed bastard so those are the guys that killed Vegeta and go on we can't let there be any more casualties I'm going to confront them no think about it if you die on us there won't be anyone to teach Goten and Trunks how to fuse we have the Dragon Balls we can use them to repair any damage done and bring back anybody that's been killed get it fine [Music] stop it now is not the time for tears if you want to avenge them focus on learning this new technique you got it let's get started everybody pay close attention all right time to learn how to fuse people I've just received some very interesting information [Music] one of the three troublemakers I'm searching for trunks supposedly lives at a place called capsule corporation in West City I think we might head there next for everyone's sake he it better be there I would show myself if I were you trunks your home won't be around much longer if you don't oh no my grandpa and grandma are still at the house [Music] Goku did you hear that just now my mom and dad are done for it'll be fine Bulma we'll bring them back with the Dragon Balls oh you don't get it if my lab gets destroyed so does the dragon radar the radar requires special parts but you can't just get anywhere which means we won't be able to summon Shenron what that is a problem all right trunks hurry back home and try to find the dragon radar okay I'll try to stop poverty and majin buu as long as I can't are you sure are you just gonna get your butt kicked hmm I can distract them for at least a little bit anyway hurry before they get to West City [Music] you
