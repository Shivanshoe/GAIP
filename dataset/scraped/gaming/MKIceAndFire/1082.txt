I didn't see any of them get off the beach Musil should be in the cemetery good you're here you're ready to steal some food for us is this everyone just the men who can fight worth a damn the rest are too hungry or sick let's hope we're enough to raid the fort there's a better chance of seeing cherry blossoms in winter than getting that food there's always a way preferably one that doesn't kill half my men my scouts back come on a lot of men inside and a signal at the top of the tower if they call reinforcements from the day will be trapped they'll cut us to pieces find a place to watch for me once I destroy their signal attack they'll kill you if they do avenge me and take their food that's not funny watch the tower for my signal if you say so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] need to signal the others they'll see me like the brazier it's time [Music] juvenile [Music] [Music] bastard [Applause] [Music] Celeste [Music] let's get him in something to eat where's all the food and then see any in a tower did you find anything just a stack of manga papers on a dead officer let me see you read Mongolian if it's in Chinese I can make out some of it since when since I had to read Sun Tzu this was only a temporary depot they're taking everything offshore before time that there will never get out to them we got in here look crazy [Music] what did you have in mind let's see what we're up against the Mongols have small boats on the beach because still one we'd have to cut through their army too many barriers in archers a frontal attack would be suicide I want my men far away from the enemy's line flaming arrow might set off those explosives that will get their attention but we need them to look away from the beach put your archers on that cliff the Mongols will focus and then what we still a boat all right men they don't know we took the fort so they'll be waiting for reinforcements that aren't coming keep them busy long enough for us to steal a boat then retreat into the forest look for my torch that's your signal to attack let's find a way down to the beach you heard you though that's movie won't let you down watching you fight back there reminded me of Lord Nogales tournaments you did whatever it took to win it was a competition you fought just as hard you know what are you getting at nothing just remember we'll talk about this later if we survive your men should be in position like the Doge I knew they'd come through look at that fire [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we need to move quickly take an oar no one tried to sink us your men destructed the ship's crew - nothing I never knew our duo bothered you so much now you do no luck you should have told me earlier no food here any sign of food not here maybe on the next ship that I live guys no way around Surprise them greetings nice [ __ ] we have to move fast [Music] [Music] archers on the next ship watchable into you [Music] [Music] muggles take them [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if the food isn't here it has to be on the other ship you search here I'll take the other be careful I've got got boo or old gives you something [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what's in here these look like battle plants it'll go find your easel no sign of any fluid it has to be something [Music] all the food they've stolen from us you saw [Music] I think us [Music] to me [Music] I would have heard that mangu if you hadn't shown up I know did you see how big he was that's where all our food went [Music] now booting off food though you have to go to swim fire spreading jump let's get out of sight they're still hunting us as the good hiding spot the head I promised my men I defeat them and I'm going back empty-handed we'll find another way but how many will I lose before then I found something that might help Mongol battle plants do they show supply lines one page has a map it's a start ended over we do this together you've got your home problems and I am their leader I need this Jeep and I'll need you at castle Canada you'll have me don't let them see you coming just like you [Music] I need to find more allies that's my cookie [Music] [Music] a single drop of does your bow need work my lord your arrows will strike like deadly Falcons farewell I can help improve your plates level permit me to refine your armor my lord nothing stronger my lord I hear samurai are skilled in the art of haiku I would go myself skilled but yes I write them there's a poet in here she Springs said he once wrote with your uncle I'm sure he has much to share I'll be sure to check on him I work metals woods and cloth only the best for you I'm sorry I need more for that yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] tell us where the others are I told you I'm traveling alone if you want to live and stop lying [Music] [Music] [Applause] has to be him [Music] [Music] [Applause] yeah centuries ago the war Aadhaar you save awesome obey come pirates I don't please join me sounds like you have an interesting tale to tell but I'm surprised to find you in a thermal we both call where we're needed Lord Sakai my story is for your years as well sentries appalled that I or II na goal was the greatest Archer on our island famed for his wisdom and perfect aim the commie hajiman himself was so impressed he gave the archer his armor light and strong beyond compare in those days cruel pirates raided the coast they threatened the town of ASIMO bay with annihilation the people fled to safety but today or effaced the pirates alone wearing his mythic armor the Pirates stormed the town that I orry's arrows tore through them few survived but not one blow pissed coyotes armored years later today or he died peacefully at home but his armor mysteriously vanished some say his descendants guarded still awaiting the rise of a warrior to defend Tsushima once more a little writing about today Ori that survives refers to a violet crown a place in the north of Assam all strewn with violent chrysanthemums where today Ori would often meditate [Music] driving the Mongols from our home is all I care about this armor could help if it's as good as you say is almost without equal I know and I believe it is still out there find the violet crown looking for me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come here and fight [Music] [Music] stand and fight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'll never forget the day he was killed [Music] I could have saved my father if only I was older stronger if I wasn't so afraid [Music] can't sleep not since I heard about those masked men hiding in a bamboo forest of Yoshi there's plenty to fear without worrying about folktales hmm it's no folktale my lord they call themselves protectors of the greater chicken his longbow try to rest I'll find out who these masked men really are the musician in Yoshi Springs can tell you more but be careful my lord some believe Shih Tzu knees cursed lives on fathered chrysanthemums a musician who told me the legend of hello he mentioned he could lead to the violet crowd [Music] [Music] nobody's armor could be here incense burned recently something inside that container map to Toyota's rest [Music] more by the casinos is resting in the house this are to share the client must be another way in a map like the one from the violet crown Tavarez vest whose grave Saffy's the emblem of Clan na go tavares clan times rushing river slows today Yuri's mind at rest one drawn bow pierces many same incense from the violet crown lit recently

trespass on that IOT sacred ground you dishonor talionis legacy thief [Music] we should be fighting Mongols not each other you're nothing but a scavenger old my lord my name is kaya day last of categories line I heard that samurai were all killed assumed you were a scavenger and no thief but I seek your ancestors Ouma and you deserve to wear it Lord Sakai but the armors lost and you have no way to find it there is a line from an old scroll today Yuri watches over Azam obey for eternity I suspect it's a clue to where he hid the armor padai oles armor gave him great speed and deadly aim
