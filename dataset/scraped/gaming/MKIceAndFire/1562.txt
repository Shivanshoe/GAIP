[Music] what are beasts what flickers in the man's eye when you hear the word I would wager that most of you visualize the dare that now walk among us those vacant eyes clouded over those devouring mouths always sack and the smell and that probably comes to mind to rot some of you may conjure up a beast of the field a bull or a slide wishing their finest cuts were upon your plate fewer still might consider the beasts of the wild a black bear wading across a stream a nasty swamp Gator more than a century old drifting through the bow searcher hungry for a critter with warm blood to sink our teeth into the nature of the beast is not what I'm asking you to contemplate what I encourage you to maul over for the moment is what beasts all have in common big small fearsome or timid the common thread between them all is the limit Oh hmm think about that a beast is limited in thought a beast has a one-track mind of beasts thinks only about its own survival it doesn't care about anything else so allow me to pose a question are we simply beasts are we so beaten down so base that they're only pursuit we can conceive is survival are we no longer capable of dreaming of creation have we so completely blinded ourselves to the great achievements of our glorious path that we are willing to let it all disintegrate into dust because we are afraid to die the way I see it the answer to every single one of these questions should be a resounding no if he keeps on me where is she nobody seems to know the rumors are wide and wild I can barely keep track of them all let's begin with the most unlikely mama is a ghost she has never existed mama is a fabrication created by those truly at the cruel heart of the tower collective to serve as a symbol under which the unifier they're impressionable masses next we have mama is dead followed closely by she is deathly ill then of course one of my personal favorites mama is afraid of her people so she hides knowing that the towers time as the dominant voice of NOLA is drawing to a close its collapse imminent once the blindly obedient finally realized there is so much more for them beyond the oppressive war now I must admit I have never laid eyes on mama myself my time on their side of the wall was brief as a mayfly the towers ways do not reward those who believed in the power of autonomous thought but whatever you believe there is an undeniable truth the tower is in decline their philosophy their lack of vision and their cruelty have ensured their own doom as mama seen it already the end surely someone of her acumen can write the ship set the tower back on a benevolent course and yet it appears that mama has abandoned her flock why has she chosen to withdraw when the tower is so desperately in need of strong leadership isn't it obvious New Orleans mama knows she's already lost she knows that we the reclaimed have set hearts and minds a flame with new possibilities she knows that she can no longer compete she knows the time has come to let go but there are those among her ranks I'm told who have taken it upon themselves to double down on the failures of the tower to clean the world views that no longer hold any relevance despite the reticence of their formerly esteemed leader sounds to me like the inmates have taken over the asylum is that where you want to place your trust to New Orleans with a so-called community that sees you as nothing more than an expendable cog in their ever grinding machine wouldn't it be wiser to embrace a philosophy that embraces the humanity that sieves in sorry chand every one of you mama is done with you those loyal to her and her broken ideologies will find any excuse to dispose you retake control of your own destiny my friends find your way to the reclaimed we believe in you if you keep solving what our beasts ah vacation you there yeah always here always thinking my mind is always swirling with something these days it's impossible to shut it down doesn't make sense to get all worked up if you want to survive you need to focus steady your mind yeah well I guess but you know hey this morning I realized something I can't even remember the last time I saw the sky it's been a while at least that much I know mmm months wish I would have paid more attention you ever been to the Badlands up in South Dakota never been oh that's a shame like another planet my mom used to drive me through there every summer on the way to see my uncle the night sky was so bright so many stars like a dome overhead crystal clear view of the cosmos and put a lot of things in perspective for me back when I really needed it how insignificant we really are the grand scheme of things now my troubles no matter how big they may seem really don't mean squat what our troubles anyway huh the universe doesn't know the meaning of the word I wish I had that bad land sky overhead right about now you know the first thing I'm gonna do when free is head back north I think I've had enough of swamp life [Music] you mentioned your mom and your uncle my uncle died a while ago I miss him a ton we were friends I looked up to him they never really knew my dad so there he kind of stepped in what he could my mom and I we didn't always get along no clue what happened to my mom actually when I left home and joined the guard we won't speak English with me she never thought too much of me didn't think I'd ever amount to anything verdict is still out I suppose what was the problem with you and your mom typical only child [ __ ] smothering me one second cut me down the next I hated her for it reminded her of my dad so she hated me for that look Torah stop I've had enough of terapy session I don't feel like talking anymore I'm gonna go put my head down for a bit I'll talk to you soon [Applause] [Music] med supply located the shallows you [Music] maybe ma isn't she maybe moi is a liar and a thief she was any to further her own selfish agenda do not be fooled she will not help you she will go I considered her family treated her as if she was flesh and blood yet she did not hesitate to betray me she tried to turn my dearest and most loyal friends against me how her treachery knows no bounds she is desperate and will do the same to you do not be fooled maybe noir is a menace she should be shunned if you assist in any way of the tower we do not wish this do not force our hand the tower will always stand [Music] [Music] I just don't know what to do I just found my sister and she hasn't eaten in a week but do you have any food I could bring her I'm begging you just a couple of bites ah Oh [Music] I'm taking just a couple of bites thank you from the bottom of our hearts at I want you to have this ah [Music] morning sunshine your round I'm here Casey what's up I've located another flow regulator we needed to repair the second pump and guess what I woke up this morning with water up to my ankles so that sucks time is slipping away from me faster than I expected hope you took swimming lessons as a kid you're a real comedian tourist if you're through the jokes and feel like helping out a guy staring down at cold creeping death the regulator is in by water blue-collar Park Town warehouses auto repair shops small homes shoved in where possible there's a huge lumberyard there too from what I heard through tower radio chatter a bunch of valuable machinery was discovered in a storeroom no specific stone you're gonna have to poke around oh and I looked into the key you mentioned I hate to say it but we needed only way to access the final pump station so you should keep things cool with May for the time being what do you think of me well it's hard to tell the tower is really going after her spreading all kinds of unflattering words I don't trust much coming from them I guess the verdict on May is still out for me and what about you so far she's held up her end of the bargain when I help her out that's a solid sign yeah and hopefully things will stay that way and hey I want you to know how much I appreciate what you're doing for me it's nice to know someone has my back for once beginning to believe I actually might survive this there was a time when now never mind I I'm trying to keep the dark thoughts out [Music] ease up on the sentimentality Casey you know what I expect from all this better be worth it it is trust me just hit me up when you snag the pump mark from Bywater I'll do my best to stay dry in the meantime might try to elevate my Coniston feet so I don't wake up floating talk to you soon tourists stay safe up there Oh [Music] you
