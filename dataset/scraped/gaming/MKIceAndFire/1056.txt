the samurai are here who goes there i'm lord sakai you must be your reinforcements that is correct i am lord sadamone to the shogun welcome to tsushima thank you lord sakai the shogun dispatched us the moment we received your message your uncle just issued the order we're to ride to battle defeat the khan and reclaim kasumura from the mongol invaders excellent now your men i need to check on someone first i'll wait for you by the northern gate then we'll ride to meet your uncle together my lord anything to offer from your hunting goodbye [Music] not quite my lord i just finished leading them in meditation samurai the people of yarikawa every spirit needs a moment of quiet before battle to accept the impermanence of life and the possibility of death wise words will you meditate with me it would be my honor check those wheels i see you're hard at work someone's got to make sure the battering ram is ready for battle the this thing falls apart there's no way we're breaking into your uncle's castle if only we'd had one to breach osumobi you didn't like hiding in my car i didn't like reeking of sake you not told me about taka he's up there for faster than i ever was if tucker were here i'm sure he'd disagree well i'll try not to let him down welcome back lord sakai sensei i see you've met our reinforcements the sjogren's bannermen are elite warriors but even they would benefit from archery practice and the peasants impressive in raw talent if not in skill high praise coming from you yarikawa used to be the backbone of our island we could send the mongols running for their boats with a month of heavy training you have one hour then you should stop distracting me gin i didn't know you returned i hope you're not being too hard on them lady muscle they can take it the yeti peasants are hardier than they look stubborn too more stubborn than you not a chance a week ago they would have spit on the name sakai and arachi but after what you did in yetikawa they're here because of you then i won't disappoint them nor will i it's time you know the samurai are here everyone's preparing for battle did you get some rest i couldn't i'm sorry tucker should be here he believed in you now so do the people of yarikoa because you stood up for them when no one else would they're risking their lives for the ghost [Music] i will give my life for the people of tsushima and for you let's hope it doesn't come to that take care you know i need to meet loruga i'll see you on the battlefield where's my uncle waiting for you atop the hill clan oga would be honored to escort you to his post i'm glad for the company we'd better not keep the khan waiting splendid to be commended lotsakai to rescue your uncle then recruit the yarikawa outcasts they may not be trained warriors but i trust them with my life then i will do the same is it true the people have a name for you ghost they needed something to believe in after the samurai were defeated now the samurai are back it's time we put these folktales to bed and re-establish shogun's law it's time we save this island and the people who call it home politics can wait until the khan is dead of course your nephew has arrived up here ugh you've done well jin we now have everyone we need to reclaim my castle i dealt with the straw hats but rizzo escaped with a corner they wanted me to betray you you spoke to the khan i was captured if i'd known i would have marched my entire army to save you yuna helped me escape but her brother he died with honor khan will pay for his sacrifice and for all you've endured [Music] a shogun formally supports my decision to adopt you when our island is saved you will be here to clean shimura [Music] not as a ghost [Music] i won't disappoint you uncle today we ride into battle as sakai tomorrow we celebrate victory as father and son samurai pride themselves on their honor code but it also makes them rigid predictable easy to break ghost has no limits this makes him dangerous this is our moment gene the fate of our island hangs on this battle we will take the khan's head together and personally deliver it to the shogun warriors of tsushima today we defeat cotton khan retake castle and drive the mongols from our home follow lord to victory kill them all back down fight [Music] [Music] yes this is for my sons [Music] [Music] food [Music] hmm [Music] uh everyone

gate your uncle was wrong i can't make him understand we'll die if we don't change we still have a long way to go oh for the mongols oh [Music] kill them all [Music] guys and then [Music] behind you look the bridge they're falling back the khan wouldn't give up like this something's wrong [Music] open fire explosives oh those poor souls we sent them to die for nothing we must honor their sacrifice gather our best soldiers we will repair the bridge and attack a dawn no we've lost too many if you had listened to me often there is another way we will discuss it alone so the mongols are on the defensive we will strike before they regroup and end this war tomorrow you sent our men to die they are soldiers their blood is on our hands i can find a way past the bridge poison the enemy an act of terror i am trying to save our people by teaching them to fear us if you continue down this path you will be no better than the mongols i trained you to fight with honor honor died on the beach the khan deserves to suffer you were ruled by your emotion i sacrificed everything i knew to save our people i gave them hope you did nothing no we're finished so your protection is my duty i have no way to strengthen your armor lord sakai kenji what are you doing here trying to help the but the best i can offer is a stiff drink how do you comfort someone who's just lost his arm i don't know taka always knew what to say hmm i miss the damn kid we all do get some rest huh i'll try you survived many weren't so fortunate i wasn't there when my sons died but i'm doing what i can to ease these boys into the next life lord shimra wants to press our attack at sunrise if there's another strategy one that saves someone's children there may be do what you must you'll have my support so sakai i worried you fell at the bridge it was close the blast knocked me to the ground and carried these brave warriors to the afterlife we'll give them a proper burial once we've taken the castle you think there's still a chance there is always a chance don't lose hope never my lord focus keep practicing sensei lord shimra plans to repair the bridge we strike a dawn no the khan won't expect such a bone move hesitation could cost us even more lives there may be another way one that violates your uncle's honor code one that saves people's lives carefully sakai you disagree i didn't say that they're patching the bridge on your uncle's orders lord shimra is determined to see his plan through no matter how many lives it costs these people came here to fight for you how much wolf spain can you find in the next hour a few handfuls talk to the others tell them to gather all you can carry you're going to poison the mongols i'll find a way into the castle and slip it into their drinks watch the khan choke on his own blood your uncle's going to find out i know tucker was making something for you i wasn't sure you'd want it but now if something happens it won't he'd want you to have it this is all the wolf spin we found will it be enough i'll make sure it is if i reach that tower i can scout the khan's forces find a way to poison his army oh [Music] uh better take out the gods quietly that i can scout from the top floor [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh uh foreign that was clear now look for a way to poison all of them the garden path light defenses plenty of cover a straw hat of course

can't defeat the mongols together after everything you've done tell the people i was just spy santa came to khan's trust they'll believe the ghost up you're my oldest friend do so surrender an answer for your crimes for both our sakes [Music] i can't you should have surrendered i won't die by your uncle's hand [Music] you won't stop the poison you broke your uncle's coat you left me no choice i'll never forgive you [Music] [Music] um goodbye usually [Music] [Music] [Music] good the castle is yours the khan marches north we can head him off you can find me i did what i had to for them is this
