deck is there a bigger problem than we thought I need something to stop them I finished my analysis of the Decker's network and infrastructure to determine the needed processing power and hardware requirements for accessing a mainframe I worked really hard and know what we need to go after the Decker what do you need me well my place has all the data I guess you could come here I mean makes sense right I've seen your place before Kinsey got my inner sanctum right you can hit the light it's homey I don't see a bed sleep is forbidden what the [ __ ] did the deck is do to the choppa Matt musta hacked into its flight computer and fried it with an EMP you can do that you can do a lot worse if Matt gets the Decker you snap plugged into its central power grid it's trust me it's bad I said how do we know the deck ace if I could worm into their mainframe I'd do all sorts of naughty things but I don't have to care for that what would you need something like this that's one of the most powerful learning computers in North America and Staggs got one wait that punk kid is Matt people are probably halfway to the computer right now go [Music] Kinzie where's the computer but that be on center hurry so you and Chandi would be to buy a little punk like milk you kidding me I'll have a cup to crashed that sounds like you lost to me go on laugh it up are you there yet calm down we'll get there don't worry he won't yNN's is a little high-strung don't you think for someone who spends months of a time played to a monitor I'm surprised she's still saying he's sure she's doing she looks like the decklist art at the park well guess what clashing it thank you have a lot of tech in here I can tell one thing from the other where's the flooding computer oh don't you dare I don't want that thing anywhere near my computer is off-limits really course not have you gone mental going after the truck you [Music] so you sat right almost I need a chair I'll give you 50 bucks pick out nice one funny I'll explain it all once this thing set up [Music] [Music] you we're not ready for you yet well how long will it be depends on if that's your boy if only can get the processors to overlock beautiful give me a second yeah that's great can we worry about the deck is now sure come on damn it finally I'll explain it again real slow I want to broadcast your subconscious into the Decker user net then you'll be able to interact with the avatars abusers and corrupt the abstract representations of data that are the cornerstone of their online operation to do that I need an emo chair of course a wall chair near more neurological electromagnetic or narrow scope a KGB destroyed the only one in existence Decker's have one impossible how could they miss the signal they're keeping it here clover okay nerd time is over what is this thing and Kinzie for [ __ ] sake keep it simple I need the chair to stop the Decker's thank you [Music] once we get to the nuclear plant I'll need to cut the external power up links which is willing to take the chair well we could if you want all its circuitry to fry as we try to disconnect it from the power grid probably not the best idea yeah [Music] no thanks come on some tech knowledge that that's what the kids lie right not interesting you don't like easy listening [ __ ] Dean then one ag's rock death metal our core gangster rap get the [ __ ] I mean on stag night [Music] all right here's the powerup link locations keep the Decker's often you while I disable each one this looks like it finding the time to shut down this power node you got it do this all day mind keeping it down out there you're joking sorta that's one two more to go beautiful bugger never any shot how's it going in there two down last one and we're in business data guy who did that Saints gobblers maybe you're as good as they say all right that's it now can we go in and get this chair nope now we go up in a helicopter a helicopter they could be keeping the chair anywhere I have to training doing its exact location first boys Scottie [Applause] all right we have to play around the area for this just do whatever it is you do and I'll take care of the rest asking for a [ __ ] lesson a break you find anything yet Kinzie power output coming first late so it's hard to get a lock on a care no [ __ ] it's a power play any more time good it's right under the main cooling tower boy let's go get just cute and you have to take the quick way the Dicker's may already be destroying the Kiva's oh yeah jump yeah I mean Kinsey got the chair from their system by disabling the router connection so press the off button on the consoles these minute dude in here played in the next World War could I do now faint silly router things he shut down what is still plugged in cut that link to [Music] [Music] [ __ ] you know if that chair thing is ready and I don't know why ask me talk to cam via only cuz you I can understand I think they're fed they be done pretty so we can probably head over whatever alright see you when I get there I'm a badass [Applause] you you ready to [ __ ] things up in virtual reality you safer than being shown time you can survive a gunshot but if your mind takes too much shock in this chair he'll go brain dead right blarin Kunze I know you ready let's do it you all right you should be seeing a visual representation of the daiquiri usenet now what I see kingsy all I see is a I'm a bloody come out sorry about that money motive another I thought you knew are you doing and if you haven't hurry yet that was just temporary I'll seem to have a distinct lack of arms linked to the data asserted out soon have you lost your mind clicking painting you big baby [Applause] that could just get lost that's better okay leave me out this is my I wanted to say as I see fate not yours alright looks like Matt doesn't want you punky around here you'll have to work your way through his defenses but state of Iowa first
