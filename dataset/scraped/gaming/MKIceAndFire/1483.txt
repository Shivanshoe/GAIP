[Music] I've felt that a little isn't this fun just who are you I am the deep-sea King as lord of the clan of the sea folk I rule the deep sea and I rule everything in this world as well do you dare defy me too you think you have the strength to rule the entire surface all alone you should have lived quietly with your brethren at the bottom of the sea for oh then I suppose you must die that's my line I would have let you live Oh show me the respect I do I'm no hero but I going to be [Music] your attacks don't hurt even a little he's faster bigger and stronger even so would exploding shark

ten with this game I'm bored already I know I don't have a snowball's chance in hell but I still have to fight I'm the only one left it's not about winning or losing it's about me taking you on right here right now we believe in you you can do it hang in there Moomin rider come on beat that monster you're our only hope waste him [Applause] stop your blathering and just die already grass [Music] I think not you did fine nice fight anyway now I'm gonna pound this SI freak or whatever it's called I heard that cue ball ready to join your mangled friend each and every one of you Simeon meatbags will die grizzly now you stand among the ranks of the strong he [Music] what did you see that that was amazing who is that guy that was what just happened I don't believe it he did it we're saved think I floored him with one hit one punch just one punch we're saved how did he do that the other heroes barely scratched it is he really classy he's so strong we're still alive hey you alright I'm still breathing but maybe that monster wasn't really that strong after all bought it beat all those heroes that just means those heroes were wimps huh maybe well I suppose the monster didn't look all that tough when he killed it after all a Class C hero took it out with a single punch the heroes who got stomped must really suck they may call themselves Class A or Class S or whatever but their titles don't mean a thing hey cut it out will ya they risk their lives for us risk their lives anyone can do that but to be a hero you gotta actually be monsters a boatload of heroes were seriously injured this time that monster tore through them can you really rely on the next time we need their help sure we survived so it worked out in the end but it's annoying when wimpy heroes who are really just average joes show up and try to save you I wish to just stop if they're gonna call themselves heroes they better actually help us maybe it's time to shut up ah why are you getting mad at me our money is what funds the hero Association right as long as we're paying for it they better protect us that's their job the fact of the matter is that bald guy pretty much took care of it all by himself so all the other heroes died for nothing I said shut up anyone could come up with a way to buy a little time in the end the other heroes didn't do anything heroic did they we were all saved okay just leave it at that yeah exactly true the other heroes didn't do much I mean maybe they didn't do anything at all but you don't have to add insult to injury today's my lucky day good for me the other heroes wore the monster down so beating that gross sea thing was child's play I barely did a thing and now I get all the credit awesome good thing I was late right Hey all of you get out there and spread the word I'm the one who finished the monster off this guy right here doesn't matter how got it and I'll beat the snot out anyone who says it's only because I got here late you hear me huh what's he talking about so the monster had been softened up I mean that's what he says but the other heroes may have worn it down they were fighting pretty hard but still one punch how do you win with one punch wait a second ah that Saitama he's the hero from city see that everyone calls a cheat I'm sure of it I knew I'd seen him before what a cheat well no one's sure about that yet hey I heard of him too he appeared out of nowhere and climbed the ranks superfast sounds fishy he just swooped in at the end but his rank will go up anyway but still one punch that's crazy the other heroes were getting pummeled like that new guy Jennison Moomin writer who leads Class C and then this guy he just comes swooping in and grabs all the glory seriously that's just low he might not be achieved ever consider that hey you guys look after the Fallen Heroes okay I need them alive they die on me how am I gonna cash in on their work yeah geez maybe he is a cheat man that's not fair exactly compared to him the other heroes really are heroic they're amazing where would we be now if the other heroes hadn't fought yeah these heroes deserve our heartfelt thanks you
