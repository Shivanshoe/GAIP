castillo's army that means he's better trained quicker with the trigger and a tough this fort is the most protected base on the island these soldiers have been issued with body armor and helmets nothing armor-piercing rounds can't handle use the workbench if you need to craft some and then go snatch that uranium dany that parachute i gave you could come in handy here just don't drop into the middle of the fort okay huh now is is and they will see the vision through what is the difference between a true a suffers from chaos oh okay i heard the key they should get me juan's uranium oh the

like a rocket launcher see she does that too one more thing i want you to meet tostador the two go together like fire and fury so do i or a great sandwich are you just hungry one yes but i'm talking about layers danny head to the workbench and i'll show you hello my friend supremos aren't just simple tools of destruction danny they carry gadgets that can make your dreams of chaos come true let's take a look at that supremo the special ingredient that makes this all happen is supremo bond you needed to make your gadgets pick a gadget danny this is a safe space there's no wrong answer here excellent now go talk to clara time to give that supremo a workout now go talk to clara time to put that supremo to use you better be willing to die for our cause got a job for you this will work as long as they don't kill each other got to act on this no i don't need to tell you that viviro is a lifeblood of castillo's regime he's built world camps to produce it all over yara these plantations use outcasts as slaves to grow the tobacco plants they turn into vegito these are our people danny beaten tortured sprayed by poison chemicals there's a camp on this island we tried to destroy it when we invaded we failed now we're going to finish the job julio is waiting for you at a nearby barn hit that slave camp they need time to breathe after you use them you know so they don't overload and kill you could have told me before i strapped onto my back just let that supremo feed off the blood of your enemies what you'll get it danny you'll get it huh uh so huh uh uh huh child huh finally listen i'm not going to you i wanted to do this alone but clara gave me an order i can handle myself don't give a so could lita she should be here right now but instead i get you and i'm supposed to be in miami but instead my two best friends are dead and i'm stuck here with you so truce enough talk step one we hit the tobacco step two we destroy their poison supply step three we get the out of there and castillo gets a nice pretty message from liberta got it take this gear it'll protect you from fire and more importantly castillo's poison using the right protective gear in the right situation will keep you alive yeah right tool for the right job i've been hearing that a lot lately listen julio lito was like a sister to me she shouldn't have been on that boat he died because of you no anton castillo killed lita if i could change anything it would be me dying on that beach lita was a better person than i could ever be and if she loved you well that just says a lot about who you are enough look if you and i are going to do this you need to know about the poison you mean the they spray on the leaves its real name is pg240 but we call it the poison because it up your system try not to breathe it or get it on your skin it can make you go crazy or sick like deep down city and if that doesn't get you the cancer that grows inside you will kanye so you're military marksmen close yourself what's your thing i'm good with guns we get along we'll start thinking that gear i gave you is good for fire and poison but there is no gear that fits their style no matter the situation where they get themselves killed this is a good place to scour it right behind you let's see what we're up against up here daley see the viviro tobacco and the yellow poison tanks see punch holes in the tanks to let the poison out into the air fun fact poison and fire make a hell of a mix big boom same idea with the fumigators they're hard to kill but they can't take the heat you've got a flamethrower you've got that supremo time to up all this favira you know lita and i had a ritual psych us up before battle hit me el movimiento delivered bella ciao foreign go go [Music] you
