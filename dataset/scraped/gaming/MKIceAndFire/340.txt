hopefully things around here can settle down again no one could blame me for wanting to drink all my sorrows away rm and tb i wonder who they were i think gabe had more fun at his job than anyone [Music] who pays for their alcohol with a check oh wait gabe hey look i appreciate what you're trying to do for me mr lucan but i'm not staying long and i don't take handouts just maybe don't cash that check like right now jed definitely has a decorating style i'd call it steakhouse chic okay jed said i might find mac in the flower shop but i have time to swing by the dispensary if i want on one hand there's the open road and the freedom to run away from my problems on the other helmet hair okay this is probably the most haven thing i've seen yet gabe was too young just too young bet pike's really had his work cut out for him these last few days hey pike hey uh how you holding up guess i've been better yeah right dumb question hey i want you to know i meant what i said back there gabe was something else he could bring a smile to my face even on the worst days yeah that's what everyone's been saying and uh when you're ready i still need to get your statement for the investigation i think i'll be ready soon yeah yeah no rush so nice to know ipsters can survive at this altitude wind chimes the original jam band it's we have a right to know what's happening to our jobs you guys don't think anything's really going to change typhoon eight years of my life and that can't give me back one simple answer about my job typhon doesn't give a about anyone i just still can't wrap my head might be a good time to check out the dispensary jed said charlotte wants to talk to me might be a good time to check out the dispensary chad's nothing says festive like three exclamation points i just hope the council passes the vote so anyone seen loudon sorry about today it's not your fault but i was really looking forward to climbing teller's peak i think the trails why should one accident close all the trails what a wasted vacation yes we're all suffering here might be a good time to check out the dispensary jed said charlotte wants to talk to me want to do something together next week sure i have a pottery class wednesday night want to join uh class uh maybe could we get dinner first yeah i usually grab a bite with katie you should come oh i i meant just the two of us dude we hang out all day aren't you sick of me might be a good time to check out the dispensary if i tell him i like him we'll date and then we'll break up and then i'll lose my best friend i mean you don't know that come on man can't you take a hint she's not into you let it go hmm maybe i could help them wait hell no what am i thinking this is none of my business guess they didn't feel like painting the mine might be a good time to check out the oh sorry we met briefly you're gabe chen's sister right alex yeah i didn't know him well but i could tell he had a big heart i'm so sorry for your loss charlotte alex hey judd said you wanted to see me i just wanted to see how you were doing i've been trying to stay busy mostly yeah distractions help how about you i can't even imagine what you're going through honestly i'm really trying to keep it together for ethan he's hurting i hear he's been having a rough time he practically just lost a father but he's shutting me out he's never done that before not when it mattered everyone grieves differently maybe he just needs some time i've been through a lot together with the divorce and moving it's never shut down like this i just can't get through to him i can't get over the feeling that the one person who could help me deal with the aftermath of gabe's death escape what is this an affidavit from typhon if i sign i'm agreeing not to press charges in exchange for a payment a big one that's so shady why would they be offering you money if they didn't do anything wrong they say it's an offer of good faith but you're right he's dead because of them and i'd be letting them off are you gonna sign it i don't know i'm trying to put ethan first but what would you do do you think it would be a betrayal of gabe [Music] i don't think you should sign it [Music] i'm sorry i know it's hard but you can't let typhon buy you off gabe made that call and i'm gonna prove it i just i need some time thanks for being honest if they're willing to pay charlotte to keep quiet they're definitely hiding something i really appreciate you stopping by feel free to take a look around if you want yeah okay of course she's right but i could really use that money we can't give in no matter how hard it is probably cost more than my bus ticket sweet logo but charlotte designed it herself and which part of the brain is responsible for the crazy glowy feelies these bougie dispensaries are gonna put all the creepy dudes named gene out of business man these things better do the trick i'm averaging like three hours a night pro tip insomnia doesn't usually come from nowhere and thc is way better at treating it when you're also tackling the underlying cause [Music] any idea what's keeping you up i hope these helped a little gabe charlotte's dedication to her art is so inspiring there's nothing quite like a cup of weed on a cold day i really love charlotte's style there's something you don't see in portland that's a semi in the dominican they're said to house the spirits of gods mostly i just like how it looks it's really cool when did you start needing a phd to smoke pot stairway to haven believe it or not gabe named that one oh i believe it it blows my mind that charlotte's been running the dispensary this whole time i couldn't even leave the apartment god put some clothes on i could totally paint that i just don't want to these are my kind of discounts a little steep but can you really put a price on a kid's dreams nice contribution gabe i'm gonna figure out why max lying i'm always here for you if you need anything thanks back at you and he did it all with one rusty saw and a bottle of gin impressive wonder what it's like to have i do my drugs out of a glass sculpture type of money still need to check the flower shop for mac it's fine i love being on hold i love this song yeah a warning would have been nice cancel aaa membership yikes not transfer cancel represented i have to imagine gabe would be amused to know he made it in the newspaper oh it's that guy's sister i feel so bad for her getting sick of people feeling bad for me steph asked me to pop by the record store if i had time steph asked me to swing by she's got to be around here somewhere [Music] how could chrissy leave me after everything we've been through together it's hard to beat breakup music but maybe i can find something around here to cheer him up the breakup section huh that's rough buddy ninth warden's cool but not as cool as thane or hey i'm glad you stopped by i've only got a sec but [Applause]

for angela she loves our store so much he must be exhausted we're losing our business but it's like everything's a joke to him she must feel so alone hope they figure it out eleanor sorry no need to apologize how are you dear oh i'm um still just trying to adjust i think give yourself some time change is always hard uh is mac here uh he was helping me not too long ago i think he just left we can't have gotten too far got it thanks [Music] hmm [Music] she looks terrified i can't leave her like this [Music] [Music] okay time to figure out why she's afraid [Music] i feel broken [Music] thank you dear i'll get started on it right away just come by with the check [Music] she can't find out [Music] if they know about my condition they'll make me close this place [Music] the doctor said i had more time but everything is becoming so out of order holy [Music] [Music] it's not just that she forgot what she was doing she's afraid she's forgetting everything but how can i help her forget what you were working on you could say i'm having a bit of a senior moment well maybe i can help [Music] you could focus on something else for a bit and see if it comes back i suppose but i can't help feeling like it was something important whatever it was does riley know you could ask her oh no no i can't ask riley i wouldn't want to bother her seems like you have a lot going on today i could help you retrace your steps oh i don't want to keep you [Music] hey i i want to help [Music] okay what would eleanor have done first [Music] you must have flipped the sign to open i always flip it first thing when i come in and then i open my mail something must have distracted me better we can do this did you trim these flowers today i don't remember could a phone call have distracted you yes i got a call first thing in the morning [Music] but i can't think who it was maybe we can find something to remind you could it have been riley who called i think that's right she called to tell me about a new order oh goodness what was the order for [Music] rush order this must be what riley came in for i think that order might have been for these lilies of course riley helped me pick them out before she left now we just have to figure out who ordered them the check for the lilies would be in here right that could tell us who bought them it should mr jedediah luken looks like the lilies are for jed that's right riley dropped off an order for jed i knew you'd figure it out i couldn't have done it without you jed must be hosting some event i wonder why he wants lilies though they're traditionally for funerals god she doesn't remember [Music] you know dad probably doesn't know the difference between a lily and a tulip don't sell him short he's more clever than he seems thanks again for your help don't be a stranger i won't promise she was finally feeling better i didn't want to ruin that that must have been a different time i hope it's good news i hope you find mac thanks i should get an emotional support dog but like for other people eleanor said mack is nearby i don't see him here maybe at the bridge how's your progress in moon drop ranch do you buy your chicken coop no i couldn't i spent too much money romancing the lumberjack i can't believe you think i would like this game just play it you'll see only if you start dust and daylight i'll think about it i'm so can't hide from me forever mac mac alex look it's not a good time you owe me an explanation about what happened to gabe i'm really sorry he died and i appreciate that you you didn't out me to riley the other night but i can't talk to you drop the act i know you've been lying about that night you don't know mac come on he was my big brother i can't something definitely has him scared maybe if i could tap into his fear i could get to the truth i just need to find something i could use to push him over the edge so simple but effective if he's innocent why is he acting like this acting like what maybe i can get her to tell me hey riley alex hey i know you and gabe were close how are you doing i miss him so much he was like an older brother to me i'm glad he had you thank you alex really you and eleanor seem close she's taken care of me ever since i was little i never really knew my mom but she's always been there for me what does she think about you going away to school she's thrilled i think she just wants me to end up happy will she be all right without you she's a tough cookie but i do worry about her sometimes she's getting older one day i'll have to take care of her i know having you work with her in the shop has meant the world yeah to both of us that fight mac had with gabe over your secret meetings they were about you applying to college right yeah ever since the first time mac lost his  in front of them gabe and charlotte had tried to get me to end things with him and after all this i can see that they were right do you think he could have ignored gabe's call i mean do you think he's capable of that i don't want to believe that but sorry i'm really not ready to talk about it yeah i get it it's just if he didn't do anything wrong why is he acting like he has something to hide he asked me to leave haven with him what right after the wake he wouldn't tell me why but he just looked so guilty i told him i had to think about it but alex i i'm scared he did something horrible riley thank you for telling me you deserve the truth i gotta run there's some stuff i need to do okay talk soon yeah whenever you want mac trying to skip town is sketchy as i bet i could use that to stoke his fear i should make sure there's nothing else i want to do before i confront mac everyone's out to get me alex ryan even riley  good he's scared time to find out the truth what riley told me might do it but i should make sure there isn't anything i still want to do around town first okay let's do this i got riley to tell me about your plans to leave town that's not something innocent people do oh god it's not i didn't do anything  off [Music] so [Music] [Music]  i'll deal with mac when i get to him for now i need to learn everything i can type is always watching they run this whole town mac feels like everyone's staring at him everyone thinks i killed him they all hate me it's not fair i didn't do anything wrong it should have been you instead [Music] alex no what the hell there are people out there no i told you to call it off i saw the way they looked at me in the wake they all think i let him die i know why you're lying typhon's forcing you to deny the call what the you might not have been the reason he died but you covering for their up makes you guilty too you don't get it this wasn't some accident i told them you were down there and they detonated anyway on purpose why i don't know i swear and then i get a message telling me to deny there was ever a call you gotta believe me gabe and i we didn't get along but i didn't want him dead [Music] and now now typhon's watching me my girlfriend she she thinks i'm a murderer my neighbors all hate me what the am i supposed to do i think i can calm him down but does he deserve it [Music] all right mack come on you gotta calm down okay dude stay with me i know what it's like to be doubted to have everyone think the worst of you but the truth will come out i'll make sure of it if typhon comes after you they're gonna have to get through me too okay [Music] thanks i actually feel a little better yeah well you learn a thing or two hanging out with shrinks your whole life so what are you gonna do now don't leave haven i'm gonna get to the truth uh hey yeah it's can we talk where are you okay so so you were right about typhon about mac alex mack got the call how do you know that he got the call and he lied about it doesn't matter someone is putting pressure on him to keep quiet someone from the mine and it doesn't matter i keep coming here and playing it back but it always ends the same ryan he's dead he's really dead alex [Music] [Music] it was my fault my job is to keep people safe and i failed [Music] you did everything right [Music] typhin took him away from us not you wrong i let her cross that log i put gabe in harm's way i'm not a hero i'm a coward worse than worthless [Music] you've got to stop torturing yourself you did everything you could have it doesn't matter gabe's dead because of me gabe i'm so sorry [Music] there's only one person holding you responsible for this ryan you need to forgive yourself you're not alone [Music] hold on there's a guy in a gorilla suit does he also jump off of the cliff and into the pool no no he chases a guy in a banana suit that guy jumps off the cliff and into the pool okay i'm i'm sorry this is a mexican restaurant yeah nominally the food is uh terrible but it's gabe's favorite place i tell you he's the oldest 12 year old i know [Music] can i ask you something of course you came up here to tell me that i was right about mac about him getting the call how did you know there's something you should know about me and it's gonna be easier to show you than to explain it this is gonna seem sort of weird at first then really weird do you trust me okay think of something sad like breaks your heart sad really focus until you feel it so gabe's laugh we never made anyone laugh like him [Music] you're sad you'll never hear it again never a dull moment kinds of stuff we got up to [Music] we're going to send him off right this time glad i was able to help but i think i'll pass on the kisses okay [Music] what emotion is this [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] must be a good memory i wonder if i can piece it together but gabe goose i see it it'll move it's not moving it'll move [Music] oh that's a lot of blood huh gabe this is serious killing a canadian goose is a violation of international law shut up it is not their canadian geese gabe property of the crown the the crown of property of the crown gabe what do we do [Music] how deep you think deeper than that the royal canadian mounted police can spawn a goose grave at 100 paces the mounties [Music] [Laughter] oh come on man i'm sorry i'm sorry how long were you gonna let me dig i wasn't gonna stop you [Laughter] so did you finish burying the goose or not okay also property of the crown really well they are technically protected under the migratory bird treaty act [Laughter] how so i guess i have this power i can see other people's emotions they show up like an aura and if i get too close i i feel what they feel as if i was feeling it myself and when i focus i can even understand why they're feeling it and that's what you just did with with me some kind of power no kidding it's it's only ever been the bad emotions before but that that was pure joy who else knows gabe did but now i guess just you and that's how i know max terrified of typhon he reported gabe's call and they ignored it now they're putting pressure on him to toe the line okay but why i don't know yet someone made the decision to let the blast go off seems like finding out who would be a good start so you're going after typhon you'll need help you don't have to you're stuck with me now okay then team up do the buddy cop thing you're a loose cannon jen but you get results [Music] this one's for you gabe i miss you [Music] how do i say i love you the day how do i change all of the pain into the joy [Music] i didn't speak this morning [Music] i couldn't hearing everyone talk about him about the life he had here with all of you i lost the chance to have that but even though i only had one day with him [Music] he changed my life [Music] i said i didn't know if i belonged here he told me that home isn't something you find it's something you build [Music] how do i [Music] all say ways [Music] childs [Music] i won't hold up to this place without you [Music] i will let you fly i will say goodbye [Music] you
