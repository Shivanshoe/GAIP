fill me with dread and [Music] anxiety out there team might want to buckle in eh oh [ __ ] hey major hall i can't believe ugh damn great way to start my first mission in 25 years [Music] this is keegan anyone read me that's not too promising get a beacon signal though could be the others we all got clear the condoms hope they're out there where the hell am i never thought what the hell was that this place is bringing up some bad memories need to get out of here hope the others made it [Music] anybody there lieutenant caliso reporting for duty sir glad you made it soldier you good bit banged up but i'll survive any sign of the outsider negative kid you out there reunited at last you made it well thanks to you cog goddammania kicking me out of a burning plane well outsider seems like i should get a thank you see it as you alive you're assuming i want to be alive teams back together now what you all follow the beacon right let's find a way up to it this looks like a good way out come on no that doesn't look good [Music] damn you did good kid save the three of us we owe you one what's next we need to let whoever's in charge know he survived only way to do that is locate the crash site hope that radio is intact i saw the condor that's quite a trailer what would it smoke great that wasn't uh bath ends at this pit here oh real observant there aren't you let's find a way across this looks like a way through but uh um problem sir the back isn't what it used to be especially after that crash leave it to me sir just need a moment that dead tree's caught on some vines heads up well done soldier come on let's go bit of a ways down ah you got a problem with heights after what we've been through can you blame me this looks like the way through here so either you know our destination before we left they didn't tell me [ __ ] all i know is there was ocean beneath us a long time what the hell was that another reason to find that radio asap well that is one [ __ ] up plane there's no way that radio is operational we need to eliminate it as an option before we move on to another plane come on [Music] look down there he's ruined seen something like them before my grandmother left like along the islands when she was young but photos from this place hell of a way to reconnect with your roots [Music] hmm must have flown off the plane thank goodness no we're talking my dad always told me i was lucky lucky as a locust and a lost party so that's why you are picked with a mission stack up can never be too prepared for what's coming come get your ammo hey little help i hate this place more by the moment you're saying something about luck boy hey we're safe right look some more supplies i told you lucky a flock huh i stand corrected how the hell did the swarm get to an island sign of the times old man the entire world is infected with them keep pushing through gotta get out of this swap ammo trap on standby we must be the first wave of troops ascended in a driver isn't exactly what i call a wave your driver delivery driver award-winning get out of the way four leeches come get your ammo the blood hmm [Applause] we're clear the swarm is even tougher than the locust well old man i for one like our odds won't be longer for the flocks back let's go look at all that now we stand up like shots you even know how to use half this ordinance grandpa my dad taught me to shoot how you don't like him i think you're quite similar soldier [ __ ] take it down the blood we're clear what's next sir stick to the plan find the wreckage find the radius gotta be your way through here somewhere we need to look around there'll be another way what's that behind the waterfall there's a way through here someone give me a hand i smell again you ran into it too we gotta get out of here [Music] blaze chart resupply depleted first i guess oh the smoke out of the frying pan this looks like the tail with any luck cockpit and radio is over here hey lucky you remember let's go ah damn it guess the radio's not here the entire cockpit ain't here grabs so it's a plan if we find that precious radio smashed to pieces there's a good chance that whoever organized this operation is well aware of what's happening might take a while they'll send someone and if they died in the clash as well how are your survival skills terrible delivery driver remember ah good oh got it destroyed good work now let's find that radio this thing is absolutely destroyed nice spot to build a shelter though we settle down into our new lives you know hell island you might come in here authorization code sjk 421 activate defensive patrol that's all i got operational why do we get the feeling that tak isn't the only one we signal looks like we're gonna have to earn that right let hopefully uh [Music] clearing the way good we're lucky they're the only ones that hurt us it's done that's all i've got that's enough ready to flock up [Applause] at hmm stuck up on ammo while we have the chance where the hell is that pilot i've got ammo don't let them good fragile for cover yes who needs ammo on the island brother i need help easier said than done bouncers went way over ahead here bring it [Music] hang on tight we're getting out of here [Music] the hell is that [Music] right this island could get [ __ ] glad to be getting far away from this nightmare [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah exactly what i thought here's the results right sorry to be late and all we survived a horrific condor crash fought an endless hoard of monsters from hell and barely escaped with our lives but uh how's your day been well it's about goddamn time holy [ __ ] what show some respect it's colonel victor hoffman it's an honest a real hell of an honor shared sentiment soldier that's why you're here best of the best this here's hannah colt she's my number one on this covert operation she knows a lot about science things and uh is uh well in general quite pleasant to be around advanced degrees in biochemistry toxicology chemistry and science things thanks hoff anyway good to finally meet you what kind of operation is this hannah now what we're looking at is a schematic of the pohanu cog bunker designation sanctum it never served its true purpose instead becoming a burial site at the end of the locust war and now well it's a full-blown swarm hive i need you to infiltrate and plant a chemical bomb in its heart so we can kill them from the inside out it's a high risk mission but if we get this right we can wipe out those bastards and use what we've learned to save the entire goddamn planet now i've made promises to the cog and through my people on the mainland i've made promises to you complete the objective and i will deliver questions whatever the mission sir we're in what is the hell out of retirement well then what are we waiting for all right team you'll be infiltrating the basement's main entrance all of our recon efforts indicate it remains fully powered by the thermal reactors once inside you'll need to access the bottom floor it's 20 levels down but the elevator system will ease the burden what kind of recall and operation did you like we sent a few teams but lost contact truth is we needed somebody i've got ammo initiated by special operations officer corporal jeremiah keegan welcome all right guys now that we have access to sanctum i'm officially initiating sanctum security officers please proceed to the waiting area in an orderly fashion security gotta make sure the right people get in what exactly does the right people mean sanctum was meant to protect the most important cog citizens scholars politicians celebrities and which category did you fit in graphs none of the above does the goon working for important this is decontamination there should be a final security checkpoint on the other side all citizens of sanctum are required to undergo decontamination protocol before entering the facility please step into a chamber to begin that's all i got initiating decontamination you'd think without bad the cog was losing the war they'd be willing to take in any poor soul that survived still need to follow protocol protocol my airs decontamination proceed to the breathing room for further instruction this is my kind of sanctuary it's engineered as a system there's an order to it real confidence this is where new arrivals would have been processed after proper clearance of course that should do it activating sanctum core systems stand by so what happened to you the volcano powering the thermal generators ended up being too unstable the whole place was deemed uninhabitable so after the war they turned it into a locust burial site biological threat detected well something's trying to get through defensive positions raytax looks like we found your robots hannah and the evidence never heard back clear swarm infected tvs there's no end to the cock's sight to clean up welcome to my life kid that would be the dr1 we've had to protect the rest of the needy further access to authorized personnel only come get your ammo authorization granted proceed who'd have thought my clears would come in handy all these years later more rejects ahead welcome here we go oh how many db's did you spend on first emerged glad to hear that the colonel and i are of similar minds yes me first minister jin's always been a bit too eager to use robots to solve a problem my opinion find a plot of land far from all cog civilization you'd be surprised how much pet this panel must be connected to that door let's get it open let me take a look there cramps ah somewhere install confused wrong way around ah got it [Music] that's all i got would rather die in the sunshine and live underground give me vast open spaces a good friend and a bottle of whiskey that's the way i want to go whiskey can be a friend damn door's stuck leave it to the superior officer corporal i love it hell was that just seismic activity from the volcano oh is it just a volcano that's another brilliant cog ideas that throw the last of humanity into a [ __ ] volcano anyway the elevators are on the far side of the main hub hey man think you can take a look at this oh sir yes sir i've got ammo [Music] oh well this doesn't look too complicated got some rejects so the hell was that just seismic activity from the volcano oh is it is it just a volcano that's another brilliant cog idea isn't it throw the last of humanity into a [ __ ] volcano anyway the elevators are on the far side of the main hub hannah we've got an infestation coming up into the hub from below damn the hive is growing faster than we looks like the infestation has affected the elephants oh is this weak gospel i'm going to do the job yes yes of course as long as you deliver the bomb to the center it should work should work enough let's get down there only 18 more levels to go [Music] out of range wonderful looks like this is the only way out let's go here i go oh clear time backup team we've got more done here room coming through area clear we need to get to the thermal control room should be another access console somewhere taking this the console looks offline i'll give it a try no good you tried turning it off and on again can we please take this seriously i'll take a look so i was thinking why don't we just drop the bomb down the shaft looks like it goes all the way to the bottom absolutely not you heard hannah we deploy the payload to the center of the hive that's the mission access granting opening maintenance week here they come leave it to me that's it hey that's the last of them you want to open the correct door now well if i wired it right and i did both doors should have opened access granted opening thermal control oh look at that you just needed some time to think snipers [ __ ] you're kidding me god damn it we are in a volcano oh and the actual depths of fire would do it come on there's got to be a way through one of us needs to flank the position while the others draw apart just think of it as the most insane delivery ever there you go that's all of them kill that furnace mac killing the fire making it a wee bit easier for the older more feeble in the room [Music] ventilation closed in subsection 28c potential heating hazard detected venting subsection 28 what's that mean saturn you've got your priorities all wrong got it grenadier fight's not over this whole place is working against us cut that tuck out and stay focused ventilation station temperature exceeds safe operating protocols cooling area ventilation station now within safe operating temperature proceed to plastic if the swarm doesn't tell us the climate control well thompson [ __ ] growing frags hey buddy this is getting out of hand for you maybe don't know what they were thinking sending an outsider down here can you two argue after we get out of this [ __ ] place [Music] is oh oh come on clearing away initiating final climate stabilization ventilation station temperature temporarily stabilized all personnel vacate immediately i think we should take good advice [Music] huh ready to resupply got it it's back up team down here we need a goddamn army i am sick of your complaint there's a door ahead we're going through [Music] it [Music] come back or shooting leave it to me shot um those pawns are bursting open i've got ammo keep shooting it this keeps up we don't stand a chance okay someone's gotta say it we barely made it out of that one and it's only good to get worse we all know it we are going to die down here for what you're afraid of dying you should have thought of that before you took this on oh believe me i'm ready to die but i wanted to count hello you got some sort of deathwish not a death wish but when the dust settles i want to have made a goddamn difference that's it we're in let's go we will find our way into my [ __ ] edge if that's what it takes we all took this mission to make a difference and we have our orders outsider now let's make it count take a look around we have to face the facts the way things are going this will all be for nothing so laurie we almost there not even close we made it this far we'll find another way down god damn [ __ ] just can't admit defeat can you i'm done take a chip to hell with the objective the hell you doing making it count brother [Music] deadly toxin detected all personnel must make sense come on now what grab hold and take the shot how did you get down there so fast what i see is it working it's working on everything we don't have much choice the dog yeah have a nice laugh mac we objectively failed our mission kiss my ass grandpa you saw with your own eyes the gas didn't work would you two shut the hell up you copy we're in trouble we ride the giant door down the lava river to be completely accurate i read you and what fast as you can make remove himself from the main entrance okay on my way because you didn't let us deploy it correctly the island is on fire you [ __ ] idiot that tree's gonna penis keep them off my ride man lava's making quick work of that tree shouldn't hold much longer more swarm incoming ah they're everywhere gotta pounce up yeah it's not burning fast enough then shoot it we're through that's it knock it off we need to work together we're going to survive [Applause] uh where the hell are we going coming where'd that flock go looks back on the roof there we go maybe we should have used lava to kill the swarm instead of that gas shield is ready walk down come get your ammo make them count well what do we have here then hey little help let me give you a hand here precisely a grenade clear nice we're clear oh max saves the day again please hold your applause they're still riding at goddamn doors on a river of lava thanks to you connection riding a goddamn door down a river of lava alive thanks to me do it we got a scion [Music] [Music] another tree simple to the point effective do you ever shut up you two gonna stop tinkering long enough to help me out come on [Music] trouble if we stay here much longer focus get behind me i've got ammo resupply move depleted up here [Music] up [Music] um that one nice today how much longer that goddamn tree gonna hold out okay new plant shoot through the roots on it the plastic bleeding it's working keep firing at it just a little more [Music] that's it come on come on and we out of here now that's looking oh everything's a joke to you getting pie on the skin of your feet relying on your luck you don't have a clue looks like i made it just in time i wouldn't celebrate quite yet scorpio your eyes coming to an abrupt end [Music] hi and it's a good thing a dead or we would have died for nothing that wasn't the mission that's your decision well i think we can all agree the mission was a failure not if we uncovered new data anything the drones juvies roasted them heavier swarm we didn't have the punch we needed you got anything stronger something that can sink the entire island maybe but how about a few canisters of that nightmare acid that killed all them bastards on the beach eh damn you might be onto something i was joking even if that could work there's a problem we don't know what's responsible for the attack or where to find it why leahy my grand used to tell me stories about her people how the young men and women would travel the ocean to face a god it was their rite of passage if anyone knows something about what we saw on the beach it's my grandmother's people well go there make contact see what you can learn hannah you prep for field work i want you there to ask the right questions i'm on it let's go scorpio i'll find a spot nearby don't need any more of these last second rescues you and me both tech no lab on this island i like adventure already all right let's see what we can learn from the locals what's the plan with attacking hannah if we obtain some of that nightmare acid from whatever attacked the form of the promise we can combine it with the toxin i was sent from new hope hopefully someone here can listen on what exactly that acid is and how to get it still have to find a better way to the heart of the hive yep i'm working on a solution for that too village is this way get the door [Music] huh peaceful never thought i'd see where my family came from even with all the stories and memories she shared brad never told you why she left any of your family still live here distant relatives i'm sure i guess i should introduce myself feels like an odd way to reconnect you know marching in middle of the night well i'm sure we'll be given a warm welcome not every day a band of armed soldiers want us into town well hopefully they'll be understanding given our rather dire circumstances is that music sounds like quite a party everyone must be gathered in that hole over there couldn't think of a better way to make our entrance come on then hello should we just be parting in like that relax lonnie's face with family here so hannah they mean it asks you any relation to the cold trade right because every coal is related to augustus sorry i was just curious is all in the sense you hear that question more than you'd like to no it's okay i like my dad i mean yes he's my dad just please please don't ask me about thrash ball find a tease [Music] the guess disco knew i saw him play but daddy what i remember it for man to legend the true definition of the cog frontline hero yeah not wrong keegan that's what everyone sees in my father i wanted to be just like him a lot of people find it hard to believe but calm the cold train he's a quiet man his introspection about the war kept me on the military he wanted more for me what i fought for baby dad said one serum in education could do more to turn the tide of war than a single front of the gun ever could you mentioned your degrees back when we first met that's uh that's a lot to know for a kid yeah mom was always buying me books books for my birthday books for special holidays had books out my ass interesting oh i loved it i think it was a distraction to keep me away from what my dad was interested in war sports and i still don't want to talk about thrash balls how'd you meet hoffman through dad hoffman had the idea for this special project after what happened at new hope he got his hands on the new hope toxin but needed a specialist to do anything with it and so here i am working on a plan to save the world you know hawk has been working on this plan for a long time but when i first got here he mostly rolled around in his wheelchair yelling out the window all right let's hope there's someone in here willing to help well that all depends on how long their party's been going on sounds like we're missing out let's get in there oh no everyone's gone looks like this ain't a diplomatic mission anymore can someone turn off that damn radio [Music] hey lonnie take a look at this all this imagery around a creature of some kind can you read the language it's been a long time since grant taught me why lehan but i can try this scroll references the awakening it's the rite of passage she talked about listen the mantle a terror stalks and desires to consume let it be your burden but let it not feed the journey our ancestors carry you across the world their spirits guide and watch over you spirit walk enter the fade and journey amongst the ancestors the path of our people will reveal your burden fear awaken reborn renewed not consumed your heavy burden transformed light as the feather face the creature huh looks like a big [ __ ] bird a bird feathers huh grand would tell me stories about the wakatu a flying demon that all children must face as a rite of passage are you suggesting that thing at the beach yes the wakatoo isn't mythology it's real that's it we track this wikatu down and get a sample of its poison hi after we figure out what's going on here we'll find the villagers come on scorpio through here let's get this door open to get here are we gonna handle this we killed the swarm every last one of them i'll follow your lead [Music] [Applause] huh oh i need help on your feet lieutenant and stay down what's up leave it to me humans we're clear there's no bodies no sign of the villagers where'd they go they have more use for us alive lonnie those any pods here though they take them somewhere a defensible structure the temple up on the ridge we can still save them let's go you're doing okay hannah oh yeah yeah i'm good we've got your buck that's right thanks guys i hope we're not too late let's go there are stories of people who survive being snatched and potted but we need to be prepared for the reality that those chances are often slim i'm not giving up on them let's get to the temple baby's coming in oh god thank you one oh [Applause] oh that's the last of them this just doesn't make sense even the locusts couldn't grow between the islands that's why sanctum was built on bohanu how did they get to oregon if anyone's in here need our help come on look in the tree we collected feathers from the wakatu and brought them here no pods though no get bodies me [Music] you've always been reckless and honestly you deserve it ah it's done the toxin coming from the feathers it seems to have some kind of psychological effect that we'd rather not think about yeah yeah but this incense it's negating the toxic effects we saw the same incense in the ritual room back on pahanu when we first landed this proves that we can find the wakato right now we need to find the villagers come get your ammo help me out here even one day too late one day makes all the difference they're gone we couldn't save them so what the hell are we going to do about now it on the same oh there's no place to hide from what's coming more of them coming from the barn walk away good and we're scaring them look out there's a hunter uh ah [Music] count get behind me shield's on recharge i hope i'm not slowing you guys down you're doing great real natural wish your dad can see you the coal train is going to be rolling over hoffman at full speed if he hears about this little outing uh we'll hunt every last one of them down give me a hand god damn look what we've got here a silverback i think we can put that weak death machine to good use hey scorpio could do a lot of damage with this thing if it had power mack can you help out on it keegan [Music] i'm gonna rip them to bloody shreds scorpio [Music] oh coming from the building throw to the bridge sniper oh so what's the science coming in foreign that's all of them we're making this right with every instagram too poor hot we're clear it was foolish to hope to find anyone alive but still i wish we could have saved a few of them but even one ah just a bit further i'm right behind you destroyed this place all its history it's people god damn swarm we're gonna visit the same fate on their entire species i still don't understand how they got here from pahanu looks like we found an answer hannah the lava tubes this is how they got here lava tubes then maybe they're connecting the islands hannah above you [Music] nothing i can't handle damn it where'd it go where did it go now this is crazy where the hell are we even going we gotta clear these cars to get to the snatcher try targeting those rocks there they look like they're ready to blow all right we can use this let's go make him count exactly what i needed it's dead that's all of them anyone see where that snatcher went straight ahead deep come on get this thing down look at it and we're on the right track how long is it bloody dude hmm [Music] [Music] huh looks clear where the hell is that it's back up team there it is look out it's on the move again stay on it get up there fast as you can come on hold on this lava tube it must lead to pahanu the snatch is going back to the hive in sanctum then we've got to stop it hang on hannah we're coming here he's getting away take out that pillar come on i'm on the board leave it to me [Music] come on you're all right they took the villagers stole them potted them changed them they wanted to change me too keegan it's okay you're safe now keegan we got a signal attack scorpio how the hell the heart of the hive oh wow it's good to go we got swarm coming hannah stay low place to go team shield spent [Music] here's a nice one we're in the clear hey hannah you were right there are people who survived being snatched yeah the stories are true huh still there scorpio sorry i got caught messed up [Music] that's all that matters it'll take me a bit to secure the stretcher you guys good for review we'll manage goodness honestly i can't believe she survived what's on your mind the snatcher was taking hannah to the heart of the hive and we need a more efficient way to get there oh no you're not suggesting let them capture all that thought we supply depleted [Applause] shield is finally made it to the park oh [Music] i'm wounded help's on the way hey [Music] foreign clear so what you think of my planet operations you're serious we get snatched up snatched up and smuggled right into the hive then what there's no guarantee we can survive that third point but i feel like hannah and her action science might have an answer for that ill it might work it smuggled into the heart of the hive but we still gotta get out of here first and all their [ __ ] friends good to go [Music] god surprises [Applause] [Applause] scorpion resupply on me that's all i got lukatsu made quick work of the swarm i feel good about hannah's toxin plan if we can manage to catch that thing i'm not sure we can do it alone agree now's the time to ask hoffman to bring in some reinforcements keegan this is not a culprit what what the hell are you talking about hoffman's gone rogue it's just us hoffman is a decorated cog veteran i just think for a second the access code's decided if hoffman's working with the cog why couldn't he just get those codes himself oh that's ridiculous i really think opman's gone can't be true there's no way do you think i'd join a cog mission outsider remember look we all know that man is used to doing whatever it oh takes this way another thing if this was a legit operation why would everything be some content secrets when we got here we had no clue where we were going neck not the time no we couldn't shake it for long [Music] [Music] [Music] wakato what the hell are you talking about looks like we're all in the dark on this one we're gonna have words [Music] no more lies hoffman the first minister rejected my plan to deal with the swarm she said her damn robots could handle them so i used my forced retirement to launch a mission of my own all this time we were on a goddamn rogue operation that's right look i know your past that you've all suffered and struggled but you've still got that fight in your purpose that's why we're here it was our lives on the line the fate of the entire planet is on the line soldier i'm not here to save the world the swarm took my son dragged him screaming into the dark i failed to protect him to fight for him i joined up to make these [ __ ] pay but i planned to die doing it [Music] but here we are so to hell with it i'll live and i'll fight for what family i have left i won't stand by and watch more people suffer not when i can do something about it we know how to get to the heart of the hive all i need is one sample and you'll get it but i won't let my brother face this one alone wish i could have been there for you mac and your son but i'm here now well that's it then once more into the screaming dark good luck out there scorpio you pick up for a reason sir we'll get the job done you guys ready to walk amongst the ancestors hey the spirit one right so you were listening of course i was like my ancestors have done for generations [Music] enter the vein and walk amongst the ancestors the path of our people will reveal your burden [Music] the awakening i'm living out what my parents and gran used to believe was mythology just stories i was in prison and grandpa's i wish you could see me now it's none of my business it's okay we're squad now you both should know i [ __ ] up deliberately ignored an order thought i knew better than everyone else and someone got killed ico a good man truth is as much as i want to go back i don't know if there's a spot waiting for me sometimes there ain't no going back my father used to carve pieces like this from wood he said they would protect us from dark spirits being back in the action having a team at my side i've missed this feeling of being part of something bigger i know that feeling too this way grab that side your old job still classified no i can spill i was part of the brash brigade locust cleanup crew some of the locusts survived the war we made them disappear quietly so the emulsion countermeasure as far as the public knows the war ended there but there was still more work to be done perfect there should be another way around through the room where they going take get behind me there's more other side oh [Applause] shops on recharge we're clear those newbies have worn out to welcome so corporal lieutenant never got the long story about your rank onyx god fought like hell in the war what would hold up a promotion that all of us were fighting i was stationed on the zura [Music] i don't know about all this rank stuff what you're doing here this matters brother thanks ready to get up close hey help me out in the back there here i come and he brought his pets break down ready uh concentrated that's all of them way out is ahead through those doors oh good vine let's get back to our path come on did you say children used to walk this path well there weren't any swarm that tree there it was on the carving in the village hall it must be the wakatu's nest then we're still on the right path you know before all this i really thought my life was over that i live out the rest of my days in prison so you joined up when half with crony found you exactly same here what else can you do perfect um which way [Applause] is on this side uh [Music] oh oh all right we made it let's find our way to the tree ammo drop is spit debris can't be from our ride a vulture went down on pahanu you found 144b it went down shortly before i arrived on galangi it was loaded with the initial db force to lead our charge into the bunker think we could recruit them to our cause worth of incoming may as well see what's waiting for us inside i'm out of behavior okay we're good take what supplies we can from this wreck let's see about getting that loading wrap opened up come get your ammo this is connected to that ramp right not a problem that's it this will get the door open great even more unfriendly traitorous cogbots don't reach out right who needs ammo come get your ammo there that's it they're probably gonna run into more dbs from that vulture stupid bot tell me about it but i wouldn't have given for their help when the swarm attacked my village what happened a slaughter than the terrifying quiet even if i wasn't miles from home i couldn't have stopped it i wasn't a fighter you did what you could mac and you lived if i wasn't such a coward i would have died with them coward show me a man sacrificing more than one who's lost their child i'd follow you into any fight thank you both of you sounds like one hell of a fight going on down there should we take a look we help him out i'm calling [Music] throw it first take it [Music] keep them coming that's all of them this river goes right to the wakatoos nest and look at that there's a board waiting for us hey lucky right you know it [Music] it's been one hell of a journey that's for sure i only got this far thanks to your support well i had my assumptions about you two as well look at us now team scorpio saving the planet on the right so maybe it doesn't feel raining juvies gotta keep another one oh thanks two of them so and then [Applause] [Music] you
