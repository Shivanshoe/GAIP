throw them off these no tacos right too risky [Music] hidden entrance used to be over there behind that white tree let's hope the Mongols haven't found it we just have to find a way through the camp once we reach the water it should be easy to find that entrance without being spotted that's our plan sneak through the biggest Mongol camp I've ever seen then hope the secret entrance we used as children is still there stay close Tucker count on it let's go you can't believe I'm risking my life coming back to this dump this was your idea I need to prove my worth to your uncle earners passage

convince him nothing will taka used to visit this swordsmith every day if there was any leftover metal he'd let my brother pretend to make swords so Smith remembered you since K passed away that's his son how did it go bujji masseur thinks they can outlast the siege the Smith told me all the best archers left to fight the Mongols against og masters orders they've been missing for days if you find these archers they may help us break the Mongol siege and win the town support meet me an old yurikawa when you can we'll look for them there I'm sure you recall how to fight back since his son still has the rock it's so small in my memory it's huge you spent holism with him I have to drag you away [Music] [Music] [Music] you know what's he doing you don't change the subject I told him not to come I wanted to help lots a guy if I stayed in your okawa I'd be useless better use less than dead we're searching for missing soldiers you're not trained for this I can learn and I won't get in the way fine but be careful and listen to your sister yes my lord any sign of the archers locals have seen them in this area but we haven't let's look around [Music] someone killed them wasn't us [Music] arrow wounds where are the arrows pulled out to reuse them sign of a skill torture tracks three four men can you tell where they went let's find out we used to come here to catch crickets at least once a week then we'd leave tiny bamboo cages for them do you remember why we came here to catch crickets oh to get you away from our mother when she was angry and looking for someone to blame but crickets kept you busy attracts me to this house didn't a samurai's of you have to be more careful we should check the house I'll look out here buried most of the food maybe that's why I'm still alive he wasn't hungry arrowheads bowstrings hide to make adhesive was IMATS they've been sleeping here at least the bear didn't get them the artists must have been here I found something the firewood is still warm the archers were staying in the house they must be close they stole the Mongols explosive barrels I like these arches trucks here there they are heading up the hill toward that Ridge they're staying low for a reason keep your heads down and don't pull out somewhere I alive get over here you must be the artist for me Erica what's left of them the Mongols caught us reading a careful

you're not the Shimura let's have a look at that camp prison Caravan looks like the Mongols are preparing to move I did for a garrison on the other side of all jolly Kawa we need to strike now before they leave your archers in good health the sooner we free them the better that idea to rush in we know where they're headed we can set an ambush along the route the terrain isn't good for an ambush what about all the Arakawa rooftops on both sides of the road we can even use your stolen explosives you found that huh I like the way you think good let's move before the Mongols do the Mongols are headed this way taka get inside one of the houses no I'm staying out here I can fight too Jin tell him taka can decide for himself and you can watch out for him are you scared No not really a little yuna's never afraid you're probably like that - fear drives you to be stronger fight harder my father taught me that I never knew my father when I get scared I can't think I freeze that's because you lack training Yoona's been in danger many times she's had more practice than you without her I'd be dead so die there they are I'll shoot the barrels when the Mongols get close what I'm not ready you
