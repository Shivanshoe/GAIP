captain i've confirmed the death of ethan winters i wasn't able to retrieve the body but i've recorded evidence share your screen and i'll go over the situation my team and i were careless yesterday we took down the transformed miranda but we didn't kill her who knew she could fake being a corpse since miranda could have infected ethan i forcefully took him and rose with us but the vehicle they were riding in was attacked when i got to the wreck ethan and rose were gone the last time i was able to contact ethan i heard miranda's voice murdered him and she is not gonna get away with it god damn it when does it end all of it three years trying to put this thing in the ground three years too long we'll get her captain the squad's ready for you so bsaa got here already they didn't waste any time mission adjustment no it doesn't change anything terminate miranda and rescue rose that's the mission and failure's not an option let's have some fun people like old times move out i want to know what the hell bsaa is doing here find out what you can roger that i'm on it in a while since we fought together captain when was at last the desert doing nothing but recon's gotten me out of shape but thanks to your recon we know morena's plan couldn't quite believe it when i heard you turn herself in the mia though taking five shots to the head's nothing to sneeze at either spooky hey alpha look at this yes they've gone too far christ looks pretty rough down there how are you planning on reaching the objective first we're gonna have to take that thing out i've got your back boss let's get to work everyone watch for hostile bio weapons roger made contact with a group of hostile fireworks eastern route is clear moving out bsaa craft spot two guards i can take don't get [ __ ]

the e-series the stuff originated here there's an opening in the roof use it huh good i'll single with the waterproof reloading now just a minute okay hold your horses next ripping the next round i'll keep going the rest of you stay above ground so if miranda was the fake mia where's the real one i doubt she saw any further use for her i don't get any of this how did miranda even know rose exists

chances i'm going in standing captain i have eyes on miranda at the ceremony site keep your distance do not move until i give the order i know it's too late now but we really should have told ethan
