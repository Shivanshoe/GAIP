playing for the same team anymore guess i'm not at all surprised seems your specialty slipping shivs in the backs of allies where's smasher could crack your skull like an eggshell know that you'd still be able to talk for a little while but i'm happy to talk ever wonder how rogue survived after the attack on the tower how in hell no one ever hunted her down her alone out of all that atlantis trash cause i do i truly wonder how far she had to go to set herself up so comfy gucci finger [ __ ] whose crack did she have to lick to oh what's he going on about he's trying to throw you off gong thinks he can still squirm out of this where's smasher now the arasakas but i think you know that already when's he do back never faithful old adam's just been named ahead of security there oh not coming back to this rat hole ever i stayed behind just to tie off his loose ends [ __ ] could say that again you two will never jump that high smashers out of your reach but don't feel bad you'll find you himself likes to resolve [ __ ] like this in person gonna lead us to smash your ass face even if i wanted to he don't trust me enough to hey why are you so interested in smasher anyway i'm not interested in silverhand and what happened to him johnny silverhand what do you want to know silverhand's iron you had it what you fan too smasher give it to you uh-huh reward for a special job well done smasher ever tell you what he did with silverhand's body that into him huh plan to exhume that scop or you just want to hear how he died soaked in his own piss neuron scorched by soul killer what did they do with him badlands near the oil fields buried out there 101 northbound then head for the landfill dig deep enough might even find a [ __ ] smear heard him finish him let's send this quickly want to rip my eyes out just looking at him no no wait i got something silverhand you're in him right but i'd give you something he deserve extinction do i end him yes meaning do what you think is right smashers got something that was johnny's it could be yours just gotta let me live how'd smasher wind up with johnny's stuff told me ordered him to get rid of the body any and all sundries sold most of it except the malorian and what i got i don't want a damn thing from you this whole thing still no leads nowhere to go from here [ __ ] v tell her to johnny this is more than a 50 year old grudge really like what is it it's about you he wanted to do this with you what to cheer me up didn't work smasher [ __ ] you don't get it this isn't about smasher he's just the goddamn tip of the iceberg even if we get him what does that get us later v leave her alone pete she'll get it together but times like this she prefers to be alone okay i get that let's hit those oil fields i want to see what it looks like out there so oh [ __ ] think i know what it is let's see what we got here take that rag off it okay my ride hop in i'll even let you drive so v a vehicle of mine went dark near your position fine keep an eye out for unknown reasons the coordinates came through corrupted so i'm unable to determine the precise location okay gotta be around here somewhere can't believe they bothered to truck it all the way out here it's better than the junkyard where i landed so that's how it is nothing here at all what did you expect headstone flag and flowers yeah i i don't know a marker something anything you really need symbolic empty gestures guess i do thought i'd feel like i closed a chapter here like i'd said goodbye to the old silverhand hello to the new how do you feel like i never even or like i was still inside the cochi we'll figure something out better now a bit but let's say it was my real grave what would you write here lies johnny silverhand night city legend sounds good but what does it really mean what did i achieve shouting chipping into a bunch of angry pimply kids what's gotten into you where's johnny i'm the [ __ ] greatest silver hand don't even recognize you maybe i'm done pretending listen i realize i [ __ ] up a lot of things either let down or used every last person who gave me their trust blind selfish bastard that i was but i've managed one thing for now not to [ __ ] this up what we have it's been a long bumpy road but we made it most people i thought were my friends they couldn't even stand to be in the same room with me you're [ __ ] closest to me by a long shot there 24 7. and yet you don't seem to hate my living guts it's too bad we didn't talk like this earlier would have made things easier never found the right moment remember waking up at victor's not knowing about me i'm seeing things i'm scared then moaning at misties about how you didn't want to die remember you whining for smokes in the middle of night complaining about not being able to kill me never thought we'd make it this far when you said you let your friends down did you mean rogue rogue alt kerry santiago not always lost yet at least with rogue can't pretend nothing's changed over 50 years can't just insert myself into her life smasher [ __ ] really got to her you can't leave it like this i don't think might be right she was acting weird you want to talk to her you know did promise her i'd take her to the movies long long ago good idea call her for me ask if she's free some night thing is you'd have to surrender control again yeah i'll call her okay let's delta nothing to see here after all worth coming out all the same absolutely thanks fee of all the heads i could have popped up in hella glad it was yours johnny wants to ask you out on a date what do you think johnny's asking or is he johnny you're the one who said you got no trouble telling us apart okay and where'd we go where'd you want to go silver pixel cloud in north oak okay i'll swing by the afterlife pick you up you
