where is chris hackett shut up wow rude guys she murdered kaley we have been over this uh caitlin what do i do oh wow real strong showing on the leadership front i said shut up oh no way i am not getting involved this is all you buddy look just think about everything that's happened tonight okay that's all i'll say hold up you said you heard a woman crying when you escaped why what do you know it's the ghost story you told us about right caitlyn this isn't a ghost story it's a creature feature it's really happening and you're all in it your bracelet what are you doing trying to help worst case scenario this should give you a fighting chance and this will kill them for good yeah but what if it's nick or someone like i said worst case scenario brian put that [ __ ] thing down before you hurt someone so come on where does chris hackett live when he's not at camp i mean what makes you think i know that uh you guys are counselors right you've spent the last two months here he's not in the storm shelter i'm clearly getting nowhere hunting him in the woods i need a place to start i think that spooky house behind these woods dude what listen there could be another way have you thought about that i've spent the last month thinking about nothing else look when the sun comes up i am stuck until the next full moon so is max so is anyone else he's been how is that our problem why don't you ask your friends in the woods don't forget about nick dude okay any clothes are gonna spray you two with cold water ryan let's just get out of here i'm running out of time if i can't find chris hackett then a lot more people are going to get hurt i'm going with you what uh yeah what they said i'm gonna show you that chris heckett has nothing to do with this he wanted us to stay inside tonight he wanted us safe i don't care what you think i don't care what you think shut up fine do whatever you want you saw what happened to nick he was bitten everything's gonna be fine that cop car you stole where is it ditched in the lake why it was a stolen cop car you're gonna have to try and fix the minivan get somewhere safe how long do you have an hour or two i don't know it doesn't seem like an exact science then we better get going are you sure this is the right way pretty sure yeah pretty or definitely what do i look like a tour guide this doesn't feel right i think you're up to something i'm not you better not just be running out the clock i'm not the longer we're out here the longer we're in danger said the murderer you know it might be a lot more pleasant if you lightened up a little what is wrong with you nothing and if it makes you feel any better i'm not a murderer you murdered kaylee and you want to murder chris i don't i want to save everyone else he's infected except kaylee right she would have killed you all if i hadn't shown up you must know how insane this all is there it is pack your house so he lives in some redneck mansion with his redneck family in the ass crack of the woods look at this place no but it's where his mom lives i think i've never been there but if we're looking for answers it's probably the best place to start so uh wait how do we get there what do you mean how do we get to the house that's a really good question maybe we just don't look i understand chris is your friend if there was another way i'd tell you sure yeah laura chris is a good man this isn't about good and evil ryan just how can you be so certain i let my conscience slow me down now everything gets a lot worse for everyone believe me if there's another way i'm all for it hey where are you going you're the timer remember there must be another way across somewhere i got you careful oh holy [ __ ] are you okay laura it stalks your breath but shuns clear water right oh my god laura jesus marion jazz hands here's the thought what are you doing relax look what big eyes you have grandma no [ __ ] can you see yellow in my eyes define yellow [ __ ] we haven't got much time so this must be part of the old working quarry make sense these must have been from the quarry days no duh no one's been down here for years did you hear that too it's her who the hag of hack it's corey it's like she's warning us off or guiding us [ __ ] you think anyone heard that no they can't it done this place is not up to code i mean if the code is literally crumbling to the ground then i think it's doing fine let's just keep moving yeah careful jeez [Music] just look at this place oh i could really do with a hamburger right about now stop being weird so oh boy this is high whoa do you think actual way something is in here with us either that or this route isn't as disused as we thought a long way down well where's cave out look who's finding their funny bone so what's your deal then what do you mean the whole mysterious brooding loner thing it doesn't quite fit with i love my camp leader vibe so i don't fit into the right box is that what you're saying and what box would that be nothing forget it do you always do that do what uh start to engage in a conversation and then just immediately recoil into your shell maybe i don't want to talk to you anymore oh wow charming i am assuming you're single yeah why no reason this way i see a light yeah or you can just hang out here up to you someone's been eating their spinach so you want to go into the collapsing nightmare tunnel first or shall i looks promising careful splinters thanks i'm fine guess we found the party alcohol from prohibition these are rum running tunnels that would make that liquor almost 100 years old probably still good good try vintage well i guess the hackets were bootleggers that makes sense i guess when the cores get down they branched out come on time travel later you think this is it oh beach me i'm pretty much completely lost yeah me too shall we so uh what the hell happened here uh that's kind of my bad had a bit of a tumble with one of the locals the [ __ ] caitlyn this place is wrecked well you should see the other guy what do you think happened to jacob and emma probably nothing hopefully i mean should we go find them warn them i think the safest thing the most responsible thing is to try and get help right and then we can come back for them and nick and nick wait what is there is there something in there i don't know what is it jacob ella are they should i open it up your funeral buddy what air freshener oh yeah it's all i could find in the van uh dylan you're uh so she was in the police station this whole time insane right this whole time we were having such a fun summer we never knew jeez okay so the engine's completely screwed more great news i mean if i could summon a working car out of thin air i would wait maybe i can okay she's gone nuts there's a scrap yard up the road if we're looking for a vehicle maybe there's one there that sounds like a long shot dylan come on look i need you we need you fine okay once again dylan puts himself in mortal danger for the sake of his work friends what exactly are we supposed to do i mean the van is nice but it's not exactly fort knox well there's a shelter under the lodge you
