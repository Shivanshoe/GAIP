so you're probably asking yourself how a handsome devil like me ended up in a place like this with you right all right i'll tell you the whole story but i warn you it ain't pretty may seem hard to believe but these chiseled good looks have seen a whole lot of ugly so i guess i'd have to start with the book legend has it that it was written by the dark ones necronomicon ex mortis roughly translated the book of the dead about 20 some odd years ago professor nobi unearthed the book at castle kandar and accidentally unleashed the deadites in the woods outside dearborn that's when i got involved to make a long story short i was sent to hell and back and then back again and again bad enough about that let's talk some more about me like for example how did i end up here well i guess you could say it all started with a woman a woman in that godforsaken book welcome true believers to another chilling episode of mysteries of the occult i'm trisha pettywood your guide into the realms of shadow and the arcane joining me tonight is parapsychologist and best-selling author professor alex eldridge author of the critically acclaimed necronomicon welcome professor thank you trisha it's truly an honor to be here in the very town where my late colleague professor nobi began his career oh the honor is all mine your brilliant modern translation of this ancient text has set the world on fire i'm told there's even a film in the works oh please that hack wouldn't know the real necronomicon from a roll of extra fluffy two-ply here this one's on me i'm awful sorry about jenny tonight would have been 10 years right oh yeah thanks for bringing that up chief you're a real pal for throwing some margarita salt on the wound there perhaps you'd like to poke me in the eye with an umbrella straw while you're at it claims the necronomicon has the power to raise the dead or even travel interdimensionally through time while it's easy to get caught up in the mythology behind the book i'm afraid that sort of thing is just the sad depraved ramblings of a lunatic the real power of the necronomicon lies not in the incantations but in the poetry did you hear that the guy called me a lunatic can you believe that you want to see a lunatic buddy why don't you come on down here and i'll show you a whole bottle full of lunatics absolutely fascinating professor we may never know what really happened in that cabin in the woods but perhaps tonight we can finally shed some light on this famous local mystery there i was face to face with the mother of all ugly so i say come get some and blam no more mr nasty face thanks to my investigative work into the nobi case i've managed to uncover this amazing piece of evidence here in my hand is the last known tape of professor nobi recorded the very night of his disappearance but then it went bad my hand my own hand it grabs the knife and i in the mysteries of the occult exclusive we're going to play the tape live in studio oh i can hardly wait wait the hell are you doing don't play it don't play that [Music] nosferatus [Music] [Music] make mine a double when you've just emptied both barrels of a shotgun into your favorite bartender you can pretty much bet that happy hour is over i went outside to see just how bad the situation was it was bad past experience told me it would get a whole lot worse unless someone hit the deadites where it hurt and seeing as how the tv station was their shortcut into this world i figured that was a pretty good place to start but first i had to find more weapons my trusty boomstick was almost empty your pain my gain kids these days huh what are those things they're everywhere it's like all hell broke loose oh gee do you think say you mind tell me where i can find some more ammo for the old double barrel i'm just a rookie they don't give us a shotgun until our second year i'm pretty good with the sidearm though stick with me and we should be okay oh great an optimist with a gun i just think it's so cool when the parts go flying everywhere say bub is there another way in here oh yeah well the boss has the key but he didn't show up for work yet you know the guys from the day shift should have clocked out by now but there have been some freaking noises coming out of there i sure hope nothing bad's happened to him uh sorry pal sounds to me like your co-workers are playing footsie with the forces of hell right about now but i'll keep an eye out for your boss though put in a good word for you [Music] oh i could cut through this if i had the right equipment [Music] um hey

break into showbiz you want in well i got a key to the main gate but the station is on emergency lockdown you need the master key card to get into the station building but our chief of security has it and he took off yeah where too said something about dying with a smile on his face i figured he went to the kitten club the nudie bar who'da thought an invasion from hell would be so good for business here's the key to the gates personally i'm out of here break a leg huh [Music] so boy that one was ripe wow oh that's just beautiful wow [Music] how'd you like the taste of that [Music] hey nice

[Music] cool oh [Music] so uh so what exactly was the plan here einstein run your hand up the thigh of the supernatural till you get your wrist slapped i uh do seem to have underestimated the power of the book somewhat these creatures if we leave them alone will they eventually go away oh sure they'll go hang out with the easter bunny listen brainiac these are the mother of all pest problems and we are the exterminators you know any good rid the world of demons routines i i always thought these writings were mere superstitious nonsense professor nobi was the one who truly believed in the necronomicon's power three cheers for nobi did he leave any notes any egghead stuff that might tell us how to give these mothers the kiss off he was obsessed he wrote endlessly but would never show me his notes i don't know what happened to them after he died well they gotta be somewhere and if we're gonna live to see daylight we have to find them so after i saved them from a closed casket funeral trish and eldridge showed their gratitude by running for cover in the church leaving yours truly with the dirty work eldridge thought professor nobi made some notes which could help us get out of this thing alive he seemed to think someone at the university knows where the notes are now personally i figured the cops who investigated nobi's murder might have a better idea [Music] hang on oh better than that [Music] um i don't like pardon me officer i need to find some things belonging to a stiff a guy uh called nobi any chance you guys still have his effects no the old crank at the cabin out in the woods i don't know could be kind of wait a minute weren't you a suspect in that case well it was me or a bunch of demons from hell go figure well that case was closed recently anything in nobis we had as evidence is most likely in the trash by now you're welcome to sit through the bins behind the station ah great the one thing missing from my day come on i'll show you so [Music] the yard behind the police station was crawling with dead eyes something told me walking in with guns blazing wasn't the smart option okay everybody lie down on the ground and nobody's gonna get hurt oh oh god no stop it certainly didn't do a whole lot for my police escort it kind of went against the grain but i figured i'd better play this some other way [Music] [Music] uh oh there goes [Music] pardon my french padre but what the hell is that out there that my son is a vortex a portal from another dimension these vile creatures are using it to enter our world if we are to halt the spread of evil someone must close all the vortexes which have opened up around the town uh-huh and the standard vortex closing procedure would be only pure silver can close the vortex the valiant soul must find something made from silver then stand beside the vortex and use the item on it well i'm a valiant soul and all but i'm fresh out of silver have faith my son the lord will provide i hear a gang of beggars robbed a jewelry store last night you might persuade them to give you some silver if they're still alive trust me padre living or dead i can be real persuasive one other thing for our safety i'll lock the church doors after you go use this key to get back in god be with you amen to that brother oh ash say something heroic you know would it kill you to say please just once in a while [Music] i need to see professor nobi's notes can you find them for me oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um oh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] i bet you're a believer in gun control hey officer mind if a humble scholar slips into the university for a little after hours study no way we're just holding our own down here nothing's getting through those gates let's find some of the way wow [Music] uh hey nice stolen silver grease ball fork it over take it man it's yours you sure don't mess around with those things do you i call it tough love ah hell why pretend i call it hate [Music] so [Music] ugh uh got it [Music] [Music] okay [Music] there goes sandwich cheers [Music] shopping boy that one was right hmm [Music] oh um whoa are you born that [Music] there ugly hey nice [Music] wow [Music] thanks fella not sure how you did that but i'm glad you did take this pistol it might get you out of trouble if you're short on shotgun ammo [Music] kick back all of you back i'll make sure the dean hears about this we don't like your class very much professor we're transferring out after we devour your soul no so much for the football scholarship well i solved your little discipline problem there prof no thanks necessary and i'm looking for the notes professor nobi made before he died any idea where i can find him nobody's notes why as it happens i have them myself but i don't think there'll be much use to you ah you'd be surprised prof i'm not as dumb as you've heard well i should hope not wait here and i'll fetch the notes okay you guys want to retake the semester that's fine by me have fun cleaning toilets in hell loser wasn't that a case of overkill no i'd say it was just enough kill you got the notes bright boy yes but as i said i'm afraid they won't be much used to you what you don't think i'm smart enough to read a few crummy notes i know you're not you see professor nobi wrote everything he learned about the nekomonokon using a cipher a psy what hey remind me what that means it means he wrote it in code he was clearly aware of how dangerous the book could be i've spent years analyzing the notes but without the cipher they're gibberish and no one has seen the cypher since nobody died you eggheads never do anything the easy way do you well i guess i'll have to find this cipher oh also if you're searching for professor nobi's personal effects see if you can locate an old gold watch he out i'll reward you handsomely for it so in english that would be you'll make it worth my while right [Music] [Music] hey i think i just found it here for ugly got it so [Music] um hey you're it me [Music] i don't think that i'm afraid saving your ass comes at a price buddy i take all major credit cards or items of pure silver all i got on me is this here parchment figure being old it could be worth something i stashed my cut of the silver in the parking lot at the tv station you're welcome to it i'm getting the hell out of this town [Music] [Music] [Music] hey einstein think you can do anything with this no these notes you found them oh damn that fool look they're written in code yeah i uh noticed that too we must find nobi cipher if we're to make any use of them that'll be me again huh rest in peace [Music] uh animes now [Music] oh [Music] [Music] boy that one [Music] when i returned with the goods i found that someone had beaten me to the church the padre was dead and the other two were awol they were probably dead too but i had to be sure oh what can i say i got my sensitive side too and besides i sure as hell wasn't going to translate that crackpot's notes by myself hey officer you see a hot little redhead and a creepy old bookworm passed this way can't say i did we got a report of civilians being herded up by them dead things and taken to the park you might want to have a look over there ah what do you hear you're dead what the hell trisha and eldritch i better get in there fast or they'll be resting in pieces [Music] [Music] the gates are locked [Music] have fun cleaning toilets in [Music] at hell i can finally read professor nobi's notes accident yes it's all here it seems nobi learned that a mortal could control these evil spirits using an ancient relic called the candarian summoning stone uh by control you of course mean destroy right isn't that right destroy yes of course the summoning stone can be used to send them back to their own dimension we must find it hey you don't have to tell me twice where do we start looking if it's here then it must be in the museum nathaniel payne the man who built it was a great collector of occult artifacts if the summoning stone is as important as nobi thought payne would have found it trisha and i will go to the museum and try to find the stone you must close the remaining vortexes that have opened around town that should buy us some time you know would it kill you to say please just once in a while what are you waiting for man go and close the remaining fortexes kiss my didn't your mom ever tell you never talk to strangers ash you saved us again how can i ever thank you hmm good question you ever see a little movie called deep throat ash really what can i say i'm a man it's lonely being humanity's savior again and again [Music] [Music] don't get all mushy [Music] foreign [Music] ah [Music] better than that say are you robert graham care of auto parts dearborn who wants to know me and professor raymond noby i got a letter from him addressed to you nobody he's been dead 20 years tell it to the postal service buddy now come on what's he put in there translation from the necronomicon some ancient incantation to rid the world of evil right nah he owed me for some work i did on his car back in 81 about time too thanks for your trouble stranger what is that it uh no up here don't go empty-handed would this shotgun ammo be any good to you yeah i might be able to find a use for it [Music] thanks looks like i owe you my ass that's all right i'm not that kind of guy but i'm gonna have to relieve you of any stolen goods you might have on you once you've relieved me can i get out of this crazy town hey there's no way i'm relieving you pal but sure blow [Music] [Music] okay you're it [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] whoa hey somebody ordered a dead guy's watch you found it it dates from the civil war a priceless antique quite valuable uh to a student of history that is uh yeah yeah i'm real happy for you now come on cough up the handsome reward oh of course how may i be of help to you i don't suppose a scholar such as yourself would know way into the museum you know secret entrances underground passages no nothing like that i'm afraid i do have a key for the front door though it happens i'm on the board of trustees well what a coinky think [Music] [Applause] when i finally got inside the museum it was dark and quiet you know what the hell happens next kind of quiet there was no sign of tricia or eldritch then again seemed like the legions of the undead were on a break too i figured now would be a good time to look around for my two compadres [Music] this will do the job say [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm freeze don't come any closer or what you'll shout freeze again sorry buddy i thought maybe you were one of those creatures oh it's an easy mistake sure i look just like him hey listen you seen a cute but annoying redhead and a nutty professor hanging around the museum they're not in here and i sure as hell haven't been out there not since the exhibit started coming to life i always knew something like this had happened someday you did this place was built by a man called nathaniel payne big on the occult brought in weird artifacts from all over rumor was he even built some kind of secret temple in here for making blood sacrifices well people sure got some weird hobbies don't they where is this pain guy now no one knows they say one day about 20 years ago he went down into his temple and just never came out well he must have cable do you know if payne got a hold of a candarian summoning stone i don't know but it sure sounds bad well just think pure evil and you'll be close evil was pain's specialty if he had the stone it'll be in the temple now that i need to get in there can you give me a hand there's supposed to be a hidden entrance someplace in the museum here's my security pass it'll give you access to the east wing exhibits i'll open up the basement [Music] i opened all the doors in the basement only one of them stuck and the system's flaking out i'll keep on trying [Music] alright [Music] [Music] i guess this is nathaniel payne here's the look of someone who's hiding something it says an ancient greek vase circa 440 bc [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh you know if i may say so you look kind of sexy behind bars not now ash we got locked in when the security system kicked in you have got to get us out of here don't get your panties in a twist i'll get you out you are wearing panties aren't you ash this isn't the time for this [Music] i think it's stuck you don't say what now well i guess i could maybe blow it up are you insane look if you can just cut the power to the security system the door should open automatically now why didn't i think of that you really want to know [Music] wow

neck throw up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh oh yeah excellence in the workplace that's my motto hey einstein ever seen one of these gizmos before it appears to be some sort of divining device such things were reputedly used to locate crystals with powerful magic properties but of course that's just superstition right you mean crystals like these yes much like those okay so what do i do with them i'm not at all sure off the record you don't have a clue what the hell you're doing do you [Music] there are four holes cut into the door i wonder what those symbols represent they look like

be wary so i locked the graveyard gate after him well that's good wary is good now where's the key i threw it away in the circumstances i thought better safe than sorry where this town is concerned padre it's a little late for both is that gate the only way out of the graveyard no there are two paths that lead into the woods beyond the graveyard but i doubt he would be reckless enough to venture there well that's because you don't know eldridge see he's a [ __ ] [Music] wow [Music] there goes [Music] [Music] cool [Music] do [Music] come on come get some looks like this guy is a man after my

sticking your finger in the electrical socket can you you're up to the elbow already einstein give it up by way of farewell mr ash i arranged a little family reunion one false move and your not so illustrious ancestor goes to his grave without an heir some might call that a blessing but for you all right already i get the picture allow me to join the dots he dies you die which is why you're going to run a little errand for me i need a spell to send me back through the vortex unfortunately some of our undead friends want it too so you want me to slice and dice and bring back the spell right i think that plays to your strengths don't you the spell is in five pieces bring all five to me and i'll spare the blacksmith you know something eldridge your mouth is like my ass nothing good ever comes out of it spare me your feeble insults and get to work [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] okay eldritch here's the spell now let the blacksmith go at last now if you'll excuse me [Music] kaluto monstro condo had revertands hey merlin we had a deal goodbye ash and good riddance i'll follow you to hell and back eldridge and back again i'm afraid for you

just peachy you're a williams for sure welcome to the family fella thanks but i'm afraid i got some unfinished business on the other side of that vortex i understand guess a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do thought i'm making that the family model sounds swell here i found this for you i guess now i'll never know what you made out of it i'll use it well kinsmen fell so long old fella and take care of yourselves will you for both of our sakes [Music] a quick spin through dimensions and i landed right after eldritch but it looked like we took another detour through history 101. eldritch hightailed it into some kind of old fort and showed them his party piece with a vortex by the sounds coming from inside they weren't too impressed one thing was for sure though i had to find a way into that fort [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh [Music] are you a union man sure i pay my dues how about you ah this is a union fort the rebels have sent demons from hell to attack us they've overrun the fort i saw my cat meeting alive yankees and confederates huh i guess i'll buy that but this war of yours just got a little less civil how do i get into that fort ain't no way you're getting through them gates are barred from inside and strong enough to stop a buffalo charge you'd need an army to break them down [Music] if i could blow up those barrels of gunpowder up there [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so how about it stranger you confederate or yankee yeah i'm just kind of on the fence there i'm just your average guy with a chainsaw that's me you give me one good reason i don't put a bullet in you right now because if you try it i'm going to shove this chainsaw so far up your ass you'll be whistling dixie through a hole in your head comprende you got spunk boy i'll give you that i'll not kill you today but you won't live long in the middle of a war not without a sign to fight for believe me i got battles of my own you change your mind we're camped in the woods beside town south could use a man with spirit and a strong arm i'll think about it me and colonel sanders yes siree [Music] [Music] so [Music] evening padre not much of a turnout tonight huh you're welcome in the lord's house my son but how did you get a key well that's a long story and we're kind of in the middle of a war scenario truly i've offered the church as sanctuary from the perils of war but none of the townsfolk have come yet they've been through so much already wish i could tell you otherwise but they could be going through a whole lot more please my son if you find any of my flock bring them to the safety of the church don't you worry padre i'll make like a regular shepherd boy [Music] all right listen up you screw heads you don't want to be hanging around here as a king-sized demonic army all set to storm the town you're too late mister the confederates already tore through here we lost everything ain't got no place to hide uh there's worse to come buddy follow me the church is the only safe place left in town [Music] you seem to have let's tango [Music] [Music] my flock you found them thank goodness you've done the lord's work my son it appears one of my flock found this fragment of a map near the confederate camp i'm afraid the other half of the map is missing but perhaps you can find the other piece i'm way ahead of you padre one last thing son you look like the sort of man who might find a use for this parchment i found it looks to me like pure evil but the lord works in mysterious ways [Music] [Music] [Music] oh who goes there name's ash i need to see your commanding officer hold fast you got identification no one passes into camp unless they can prove who they are hey hey at ease or something okay geez you guys need to relax [Music] stop right there i told you no one gets in the camp unless they identify themselves first easy there buddy will this do you yes smart you want a colonel smartsman uh yes yes i am well shoot why did you say so any of killer smarts boys is welcome here it's an honor friend yeah the feeling's mutual i'm sure [Music] hmm oh hey from the silverware on your chest i'm guessing you're either the head honcho or a big fan of mr t and who the hell are you mister name's ash houseworth i'm the guy who's going to help you take on that little union fort you've had your eye on what makes you think i need your help to route that yankee rabble cowards didn't so much as fire a shot in hours uh well that might be due to the flesh-eating demons that have taken over the fort demons what kind of crazy nonsense is this the kind that sneaks up and bites you on the ass believe me captain demons are munching their way through that fort and pretty soon they'll come looking for dessert now either you help me get inside and kick their undead asses back to hell or you and your men are dead meat no in fact make that live meat afraid i'm gonna need more convincing than that mister you bring me one of these things in the flesh maybe i won't put it all down to a case of trench fever till then dismissed [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] what the hell was that damn thing was trying to eat my man you say an army of these things

the fort already and they'll wipe out this whole town before sunup if we don't stop them i hear that confederates build a barricade to stop us getting to the fort that should stop the dead getting into town for a while buy us some time uh about that barricade i might have damaged it just a little bit damaged it well maybe a lot actually then nothing stands between them and the town i'll gather the rest of the company and prepare to attack the fort on my way captain me and the boomstick are gonna spend some quality time one more thing ash stop by my house and you'll find an old family

town people they didn't meet they turned into slaves and for some reason they started digging making these tunnels under the town well i guess dead guys like the smell of dirt maybe but then one day they found the remains of an old civil war fort that's where the stone was buried the stone oh the candarian summoning stone oh hell i knew i forgot something once she had the stone there was no stopping them she rules them like her own army she who is she their queen she lives in some kind of chamber under the old church but no one's ever seen it or at least no one's ever come out alive to
