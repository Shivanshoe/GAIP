i'm gonna stretch my legs a little then head out i'll make this right for all of us your mom texted she's working on this building then heading down the block to evacuate people closer to the plaza first you still gonna help totally as soon as i find finn's latest new form set up got some time while genki tracks down finn i should check the app see if people need help something's weakening emergency responder communications should check it out easy uh spider-man thank god something's weakening our emergency comps we can't get through the fire department is anyone still inside no we got everyone out but this fire's gonna jump if we don't get help hear that just noise now i think i can find the source don't worry i'm gonna get your comms back up the sooner i get to the source the sooner the fire trucks get here my webs can handle a fire this big whatever's weakening the signal is just ahead burning real good and all i'm hearing is static guess powering down the tower work insurance only pays out if the whole building goes down so make sure the static stays till then they're weakening calms for an insurance scam i gotta stop them there he's there calms a weak because there's no power i need to charge up that generator hey mr emt dudes are trying to burn down that building for an insurance camp that's why they're messing with your comms are you serious they're putting people in danger yeah how's the fire looking i'm getting real close to jumping to the building next door and i still can't reach the fire department signal should be clear soon hang tight i'll update you getting close hang hang on the signal's stronger now now what'd you do why are you always assuming things are myself huh what's that about can't wait i got to get those calms back to normal kind of feel a little bad for the neighbors what if the fire spreads you must be new here spider-man whoever takes him out gets a bonus you're not walking away from here oh don't get me that easy now to get the comms back to full power there i think that worked i should check on the fire and make sure cons are back up hey how's the signal now everything's coming through loud and clear got through the dispatch too fire trucks are pulling up now [Music] fire department got the building extinguished just in time i'm definitely giving europe five stars glad i could help spread the word too the more people use the app the safer will make new york i'm gonna make sure everybody knows about it thanks again spider-man hey i found finn's setup oscorp science center it's closed for renovations our energy converter that won the middle school science fair that's how she's gonna finish making the new form unstable enough to blow up roxanne plaza whoa it's like she picked it to get back at you maybe she did thanks genki it's my job speaking of time to help your mom evacuate harlem later okay last corpse science center finn needs to know what'll happen if she goes through with her plan and if she won't listen i'll take the new form destroy it if i have to just look natural hey man i'm so glad you're using the app it really feels like it's catching on with people i'm not surprised dude you nailed it take a bow sorry about this nephew can't let you go back out there let krieger and the tinkerer kill each other go back to being spider-man when the heat dies down and what just hide down here i don't get to pick and choose when i'm spider-man i gotta stop finn no you gotta survive i've been trying to teach you that but you don't listen you want me to survive so bad why sell me out to krieger wasn't a sellout yeah i'm serious you were never supposed to get caught krieger broke our deal you want it back in the family and that's the best you could do i saved your life you threw me in a cell to protect you like this is protecting me damn it miles i'm not gonna lose you too and i'm not gonna let people die just to save my skin you underestimated me damn it no don't fight me on this i don't want to but i can't stay down here then i'll do what i have yeah keep you safe his cloaking text i need this isn't about me at all it's about you you're afraid don't you turn [Music] i have to fight for this city when are you gonna understand you can't do that if you're dead you don't realize i'm the only one trying to save you and i'm trying to save everyone else nephew he taught me to put other people ahead of myself you don't get how the real world works dog eat dog not if we make it better throw yourself at enemies you can't beat no one else did that don't say his name you want your mom to bury you too i will let you [Music] you are never gonna accept me as spider-man the risk i gotta take you're right i'm done letting my family die trying to play hero [Music] if that's what it takes just like you [Music] i know i messed up i'll let you down we're family family that didn't stop you from lying to me manipulating me fighting me being family isn't enough anymore it doesn't have to be like this you me hating each other that's how it happened between me and your dad i don't want to repeat that i don't either but i can't be the person you want to turn me into i can't turn my back when people need me i have to be better than that genki my uncle just kidnapped me locked me up what dude are you okay i had to fight him then i said i told him we're done for good i'm sorry that's that can't have been easy it's what i had to do i'm headed to the science center call me if things get bad in harlem i will good luck spider-man uh uh batten down the hatches folks all three stage storm of the century one heck of a blizzard is blowing in make sure you're stocked up on supplies my loyal listeners will already have plenty of jameson's jerky guaranteed to last longer than radioactive fallout meanwhile if you're planning on taking the in-laws to visit trinity church i got some bad news parts of this sacred local landmark are now rubble following yet another skirmish involving spider-man and the tinkerer thankfully roxanne was able to secure the scene quickly the current whereabouts of either masked menace are unclear but right now that's secondary to the fact that roxon has generously offered to pick up the cost of trinity's restoration even though the damage was caused through no fault of their own that's the kind of selfless giving we need more of this time of year folks roxanne just made my nice list i'll give you three guesses who's on the naughty list and they all start with spider an ending man you see in close renovation and the underground moves right in finn's gotta be inside who is that huh huh [Music] closed captioning not available [Music] you can't hide forever [Music] actually you take this all right let's see what kind of security they've got same kind of barrier they had at gym theater i need to drain the generators those shacks which are locked and powered down need a new power source like that giant spinning mobile webs won't reach yeah this will work got it sticky and conductive that's one feeling good oh this is gonna work [Music] this is working a couple more [Music] yes i saw one more i can't believe how well this is working [Music] uh oh sweet time to break the underground's toys finn you here winning the science fair getting to show off our converter here you were so proud huh exhibit was down that hall underground cash finn come on we need to finish this you and me she's got to be with our project down that hall come on molasses i want to see our project while we're still young welcome to the oscorp science center where tomorrow's innovation is today's i'm coming i'm coming hey where'd they put us i've got the museum map on my phone our project's in a special exhibit on the top floor can't wait to see our names on the little sign like real scientists today the ozcorp science center tomorrow every major museum in the mid 20th world scientists have envisioned human habitation beneath the sea looking out your window someday you might see the brightly striped clownfish or even the menacing anglerfish i'm naming that one howard you name one uh leviathan love it energy farms are the key to sustainable healthy living beneath the sea commercial and industrial algae cultivation is already used in a number of products from colorants to pharmaceuticals i wonder what algae tastes like probably kale look i hate kale this model combines the design of a submarine with the deep-sea integrity of an unmanned underwater vehicle oscorp's prototype would unlock new possibilities in humanity's ability to explore you and i got to get one of these bet we could build one out of a vacuum cleaner and some old tires if we put our minds to think it living sounds like science fiction think again underwater habitats have been used around the world since the 1960s this model proposes a permanent residence beneath the waves today new yorkers are building up to save space tomorrow we could be building beneath the sea pass what you scared of sharks the dark tiny enclosed spaces it's a no for me the earth is bigger than you think 95 of the earth's oceans remain unexplored and could be the next frontier in human habitation it's weird to think how little we know about our own planet this knife suit is one of the first developed in the early 18th century the first pressure-proof diving suit was developed with salvage work in mind today's suits such as these are used by salvage workers scientists and explorers i think they'll let me try it on never been would love to see you try to walk around in that thing can't be worse than those shoes you wore to the spring dance oh come on yours were at least an inch higher than mine let's go to the main hall special exhibits upstairs there's the elevator we've got time to look around first he's going to meet us at the restaurant using a shaped memory or memory medal oscorp scientists created this prototype of a metal that could change its shape while maintaining integrity one day memory metal could be used in many types of machinery and even in your own home whoa check it out metal that changes shape i like the idea but it looks kind of basic but it could be improved this model proposes a terraforming and housing initiative on mars our closest neighbor in the solar system this community is designed to draw an abundant water and counteract low temperatures making human life possible on the red planet it's like a whole little community on mars needs coffee shops and street art we should have museums like this oh we got to play oh come on it's just button mashing so you admit defeat never oh come on rock it buddy [Music] gotcha found something i'm better at than you not for longer can be operated as a man or unmanned vehicle used to carry minerals and fine water sources the oscorp rover would make exploration possible to mars stands for minerals carries people across toxic wastelands what can't it do can you imagine driving this thing down fifth move pedestrians solar energy already popular on earth could provide heat and electricity for space stations shuttles and extraterrestrial settlements these oscorp stickers show how flexible and affordable solar cells can be go on take a sticker oh shiny ooh shiny those are portable adhesive solar panels did you ever move the switch portable shine only if my family came too government and privately owned spacecraft explore our planet solar system and galaxy to communicate with them scientists use radio antennas to send and receive messages across local and interstellar space oh i bet the sound quality on these are dope not from space do you have tickets for the special exhibit oh um our project is on display didn't think we needed tickets you do and we're sold out can't let you go upstairs thanks anyway so we need another way in she said there's no more tickets right but see that door the hallway behind it wraps around to the elevator can't just break in we have to they're taking down the exhibit tomorrow and then we'll never see it locked i recognize that kind of lock if you shine a light at it it'll open the flashlights on our phones would work but they won't reach they will if we find a way to slide something reflective under the door something reflective it'd be nice to find something mutable mutable you mean changes shape look at you breaking out the fancy vocab shut up oh hey look it's solo mirrors and sticky on the back perfect for tricking a light sensitive lock take one now we need something we could slide under the door something long and flat something that can be both architectural innovations are the key to human survival on extraterrestrial planets this model home would protect human inhabitants from the low temperatures online check it out you want a house on mars sure if i could bring my mics audio setup sampler they won't let you take all that they will if they want good music on mars not gonna help us get past that door this stuff is crazy that's it take it don't let anyone see got it let's go oh man sorry all good i'll attach the sticker let's get that door open look how the external tools interface directly with the command module's computer we could recreate the idea but with a neural interface it would overload our central power not if we integrated it over the entire mesh from multiple entry points do you think you can handle it with enough time and a lot of coffee absolutely i'll supply the coffee well done peter i couldn't do this without you we should probably head back to the lab we've overstayed our lunch break oh doc i'm so sorry but i've got to take the afternoon off it's an emergency again peter is something bigger going on perhaps at home you know you can talk to me about it oh i'm i'm fine but i'm sorry to run out on you again not at all work will be waiting when you get back thanks doc integration over the mesh that boy's mind never stops this is either genius or really really stupid if we open our own research lab someday no yeah what i'm naming it genius i've got the light tell me when the stickers pointed at the sensor and i'll turn it on no one's looking at us yet gotta hurry need something else that worked we did it that was awesome i'm gonna miss doing stuff like this with you what are you talking about uh hello you'll be at brooklyn visions next week i won't i'm not gonna vanish off the planet we'll still hang out you'll be busy not that busy i'm gonna make time for us seriously okay oh this is getting mushy come on let's head upstairs [Music] hey dad hey mike hi mr davis finn says hi you kids having fun make sure you get a picture of your project dad it's not a big deal it's totally a big deal okay okay we'll get a picture love you dad bye this is it our project's in the back think they got a converter otherwise what's the point they'll need to feed biomass in though maybe hook it up to a trash can cultivating agriculture in nutrient-enriched fluids what we call hydroponics could make farming and space a reality wonder if they can grow flowers in space they're probably more interested in food why you trying to impress someone i like to be prepared in case i get a crush on a cute astronaut okay this engine used in the apollo space program is one of the most powerful inventions that uses liquid fuel today oscorp is building on that technology to maximize fuel efficiency making deep space exploration possible the most powerful single nozzle liquid fuel rocket engine ever made i'd love to build something like that nuclear energy is working on something that's supposed to make nuclear energy keeping it super secretive the oscorp science station positioned at one of two stable lagrange points between earth and the moon could one day be a permanent home for human scientists and explorers man it'd be so cool to live on a space station one of humanity's greatest accomplishments came from the apollo space program we reached the moon since then scientists have dreamed of traveling beyond and someday settling our solar system lunar module from the apollo program hey we can name our time capsule after that how many apollo missions were there 16 17 i think apollo 18. i like it our project [Music] would you look at that genuine award-winning scientists no one told us we were in this special exhibit ticket only how'd you get in uh i bought a ticket how'd you get in not important hey huddle up we need a picture you got to be in it too you helped us get it working okay okay fine fine scoot over all right say alleles i am not saying that finn you need to know i'm done listening to you i had to tell her what happened to the reactor don't let him kill you success emergency oh come on this is my favorite museum gotta focus on that yes the underground just showed up and i saw a rockstar tank runs out of harlem or blocked where are you near your apartment trying to find shelter get the day of bodega i'll be there soon we'll keep everyone safe as long as we can gotta take care of them before i head back to harlem think back much to enjoy thank you i hit spiderman i need to get to harlem now before finn destroys the reactor dinky talk to me how's the evacuation going roxanne and underground are all over it's like a war zone are

do this [Music] i can't let you stop me [Music] don't you see what the reactor's going destroying the plaza tearing down trevor's monument who fed you that krieger i ran the number why won't you listen to me [ __ ] couldn't change the reactor he's not that smart he's smart enough let me stop this why can't you just admit you're wrong maybe because i'm not quick cared more about protecting people than punishing them please ben i'm telling you the truth i shouldn't have lied to you about getting into the underground if i could go back you can't stand still i don't want to do this ben stop leave yeah i don't want to fight we'll talk after i just able to react finn look the reactor's still going critical soon we won't be able to stop it i am not running away again [Music] i am on your side we can take down rock stone with what we know about uniform it won't work no one cares about that did you feel that we have to stop the reactor i've beaten you before i'll do it again not this time not this time give me a break that won't keep her locked down for long [Music] not getting rid of me that easy that won't keep her locked down for long oh hey battle royale my favorite uh i just wanted to chime in and let you know so you don't worry we're gonna be just fine with this building hello hell will we find them all in harlem i mean do you have any idea what kind of insurance we've got being the victims of a terrorist attack forget roxanne plaza coming soon roxon city all right later i have to stop him not like this did you feel that we have to stop the reactor i know about the promise you made to rick but he wouldn't want ah just stop miles not till you do keep dodging see if it helps you wanted the truth here it is rick would have hated that you turned into the tinkerer [Music] how can you defend his murderer i'm not but i can't sacrifice carlos to take down krieger please finn i'm telling you the truth the first i shouldn't have lied to you about getting into the underground if i go back you can't how do you move so fast you heard krieger the only people you're hurting are the ones in harlem krieger was lobby he had to be the more weapons you build the more i'll destroy i gave you every chance to leave don't make me kill you you can't win why do you keep fighting because i'm spider-man death will okay nice try miles me too that dose i should

idea who i am i will own you yeah yeah we know who you are oh you do you hear me that's right friends simon krieger is in prison aaron davis aka the prowler flipped on him and roxon davis will serve time but could get a reduced sentence i think we can all learn something from what happened in harlem together we're stronger and that having your own neighborhood spider-man is pretty great i'm looking good hayley hey all right man see you around hey kid what are you up to signing up for a shift obviously good on you after a break see ya hey man what's up i'm all right man i'm good i'll see

they saw us as disposable me rick finn all of harlem i think part of our job is making sure they can't get away with it we'll add it to the spider-man oath go time go time residents of harlem are still feeling the effects of the recent city-wide uprising of the group known as the underground while the roxanne corporation deals with a wrath of lawsuits newly elected city councilwoman rio morales addressed the media yesterday to make a plea for additional public funds to assist with these vitals are good circulatory system healthy um brain activity normal he's been in there long enough mr osborne i understand he's your son but he's my one he's gone but we may be underestimating the potential i said get him out now goodbye finn uh hey ma you busy not too busy what's going on i just left trinity church and i was thinking about ben and tell me about it she saved my life and yours everybody's but she's the one who put us in danger in the first place but after seeing what happened to rick i get why she did it people are messy take your uncle aaron he's the reason krieger's in jail and he helped us get people out of harlem but every time i look at him i think of all the pain he put your dad through yeah you don't need to make a judgment on things like mijo or her death just remember who she was and why you loved her you always know what to say that's my job call me back if
