he'll be joining the Doria soon enough in [Music] it's closed state bar is no match for me [Music] all I need to do now is finish off the rest of freezers pathetic toons as good as mine the easy prey we wouldn't have to split up and find the villages if we just had our Scouters well look at that if it isn't Sorbonne you know I ran into you friended Oriya earlier he's super dead and soon you will be what you beat to Doria so that's why he never came back pleases I hear you've lost all your precious counters and had to split up to look for namekian villages which can only mean freezes holding on to the Dragon Balls you obtained so far Frieza will not get his dirty hands on all of them I'll make sure of it I've already found one myself and the others are as good as mine what [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] great [Music] [Music] the power of just a taste of that berry power [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself they're yours now after all that you couldn't lay a finger on me hmm you've improved I'll give you that much at least but you don't seem to realize the mystique you've just made you have awakened my true power you got quite a sense of humor go on show me your power you are going to regret this Vegeta prepare to be amazed by my glorious transformation [Music] you you must feel pretty foolish you into all that trouble to grow stronger and for what nothing and here's something else you probably didn't know Lord Frieza also hides his true power behind transformations oh he passed out I'm afraid I can't let you die just yet I still have a lot to ask you I can't believe I'm actually providing aid to a trader like you once you're fully conscious you're going to tell me where you've hidden the Dragonball there it is that's gurus house that's it okay I'm glad to see you're safe today grand elder guru is aware of your situation you two may enter grand elder guru will see you now welcome young earthling I understand I have you just thanked for saving my little den day here my gratitude huh well I really did too much it pains me that most of my children on this planet have fallen victim to such vile invaders I had no idea the Dragon Balls the very symbols of namekian wisdom and power could cause such strife forgive me for cutting straight to the chase but do you think I could borrow the one that you got right there look I won't let the bad guys get their hands on it I promise I'd like him to have it as well if the Earthlings gift the Dragon Balls they can wish for theirs to return to Earth what what where are dragon balls on earth as well is or was there an emic in there yeah oh yeah I remember hearing about one coming to earth in order to flee some sort of crisis here on Namek it must have been Coty's child truthfully I'm surprised the child was able to survive the journey if memory serves me he was a gifted member of the dragon clan the creators of the Dragon Ball but how is it he met his end did he die of natural causes or was he killed he was killed by someone here on Namek a Saiyan named Vegeta young earthling please step forward I would like to look into your past Mike [Music] my goodness is split himself intro to combat the evil in his own heart how foolish to reduce such extraordinary potential is such a waste if he had remained as one he might not have met with such a horrible fate remained as one wait does that mean if comi and piccolo rejoined piccolo will get his power back very well I can see that your intentions are pure and that you have exhibited great bravery thus far I will entrust this Dragonball to you however you might not be able to make you wish what do you mean unfortunately I am NOT wrong for this world I have perhaps only a few days left do you think you can reclaim the remaining Dragon Balls from those horrible feelings as strong as you are I feel that might prove impossible once I am gone the Dragon Balls will cease to exist I see well I guess we'll just have to do what we can I'll keep the Dragon Ball and I'll guard it with my life I appreciate it I must say you seem to possess a great deal of strength for an earthling but much of it lies dormant and unrealized how unfortunate for allow me to release the power resting deep inside you what are you talking about there's no way I'm hiding any more power I mean I'm already pushing myself to the limit yeah I've never felt this kind of power before this is incredible wait would it be okay if I brought a friend of mine here to see you I bet he's got more untapped power than me hidden inside of him yes please bring him here we could use another ally in the fight for justice okay I'll be right back with him now wait here Dendi I'm gonna go get Gohan okay all right be careful [Music] you [Music] hey Gohan according to the radar the dragon Bowl over there is on the move it's heading straight for us do you do you think it's Crillon on his way back I bet it is what about this one v5 here probably the ones that Frieza guy has and hey here's this one all by its lonesome wait that's the village we heard Vegeta was attacking right but Vegeta isn't there I don't fit his energy anywhere near it oh I think I get it he attacked the village but he didn't find the Dragonball let me borrow the radar FOMA i'm going to go find that Dragonball [Music] okay here we go hey actually thank you so much [Music] perfect now's my chance I'm not sensing any scary energy in the area that's good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if they don't can handle this see should be right around here this is awful the villages and ruins got to find that Dragonball [Music] [Music] [Music] but what was it doing in a place like that maybe the villagers were in a rush to hide it [Music] what was that explosion just now it can't be he's not in the recuperation tank then Vegeta where could he be fight him Saban fight him now aha the Dragon Balls looks like five of them are here and I can't leave this place without all five of them looks like time isn't on my side either great going out to buy myself some time here [Music] there we go now it's my turn yeah that filthy stay and monkey Vegeta appears to be up to the Dragon Balls yep the Dragon Balls damage is excusable you were scoured is entire planet in finer treasure feet after one hours time do not return to me with Vegeta know that your death will be a slow and painful one oh yes sir it pains me to say but it appears Saiyans are capable of more than I initially thought they seemed to grow stronger with each battle they managed to survive they can't hope to reach my superior level of course still hit mic proof prudent to finally rid myself of them once and for all it would be quite bothersome if I had to deal with a Super Saiyan it seems it may be time to call the ginyu force here they are yes yes I'm untouchable this is what you get Frieza your Dragon Balls are finally mine now that I have these and the one that I hid underwater that leaves just one to collect then I'll have all seven [Music] this huge power sense our bond great we had no idea had this kind of power then I can make it back to Gohan in no time at all that go on it's gonna get way stronger than me when he beats guru the little runt from Earth why is he or Namek and is holding the very last Dragonball as well [Music] seems fortune is smiling quite favorably on yours truly today cheetah where did he go if I don't find him soon Lord Frieza will have my head wait that oh I finally found you Vegeta huge power level is on its way here guess Saban found me good once I get that dragon ball off the pint-sized earthling I'll finish him off once and for all Zorba's probably quite full of himself back to the last encounter which means his guard should be down one thing at a time first I have to get my hands on that dragon fool I told you to hide it's not safe for you he's that a dragon ball yeah I got it from guru he's a remarkable person oh yeah that's right where's Gohan I want to take him to see guru to increase his power level he left to go look for the other Dragonball the radar showed one in the village Vegeta attacked before what really took power no way Vegeta you're a long way from home earthling oh no it was so focused on my increase in power that I didn't notice him he's not wearing a Scouter and that means she must have learned how to sense power levels without one that's a nice dragon ball you've got yourself there it would appear that you and I are after the same and the-- fortunately for you I have some business to take care of before I take it but I think twice before doing something stupid like running away if I were you [Music] there you [Music] well will you've got some nerve Fujita thanks to your foolish actions Lord Frieza has lost faith in me if you don't give me the location of the Dragon Balls this instant I'll just have to beat it out of you you're welcome to try you never learn do you [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself I sincerely hope you're ready for your tryst [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] remember when I come to life by a thread I bet you regret healing me now don't you something to keep in mind we say and grow stronger every time we're brought to the brink of death oh yeah that's right Goku keeps getting stronger after each one of his fights so Baldy what's it going to be you're walking over that ball or am I taking it okay if I give this to you do you promise just to take it and leave fine why not there's no point in wasting my time with small fries like you once I have the Dragonball finally I will be the one to rule over the universe not that foolish Frieza the immortality will be mine [Music] just let him have all seven dragonballs want Gohan we're counting on you whatever you do don't let Vegeta find you [Music] I hope Krillin and boom are okay better hurry [Music] [Music] better pick up my speed ha this one has four stars it's just like the one I'm coming hurry up and hide where to hide where to hide [Music] where did this power come from all of a sudden but it's gone what's going on here who's there if you don't show yourself right now I'll reduce this place to ashes well if it isn't Kakarot little brat the Dragon Ball wait where did you get that it was a gift from that follicly challenged friend of yours you killed him didn't you no he's alive but I'd be more than willing to fix that if you'd like I don't think I'll let you live luckily for you I'm feeling generous now that I've got all the Dragon Balls [Music] all of them [Music] furious Sal what's that you've got in your hand there oh if the watch Oh with such primitive technology I'm surprised you Earthlings managed to make it to a remote planet like this if you're here then that must mean Kakarot here - no he is it oh I see that's too bad when you get back to earth tell Kakarot something for me the next time we meet I'm going to turn him and his precious planet into space dust oh [Laughter] that was close [Music] Krillin Shawn Krillin look what I found way to go Gohan we knew you could do it free job go huh better get out of here and quickly Vegeta now knows where to find us yeah I know I ran into him not too long ago what fortunately I was able to hide this ball well enough that he didn't find it oh man you're one lucky kid you know that that's enough let's get out of here it's not here impossible it's a straight shot from where that brat was to here and where the earthling was before but how how did he find it that device he was holding that wasn't a watch damn had little maggot No they're gone damn Earthlings they have no idea who they're messing with it's only a matter of time before they come after the six Dragon Balls I have at my disposal and when they do I'll make them regret ever having crossed me [Music] Krillin and the others were able to secure one of the Dragon Balls from guru but it was quickly stolen by Vegeta but thanks to Gohan's quick thinking they were able to prevent vegeta from getting his hands on all seven of them in order to avoid Vegeta's wrath the trio had to find a new place to hide Krillin then made his way back to guru with Gohan in tow freezes ace up his sleeve the King you force no way [Music] what you we gotta make sure that Vegeta and the others don't find us right you think I have as much power as Vegeta hidden inside me all sorts of untapped power I'm pretty good huh I think I can handle this [Music] hang in there go on it's not much longer till we reach guru right go on there it is on top of that tall mill see it [Music] go on I'm sensing great power what it can't be it's Xena Gohan I'm gonna buy us some time you hurry up okay [Music] do you have a death wish runt hand over that Dragonball with the four stars on it right now or face the consequences what are you talking about if you won't talk I'll just have to make you [Music] mmm stone diggin um I heard you can unlock latent power indeed an latent power is something you have in great abundance however I sense you also bear some resistance towards it a full awakening will require some effort real sorry but we're kind of in a hurry worry not I need only time for a few questions when I won't happen to the power buried deep within you now calm your mind and answer okay my boy what do you think of great power [Music] no no they my boy yes to you power can be a frightening force indeed [Music] but that is not all I sense you feel its full potential as well let us move on tell me when should power be used [Music] correct power must be utilized only when necessary the final question upon gaining power for what purpose will you fight now then upon gaining power yes that is why you fight think only of this and relax now I shall begin you there's someone in there that's where you've hidden the ball isn't it no wait Vegeta don't get lost there's no way I'm letting you inside do you want to die that badly a huge power level is inside that must be Kakarot so he is here after all what the hell it's you how did you increase your power so much [Music] deadly I have a favor to ask of you my child please let the office know there is a large unknown power source approaching the planet granddaughter guru says something is approaching the planet Hey it's gotta be Goku Goku is finally here what you really think so it feels like there's more than one more than one wait that means one two three four five energy damn it has to be the ginyu force I can't believe Frieza actually called the ginyu force you give me the Dragonball right now are you insane there's no way we're gonna give it to you just do it I won't lay a finger on you once I'm immortal you have my word you think we're falling for that don't you get it each member of the ginyu force is just as strong as me maybe even stronger and there are five of them they'll hunt us down with their advanced counters and kill every single one of us there's only one way to beat them and that's to give me the ball so I can wish for immortality the Saiyan may be speaking the truth there are indeed five evil power sources on their way but if we do this then we came all the way out here for nothing the Dragon Balls grant the use of three wishes you can still have your wish granted one wish if I don't get my wish then kiss your asses goodbye okay fine follow us she would better keep your promise fly as fast as you can [Music] so they finally arrived [Music] [Music] I've been expecting you thank you sir part frita we humbly await to carry out your orders the traitorous Vegeta has stolen the Dragon Balls I've gone to great lengths to obtain make him suffer for his crime and then bring him to me alive consider it done [Music] scholars have already locked on we have Vegeta's location no freezer he's a scary you'd think now time for our mission man are you ready for this [Music] FOMA no time to talk we're taking the dragonball what what's going on was that Vegeta just now Sabitha on the move make it in time are you pleased I think I can handle this well hey there Vegeta there fast we didn't even see them coming dammit we were so close oh if I'm not mistaken that's one of the Dragon Balls isn't it a 5 behind you plus the 2 you're holding that adds up to all 7 yeah and you're not getting your purple hands on them fine we'll just have to take them from you then cool no how did he damage so that tubby four-eyed freak actually does have the ability to stop time not good and that's all 7 of them all that's left is to finish you guys off Vegeta your suffering will be handled by me personally yeah that's right oh I suppose you're right fine raccoon you take Vegeta Gould oh you take the two kids this should be interesting aren't I a great captain in the meantime I'll deliver the Dragon Balls to Lord Frieza and then he will finally be able to attain immortality [Laughter] no Kudo won't you fish those pipsqueaks up first this isn't fair I'm gonna be done with this in no time all right here goes nothing release your power [Music] [Music] [Music] that was dirty no no no No no no a member of the ginyu force be beaten by these kids you gotta be kidding me whoa you see that Kudo just got his butt handed to him oh that's just great now that we're down a man a special fighting pose is going to look ridiculous discontinues gonna have to come up with a new pose that the four of us can do yeah if we can keep this up until goku gets here we should be okay you two really are off on your own little world aren't you gouda was nothing he's the weakest of the bunch the real suffering truly starts now all right Jeter now he's our turn to play you kids can play too if you want Hank I'll play with all of you [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] prepare yourself [Music] are you ready to die [Music] [Music] right that was a good warm-up now let's see what you can really do [Music] simply magnificent captain ginyu I must admit I'm impressed you were able to gather all seven dragonballs so quickly there's no higher honor than such praise from you Lord Frieza oh it is finally time to turn my dream of immortality into a reality let's begin shall we Dragon Balls I command you to grant me immortality and eternal youth sir are you are you immortal now no I suspect not there must be some sort of incantation to activate them have some sort of secret phrase that or even Emeka ins no seems I'll have to hunt down more of those worms oh look at that I'm picking up three namekian power signatures it appears a few of them survived Lord Frieza if you would like I can force the phrase out of them no I think I'll ask them myself you'll do well to remember that I have experience dealing with these primitive creatures captain ginyu you stay here and keep watch over the Dragon Balls understood Lord Frieza I won't disappoint you [Music] you
