the well give me your counsel you who seek immortality may find it within these waters but there is a price as always the mead is not magic alone it requires the sacred waters of mimir's well to ferment into its final state before you take these waters you must infuse them with the blood of the asp to remember you it must know you surrender a part of yourself to the waters that nourish the world tree only then you have that which you desire you yourself have lost much for wisdom beheaded by those who did not value your learning my hooger is here that is all that matters i have learned

sacrifice has been made whosoever drinks of the meat the world tree will remember them and you what is your sacrifice my liberty will not forgive this trespass they will hunt me now to the edges of the nine worlds what are they to you we ruled together for a time a noble triad as father mother and the sacred voice six times we tried to blunt the fangs of ragnarok and six times we failed the mede was our seventh but they feared how it might change the humans for the worse so they locked it away and banished me from utgarder by your efforts you have returned to me what is mine the ashes of my husband he made his own sacrifice for knowledge with a few changes to this need i may undo old sorrows do as you will i've had my fill of this cursed realm right mind hearts ease beloved i will not fail you again my work here is done now to ask god to save my people come settle your mind and tell me what you have seen strange things velka i'm learning much and seeing more than my mind can

meat i hope to live beyond my own death well into the future fascinating was that your final vision they have not ended not yet something compels me to return to asgard the elixir is ready when you are hmm so the norney told me you'd be here the cord is forged gleiphner i call it i'll wager there's a good story behind that wound a tale for another time thank you for this when you bind the beast spare no loose ends the cord will stretch or shrink to fit your needs how tightly will it hold the beast may resist the more you tighten the cord the stronger it will hold and the greater it will hurt till the beast is rooted to the ground thank you ivaldi you may go you mean from asgard do you not my debt to you is paid in form yes as promised thank you harvey i hear i did not expect you to remember where will you go next under the mountains of svatalpine our mountains to free the earth's riches for this is what i know best so what do you see tyr are you near javi you're a bomb to my eyes what happened to yours a sacrifice for something greater is the wolf nearby yes but he's grown i have kept him company or he is consumed by a sadness i cannot understand regrettable but necessary i knew from the start this wolf brought ill-tightening from the start it was a kind creature but our mistrust and cruelty have robbed the poor wolf of its sweetness and life would it be a kindness to kill it then we are past the time for such mercy this wolf has power now that would test our strengths combined i fear he is possessed of a power that renders him ever living then we will offer him a different fate this cord is unbreakable you must convince him to wear it it will act as a leash whose magic will signal that he is safely secured and assumed to the ac to fear him a beacon that is all no harm will befall the poor fenrir fender yes you know the creature's name did logi tell you he did it is a fine name yes dweller of the fence an up name for his current fate andre a good word has come i wish you well great wolf but a fear still hangs over oscar the eyes here worry about your growing size and strength and what do they have to be afraid of old friend brings a caller fashioned by the dwarves a beacon that we may track from a distance to know where you roam wear this and you may live and thrive in asgard without worry i smell something sour wear the color i'll return to youtube there's no third way son of loki have i not treated you with kindness we are bonded unite and as i trust my king so you may trust me open your mouth as a pledge of faith you may take my hand if i am untrue be swift hobby it burns harvey i'm fighting army here you stay fender hear you die just save her brothers will fight one another kill one another you speak in riddles turns red so come on uh um me foreign uh but where did you hear these words of prophecy thank you so foreign um how do you know these i tell things each night turn cold and dark before i swim uh uh foreign so so oh i could not strike the killing blow all my oaths remain unbroken anyone lesser would have succumbed to his hatred if i could have done this any other way there was no other way harvey our fates are fixed fate i know you made a great sacrifice on my behalf it was not for you do not think your kindness has made you a new friend lord of imbeciles i will kill you all of you gorging an aesir flesh you may strike the final blow son of loki but i will savor my years of freedom before we meet again come old friend the healing hands of freyja can help have you come to say what i fear not to say but to show a vision of the times to come none living or dead now equal our heavy in arrogance to believe that you could remake your fate thus for all your efforts for all your struggles the threads of fate still bind you as tightly as that and yet from this pattern a single strand escapes the fray and stubbornly clings to the weave aside your tomb will come the earth will shake the sun will die yatner will stalk your streets as fire rains upon your heads and the great wolf fenrir will feast upon your blood but you have found a way to live beyond this terror let it flow to cheat your death from the life three we go to the livestream we shall one day return mind and spirit will search to a time far beyond your own to a time in which you shall be reborn none may follow loki least of all it is done time to face our end this was not my day to die avor you have awakened with more to share i hope i returned to asgard and what did you see i witnessed the final vision from the nordia the coming of ragnarok all was fire and ash a chaos like a foul wind from the depths of kinunungap but we were ready for the coming storm eight of us we drank the meat then stood and marched to our doom and that was the end of the north near's prophecy how curious was there more i bound the wolf fenrir loki's son with an unbreakable court the beast was enraged by my actions we fought and i prevailed but i could not kill the beast you visit lore and legend things i would never have imagined to be real parables yet here you live them as memories every moment there was as tactile and as vital as you and i seated in this hut this is wonderful was there more that was a betrayal i betrayed my friend tear i stood by as the great wolf mauled him tearing his arm off at the joint i could have said something to prevent it given him a warning but i did nothing how did it feel i was unmoved by his pain not hateful but i did not regret my indifference a swake of poison that drinks like wine selfishness unmeasured often feels this way what else did you see i can make sense of no more i see the thrust of these visions seem clear to me as in your first reverie a fear of betrayal hangs upon you odinn has seen fit to gift you with his infinite knowledge and the treasure of his experience perhaps his tale is a warning the indifference he felt is a great pity see that you do not follow this same road to do so would risk a loneliness a personal exile worse than death i understand oh i hope i do thank you valka how do you feel avor i would rather not talk about it i understand i want to see the alliance map tell me about jorvik python says there are three more targets there if that is true you are in luck our old friends jor and luvina have made their homes in jorvik both had status and influence in norway so they may have valuable insights into the city's politics that would make my work easier what say you then i will go now do you know where i might find hyor and luffina when entering a new city it is best to ask around the ports the people there know more than the average peasant looks like i have a new letter this woman speaks of her child grindel cruel fate the gods have woven malevolence this land bears deep affliction magic so huh and that left me a challenge my service on purpose uh uh unravel this looks like an old cellar yeah reeks of stale wine are those barrels still full this is a shaft i can see something at the bottom but it's out of my reach the wine has filled the shaft bearing my prize with it i should be able to reach it now drinking horn it looks valuable a good find i think uh foreign ah [ __ ] [ __ ] oh so so hmm uh so huh uh let's see what lies in store so ah foreign uh so uh uh huh uh another vessel i serve some purpose uh uh what surprises await me this time what uh foreign uh uh uh uh uh one more enigma to unravel um hmm artifact we give me ah uh uh uh in the kingdom of freesia we honor your type pagan we strive as you strive to achieve the perfection of the ancient ones pagan to be pagan is perfect oh uh uh what you expecting foreign ah no more winters for you better to die than face my lords i hope my magister magnus forgives me for so long i looked to him for guidance for order if your honor is slow a true lord cannot forgive you they cannot huh now i will turn my gaze toward antiwar and shoenor i will continue to turn until i find some forgiveness you will spin and drill yourself to an endless button so won't be long now so uh can't stop me ah so i once knew a man cleaned all the rats in london he took his time they loved him and he loved them they lived freely we came to see him for a scrub rats have a certain freedom but they feed on [ __ ] it's a coward's freedom a valhalla for the vanquished so uh uh huh yes so so gods this is immense uh stone pillars the holes at that base are you the sword the britons call excalibur uh uh what is this a cold fire it throws no heat through darkness from one place to another uh my is if you [ __ ] this must be jorvik the order of ancients lurking its streets and alleys my old friends your and luffin i live here hold here settled near this harbour someone should know where to find them my friend could you help me find some of my people i'm looking for sure and lufthana sure i know him are you a friend i am then you will get no help from me or any of the other merchants for that matter now if you don't mind hmm bitter she obranged him somehow cast about this lap my friend little one can you help me i'm looking for some friends did the names your

clean dock in jorvik you must be the dark master what gave it away everyone hates you as i just explained to your friend there if your wares have been seized take it up with the council these merchants are not my friends but i'm looking for something you're loofing you know and you finna what business do you have with them i know them now you seem to know them too point me in the right direction in a manner surrounded by flowers that's where cure and euphina live how about some coin for my trouble how about i cut out your tongue forget i said anything a manner and luffy have done well for themselves keep your coin pouch close to you there are pocket thieves around lately i gotta wait for the yuletide feast here this is their home the place has been ransacked and this body it's not yours scattered scrolls a thief was looking for something there was a struggle here looks like it continued outside blood nobody which way that they go is this one of the thieves the trail continues who is that come closer now it's it's me lufina it's avor evil but who sent you are you at them you're adult you know me i am a friend are you you show up here like this these people tried to kill me heard there was trouble in jorvik i have only come to help on my honor i am sorry avor i did not mean to doubt you it has been a tense few weeks who were they why were they after you they were after this i do not know what it is but these men were ready to kill me for it a poor fellow soldier of christ you know him i've seen a letter like this before in london this city is in great danger where's your at the royal hall i will take you there pull up your hood we may not be safe just yet this way they are still looking for me hide low we can slip past them do go on she can't have gotten far look around hold them up let battle sweat flow you choose come on then ah i cannot see any others let's keep moving this way let's go uh i think it is safe now god savor your arrival could not be better timed call it fate i had hoped that path would cross again though i imagine to calm a reunion we've led one problem only to find ourselves embroiled in another while king richie is preoccupied with the money shortage a group called the red hand has been imposing their will the ones who attacked you yes and no they are band-aids but someone is controlling them look no further than the names in that letter killing them is the reason i'm here but they are coated they could belong to anyone the sludge in the streets often drips from the gutters of the homes when in doubt look to those in power you mean the council cure is on the council that works in our favor it pleases me to see you old friend all are welcome here in your week it's good to find you well you're both of you what are you doing here you have not come all this way for the yuletide i've come to warn you old warrior about a rut in your city three figures corrupt and dangerous we should work together to bring them into the light and kill them before they come to power however i may help i am ready slow yourselves ever we cannot just go running around the city poking and prodding and killing at these people sent the red hand after her ready to shed blood in your streets to keep themselves a secret but they failed this is the letter that was sent to our home the needle the firebrand the forced they belong to a group called the order of ancients these are their assumed names our leads listen to him he has dealt with their kind before corruption has seeped i do not want his counsel all i have told you stays between the three of us but you should introduce me to the king i will need to align with him if we are to go about this freely the pits are winning this war we should be scraping together every ounce of silver to procure food for our men understood dear father but we also have a responsibility to our town's people the yuletide must go on enough the more you argue the more my head hurts cure i was not aware we had company the likes of which i did not approve you have a problem in jorvik yes i'm looking at it a problem that nearly got my friend killed luffiner was attacked by the red hand they raided her home destroyed her property and chased her through the streets those bloody scoundrels again she survived but the red hand has been a growing problem here of late and what is your stake in this he's some sort of wandering mercenary no this is secret giant's draenger took our old camp by the river nana as i hear it i am follow it warchief to haftan rang nashon and this welfare westero is alden high reef of your week i've seen rebel groups like this before they sit and wait and the moment you lower your guard they spring up like weeds if left alone they will take your wig out from under you not what you want but what half them wants oh dear what do you want tell me what you know about the red hand that i will rid your city of them you can go about your affairs they've been sticking their hands in coppers around the city targeting nobles merchants and anyone else they can throttle and they are growing as you said i would rather not be worrying about them calm you tied this is not something we can afford to ignore if we do not have the means to deal with a red hand we should let evil do what you can but do it quietly i do not want the public alarmed pure send funds to procure food and ale for faravid's men and make sure there's enough left over for the feast but it's as i said we don't have to find it i have spoken he tells me to find more silver where in a dragon's horn she will know where to begin i cannot tell if that went the way you had hoped it went well enough richer will stay out of my way no one can argue the red hand must be dealt with speak a word of this to no one the circle of trust must stay between the three of us you will forgive me for stepping away i grow weary of those pissing contests my love i am sorry for what happened i should have been there nonsense you have your duties to fulfill besides a few bandits is hardly something to worry over i am only glad you are not harmed ava i will be around if you need me once you catch the tail you do not let go old habits die with the struggle yours changed softened politics it takes the north out of a norse i'm happy for him and you as well you have made something of yourselves here perhaps what do you have there christian texts the gospels iglesiates the revelation of john the red hand steals all they can find we may run their city now but the christians must still be allowed to worship as they see fit seems the red hand disagrees what's more alvin is worried they will come for the archives next between this and all the uproar at the harbour i would say we have some leads what does the red hand want with christian texts that is the question whatever it is there's no length they will not go to to retrieve them they have even burned people alive who refuse to hand over what they demand where's the largest collection of texts in the city the archives but they haven't been so ebola's to attack it yet also keeps a close eye on the place i will try my luck there i went by the harper when i first arrived the duck master looked wary when i asked about you that does not surprise me he's been using jorvik's money shortage to increase taxes as if he's been ordered to by the council your would never wrong the people like that even if richie demanded it the dog master is a thief and a liar a man in need of a throttling i will have another look around the harbour try the trade depot it's where he's holding the merchant's wares i'll get started at once no i need you here listen to the voices in this hall look for any signs changes in behavior anything i would swallow a horse heart to join you aboard i know old friend your loyalty is why i need you here i will return when i find something like that you
