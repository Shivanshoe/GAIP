don't remember we're getting on to morelo's turf now there's some kind of line between his streets and ciliary streets not really there's always some give and some take though in general we look after little italy and his guys work north park and more besides you're walking on the wrong sidewalk in a rural part of town you start getting a sense you need to be someplace else you can feel long before they start appearing on street corners to stare you down okay it's close by morello's goon smoking jaw up front leave their motors out back there's some lazy bastards they put some gorilla on guard

out of sight till they lose interest drive careful tom you don't need more heat he's gone go back to patrols okay good let's head back and see the boss i thought silly oh you had cops on the books some street cops sure but morello's got the chief in his pocket how'd it feel feel good hug what feel taking out the guy taking dino's car feel good yeah i guess it did it's no time like the first time tom don't get better you think it's for you there's life what's it to you hey i'm just asking questions i like asking questions i doubt that every day you and sam going panel beep motors in parking lots busy days it's slow days had more of an introduction than i ever got you never got to beat up dino's pals and take his motor nah stolen enough cars to get noticed i guess when i got squeezed by the cops knew never to squeal and one day i found myself in a yard behind a bar drawing with vincenzo ten years go by and i'm still there so i got a suit now and vinnie's an old bastard i always thought that to be in a family you had to have more connections your brother or younger oh some guys sure their cousin got made or you like carlos he's popping way back with the don that means you get trusted more when you're starting out there's plenty of us who came in off the street i'm thinking we get you in front of the boss then we tip a few well i don't got plans so sure you don't got plans the plans are to feed vinnie so much booze that luigi has to roll him out the door again i'm good with whatever sure you are [Music] so what happened to the car i sent you out with dumped it well why it was a boiler this one's better up of a better car with a broken window russia ain't never killed nobody he's still with you then somehow yeah hey boss it's done no trouble yeah nothing we couldn't handle mr celiardi good good sit down you see morello nah but he'll be plenty pissed when his boys tell him what happened he's not going to be able to think straight for weeks [Music] see that's the difference between me and mariella i'm a businessman i do everything with this every decision i make it's what's good for the business and my boys but marella is a hothead and all that anger burns out the brain and when he gets mad he gets stupid you got nothing like that to worry about with tommy here he was aces the whole way boss i'm glad to hear it i got a growing business here we could use a guy like you to help out around the bar maybe run some errands make sure the bills get paid on time you up for that oh it'd be an honor sir good good now polly and sam have already vouched for you but you need to understand we have a few rules around here so you listen and listen good first no cursing on the premises there's a million words out there the man who needs to resort to [ __ ] this and [ __ ] that is just ignorant or lazy second we don't deal in the hard stuff i don't want any fiends in this neighborhood we'll let morella poison his own people if that's what he wants finally stay out of trouble with the cops we only have a few on the payroll and if you cross the line the rest will come after you you understand yes mr salieri then i'm going to only ask you for one more thing tommy i don't keep paulie and sam around just because they're strong a lot of guys out there bigger and tougher than these two and they don't keep frank and apparel because he's smart though he is an artist with the numbers all these guys in this room they're here because they have the only thing that matters to me the only thing that should matter to any of us you know what that is tommy they're loyal that's right now you stay straight with me you're going to be living the high lifetime but you abuse my trust don salieri you won't ever need to worry about me [Music] okay then welcome to the family [Music] excellent now i'm starving luigi let's see welcome a barman luigi it's not much of a cook but his daughter sarah madone [Music] those first days in salieri's bar was slow i moved crates and delivered messages the guys busted balls and told stories from the old country mostly we just waited i got to thinking maybe life in ciliary's crew wasn't gonna get me clipped you tommy come on yeah thanks angkor there he is sorry i'm late take a seat and it's collection day boys so tommy you'll drive paulie and sam can handle the rest it'll be routine just a handful of stops today bill at the motel was a little short last month so make sure he pays us the interest he owes no problem boss don't lay hands on anyone unless there's no other choice our clients need to understand that we provide a valuable service they need to look at you and see santa michael they need to believe you'll protect them so let morella stoop to breaking lakes we're better than that but the bills still do and everyone pays up we can handle it go see ralphie about a car okay boss ah vinnie said to say he's got something for you tom head to him first probably just wants to tell you some [ __ ] story about some guy who whacked 20 years ago you guys need to be careful today okay i spoke to biff he said morello's still been since he lost the cars ah what's losing some motors to him he's got at least five garages inside of you town know it like i know it's always the same bellow does this so salieri does that some cars here some booze there just come down for a few weeks then it all happens again world keeps turning well it's been a month a bunch made a weeks split whining hey just the guy i saw this and i thought of you you ever carried a rat shot him at the fair a couple of

show the wheel sam show the wheel and give our best to your mom huh it was a real pleasure me okay next up we got old eugene's place chinese store up on palo he's not dead yet almost heard his nephew's taking over i used to run this next place tom his name's not eugene guy's a trainer man but it sounds like eugene well that's what we called him polly slammed his head into the counter back in 27 i think yeah it was hilarious after that no problems at all if you look you can still see the blood poor old bastard couldn't scrub it out keep some of these guys on our books to remind the chinatown gangs there in our city not theirs but we don't know eugene's nephew so he might need reminding too [Music] this is it [Applause] i'll cover this one sam you sure sure i'm sure he's doing the store on his own yeah when paulie's built up a little steamy needs to let it out on his own she's got to let him get on with it it's his way you can hear it in his voice gotta let him lone wolf from time to time keeps him happy yeah eugene's nephew ain't having much fun right now when he's going polly don't stop once we were putting a squeeze on his tailor over in holbrook a guy ended up in a wheelchair here he comes he's a fast worker drive before the cop show tom next stops bill at the motel eugene's nephew's guys money is ours next week with some extra besides he doing okay he's okay how's the shop counter yeah that's seen some more blood how much blood and nothing he can't scrub out once he's back on his feet you want to come out with us again tom get to hear even more about chinese nephew guys scrubbing their own blood out of shop counters yeah seems like it's not too hard not hard kind of not hot i don't know comes naturally you guys don't see why it can't come natural to me so anyone could do this me and polly we've been working these streets for years you come in and you think you know it all i'm not saying that sam i you've been a day on the job pal you haven't seen what we do you haven't seen how we throw it tim i think you oughta no paulie this bunk thinks he can walk in here like a big shot i put greasers like him in the ground i think you gotta say you're sorry tom sorry huh well i'd say sorry if i couldn't see the [ __ ] smile you're trying to hide you got him though you got him i could smell the crap in your pants from here no you didn't get me when little tony first came out with us i had him on his knees before he knew i was yanking his shape yeah you did better than him anyways jesus i hate it out of the city you hate it most places yeah but out here it's worse how come there's a place so far out of town on our books out of town's the safest place for deals safest place for card games the safest place for most of the things we do we're expecting a big bag of money today the guy owes if it ain't big boss will be pissed yeah this place is a real earner oftentimes the places to get you the most stow are the ones most people don't look at twice just recently the motels had a new lease of life last stop before i lost heaven for rum coming up from cuba they drive it this far sure right though and that's how we can sell it so expensive phil's motel has gotten to be the place where crates get exchanged salieri protects it but he lets the other families use it too even moreo to keep the peace sure plus it's far enough away that no one cares so long as everyone's making money no one's gonna rock the boat anyone else starting to miss the side of streets and sidewalks you not one for the great outdoors paulie he's not one for anything indoors outdoors in the city out of the city i hate it out here like when we sit in the field doing some booze hand over or something it's always knee-deep and [ __ ] and most times it's dark and cold as hell that's why it's good we got you now tom you can do all the jobs that polly hates but happy to oblige okay there it is finally wait for us here tom we'll be back in a bit okay [Music] i took what jesus christ police tell salieri from here on out this place is ours capisce and don't come back but you'll end up in worse shape than your friends they're trying to beat information out of it i gotta get you to a doctor i can wait get them out of there okay okay just hang on give me a name is i guess [Music] we're the last thing you'll see shouldn't be here checking over there put you down i'll make it quick gotcha get ready move under this don't feel like a war to you [Music] ready now you're done i have you sam they really went to work on you buddy christ come on you'd be all right your toughest oh nails oh he's got the money tom i'll catch the bastard where is sam he's okay inside hey go get the money uh so [Applause] so [Applause] that was when i saw an acost what it meant to be on the inside i should have took off there and then but i couldn't go back to being a nobody so that's how a regular palooka goes from cabbie to mob enforcer overnight is it just dumb look didn't feel that way at the time me parking on that particular street taking a break just when paulie and sam are coming around the corner what are the ads i felt like i don't know like someone was watching out for us whatever helps you sleep at night pal but it's a lucky break all the same i mean one day you're busting your back doing an honest day's work in a city that's been trying to scrape you off its heel since the day you stepped off the boat and then next your stuff in your pockets for the salieri's dirty money and learn it over the rest of us yeah it wasn't like that back then celia didn't have the run of the city for every buck salieri made don morello would turn 10. he paid off cops politicians judges and anyone he couldn't buy he's scared into looking the other way he did seem to have the city jumping in its own shadow i'll give you that you hear anything about joey crackers yeah got his name in the mural file short boxer right yeah that's the guy [Music] way i hear it joey was just driving to the gym one morning probably daydreaming about winning a belt or something god damn it [ __ ] you travel your goddamn eyes closed look at this jesus buried joseph dumb tomarillo i didn't know it was you you know anybody else driving a rare import in this part of town joey no well then uh i'm sorry i i was driving real slow you're saying this is my fault no no no no sir i just i just i ain't never been in no accident well repairs are gonna be expensive [Music] oh you you're not gonna need that sir tires are just fine girl's a little bent up is all i mean i got a cousin someone spun yet tail pal you got an informant right there says marilla made a mint every time crackers went to the mat that's true too and still marella left that poor sap dead in the street had all caved in don't square oh maybe the don know joey's career was on the downhill well maybe he was trying to scare someone a guy into paying up who knows don salieri chalked it up to morello not being able to think straight when he was mad you uh have any more run-ins with mirella's crew back then not first for a couple of years after i joined up things were quiet we got into a few dust-ups with guys trying to muscle in but elsewhere was just the usual routine we're running booze offering protection me and the boys doing rounds to collect small time but i ain't gonna lie most days we was also having a bit of fun and the money that comes from tommy thanks for getting down here so quickly yeah sure thing boss what do you need you know there's a race coming up oh yeah yeah paulie and sam have some money on the local mikey dunn that's the guy he's a good kid but a bit of a scrapper not too smart with his money a few years ago mikey comes to me asking for a loan he wants to get new tires so he can keep racing junkers out at the quarry i like fast cars i figured it'll be a bit of a hobby turns out mikey's a great investment the kid can't lose a race if he walks the track he graduates from the junkers to gow jobs and i start placing a few bets on him here and there next thing i know i've made all my money back and more hey sam says he's the guy to beat he was we ran all the competition out of town but now ralph says there's a hot shot european entering the race and he's got a car faster than our boys by a country mile how much do we stand to lose a truckload but not just our outfit a lot of guys from the neighborhood come to me for financial advice they've all put money down on this kid it'll be like black thursday around here if he loses for
