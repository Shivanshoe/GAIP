accused you of betraying the children of danu i was once one of them how can this be deirdre warned me against them but back then it seemed the only hope you knew these people why did you not direct me to the rem they only wanted to use me distrustful and secretive i never knew their true names or anything about them a glenn of great beauty lies on our road find me when you're ready and i'll confess my errors there there's i need your eyes my friend [Music] oh [Music] [Music] now let's get out of here likes it's done ah my business partner illuminated gospels have arrived from listero

forward to your return foreign so [Music] so so it is beautiful i used to wash away my cares and pain in this pond would it be all right if i of course as a young girl when the christians cleared the forests of druids i fled and stumbled on this spot how would i survive my friends the world i knew soon i turned to the children of thanu at first they pledged simply to keep the old ways alive then one by one druids turned to dark rituals then they turned to worse yes even murder i disavowed the children and now pray for their destruction the high druids spoke of some sort of awful might fantasies an ancient fable of a people long lost the druids are now dispersed without a champion you have king florn my hopes are placed in him but am i a fool he has no deep love of the past he hopes to build a new ireland he pledges that my people will be part of it but once he's king storms will come i cannot know where he will take refuge you are no fool you and i have been through much together we came near death i would like to celebrate life is this why you brought me to this place it is a lovely glen perhaps we could pass some time here i would like very much to pass some time with you [Music] i lovely lovely indeed [Music] so [Applause] oh uh hey chelsea idiot avor i have you and kyra to thank for curing my men even if the source of this sucker does not sit easily with me not all druids are your enemies lord it is the children of danu who attacked you kira has told me of this druid cult they are no great threat if they must strike from the shadows perhaps they only sought to sow doubt among their enemies and the friends of their enemies i regret my earlier distrust but i've seen too much irish blood spills by danes to give trust easily i know what it is to be blood-bound lord it burns so bright it can blind to all else so king if allah is the prize how do you mean to take it the ringfort there is the strongest in all the lands yet the kings of alec dwell outside its protection foolishly leaving themselves vulnerable still that's a long march over uncertain soil your army will be exposed to forces unknown aberrant has offered land at clark where our army will make camp from there we move on to alec this just arrived the kings of allah want to talk peace they surrender before you touch their soil i know those who would die for such a reputation i don't like it the warding is vague asking much and promising little what's the harm in hearing them out if we start with the sword we have nowhere else to go they know me they'll listen you would speak for me if you would honor me with your trust do you have an opinion avor or will you simply side with your cousin my cousin gives wise counsel you lose nothing but time and if talking fails answer with steal time marches more quickly when you have an army to keep fit and fed but i will consider your words my life has been one of warfare plots and intrigue i've never known the trust for brother and do not give mine over easily king of dublin i hereby authorize you to speak for me flan china high king of ireland and all of her people i will honor the faith you have placed in me my king do i have your blessing to accompany bardeth king florin i'll not waste our time on formalities avor but you'll not be going with bowers i need you elsewhere tell me where you must build up some goodwill among the northern e nail as you've done for other kingdoms keira will provide the details of the pigeon coops i will earn you their favor lord for the trust you've shown my cousin you
