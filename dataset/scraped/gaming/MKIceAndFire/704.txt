are we right behind you we can start where jeff spotted our uninvited guests i have to admit sometimes i get fed up with all of this politics so far we've managed to effectively turn down offers to work with night corp biotechnica arisaka so far you say if jeff can get elected without owing anybody favors or otherwise that'd be the real victory jeff's office control room storage and flea market crammed into one tight bites you and jeff must be putting in serious overtime elections you don't even have time to think about food so you just this is where jeff's but yes it's true jeff hasn't done anything else recently here right after walking out of the bedroom at least that's how he remembers it [Music] blood stains not quite scrubbed clean where's the blood from it yours i'm 100 sure it's not ours maybe the intruders probably bullet holes cocked up someone tried to patch up the bullet holes assuming neither of you had anything to do with this no of course not this is jeff's personal machine i doubt you'll find anything on it relating to the break-in vote for perales we are paying the staffers and for the campaign out of pocket and we keep all the campaign stuff here it's cheaper that way seems a happy fam that your daughter sachi oh we miss her her studies took her abroad oh we do europe an excellent school she'll get a good education i know it's an ocean away but with jeff running for mayor it's just safer this way wedding pic interesting backdrop i wanted blue roses so we ordered a whole truckload blue roses what you sure cause the roses in this picture look pretty red to me oh of course you're right they didn't have blue roses i forgot notice anything different in here after the break-in no i don't think so what do you have in mind jeff said he passed out anything seem out of the ordinary the bedding its arrangement any signs at all as if he was dragged back to bed you mean no i didn't notice anything mind if i take a look around be my guest iron this jeff's mine actually but yes that's the one jeff used that night broken it was fine a couple days ago we rarely use it though [Music] what was that no [ __ ] clue felt kind of good but weird like tripping on acid does that happen to the screen a lot or to any of the others i don't understand what just happened a second ago didn't see it no what okay never mind you're welcome to go up to the roof if you want sure thing [Music] odd tech's practically prehistoric but it doesn't look older than a day saw something like this back in the war transmitters militech was using them short range uhf signal only traveled's line of sight but it can't be intercepted line of sight let's look around see if we can't spot where a receiver's camping out [Music] got a vision the receiver black van parked next to it gotta be our winner the hell is all this for though [ __ ] if i know but my gut tells me we should see what this bad boy's hooked up to see these cables [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] jesus christ i think we're safe putting your security at the top of our list of suspects sons of [ __ ] under my own roof i wonder how long they've been keeping this from you too long this ends now i'm not letting any more of those freaks set foot ah my head something wrong don't worry about me do what you have to do [Music] used meds intruder make a beeline here after jeff tagged him talking to yourself again more and more ever since this terrorist started stalking me weird hardware what's it for [Music] connected to the wall mounted screens wonder where else these cables run transmitters within reach of our mystery van wonder if elizabeth has ever seen the car ugh liz this is way bigger than we thought jeff's entire campaign could be threatened let me worry about the race just tell me what you managed to find there's a transmitter on the roof it seems to be conveying a signal to a van out front you know who it might be we never set up any transmitter and i don't know a thing about any van but my guess is it's ssis [Music] security or do you plan to check it yeah about to pay them a personal visit i'll wait here just don't tell jeff anything for now okay sure whatever i'll call him once i know something more substantial that's fine just remember it's the busiest time for jeff right now you can always come and talk to me fine i'll keep that in mind [Music] how about we take the wheels v that van could give us a slip any second [Music] wanna go home we lost everything [Applause] yeah we lost everything we have to play the prize [Music] [Music] definitely not your ordinary van we're about to find out [Music] don't lose them v oh now you're interested we could expose a corporal conspiracy here v i'm telling you they could be corpo's spies or who the [ __ ] knows what [Music] hmm [Music] um hi guys [Music] you look at politicians and see a curated display but behind the scenes is all-out war citizens don't choose their representatives then who the key players string pullers they spy on all the paralysis look for weak spots hmm v a vehicle of mine went dark near your position fine keep an eye out for unknown reasons the coordinates came through corrupted so i'm unable to determine the precise location come on out you little chicken [ __ ] [Music] [ __ ] why do i gotta do everything right now we win or we die i'll make you cry [Music] game [ __ ] steady [Music] [Music] [Music] pierced it we're in couldn't ask the ncpd for better records than this pictures medical records vulnerability to neuroplasticity some kind of database brain scans the paralysis biological casts neuroplasticity [ __ ] what about that the blue [ __ ] fresh neural links they're not spying on them johnny they're [ __ ] with their heads i mean to say someone's literally controlling our upstanding politicians minds red bloods are memory residue in the hippocampus region see how they're bleeding into the blue so what are we looking at they're planting new memories in their heads modifying their personalities this is big [ __ ] johnny [ __ ] me got other guinea pigs besides the promises too quick download the data whoever comes looking for it that's your suspect [ __ ] they're wiping the data we've been made now they know someone's been in their database wonder if they also know who v do you have any news you're gonna want to sit down for this it's way bigger than we thought what is you're being brainwashed literally they've scanned your minds now using some kind of conditioning too wait not hollow right i'll come by no you and i we need to speak a lot i know a little ramen place in japan town sending you the coordinates right see you there um johnny pretty sure they turned your great spot into a slurp shop mindless [ __ ] consumerism wins the day again point for the other team huh huh this is why you don't bring back fallen warriors sooner or later they're gonna see everything they fought for turned to [ __ ] asks where is his old rainbow club and i'm like a broken record tell all of them the cough broke them out 20 years ago i should put up a sign some people could go for a bite i figured what can i get you know anything about any rainbow cadenza days i'm talking about you say how are you getting i don't know uh samurai stuff let me guess food from youtube rusty water from the tap oh that ugly red face on black yeah even i know will you sit please thank you for coming why are we meeting here and not at your pad because i have something to confess in private not in front of jeff okay confess away i i'm sorry my nerves are shot i can't gather my thoughts wasn't that long ago since we last met something happened since then no i mean something did happen though not recently it's a long story i don't quite know how to tell you where to even start relax no need to rush ah uh uh a while ago i started noticing some changes in jeff's behavior his personality he seemed to be changing right in front of me becoming someone else how so he stopped reading forgot the title of his favorite movie even his musical taste changed overnight once i said we should visit his brother's grave and he told me that he'd been an only child that's when i started thinking something bad was happening something insidious and not just with jeff notice any changes in yourself after some time on several occasions my friends pointed out that i was acting strangely that must have been hard it was you know it's at times like those you start to question reality so the whole time you knew what i could end up finding i don't know who how or why but they're changing us that concealed room in our apartment what about it i'm sure i'd seen it before but must have somehow forgotten i find that terrifying mention any of this to jeff i tried i did but he's blinded to everything he just laughed said i was imagining things he once brought up a vacation that we never went on swear to god he went on about it in such detail i almost started believing him could be just you who forgot maybe they wiped the trip from your memory hell i don't know anymore don't you get that you haven't told me the whole story yet have you i saw a stranger in our apartment one night tinkering with the monitors but i was in such a state by then that i didn't know if i could trust my own eyes so you didn't do anything i don't remember what happened i talked to security the next morning i find it strange he took this to security instead of your husband i thought i was going insane i wanted to see what was on the feeds first there was nothing there of course so what was i supposed to tell jeff and then the next day i got a call it was them whoever they are there was a garbled voice on the other end he never introduced himself and you cut some kind of deal with him no i was told that our perfect lives could fall apart at any minute that i have my husband's safety to think about after there was no record of the call it was as if it had never happened so i'm begging you v jefferson can't find out about any of this ever his life depends on it [Music] you knew who sent the intruder but just strung me along anyway liz i didn't have a choice i didn't know what to do you wanted everything just to go on and flow on because it was convenient convenient you got the perfect life prominent husband you don't lack for a thing you think i'm having fun you have no idea what it's like living like this what if you're just saying what they programmed you to say just reading off a script based on thoughts planet in your head all i know is i love my husband and i want him to be safe and and happy but that's what they want you to know you know what jeff will do if you tell him i know my husband he'll start looking on his own he can't find out about this it it destroy him you think if i tell him everything that he'll go and pick a fight he can't win i don't just think i know one thing hasn't changed jeff's still a fighter and you go down swinging [Music] so how do we play this i'm going to tell jeff that ssi was spying for his rival holt you just need to confirm what i say [Music] and if i'm not on board you have a choice just remember any consequences will not be yours to deal with you're truly prepared to fire ssi after the threats it'd be brave but risky is all get out what they're doing to us is one thing but when you found that concealed room i can't accept strangers spying on us while we sleep not under my own roof what difference does it make where i'll take full responsibility for anything ssi goes on to do i'm just asking you not to get jefferson involved i'll add a meeting in reconciliation park to jeff's schedule he'll be waiting since i can't know if i'll remember this conversation tomorrow i'm counting on you not to forget what i asked of you i won't that's all i can promise goodbye v all things [ __ ] up huh wouldn't want to be in her pants speaking of overlapping memories changing personalities you of anything but hey at least we know what we're up against no this is different you saw yourself they're purposely modifying their minds individual thoughts parallels make a damn nice next-gen puppet even in my day there were whispers about this kind of stuff cognitive pattern fluctuators remote neural re-networking in layman's terms gaslighting the beauty is that everything's fair game subliminal tv signals high density emitters and your electric toothbrush you name it so in my pants what would you do some real red bastards behind this someone's got to take them down even by risking the paralysis lives [ __ ] knows what kind of [ __ ] a mare controlled by puppet masters could pull but yeah you could end up putting their lives at risk or not tough choice oh hell no i heard i can get some decent tunes here what you mean by decent we got cartesian duelist eurodyne stuff tainted overlord any samurai you did you even gotta ask never fade away dancing with my axe chipping in you name it we got it silverhand was the one true messiah of rock i'd hand them records out like candy if i could but a guy's gotta eat i see i found silverhand's biggest fan and proud of it today's bitty box rockers can't even touch it silverhand had something they couldn't eat it uh a silver hand he had that fire kid fire the guy shook the foundations of the corporal world he died for his ideals doesn't matter he was also kind of a terrorist blaze way down the rebel path looking for the real deal like say bootlegs from samurai's first gigs [ __ ] first you have got no idea what you're asking for not if you're so so chilled about it don't know how you found out about them bootlegs but forget it not gonna give them to the first gonk off the street hey i ain't a poser i know everything there is to know about silverhead go on impress me nobody told carrie the last time they met [ __ ] this band not your crowd not your noise do your own thing yeah sure i could think up a million conversations they had there were no witnesses i used to uh come here back when it was still rainbow cadenza bootleg sure would make a nice souvenir of the good old days cut the scarf you're too young to remember the first samurai gigs weren't even a twinkle in your daddy's karoshi's hey appearances can be deceiving how do you know this pretty face ain't an implant all right punk prove it how'd samurai's third ever dig in johnny my dear expert help put you out we need a quick run down the samurai tribute yep third gig remember it like it was yesterday set my axe on fire then smashed it on the stage crowd ridden wild well can't wait all day easy johnny lit up his axe then smashed it nope knew it who smashes their gear when they're just starting out i mean a new one costs eddies [ __ ] hell johnny why sabotage why now because it's funny because i'm bored maybe i don't like the cut of your conformist chip you always freeze up like this played our third gig at cadenza little fire broke out some drunk gunks try to put it out with beer denny's fro got singed wore wig for a few weeks never did get herself any tech hang on now i remember there was a fire ah poor denny poor danny's hair i almost forgot heard johnny started it actually tossed a cig that was still glowing [ __ ] that said was carries no doubt but hey any troubles johnny's fault still don't believe you were there but what the hell only a real fan can know something like that hey anyways gotta educate the youth maybe you'll find something special under the table come on have at it much appreciated take it spread the good silver hand you know they say time is the best teacher used to think that was true but look at that guy 60 at least but still living in 2020 guy's your biggest fan you're not happy to meet him blue soccer tower to smithereens and it's still standing there just the same don't want people getting stuck in a rut stuck in the past want them to change them and the world you want to force him to change and he can't just blow him up like the tower but music's the answer here's what happens grandpa knows every damn word doesn't understand a single one you'd rather massacre a bunch of people and the average james and joe's maybe they don't want to change their choice you want to take that away from them it might be bums who play see no evil might be blind idiots they need to wake the [ __ ] up guess jury's still out on how [Music] foreign hey [Music] um [Music] again oh [Music] me bee how you been you know right i was thinking okay drop by for dinner maybe joss has worked

visits him relax don't need to explain right so you're gonna stop by appreciate the invite river but gonna have to pass another time baby shame joss and me we cook up mean stew you know especially don't doubt that at all it's just uh now it's not a great time sorry ah it's all right but i won't take no for an answer next time see you around river [Music] we believed in freedom i think yeah it doesn't matter what you tell them it doesn't matter what you think of doing or do you can't change anything no what we know who you are we know what you are we know what you want you are playing with fire don't dare cross the line [ __ ] hello vee yes i know elizabeth filled me in sounds like i was right to hire a professional elizabeth what did she tell you exactly didn't get specific just that ssi was spying for that son of a [ __ ] holt guess you got more though ssi wasn't working for holt you're in deeper [ __ ] than you think easy meaning organic food they're in your heads jefferson yours and elizabeth's this some kind of chuckle-worthy metaphor strange dreams partial recall jumbled memories it's not just stress and long hours i don't know what you're trying to tell me but i don't think i like where this is heading wake up your brain's a mess messier than the discount section of a bd smart hud i'm not paying you to make up riddles for me so get to the point ssi's on the take for some unknown group that's out to control your lives you know there's concealed room in your pad out with it they've got tech in there you wouldn't believe these people know everything about you and your wife they're watching your every move somebody's hijacked your life reset your course your career i'll admit there were a couple of fortunate coincidences but they forged your views personality even that skepticism that pisses me off so much clearly what they want is for you to be their mayor molding you like a clay figurine [ __ ] i need to remember who recommended ssi to me your memories can't even trust those anymore [Music] if that's true i'll never know what's real in my life and what's a lie fabricated wait the intruder i have to find him got no idea how we go about doing that first i'll find him then i'll find whoever's behind this pull the curtain back on these [ __ ] and show them what's what could show their hand if you're patient wait long enough or use your mayoral powers if you get elected as long as you don't forget all this by morning sun tzu's art of war feign weakness so your enemy may grow arrogant don't see you doing much fainting jeff my god i have to tell liz of elegance your wife knows everything this how figured it out at some point elizabeth no no no no she would have said something she feared for your life your daughter's life who could blame her nah she's never kept anything from me she doesn't scare easily believe me got an anonymous hollow telling her to keep her mouth shut so she did what the perfect candidate's wife would do protected her family i won't let them get away with this is there anything else i can do you've done enough already v all that's left to do is wait so what now still want to be mayor well i'm not about to give up i didn't run just i'll wait for my window an opportunity then make my move isn't that exactly what they want [Music] well i'll give more than they bargained for same with your eddies take care of me good luck and good night so thoughts somehow i doubt it's people who are behind this so aliens very funny you're too young to remember this but not so long ago people talked about rogue ai's prowling cyberspace so not aliens doesn't matter who what matters is that guy decided to take up the gunman [Music] so ready [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] hmm [Music] please what's up practice [Music] did mom send you be just in time agoro you're here to jump remember that there's help available around the clock hotline that is not funny the parade will soon begin i adjusted the data from okada i advise you to examine it yourself to begin with the malware works truly much better than i anticipated our eyes and ears are in the guard brew i observe the cctv and i know where the sniper potions are they are true you must make each harmless before they do the same to me there are many ways to reach them the first is nearby he should not be a problem the second is worse you will have to climb as for the third he hides on the foot bridge over the street we are here hanakusana's platform will stop here close to the emergency exit we will use when all is done from these points you will have a clear view of the parade but the snipers will see things even better if they notice you bang no more thing if this sounds dangerous consider that i must dip to the float enter face to face the last is what i fear the most it's all this clear are you ready wait things go to [ __ ] we got a backup plan what do you think i am accused of betraying arasaka soon i will try to confront the sister of the ceo in person there are no backup plans this one must work i'm ready question is are you i formed this plan did i not all the while ignoring one crucial element your friend oda oda is a man of honor he did not dare raise his hand against me maybe you're gonna be dropping in on hanukkah by surprise ah you have a point instinct and the reflexes went out at the moment like this so so i can only hope that i am still faster than he is stay safe [Music] [Applause] i am in position the floors have started to move remember to be careful why you will face arasaka drones i also spotted the net runner in your arasaka uniform she is somewhere hidden okay good to go then let us begin you must reach old snipers before anakosama's float appears you
