you seem a little confused yeah fine i just want to get these folks to where they need to be i doubt a short delay will trouble him too much head up the east road takes you straight through little hope adds almost no time to your journey oh you rub that chip any harder it'll wear away to nothing how long have you been sober a few days shy of three months impressive i heard the first 90 days are the toughest and roughest i know it doesn't add up but i get something from holding on to this we're going the wrong way it's fine just a quick detour it's oh please john could you not patronize me keep it down please [Music] stop it james you know i hate it when you don't take the things i say seriously come on sweetheart i do i just had a rough day today can you believe they are at each other again i can you're drunk what a surprise i just caught the game with the guys honey that's it that's not it never is there's talk some of us may be losing our jobs the factory's saying that for years i'm more worried about megan what's wrong with megan she looks okay to me everything looks okay after ten beers reverend carson held her back after prayers today that's four weeks running she's not right it's serious james worry too much about that kid i can't deal with this right now another surprise you can't deal with anything when would be the right time you're making a mountain out of a molehill getting yourself worked up for nothing for nothing single-handedly keeping our family together and far from nothing in my book i could use a little help maybe if we'd had kids of our own none of this would be happening that's a real low blow don't you get how tough you're not the only one feels pressure the factory situation is serious anne real serious not right now not tonight no way [Music] tanya's late she always is these days [Music] at least one of us is out having a give her a break it's him i'm worried about that guy's no good for her all that new age  reminds me some creepy cult he came in last week we shot the breeze a little bit i like him [Music] that one's a classic legendary vinyl quit pawing at it hey bigfoot mind the goddamn vinyl will ya come on man take some time off from being a dick and give her a break okay mother superior why are you always sticking up for her anyway [Music] damn ice i'm going to start climbing through the window unless that door gets fixed how's things let me guess he's been pumping iron again they've been at each of his throats since dad got home what's it about this time he nearly fell through the front door some dad we got huh they're always fighting these days getting predictable like a record that keeps playing over and over dennis for the 10 million time will you shift that of yours up into the attic some respect this is a valuable rare and sought after collection i think she was a marine sergeant of past life he's being even more annoying than usual tonight a real jerk so what else is new hey dennis hey not now sis i'm busy hey quit acting crazy oh jesus you scared me sweetheart i heard you talking about me not now megan i'd like to have a bath in peace take a break from this mad house for a while maybe you should talk to mom and dad it's not a great idea for me to get involved you know what i'm like i just upset someone they sounded more serious than the usual they were talking about megan she's done something bad i can't say i'm surprised there is definitely something off with megan i don't get why everyone keeps picking on her okay mr shining knight in armor where's the little princess anyway [Music] probably better to leave megan alone as her big sister it is my sworn legal duty to check in on her right sure like you're the law around here she went upstairs i'll go find her defenses back [Music] [Applause] [Music] that went right between chambers legs it was about six inches off the ice and she was starting to go down right back to brian watson he pulls in his block by green on a big play now comes boston here's a lead pass edison [Music] [Applause] [Music] stop by rolling you need to keep an eye on your little sister mom is real worried about her i can't imagine why growing up was such a great and supportive family you want to try raising a family like this the devil himself would struggle with you guys so thank son of a clock what wow megan is in even more trouble than i thought so perfect distraction from this mad house anthony where the hell are you anthony where are you goddammit anthony i'm getting really pissed off anthony i swear if you don't answer me [Music] you could be right about my family i think so too tanya what's going on that little brat locked me out it's freezing i'll let you back in go easy on megan hold on  megan you in there the kitchen's on fire are you serious megan where the hell is everybody anthony help anthony hey i'm here what the are you doing up there i got trapped in the attic get to the balcony anthony help [Music] hey i can't breathe oh now oh tanya hold on i gotta get megan out it ah [Music] uh [Music] what have you done [Music] [Music] oh hello and welcome back i have a new story for you it's very different to the last [Music] [Music] disconcerting no i'm sure there's nothing to worry about this particular story isn't fully fleshed out it's only part written and the choices you make will complete it the fire no there was nothing you could have done about that what's happened has happened has it anyway look to the future i say life's but a walking shadow eh you are about to enter a confusing perhaps disturbing world how disturbing might depend on what you choose to believe and how confusing on the path you choose to take there are an infinite number of directions in which one could travel [Music] we seldom have all the information that we'd like but we have to choose our path nonetheless and hope that we get the clarity and the outcomes that we want as in life your decisions will matter the choices you make will affect others you've seen how the story starts so much death how many more deaths is entirely up to you it depends on the decisions that you make what are you rational emotional do you trust your head or your heart there is no right answer sometimes one is best and sometimes the other my advice for what it's worth is to thine own self be true [Music] but i'm here simply to record what you do not to help you i'm not supposed to interfere you see not my place apparently but i am apparently allowed to share wise words from great storytellers that have gone before where i feel that that would be appropriate oh one final thing before i let you go there are pictures in little hope that will if found show you a vision of a possible future something that may or may not happen use them they might help you you have a funeral to attend off you go have fun hmm i do enjoy a good funeral [Music] none of us here today can understand why this tragic accident happened but we can take comfort from the knowledge that the family are together for eternity in god's loving embrace [Music] uh [Music] um where the hell's daniel i can't find him i don't know instead of goofing around you want to lend a hand here how is he doing anyway it doesn't look that serious could be concussed okay professor or should i call you doctor now maybe the cops someone like that already tried once but i'm on it hey andrew buddy how you doing where are we what happened yeah the bus crashed we're okay though just shaken up if you say so i don't remember being in any crash you're probably in shock maybe a mild concussion in there to give yourself some time stay here don't move  thing useless piece of crap may as well be dead okay take it easy we'll figure out what to do ah ah  where's my phone ugh hey anyone up there hey daniel that you john good to hear you daniel taylor you okay i'm good we're fine too thanks for asking you okay down there i'm all right nothing i can't deal with hey john any idea what caused the crash not sure looked like the driver swerved to avoid something in the road he down there by the way nope no sign of him weird he isn't up here either can you get back up to us looks pretty steep i see a trail down here i could try great take the trail should take you to the road we can regroup there that's a plan see you soon taylor help me get andrew up on his feet will ya wait i don't remember anything who are you it's okay you're concussed i'm john you're a college professor we were taking a bus on a field trip but that didn't work out so well crash wasn't on the curriculum uh we'll find the others get some help think of it as a character building exercise teamwork at its finest i had this dream it was so real flames all around us it was grim that bang on the head must have been a beauty that trail the others are on will come out down the road we'll meet them there we should talk this through why leave the bus not like we have somewhere better to wait no we could be here all night our best move is to get to the others then head towards town see if we can find some help where's the driver shouldn't he be back by now the driver's done what we should be doing gone into town for help he could just as easily have banged his head and walked off the other way fine you can stay right here i'll go myself hey professor he is a professor right i'm still fuzzy can we stick together i don't want to wait on my own i guess he's right we should all stick together i got no signal either must be some kind of black spot or you didn't pay your last bill you get that during the crash guess so who crawled up the professor's ass i think you should show him a little more respect he thinks he's smarter than us but book smart is no good out here he's all up himself acting like the big man on campus [Music] you know this place little hope no i mean i don't think so you should both know little hope [Music] why should i have heard of this place seriously this place is steeped in history fascinating stuff how do you know all this stuff anyway i'm a professional academic i read books unlike some easy einstein i can match everything you got with just a smartphone well your phone isn't so smart without a [Music] signal good to see you two finally everything okay sure we took the scenic route you sure as hell took your own sweet time he's getting worried i bet you were this gate is chained we can't get through look around see if there's anything we can use to break it think this will do it ready i'll push hard from my side ready three two one push yeah that's what i'm talking about great job youtube what's the plan now i already said i want to wait at the bus for help not head into town like john wants and we've already concluded this conversation not with everyone here we didn't we should vote on it no need for a vote decisions made just because you're a professor you don't get to call the shots we're all adults here some of us are more adult than others i'm sorry but we really don't have time to be arguing you'll stay here with me won't you uh looks like he ain't so keen after all if you got something to say to me spit it out john's right heading into town is our quickest way to find help satisfied sure whatever you say try to be civil costs nothing that's rich given how you bad mouth taylor on the way over what did you say about me you always get your boyfriend to stick up for you try doing it yourself sometime dear i'm not wasting another breath on you quit it will you the last thing we need is you causing trouble keep out of our business okay we are wasting valuable time here can we please just keep moving i'm still not sure heading into town is such a great idea i'm going to hang out by the bus while you all do whatever you have to you want to come along and wait with me okay i still think the smart move is for us all to stick together be glad we didn't stick together after we flagged down a car and come rescue your ass you get lost no we're back here this doesn't add up this is some very weird going on here spare us all first he loses his pride then he loses his way what are you trying to say that you've lost it it's not possible look i don't know what you're trying to prove here but we've got better things to do daniel hey watch out quit around and tell me what's going on here the two of us will go together this is getting ridiculous indulge me [Music] what i walked away from you we're trapped here there's no way out i i don't understand she's right we walk dead straight going away from you so how'd we end up back here okay let's try something we'll all go together we came from that direction we must be able to go back that way i want everyone to stay real close no stragglers you want to put us on a kid's line okay okay i'm coming i admit that is a little odd more than a little see what did i tell you it's just like i've been saying we are trapped we can't leave here no calm down breathe there's a rational explanation for what's happening maybe we all died in the crash yeah nice theory but i'm pretty sure we're all still alive and kicking last i checked you were schooling us on creative writing not metaphysics i know who i'd like to be kicking this is all down to you this pissy little field trip now we're stuck here in little no hope that is way out of line i had no way of knowing that damn bus would crash you can't put that on me are you for real watch your tone will you i am doing my best to understand this just like you and the rest of us i'm sorry i don't get what's happening to us i don't understand it's like you said we're trapped in a nightmare it's okay we're gonna be just fine we'll figure a way out of this together someone else thinks they can do a better job step right up maybe it isn't real we have to get out of here right i need to think straight out of the ball can everyone just shut up this isn't helping us find help or getting us out of here he's right bitching at each other isn't getting us anywhere we have to work together as a team thank you now let's be logical the fog is between us and the bus there is no fog between us and town so let's head that way i don't get how heading further away from the bus helps there is nothing on the bus we can use to get help in town there will be people a working phone something it pains me to admit but he's right there's nowhere else we can go except into that damn town sounds like a plan to me you leaving me where are you going come on let's go with them until we know what's up we should stick together how'd you get that bruise no biggie must have got it when the bus crashed why did you say we might all be dead you really think that's possible i saw some cable show about how your brain keeps going for a while after you you die forget about it what they said didn't really stack up [Music] i don't like the look of that place at all maybe they won't ask for id i'm not sure this is such a great idea we should check it out there could be a phone inside i'll go in and take a look around go ahead we'll be right behind you why aren't we going with those guys angela knows there's something between us that's obvious we're really going to get into this now like we've got no other bigger to deal with tonight this is a big deal for me anyhow i'm telling you angela is on to us she knows what did you two talk about she was digging around like she always does what exactly did you tell her back there relax i said nothing about us i'm not ready to go public about us yet i will be soon i promise anything i can do to help convince you i'm the right guy i need to know 100 i can rely on you that you'll never let me down we should catch up with the others we standing here all night or are we going inside [Music] [Music] [Music] hi there how you doing excuse me but we're uh looking for our bus driver what have you seen him yeah that's funny what is what's up with the fog outside it's pretty weird yeah sure is a thick one tonight so thick it's stopping us from leaving yeah yeah i know that feeling you mean you're sorry for busting in like this um bus we were on crashed a little way back up the road there we're still a little shaken up we're still a lot shaken up you certainly look shook up i'm vince i need a mirror maybe there's one here not covered in 20 years sounds like you could use a drink better not thanks i need to keep a clear head it's right there if you change your mind not for me why are you even here little hope sure isn't the town it used to be what are you doing in here alone i'm sure you have a good reason to be here right yeah i got my reasons for being here not the sharing type do i look like i'm a big talker let's just leave him be but all kinds are just play what is this guy's problem there's definitely something off about him he's harmless just had one too many let's look around there must be something here that can help us see what you can dig up ah he's in a world of his own an old dart sport i was pretty good back in the day stay play a little no problem i'm gonna take a look around you need an umbilical cord for something funny at least i'm looking for a way out what are you just a quick throw then we'll figure out how we're getting out of here try for a big double not my first time daniel shooting for double 20. [Music] okay so you can play a little still got it now for triple 20. well almost an olympic shot after the night we've had they don't play darts in the olympics [Music] that is one hell of a shot you did better than taylor let's get back to why we came in here this place has some great history hmm i vaguely remember what happened here all the factories closed down i can't believe it these guys could be relatives hey this way let's get out of here and [Music] you all hear that i definitely heard something did you hear that as well come on whatever it was came from outside really think it's smart to go back out there's nothing for us here we need to move on best of luck hope you found what you're looking for it's coming from the town did the old just lock us out he was weird that old guy sure was something off about him why come to creepy central just to get a top up what does that mean i have a bad feeling about this we'll figure it out the way this fog just appears it's not natural what the hell is this thing looks like some kind of effigy a warning perhaps or some other spiritual significance whatever it is it gives me the creeps i don't know i'm kind of curious about it i've heard more than enough thank you are you the superstitious type i never believed in this kind of thing doesn't seem like you can say the same i'm not superstitious but stuff like what happened to us with the fog let's uh catch up with the rest i don't want to spend any more time with this disgusting thing can you two make an effort to keep up hey can you come over here what's wrong i just saw someone in the woods i can't see anyone i definitely saw someone 100 sorry i don't buy it nobody would be out here at this ungodly hour fine don't believe me you two we need to stick close what the hell [Music] [Applause] did you hear that what on earth is that okay very good we're freaked who's there whoever you are this isn't funny at all john where are you daniel taylor come on john where are you this isn't funny hey wait for us what is that hey come and check this out what on earth is that not a clue [Music] [Music] what is your name sir [Music] i'm andrew and drew and your name lady who the hell are you why are you dressed like that i am called mary i fashioned her with my own hand [Music] she looks just like the one beside you would you kindly come play with me come play [Music] completely trickery is this now mary i affection for you will be shaken looks when he learns of your infidelity with the devil [Music] there's someone else out here by the fire what i i don't see any fire i saw them too are you okay [Music] how can you not have seen that i couldn't see anything through this impossible impenetrable fog well go ahead tell them what we saw a little girl appeared out of the fog and then just like that she was gone again what is going on maybe the fog has got you confused we're all stressed out stressed my ass i saw a girl dancing right here clear as day she said her name was mary looked exactly like the girl in my dream but she talked in this really weird accent was that even american i'm not sure i couldn't place her accent either what have we gotten ourselves into this kid mary did she want to hurt you no i don't think she meant to hurt me now what seems our only option is the road into town you're kidding me got a better idea thought not [Music] [Music] you
