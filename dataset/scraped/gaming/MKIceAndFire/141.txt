um [Music] oh [Music] you got a problem a problem pilgrim you got to help me i'm in deep [ __ ] real [ __ ] deep if you don't help me that bald thug my uncle will beat me and he's got hands like cast iron frying pans the last time he hit me i had a lump on my forehead as big as a horn like some [ __ ] rhino and it came in rainbow colors too the horn i mean now based on your colorful description sounds like you enjoy it he'll be fine later you got a problem a problem what did you do to make your uncle angry this time nothing yet but i will in a moment like any normal person i took a nap and then boom i was asleep like a frog in a swamp in winter the worst part is that the sausage is on the verge of rotting in this day and age throwing away good food is a crime okay nearly good food buddy won't give you the shits quite yet if it's eaten in the next hour everyone will be fine okay maybe one of them will run to the bathroom better than starving after all knowing his [ __ ] so much they stop being hungry right but in three hours everyone's asses will explode like [ __ ] geezers then comes the puking my uncle would just [ __ ] kill me and the rest will feed my corpse to the infected i'd hurry this food over to them myself but i still have to prepare the smoker this stuff doesn't make it well you know what will happen show me where to go jesus you can't even imagine how important this is to me just grab the food rations on the table and hurry up to deliver them oh [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] inhibitor container detected [Music] you are awesome i know you made it in time too i met one guy who ate a sausage sandwich and he was fine he even called it tasty awesome thank you thank you thank you got some spare time because if you do cause i got another sausage run to prevent the runs and you you already know where to go this isn't an urgent race like the last one but in this weather you have to be careful with food the faster it lands in someone's stomach the better for everyone step straight ahead then 16 more steps turn [Music] hey you okay there oh damn it he made me lose count once more the bag's there 13 steps from the entrance 27 wait uh two infected ran in at that point damn it i'll never find it again find what my father's cd the future of mankind depends on it the future of mankind that's what my father says stellenborg a professor of cosmology here at the university heard of him he wrote a famous paper the cosmology of virology some next level thinking so what's on the cd no idea my father left it in a backpack a bag i don't know i haven't checked everything i was 13 paces from the apartment when two infected burst in no wait three do you want me to help you would you because i i couldn't even i i mean i could try but three infected is too many they'd kill me yeah probably right so here's the deal the cd is in my father's bag or a backpack and the bag or backpack is in our apartment at 116 bell tower road that's west off of horseshoe close to meat packing square and remember the fate of the human race may rest on you retrieving that cd father will pay you of course when you bring him the cd he'll be waiting outside the church i got it oh and here's the tip wait till dusk that's when they leave they're packed in there during the day five in the hall then two up the stairs no three [Music] uh [Music] i need first aid yes um [Music] eh wow uh [Applause] [Applause] uh [Music] hmm [Applause] uh [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] mm-hmm hmm [Music] whatever's on you better be worth it [Music] so yes [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] good [Applause] [Music] [Applause] smelly we will die smelly oh you're always so negative about things the essence of survival what are you talking about want to find out just close your eyes what do you perceive well um i hear noises yeah what else oh something stinks exactly the smell impulses going straight from the senses to the limbic system triggering an emotional response memories the well-being of the mind but that smells like well that smells like [ __ ] what did you expect what do you think people use as fertilizers around here too much information sorry so who are you and what are you doing here before the fall i used to work in a fragrance manufacturing company i consider myself lucky to have been professionally active within the only century when the world actually smelled nice now it's back to normal so i asked myself how can i change that what scent would make people the most happy in this miserable world i sure hope you don't mean smelling like [ __ ] is the essence of survival of course not i have this really exciting idea for a new fragrance people are gonna pay a fortune for just a whiff i called it turn me on and it's almost finished i just need some scraps for the heart note uh heart note hmm the middle notes of the perfume metal scraps and lavender that's all i'm missing of course metal scraps and lavender the obvious blend naira goes out of her way to be controversial if you bring me some i'll tell you everything about my secret formula laura said she needs lavender for her perfume too now that makes more sense metal scraps naira wants them ah i hope this isn't some wild goose chase making perfume out of metal sounds absurd don't just stand there help me i thought i was gonna die alone here thank you [Music] keeping us prisoners in our own homes get inside aiden don't stay out at night that's when the monsters come out oh [Music] [Applause] hey who the [ __ ] are you easy chief he ain't pk how do you know they're creeping around here all the time he's that outsider the pilgrim what he's from outside the walls well [ __ ] me i don't know what brings you here but watch your back pilgrim and stay away from the pks they ain't no one's friends this time with a biomarker carl said if you show up to bring your own so he can introduce himself what a nice change from wanting to hang me and remember humanity created a civilization that turned out to be a colossus on clay legs we cannot make the same mistakes he didn't want to he had to you were a threat to everyone of course do not listen to the ideologies preached by fools calling for reconstruction there will be no rebuilding [Music] who would have thought the pilgrim in the bazaar welcome yeah i'm still alive despite your best efforts it's clear to me you're holding a grudge but if you were in my shoes you would understand we are responsible for the safety of our community and we treat this seriously that's why we did what we did i hope you can forgive us so pray tell what's it like in the outside world these days bad and getting worse settlements are shrinking in size and number i'm afraid soon there will be nowhere else to go doesn't surprise me son humanity must reach the bottom in order to rise again and this is why we are here any more news not really but uh why don't you tell me more about your people we are called the people of the bazaar simply because of where we live but who we are truly are free people free from lies free from money free from religion wars politics and the dark cloud that has blanketed the earth that sounds great too good to be true in fact oh we have our challenges water is scarce for example but with courage and patience we will someday create a paradise well you seem almost thankful for the collapse of civilization it was as tragic as it was inevitable consumerism belief in the almighty dollar led to this catastrophe so we here strive not to make the same mistake twice it would be a crime we want to create a new order based on social bonds on family and community a society where people support each other and adhere to justice no need for the police military or false authorities to shoot those they are meant to protect we have a place for everyone but let's get back to your stories [Music] is gossip all you want from me carl no but you came from outside and you're walking around my flock so to set things straight i need to know if you're a sheep or a wolf what are you then [Music] i'm not really a fan of this metaphor oh yes i see pilgrims are not people of metaphors or poetry they prefer to act yeah about acting i'm looking for sophie are you and why pray tell [Music] that's my business not when you're on my turf pilgrim but fine i'll humor you your business whatever it may be is not a threat to us after all you're just one man and we are many go that way you'll see a giant of a man that's herman sophie's bodyguard she won't be far and i really hope your business doesn't make herman angry farewell my friend [Music] uh sophie can we talk don't hurt him let him talk you're that pilgrim that came to town recently you're sure well-informed don't have much of a choice i'm in charge of safety here besides yesterday you made quite an entrance i'm looking for a job would you happen to know of any looking for a job i only work with people i trust you came from outside they wanted to hang you nobody says anything good about you pilgrim do you want me to trust you talk to the people at the bazaar see if you can gain their trust if so then it might persuade me to change my mind [Applause] [Music] find something you like in the bazaar [Music] sweet weapon you got there aiden is it new [Music] stone that depends what do you want your son sent me you've got the cd yeah and your son's doing good if you were wondering um thank you for the desk what's all this about the cd containing the fate of mankind if i may be frank this may very well be mankind's only salvation people burn books to keep themselves warm at night they use oil canvases to patch holes in roofs and in gothic cathedrals they sell tomatoes they don't understand that no man lasts forever contrary to art that's it do you hear and now this transition quite so aidan this is sophie let's talk now [Music] [Music] i wonder what the hell is going on in the central loop since pk's restricted access sophie you wanted to see me i've been hearing about you good or bad things useful things the ones that make me believe it's worth giving you a chance what are you proposing go to one of the craft masters alberto or vincenzo both know the location of the purest crystals i need a few for a certain transaction a certain transaction anything i need to know about curiosity is the first step on the road to hell carl says do you believe that i believe in not trusting strangers and that's who you are so far at least bring me the location of the crystals first and we'll see where we go from there [Music] those crystals what's the deal with them they were created by the chemical bombings of a city a byproduct of some sort people believe the infection spread slower if you wear them honestly i don't think it does but there's no harm in trying and that's why they're so important to you guys that and many other reasons they're hard to get difficult to destroy and easy to get obsessed with because they're so pretty right but most importantly they're real tangible things way more real than a piece of paper and old money that's why they're so bloody expensive alberto and vincenzo tell me more about them a father and son duo alberto the father tends to yammer on before zero hour he had a workshop and piles of cash vincenzo his son is kind of shy they're both craftsmen clever too the kind that can make a watch out old gum and a piece of string you said you were in charge of safety at the bazaar what does that mean exactly it means any pk who threatens our community of free people can count on me breaking his skull from the way carl talked he sounded more like pacifists we're trying to overturn the old ways and usher in a new era for humanity it's a true revolution and every revolution needs two things to succeed ideology and an armed faction to enforce it fine i'll go talk to one of those craft masters they're in the bazaar do well and we can think about giving you bigger jobs hey you yeah you that's looking for work by any chance you look [Music] urban your anxious friends back down the job no luck yet it's not about luck kid but about the character like yours hmm ballsy okay then what does your hungry soul crave [Music] uh someone like you must know a lot out of modesty i won't deny it and maybe a little bird told you what might have happened to lucas you know i heard the pilgrim has come to the city very nosy grills people about stuff gets in the way sounds a lot like you we can't be a coincidence sure can i don't believe in them now you know anything about lucas or not well that kind of information is expensive you can't afford it i could work for it you got any work i could do leave your cv with my secretary and we'll get back to you come on don't [ __ ] with me i'm serious you barge in here like you own the place takes coconut-sized balls [Music] that's my kind of man or should i say pilgrim okay i might have a small errand for a tough guy like you take care of it and we'll see whether you're worth knowing what do you need minor thing need you to check in on a guy who's late delivering my order been in communication for a few days now might be trying to avoid me he usually doesn't keep me waiting no one does who's the guy hubert half-assed humi we call him met him he lives up to his nickname need you to find out what's up with him this time okay i'll come back after i've spoken to him he lives in the tallest building on the edge of trinity court opposite the bazaar on horseshoe you can't miss it but getting to him is another story [Music] why hubert's not just the fence he makes money where he can and now he's hiding from half the city he's super paranoid lives like a rat in a maze to keep himself safe you'll need to climb up and find one of his secret passages to get in i can handle it when you're there give him the password sayonara so he knows i sent you garen if i were him i'd clear out before he pisses people off can i help you hopefully i'm looking for work i'm sorry harvest is already in all milled and ready to go i see thanks anyway wait take this a little sweetness for the surprise [Music] well do you often give away honey and backhanded compliments like that honey and wisdom both my gifts to you so much darkness in the world why not brighten it with a smile might open more doors for you mum don't you know who that is he's a pilgrim he's no criminal benny look at him in his eyes do you see what i see we must judge people with our own hearts and eyes and not based on rumor or [Music] you're new here right [Music] does it make a difference i pride myself on knowing everyone in this dump but i don't know you maybe that's because i just got into the city for reals wow respect i heard that outside the walls it's a bloodbath what does this have to do with the job nothing my friend just sussing you out and i like what i've sussed so far but about the job first and foremost it'll require a certain amount of discretion on your part you'll be doing business for my partners and it's their business only no one else's head on over to meet them in west quarry and they'll fill you in on the details understood i'll go report to them don't keep them waiting back in the day i had a huge and massive yes a workshop so where is it you're not in one now alberto no need to be shy [Music] sophie sent me she says you know where they can find some crystals [Music] awful fox they've already sent one of their [ __ ] who that fellow sophie's brother huh what was the asshole's name barney the asshole's name is barney and he asked the same question about a dark zone with crystals yeah that's news to me so where is that dark zone it's a hundred that 120 100 and that can i tell him oh please a hundred meters from the metro there's a big sign fashion store and a windmill on the other side of the street thanks i craft and carry only the finest do [Music] thank you

works yet again this isn't the first time i gather no he's always trying to prove himself last time he got wounded wasn't that long ago either a [ __ ] kid i'll kill him i'll just kill him why blame yourself we all make our own beds listen you said it yourself you're new here so you don't know much i'm responsible for security here and he's my brother i promised i'd look after him he promised promised who never mind i'll kick barney's ass when he gets back how'd barney get wounded he didn't want to tell me my guess is that the pk's got a hold of him your brother keeps secrets from you

i didn't trust you he thought he wanted to take the crystals he sent me to check on his friend so he could sneak away it's not like that come back to the bazaar i'll explain everything my immunity is bottomed out help me man did you save my bacon thanks take this uh pilgrim in the bazaar if i were him i'd clear out before he pisses people off things are better for us now right depends doesn't it veronica the guy was a prick the pk were a pain in the ass with him in charge conclusion's pretty straightforward lucas is gone things are better for us amen it'd be better if you just shut up barney where's sophie you again what are you doing spying on me you got something to hide you were talking about the pk commander weren't you look at mr nosey here watch where you stick that nose pilgrim or you'll lose it that [ __ ] with lucas deserve to die that's the truth barney the truth is this you're an idiot and the peacekeepers protect us protect from what who took over our windmill the peacekeepers who took over the metro [ __ ] lucas so they should get the [ __ ] out before they all end up like their [ __ ] commander you were supposed to wait for me suppose schmosed plans changed afraid i was after your crystals huh afraid of you give me a break we've got our own interest to look after pilgrim and they're none of your business two year men died for your interests you used birdie to distract me at it you don't know [ __ ] about me my people jackass birdie was like a brother to me for some reason my sister wants to see you so go bother her [Music] seriously there's no time for delay thank you we have to kill them carl they used to be family we must negotiate you don't negotiate with extortionists you're nothing like your mother besides i'm in charge here prepare your men and we're giving joe those goddamn crystals [ __ ] coward know what you think but we have to listen to him herman as for the bizarre only for the bizarre sophie relax herman he saved barney remember interesting guy your little brother you two didn't get along i take it let's just say it wasn't love at first sight barney has his downsides but on the upside he is unshakably loyal and with so many problems plaguing old vilidor i just need people i can trust what are your problems you're the curious sort aren't you aiden just ask what do you want to know why did barney bail on me crystals are valuable we needed them for a transaction and now you'll be able to help like i did with barney and birdie it didn't feel like much of a help barney was in shock when he heard about birdie that's why he bailed on you he he wants what's best for the bizarre aiden he thinks he'll protect us all he's really just a kid he was just a teenager when our mother died but even earlier when he was little we were always on our own now he's an adult and he doesn't need anyone but he hurts himself the more he tries to help others [Music] it seems after the commander was murdered things got complicated between you and the peacekeepers oh that's an understatement to be more precise our situation got [ __ ] up but lucas he deserved to die since the plague nothing has hurt the locals like him it was on his order that the peacekeepers seized our windmill to support themselves they take a large part of our crops and water in return for what protection i can protect my people myself i started learning that when i was a kid that spat with carl what was that about let's just say the pk commander's death only made our problems worse look around aiden what do you see something people outside the walls could only dream of all these people will be dead by the end of the month why because in short order our water supplies will run dry two weeks ago a local thug named joe and his pal jack took over the only water tower in the area with their gang not long ago they lived in the bazaar but carl threw them out for pulling scams and now they're taking their revenge they mind the tower and they're threatening to blow it up if they don't get a weekly tribute in the form of medicines food and crystals [Music] and all these people don't they know anything not how low the water reserves have gotten i was gonna handle it but carl was afraid of causing a panic instead he went to the pk for help of course he came back empty-handed they're only here to help themselves certainly not us they could care less that joe took the tower and demanded protection money my mother used to say never bargain with extortionists when she was still in charge here wait so before carl took power you she led the bazaar with an iron fist and carl listened to her after her death he became full of himself and he got cocky didn't your mother want you to succeed i know what she wanted for her people community and freedom that's what she always said but don't ask me what she wanted for me i don't know if i even existed for her at all she was a great leader but a shitty mom what are you gonna do what i have to do i promise to help carl so while he's in charge we're gonna pay off jack and joe and they're gonna keep squeezing more and more out of us and so on and so on the most important thing is for my people to be safe you've proven that you can be trusted i want to ask you for help carl believes joe will live up to his side of the bargain and that he'll give us access to water but i'm skeptical i have to send people to negotiate with bandits and i don't want any surprises carl and our people have already set out for the spot where the deal will go down make sure everything goes smoothly so i should guard them yes from a discreet distance [Music] like a pilgrim [Music] [Music] you
