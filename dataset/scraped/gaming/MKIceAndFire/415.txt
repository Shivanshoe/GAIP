hmm those guys were national defense forces where did they take naomi why did she just change into another there's a lot we don't understand but it's a fact that naomi is another here we go let's keep this up come on all right come on major general karen yuito and gemma you two take care of her i'm returning to the front line to regroup the units yes sir kasane uh where's naomi i suppose i can tell you since you saw the whole thing she was taken by troops stationed in seyron so that car was from the ceyron garrison yes so something's not right when i reported this to major general fubuki he told me not to tell anyone else and to tell you to do the same major general current said the same thing why tell us to keep quiet does that mean osf is hiding something i don't know major general fubuki said it would protect us and take a look at this it seems like the ceyron garrison dropped this too i remember seeing this at home when i was a child according to the major general it's a drug that temporarily boosts powers he wanted me to turn them over but i managed to keep two of them without him knowing that was a smart decision in any case why would something like that be at my home the randall family is involved in weapon development anything related to drug manufacturing would have only been joint ventures with spring pharmaceuticals he also mentioned that this drug was classified information it seems like the top brass of the osf know about it spring pharmaceuticals is major general fabuki's family company perhaps the commander knew because of that don't trust new himuka what what is that supposed to mean [Music] it's something karin said i'm not exactly sure what he meant by it either if this ampule really is from ceyron then does that mean the randalls and springs are cooperating with ceyron even if that's the case it just leaves us with more questions it might be best to do as we were told we keep this to ourselves and look into it privately that ampule seems to be pretty important might be a good idea to hide it then i'll hide the ampoule inside baki huh i didn't think you'd know how to sew i was always told to be independent ever since i was little done there's two so who's going to hold on to them i'll pass i think you two should probably carry them back my sister would have been so happy kasane about naomi i'm sorry i knew that other was naomi but i was scared i i had no other choice but to fight [Music] stop it i'll get naomi back just don't get in my way this might come off as naive but i want to do what i can to help save her too it is naive but thank you oh nice one sagumi looks like everyone's here huh where's naomi isn't she with you what's wrong i'll tell you later uh where's nagi and captain seto and hanabi nagi is with the rescue team on the front line captain and hanabi are totally fine they're worried about you so we should get out of here no the rest of you go first she didn't supposed to be up ahead so i'll pick him up then i'll go with you for better or worse i'm the leader of kyoko platoon until this mission is over all right be careful so i guess it's best we join up with captain seto and head over to the hideout so this is your family's unit it's a good fit geographically and is well equipped i hope we can use it as a hideout you don't mind of course not it doesn't look like it's being used by my family anymore then we'll use this as our platoon's hideout i'm just glad you're okay we were all really worried sagumi was crying her eyes out i was not what sugumi you've got the hots for yuito what about me shut up harsh where's naomi did she and gemma regroup with kyoko platoon oh uh naomi is it's not like naomi is dead but i can't just say she turned into another and other got her no way naomi but she's the best next to kasani and she's so nice that's why you look so down that must have been hard losing a friend like that everyone goes through that at least once i won't tell you to cheer up but this is something you're gonna have to learn to accept to survive in the usf it's necessary i understand let's rest here a while you have my permission take some time to get yourself together it's a sad situation but the others won't wait [Music] yeah he did he told me to say the same thing to kasane did he tell you to yeah i don't like not telling the truth [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] please [Music] [Music] thanks i'm sorry yuito it's too bad about naomi but you did the best you could rest for now yes sir [Music] good work yuito sorry i couldn't support you the whole time it's fine there was nothing you could do anyway naomi is yeah i heard she was so nice it's too bad [Music] okay tsugumi can we talk huh talk sure oh are you busy it's okay if you are no it's fine i just wasn't ready i'm sorry you don't have to apologize i'm sorry for showing up so suddenly but i'm sorry don't apologize really i'm not good at chatting i just can't think of what to say and i get all quiet i feel like people get uncomfortable when they talk to me so i always apologize i don't feel uncomfortable at all so don't worry about it talk as slowly as you need to thanks [Music] so did you want something oh it's not that important but i saw you watering the flowers at osf headquarters before i wanted to ask you if you like flowers and plants yeah gardening is my hobby i've grown lots of plants since i was little wow gardening sounds fun there were a lot of plants in my garden at home too your garden is probably big yeah i bet taking care of it was hard we've kind of let it go lately and that's too bad it is there were all kinds of flowers before i used to enjoy spending time looking at them oh yuita you like plants huh well i suppose you could say i do i've never actually grown them myself though what kind do you like flowers or decorative shrubs big trees are cool too hmm well if i had to choose oh right there were these beautiful white flowers in our garden i like those they seem kind somehow they only bloom for a short time though do you know the flower's name no i don't the old gardener who planted them quit a long time ago sagumi why are you so quiet i think i can find that flower what you can do that i'm good at investigating plants it will be faster if i have more information information oh you mean like the flowers characteristics um i think it bloomed in the winter [Music] what else tell me exactly what it looks like the petals are small and kind of pointed and the tips of them are tinged pink the leaves were oval long and thin and kind of came up around the bottom it was about this big does that make sense i get the idea now do you remember the number of petals and that's a small detail so you might not yeah i'm not so sure but i think it was about six no wait maybe seven yeah it was seven i think you have a good memory that's plenty of information i'll look into it i'll let you know when i know the name thanks i'd be so happy if i could see that flower again hey tsugumi no this is lancelate smaller and cyclic it doesn't look like she can hear me i guess she really does like plants [Music] she's really focused i'll leave her alone [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] what is it i find it hard to believe you need to talk to me about something first i want you to look at this [Music] the menu okay new menu festival finish our large portions within the time limit and your meal is free also receive a bonus case of soda wait you're not asking me to do this are you i sure am you eat and i get the soda prize don't worry if you can't finish it all i'll pay for the meal this is what you wanted to talk about i don't know if i'm up for it it's to advertise the new menu so the food is about three times more than usual a kid your age should have a pretty big appetite you can totally do it look it says you need a reservation i don't think don't worry i already made one you planned everything already i guess i'd feel bad canceling on them now okay i'll try [Music] oh i'm so full [Music] good job that was a lot of food you didn't let me down still i may have pushed you too hard next time i'll get you whatever food you like to make it up to you no no more food i know can you come adjust sas with me now you want me to adjust your sas i heard you're really good at that stuff hmm i mean i won't force you or anything something was just feeling off about it but okay fine i guess i owe you for helping me get what i want you mean the soda you must really love soda so much that i can't refuse your request let's get this over with already sorry for asking you to do this it's fine you're a lot more impatient than i thought though i don't see why we couldn't do the sas adjustments later this was a good opportunity to get you to look at it and i wanted to get it done as soon as possible i don't want to run into issues with the sas during battle i don't like causing problems for everyone shouldn't you be more concerned with your own survival it almost sounds like you don't prioritize your own life i guess you could say that you weren't even aware of it great another one destined for an early death you should be letting loose a little more learn how to slack off a little slack off no i couldn't it's important to know when you can ease up taking proper breaks will increase your overall productivity in other words skipping out on work is the rational recommendation what happens if the others attack when you're easing up and someone gets hurt oh you're so serious is it any fun to live like that i can't help it that's just the way i am i know someone just like you i feel so sorry for you both who else is like me okay we're done the rsu support center is closed for the day please contact us again during our regular business hours huh that was quick thanks now we're even for today that means i can enjoy my soda guilt-free also don't work too hard see ya she's different [Music] i'm tired maybe i should rest a bit [Music] no where's captain seto he went back to suo a little while ago he said he's going back to work but we can do whatever we want until we're needed sorry but that's the end of free time settle platoon is being called my my the boss says it's time to work yuito hanabi you ready yeah i'm okay too i guess i have to be yeah as long as you're osf you'll lose people like this you have to get over it you're right [Music] nagi when were you discharged i would have come to get you huh oh they suddenly said i could leave this morning oh man so you were called in as soon as you were discharged that's bad luck you were in the hospital since the mission in the abandoned subway are you all healed you know it i was getting rusty so i was glad for the deployment sorry to keep everyone waiting what's this so you're back naggy hey don't push yourself too hard hi walt all right then these orders are from major general karen others are reported along the kunaut highway we'll move in three-man teams again team one is nagi sugumi and myself team two is kaguro yuito and hanabi lately a lot of national defense forces are deployed along the cunad highway it's an army but they're still normal people we can't let them get involved in a fight with others if you happen to see them tell them to keep their distance from the area let's head out to kunat highway nagi are you okay hmm if you mean my wounds i'm fine not that i mean about naomi oh i mean i was shocked that naomi died in battle but i can't let that affect me forever what died in battle naomi's alive huh that's not funny huh oh um i guess it is kind of weird to refer to her as alive when she exists as another but she's definitely alive and we might be able to change her back she's another are you feeling okay we're deploying so stop the crazy talk we have to fight others for new himuka we have to accept that naomi is dead and move on come on let's go what's wrong with nagi [Music] okay uh i'm sure you know but if an other warning was issued that means there are quite a few of them there it's going to be a long day use your head and don't overdo it today's forecast calls for others there will be scattered thundershowers showers throughout the day this is pretty rare here we go looks like the enemy dropped something rare if your body begins to burn the fire it'll drain your health so be careful nice job i need your help here we go yeah come on [Applause] looks like there's a resource nearby thanks cairo nice first strike here we go all right here we go yep i need your help let's go i can hit it leave it to me [Music] don't get caught up now die there foreign finish it off it's covered [Music] [Music] it sprays leave it to me this conference put the pressure on here we go all right maybe i got better hmm there used to be cities down this road that traded with sulu now they're all abandoned and the only ones who use this road are others in the but it should osf up if you become invisible [Music] this is pretty rare i need your help all right it should be a crime to be this strong i'll get this done [Music] [Music] oh did you know they say there are dead bodies buried underneath the cherry blossom tree i wonder how many bodies how much time it took for it to get this big i don't see anything buried i was trying to scare them that was close thanks carol let's go scary seeing how much i evolved focus that's a big so be careful leave it to me now let's go hmm yes [Music] don't get caught yeah on all right looks like the enemy dropped something rare finish it off the resource reading is close should we get it there here we go is i need your help leave it to me let me borrow this you should be able to break the outer shell if you keep attacking now done let's try open that one yeah not bad nice job you look like you're getting used to combat you ito you're in good shape thank you very much [Music] [Music] huh you're almost at the center of the forecast point stay frosty everyone captain seto this is where the others were anticipated to be right we did run into some on the way here no if this was the anticipated area it should be swarming with others water any others around us this doesn't seem like the right place maybe there was some mistake the communication lines are also too clear i'm checking the other report again what's wrong captain we're surrounded above us is that osf hey water was another unit deployed here no use we're being jammed it's probably because of them sato i still can't believe it how can you support such horrific research what are you talking about you really don't know are you being serious if so come with me now and do not resist gemma are you defying orders if you don't align with major general karen's ideals then you platoon doing here joker can you back us up we need to withdraw right it's ridiculous for us to fight our allies gamma come with me tell me what's gotten into you no we'll draw off the osf around us i doubt they are willing to take on two septentriones would you say the same is it with me luka i knew you would be here leave my brother to me don't fool yourself come at me all together i'll take you on get it together we don't know how he'll attack your fate i can't condone what you're doing but please explain i want to understand is this is what a real power looks like thanks to ease i see so it's different this time understood however no everyone get back noggy this is bad i need to find someone what the hell is going on i don't understand any of this why are gamma and major general card attacking us sing with the other osf damn someone tell me what's going on [Music] [Music] here we go let's keep this up all right all right let's keep this up we did it it would be smart not to get near him i can't believe the national defense forces attacked us you won't get me today i'll just break them through let's keep this up here we go come on we did it all right who's down over there nagi what's wrong with you naomi hey snap out of it i swear loyalty to new him nagi yuito another other other my head maggie are you okay yuito help kasonic i'll get

are you okay uh yes what do you feel sick you're really spaced out don't worry about me i'm fine anyway let's go to karin go to him can we beat him no he's not our enemy but he attacked us no i found out about naomi it's nagi what are you doing no questions i will dispose of you ah noggy now i understand noggy you're get out of my way captain i can't do that naggy you don't want to kill yuito if you do you'll regret it noggy then you will die [Music] we finally found you captain setto i won't die that easily noggy after all you're part of my platoon i'll be damned if they take you ugh what's wrong my power could it be resonating with casanos [Music] um [Music] what is this place yuito are you all right cassani yes [Music] where are we hey that's the sumaragi crest and that man over there is dressed like the legendary yakumosumaragi [Music] ugh going on i saw these in a dream cassani damn it what the hell just happened to us but where's kasani [Music] penobi are you okay hanabi yeah huh why is this happening finally found you sakumi thank goodness are you all right i am fine captain seto no it's too late you're all right gamma what do you want you still want to fight not after that earthquake no one has the will to fight earthquake you don't remember after we were attacked by major general car and there was a really big earthquake here i didn't notice at all it must have been while i was unconscious [Music] look at that sky what is that there's some kind of gravitational anomaly happening there her fellow osf got sucked in with debris i projected my sight inside but couldn't see anything it's dangerous to get close also the fire is spreading this way we won't make it unless we leave now okay gemma we'll call a truce for now let's get out of here to better assess the situation all right wait what about captain seto's body we can't just leave him here i'll carry him let's move to our hideout for now everyone follow me i wonder if cassane is okay and what about that image i saw what was that i borrowed the freezer in the back of the warehouse next door and put sedo's body in it thank you for carrying him gemma don't mention it first naomi and the captain i knew being in the osf was dangerous but this you're right all this infighting you were involved in that infighting too gemma what's happening tell me if you know how did things end up like this it's all major general karin's doing he said that the new himuka government is trying to create a controlled society centralized around the suo capital that's consistent with what i've seen and heard a controlled society what's that mean [Music] for example 90 of all psionics will be drafted into the osf with no right to refuse the draft uses the results of the annual health checkup which we also can't refuse there are countless surveillance cameras in the city not many people know this but the cameras are also equipped with sound recording it's how they find and arrest dissidents in the new himuko regime that's just the tip of the iceberg this is an open secret but there are some in the osf that suddenly go through changes in their personality they were all critical of the regime so the rumor is that their minds were manipulated manipulate the mind [Music] that might be what happened to nagi major general curran said he would stop this control of the people and he would expel the government dogs from the osf government dogs is that why he attacked captain seto yes he said seto was taking part in the government's personality rehabilitation he showed me the evidence but i still couldn't believe it that's why i confronted sedo so i could talk to him captain setto no it looked like he was trying to keep nagi with us captain seto wouldn't have done that that's not who he was wait sagumi gemma knows that too the evidence he saw was that convincing yeah but it didn't look like seto was involved in the government's plan then there was that strange hole in the sky an earthquake after you were attacked by major general karen that wasn't ordinary several osf soldiers were sucked into that hole even then he wouldn't stop his plans for rebellion that made me question him as well so that's why you called the truce yes this isn't a simple rebellion something's not right i need to know what it is the rebellion i was part of took seto's life yuito you trust gemma don't you but he didn't trust us sagumi's right i should have been more careful will you give me the chance to learn the truth i want to know if he really started this rebellion for the sake of the people i want to know too i'm curious about that hole in the sky as well so let's go to suo together there must be some clues tsugumi can you accept that no i can't but if he apologizes i can see it through somehow right i should have been more careful the truth is i let my indignation get the best of me i'm sorry i owe an apology to setto too though it's too late apology accepted okay let's rest a bit and then go to suo [Music] i don't think i've spoken to hinati lately what nagi did to captain seto i saw it with my own eyes and i still can't believe it what happened to you nagi [Music] you
