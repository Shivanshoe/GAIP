well that could have gone better i never expected that cobbled together battleship to be more dangerous than the xavian abyss those dockyard coordinates almost cost us the overseer look at this place the deck below is even worse and did you hear we're not being given the munitions we need to strike back no wonder captain carol's furious we'll get through this think of battle group echelon after the skirmish at mercy supply lines cut their admirals flagship captured but they rallied they fended off the enemy made repairs in hostile territory and launched a daring rescue and when they were ready they returned to crush the rebels under heel there's always a way to win the captain summoned us let's not test her patience local rebel forces are preparing to attack colonel grounds munitions depot you'll patrol the area in preparation for the attack and keep the depots safe ground is a fool but his assets belong to the empire therefore they belong to us during your patrol titan three will secretly search the station his freighters and cargo shuttles for baradium this explosive material will be a valuable tool against the starhawk tag the baridium and lt514 will retrieve it remotely while ground is kept busy by the rebel attack escort the beradium to the overseer for safe keeping according to the colonel these three towers hold large munition stockpiles and will be the rebels priority targets it's a powder keg if we lose the towers we lose the depot and the overseer will be defenseless remember as long as repairs are still underway we can't afford to engage the republic secure the baradium halt the rebel assault and then we can leave the remedic system you're on your own titan squadron let's do this right why is it that small-minded officers are always the quickest to flaunt what little power they have ground can lord over this pathetic corner of the galaxy all he likes but i will not allow him to jeopardize our mission this depot has everything we need to annihilate the star hawk graham may be an obstacle but he's not our enemy we move do our duty to protect imperial assets go prepare your ship i owe you and the rest of titan squadron an apology when the overseer was attacked i realized that everything i know about war is what i've read i'm beginning to understand how it must feel in that cockpit under fire terrifying yet you and the others risk it every day i took this assignment to learn clearly i still have a long way to go i know colonel graham is in the wrong and yet seizing his munitions feels drastic but captain carol is entirely correct that admiral sloan's orders supersede grams and we are committed to work there's much to do this routine is familiar we've suffered we're damaged broken even but it's not the end never is next steps are simple we heal up find vanguard then take revenge [Applause] the first crash was hardest had to relearn breathing walking so my cockpit and nightmares wasn't personal the rebels shot me down my wingman returned fire but pain is personal my team deserved my best the empire demanded it so step by step i conquered pain i [Applause] until then surviving is revenge let's fix this it never fails bureaucratic bastards like colonel graham are always in the way my brothers died on a rebel raid with 181st that never should have happened i blame the imperial senator who pushed for that doomed mission just as much as i blame the rebels who fire the torpedoes pick any military disaster and you'll always find some bant the brained bureaucrat was behind it captain carol is making the right call with this mission let's go captain carol has assigned you a tie interceptor this machine is built to cut down enemy fighters and that's what you do best hoped you'd pick that wreckage uh [Applause] overseer titan is outbound colonel growl i've ordered titan squadron to patrol the area in preparation of the enemy attack good my munitions depot was as valuable as it is volatile i expect you to defend it with your lives titan squadron split up and control the depot find the baridium before any rebels arrive copy grid [Applause] titan 3 follow me [Applause] control towers are operational don't let the rebels destroy all three nobody survives that chain reaction sounds like you speak from experience shen which i know you do [Applause] wonder how many of our albums survived couldn't be more resources out there research [Music] [Applause] weapons target and scan them to locate the paradium titan 3 split up and find it [Applause] [Music] scanning freighter titan 3 do the same concussion missiles heavy ion cannons and plasma bonds as well think of what we could have accomplished at endor with these supplies cargo shuttles if chrome has paradium he might be doing the same we use breeding strikes to drive the rivers out of hiding a jab s but it didn't flush the ripple zone it incinerated them here they are that's it the radio i'm tracing its signature across the deeper now [Music] warming up on your position [Music] excellent we'll secure the radium during the enemy raid we have rebel forces emerging from hyperspace right on time rebel farmers are targeting the control towers kill those bombers fire on my target i'm in position attack that target tower 3 has been targeted very nice ships are targeting tower two on my target attack that target enemies that was close rebel fighters coming out of hyperspace lucky i was here destroyed one has been targeted fire on my target executing order you're welcome has been targeted [Applause] them fleeing again titan squadron lt 514 will remote pilot the cargo ships to the overseer [Applause] titan it's time escort the cargo shuttles to the overseer ground won't notice a thing while he's under siege focus on the viridium we'll take care of one shuttle group attack that target i'm with you fire on my target here i am titan engage that target cargo shuttles are on route but vulnerable to assist attack that top attack that top leads us shuttle is exposed here i am [Applause] let's cover our shuttle the gradient is ours and growl is none the wiser we have everything we need to annihilate the rebel base their star wars and lyndon james enemies they've scented a frigate destroy it immediately shed take point with ion bombs we'll follow your i'll bring down leader shields titan three you'll focus on the turrets after the frigate's shields go down fire on my targets [Music] attack titan engage that target [Applause] take down the rebel frigate grands mission and our captain titan dock aboard the depot for immediate debriefing titan squadron return to the overseer at once we're leaving the rhematic system [Music] communications with this imbecile you'll regret this captain i promise you that [Music] all personnel we keep running into fools who forget what side they're on see this is why we need a new imperial senate someone who can keep these idiots in check we have a war to win officers like graham need direction not a leash looking to the horizon is all very well saul but remember to look at what's going on around you with that paradium at our disposal we'll be at the forefront of the attack on the nadiri dockyards we got caught off guard at the xavian abyss that can't happen again in one move captain carol took us from a near shipwreck to a key military asset she'll have a plan let's see what's next our victory is nearly at hand we have the location of the nadiri dockyards and the overseer is almost back to full strength our only obstacle now is vanguard squadron i won't let them catch us off guard not again admiral sloane has a plan to draw vanguard squadron and other defenders away from the nadiri dockyards the admiral has ordered titan squadron to play a part and she wants you to take the lead for this mission at least i trust admiral sloane's decision you've proven yourself capable many times over just don't let it go to your head it would be a pity if you turned out like colonel graham our baradian munitions give us the firepower to take on the starhawk but the situation isn't that simple the nadiri dockyards are protected by a massive rebel fleet we cannot engage the starhawk until it is vulnerable admiral sloan's strategy is simple lure the republic fleet away from nadiri with simultaneous attacks on enemy targets across the galaxy we've been assigned to attack mancala we don't have the numbers for a pitch battle so you will have to strike fast your mission is to sow chaos through multiple attacks moving quickly these refueling pods are your first target next attack civilian transports and any medical frigates supporting them this will certainly draw out animal squadron who are defending mon kala stay ahead of them if you can titan three you're ready for more responsibility you will lead the assault make this fast and brutal they've earned it and while titan attacks mancala two battle groups will launch strikes at alderaan and gorse disrupting republic supply lines ah at ease pilot reports of your achievements have crossed my desk with unusual frequency those accolades have been well earned admiral if titan squadron's a weapon our newest pilot is its cutting edge just as i'd hoped then consider mancala a test pilot great talent requires greater challenges agreed admiral sloane and i look forward to filing my next commendation report i'm going to overlook your unapproved acquisition of colonel graham's paradium supply although i hope you both learned something from that encounter colonel graham is efficient after all he did successfully defend his depot without using any of his own resources but an imperial officer must also show finesse if they are to command effectively we understand admiral completely that will be all seeing you rise to the occasion taking lead on this mission it reminds me why i keep fighting despite my age despite the fatigue we're one step closer to the starhawk ride this confidence but don't let arrogance get the best of you we're all expendable but not every pilot is replaceable when we lose a good leader or loyalist you can't fill the void with just anyone good pilots inspire those above and below them when you're in charge of a squadron someday remember that for now let's focus on the mission anvil squadron been a while they shut me down once lost two vertebrae that time seeing anvil burn mighty some pain overseers fixed good superstructure was groaning kept me awake implants your metal stresses handy in combat other times it's annoying been watching the mouse strides they always seem scared wonder why time to go for this mission you're authorized to fly a tie fighter reaper or interceptor your choice so [Music] [Applause] outrage here means victory at nadiri your first target is the refueling pods in orbit remember enemy starfighters are patrolling this system move quickly and cut down any interference let's get started lead on three fuel is the lifeblood of war no fuel means no ships or supply lines just a slow lingering defeat plenty of firepower to go hidden split around remember fuel eliminated permission to take point immediately or face the consequences protect the fuel thank you attack that target someone's failing me engage that target that's the way that target [Music] [Applause] thank you very requesting immediate nice to my location nicely done titan they will feel that loss keenly i've got our laser cannons warmed up ready for whatever's next let's keep moving [Music] titan three those transports are our next target looks like anvil squadron is already here titan squadron these ships are under our protection leave now or be destroyed there's a third way anvil you won't like it cut through those anvil defenders and destroy the transports all right those transports are fleeing towards planetary defenses project [Applause] this titan fire on my target incoming now you've made an impression titan finish off those transports or push forward to the next target it's your call three attacking civilians how much lower can the imperial sink this is so precious let's press on when you're ready information and enemy ready is destroyed another these ships are transport threat to you let's keep this going next objective is up moving on our next but losing medical supplies in wartime is far more devastating engage that target under attack now taking damage net the flagship anvil's getting overconfident finish off that medical frigate or head to the silver coronet the overseer is on route to assist yes titan engage that target then let's finish this here and ready to go take no chances titan return to the overseers hangar if you need emergency repairs this is it titan the silver coronet the pride of anvil squadron and a chance to strike an even greater blow titan three lead the assault demonstrate it might help to take out the coronet's shield generators those gills on its hole that's my kind of maneuver leave it to me is taking damage one shield generator down let's take out the second keep going sounds good to me anything locked on one last push the empire's taken too much from us it ends that's it the silver coronet is done for look at it leader to any remaining forces if you can hear me fall back to mancala repeat fall back ready for the next objective wide open excellent work our final target lies ahead who led the scouring of moncala that's the sort of accolade that gets people's attention makes them listen to what you have to say if i were in your position i'd be thinking about what that new found prestige could be used for when the war's over just a suggestion let's find out what captain carol needs next our diversion was a success vanguard squadron has left the nadiri dockyards to aid mon kala leaving the starhawk completely exposed we now have a clear shot to finish our mission admiral sloane has sent reinforcements to help secure our victory but you titan squadron will lead the strike against the star hawk if new republic patrols and perimeter defenses intercept you on approach show them no mercy before we begin our beradium assault you must bring down the dockyard's shields we've discovered shield generators at these locations destroy them all and the overseer's bombardment will begin after the shield generators are down titan iii will return to the overseer to acquire baradium-enhanced munitions this is where we show our true strength immobilize the starhawk with buradium do not stop until its hyperdrive is destroyed i want that ship helpless when i deliver the killing blow let's make admiral sloan proud before us is a historic victory if we have the metal to seize it the baradium the overseer even our tie fighters are only tools what decides a battle is our will to conquer that's what the rebels have never understood if we hold to that principle we can crush the starhawk and win the day we've successfully drawn off the rebel forces protecting the nadiri dockyards only a token defense remains and the star hawk no doubt the rebels believe the starhawk is all the protection they need they have no idea what alberidium is about to do to their defender get ready it's time so on to nadire captain carroll's tenacity and your hard work have made this possible of course mere numbers aren't enough to win a battle but i'll give you the best moment-to-moment analysis that i the can will be at your disposal for the crucial moment i've seen to it the rest is in your hands unfortunately we cannot issue you baradium munitions from the get-go with the enemy shields up there's a high probability that missiles will be lost in the crossfire or a pilot either would be quite devastating gray asked me about the starhawks tractor beam but don't worry that won't be a factor in this battle with the starhawk docked its tractor beam would endanger the dockyards and everyone stationed there the rebels squeamishness gives us the advantage good luck not a factor i can predict sadly you know this attack is about more than the starhawk vanguard or even the dockyards it represents a strike at everything this new republic represents what they think they gained at endor new republic even the name's a joke the republic has never been anything but ten thousand squabbling voices though after this they'll be screaming in unison let's show the new republic for the sham it really is it's clear the captain trusts you leading the radium strike against the starhawk is a big responsibility you've more than proved you're capable agreed the path has been long but i'm proud to fly with both of you what's next after the war [Music] i've been at this a long long time i'll retire maybe somewhere quiet near the water my husband would be happy anywhere without durasteel walls at this point what about you shen this is what i do i need it here war or not fair enough time to go consider outfitting your bomber to handle new republic fighters as well as their capital ships your loadout is looking good it'll be even better once we're cleared to give you beradium explosives [Music] [Applause] so this is it titan squadron everything we've done has led to this bask in the moment and then massacre your enemy we're looking forward to it captain general syndulla to imperial forces you are trespassing in new republic space leave immediately this is captain carol of the overseer your star hawk dies today as will you titan squadron attack with pleasure all turrets open fire on those ships your meager defenses cannot stop us titan eliminate all turrets let's give the overseer a clear path to the starhawk i'm on your wings [Applause] it's is of no concern to me nice work attack that target [Music] scuffed my heart attack that target my life wait for me to reload we're launching viridian missiles from the overseer now fire on my target joining your position fire on my target titan engage that target it's time has made contact with the doctor's shields this won't take long titan we need to fly past that starhawk to hit their generators it history will remember what side you chose history has no sides only survivors our shields will hold only as long as we let them tighten destroy the dockyard shield generators understood [Music] the first shield generator is down enemy fighters are coming from that generator hangar that hangar is finished all thanks to imperial trade generator [Music] so ready for the next you're too close this is the fun part foreign [Music] shields are down the dockyards are exposed overseer prepare to fire wait we have civilians preparing to evacuate they have no place in this battle then you should never import them here that meridian is really working titan finish what needs finishing then [Music] regroup gorgeous isn't it so much let them go no survivors titan squadron captain they've launched corvettes to cover the civilian escape show no mercy titan take out their ships yards are under attack set back up we've detected enemy corvettes she's already run out lucky i was here attack destroyed nothing less you won't stop me here and ready to go just because you caught us off guard doesn't mean you've won our victory was assured before the battle had even begun general singular all personnel bore the star hawk immediately i'm flying us out of here captain the star hawk is powering up i believe they're trying to flee pathetic titan iii return to the overseer for baradium munitions immediately all right here i am we've outfitted your bomber with the radium explosives happy hunting now titan three attack the star hawk do not let it get away star hawk make your peace we're leaving and taking everyone from the nadiri dark yards with us you've evaded the empire long enough today there will be no escape titan 3 general syndulla is aboard the starhawk immobilize it and the overseer will deliver the killing blow moving to attack find a new target you're just making me angry [Music] i'm in formation starhawk engines and hyperdrive systems are severely damaged it won't be jumping anywhere i'm not done yet titan lead another pass at the dockyards [Music] your people needed you lyndon but he weren't here is there anyone you won't turn your back on all stations fire on that ship scramblers we can't let them get away they won't their hyperdrives are too damaged to jump [Music] lyndon won't escape this time we had them they were in our sights and captain carol just let them go what could she do with our missile guidance scrambled we could have done something now lyndon james and vanguard squadron are laughing at us they're running scared dragged down by an injured fleet if anyone's laughing it's captain carol let's just get to the briefing room the nadiri dockyards are burning their starhawk flees before us linden and vanguard are within our reach vengeance is sweet isn't it but this is no time to get complacent i've waited too long to let lyndon slip away again admiral sloan is adamant that the starhawk be destroyed but we cannot engage it directly the tractor beam is too powerful instead we must force them into the ringali nebula there vanguard and their battleship will be erased from history our empire has called us to serve we cannot fail you
