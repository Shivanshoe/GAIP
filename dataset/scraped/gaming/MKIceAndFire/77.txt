hey i've been meaning to talk to you i know you've had some success here on smackdown but i have some constructive criticism if you're mature enough to handle it i'd like to think i am what is it i found some holes in your game several in fact and if you don't repair those holes they'll get bigger and bigger and you'll never make it to the next level really yes really you can ignore what i'm saying and accept mediocrity or you can take my advice train hard and better yourself i don't know what do you get out of all this other than the satisfaction of helping someone become the best version of themselves potentially a tag team partner but only if you accept my help and address your weaknesses i can make a slideshow if it'll help make this any clearer i don't think that will be necessary okay so what's your answer do you want my help or no i want to be the best i can be so let's do this great i'm going to run you through an intense program of challenges that will pinpoint and correct each of your weaknesses first up your toughness from what i've seen it's lacking agree to disagree no agree to agree to fix this deficiency i want you to go start a fight with riddle and win got it all right this superstar looks determined tonight whoa from behind they're to settle this right now the bell is wrong and anything goes in this no disqualification match this is just going to be a brawl that can turn real ugly real quick no rules to obey means no limit on how nasty this one can get and i love it [Music] ah that hurt and he's able to reverse each competitor showing they've done their homework able to perry that one can't quite get him there turned that one around oh oh ouch oh man oh man a flurry of brutality [Music] run right through with the spear he's lining him up oh oh you can tell he's feeling it now this fight is pumping him up up across the shoulders feast your eyes double axe handle oh [Music] riddle left him high and dry [Music] riddle gets reversed well measured a well-aimed strike an agile escape blasted by a forearm elbow drop piercing the final cut perfectly executed [Music] and he said you're not getting me with that oh riddle with the kick and he's not done there the pro mission trying to find a way out several right hands and he's out he deflects it right back up across the shoulders boom feast your eyes oh sharp kick yeah great awareness from riddle paying it back with their own counter oh low drop kick right on the patella riddle out of the way he's got him in his grasp check their face after that one oh man that's it calling it by knockout i saw what you did against riddle could have been worse i took down one of the toughest guys on the roster and that's all you can say it was a step in the right direction but you have more leaks in your boat to repair if you want to be the best version of yourself okay so what leak are we fixing next i see holes in your submission game prove me wrong in a submission match and i'll be out there watching in person so no shortcuts because shortcuts are bad no we've been over this if you take shortcuts you get cut short now come on start paying attention and don't let me down they are ready for a fight bit of an odd parent here as the submission match gets underway what do you mean drew gulag has a proven track record of helping superstars be the best version of themselves and i heard this is his latest project apparently coach bulac has tasked his student with working on his submission game tonight let's see how it goes devastating kick hits it with the counter series of reversals samoan drop byron [Applause] this match grinded him down a little a submission match is all about wear and tear coal he'll do well to remember that moving forward just one step ahead sequence of reversals there [Applause] wow a ferocious attack against cesaro here cesaro is gonna have to endure this punishment ah cesaro able to reverse that saw that one coming these two showing how well scouted they each are yeah is here is your winner nice win in the submission match last week but when i was out there i noticed you rely on reversals way too much that's a hole in your game i didn't even know existed you're turning out to be a bigger project than i thought you're not giving up on me are you no never it's just going to take more work than anticipated first let's nip this reversal issue in the bud in your next match you're not allowed to use any reversals got it yep and no shortcuts because if you take shortcuts you get cut short there just might be hope for you after all here comes trump and here we have a superstar with a big chip on his shoulder he has certainly felt overlooked recently well he has a chance to change that perception in this matchup and taking him on is a luchador that throws caution to the win the high risk high reward but don't look at let's say it's one dimensional he's really developed a multi-tool offense yeah dorado continues to mature inside the ring and out of it i just heard he learned how to use the litter box solid connection treading all over their opponent oh what a kick oh what a kick oh stinky kick he may be in a bad way and this match is not over yet things are only going to get harder from here strikes with a kick that's gonna be it there's two oh how did he get the shoulder up what an incredible match we are witnessing setting dorado up the s2l serious jeopardy for lindsay and that'll about do it folks here is your winner sub zero scorpio you're progressing nicely with your training but we still have more to fix okay what's next coach we've talked a lot about shortcuts and one of the ultimate shortcuts in sports entertainment is top rope maneuvers you might remember my presentations on the risks these moves involve in my support of the no-fly zone of course how could i forget the nfz abbreviations are verbal shortcuts oh right sorry so your next match will be contested under no fly zone rules for both you and your opponent let's see if your ground game this is gonna be unique match-up here tonight being contested under no-fly zone rules trust the process cole drew gulak is making his pupil into a streamlined fighting machine we've seen glue like out here for several weeks now with his so-called student but is his coaching really making a difference the jury's still out [Applause] he goes for the quick pin gets his shoulder up right before optimistic thinking on that pin attempt able to reverse that one and down with the suplex producing a trampoline he gets out of the way just sending a message there apollo crews a little out of his element here crews escapes the attack oh big boot mistake made by crews [Applause] to each superstar trying to stay a step ahead knees up just in time big kick oh workplace knee right to the midsection reciprocating the initial reversal second one didn't effective and this uh is over here i have some bad news you failed the drew gulak training program what do you mean i did everything you told me to do i passed all your tests sorry you just don't have what it takes there were too many holes to fix and not enough time i'll need to look elsewhere for a partner no i will not accept this i'm light years better than i was when we started training together and you know it okay okay you passed your final test good job huh your last weakness was perseverance but you just refused to accept failure you're now truly ready to be my partner congratulations i'm proud of you thanks all right now that the easy part is over let's get to work we have our first match teaming together next week if you apply everything you learned we'll be holding tag team gold in no time go celebrate for a few minutes then we'll start breaking down film on our opponents this is going to be fun they're here apparently we're looking at the newest graduate of the true gulag training program as the student and teacher team up for the first time here tonight gulax molded his partner in his image and the two now seen poised to go after tag team gold it's a first match here tonight though as they take on two opponents who are out for revenge in little and apollo crews reversal on top of reversal driver you're stomping down he's got the answer for that one what a counter by riddle quick exchange of counters there he's looking a little off balance yeah he might want to tag out just to have the fresher teammate in right now not that he can't fend for himself right now just floating through the air [Applause] needs to fight kick out did he do that burying elbows in the midsection he just keeps dealing out punishment with every move he's taking charge escape just in time oh [Music] and that was a well-targeted attack excellent opportunity for riddle to shift the momentum if river was looking for an opportunity to pull a 180 that could be goodness nasty line and riddle in a bit of danger i think this riddle is almost soft will that prove to be enough this time oh and there's the breakup just in the nick of time he's ejected from the ring crushing knee strike great job anticipating riddle and he'll come back from under the apron [Applause] i was curious to see how they'd work together and they didn't disappoint that drew gulak just turn on his partner apparently that's the first and last time we'll see these two team up unbelievable drew you trained with your partner for weeks and finally teamed together tonight for the first time but then for some reason you attacked him after the match can you explain why i'd be happy to you see when we were training together everything was so easy for him okay no matter what test or challenge i threw at him he passed with flying colors and the whole time he had this attitude about it almost like he was doing me the favor instead of the other way around and then when we finally teamed together he just had to get the win right it was his way of trying to one-up me because he thinks he's so great well i've got news for him he's not and i'll prove it because he thought he passed all the tests well he didn't i'm the final test and this time he's going to fail so you're challenging him to a match yes but not just any match i want to see if he actually learned anything so i'm proposing a match with no shortcuts allowed which means no running no escaping the ring and no top rope moves now we'll find out who's got holes in their game and who doesn't drew gulak's partnership abruptly came to an end last week when he turned on his former student now they face each other in a match-up with some unusual stipulations that's right michael gulag said there'd be no shortcuts allowed which means no running no escaping the way and no top rope moves kind of stacking the deck in his favor if you ask me those are all legitimate rules and now let's find out if his former student actually learned anything we know gulak failed to fix his poor attitude [Applause] [Applause] a long way up slid behind right to the left knee [Applause] he manages to escape it with a suplex he's getting a little matter now saves himself german suplex but that's not all [Applause] with the irish whip on his former student wait was that legal in this match he tripped over the ropes and with the referee down gulag is showing you exactly the kind of man he is breaking the rules that he proposed yeah he's showing you that he's intelligent and an opportunist the no-fly zone has been temporarily lifted leaving the ring another rule violation and if we're gonna steal steps drew gulak is completely taking advantage of this situation he has no integrity this is ridiculous and of course just as the referee recovers gulak initiates a side headlock what's wrong with that it's perfectly legal yeah after he broke three other rules you guys are nerds match is brutality starting to show on him they've definitely taken their lumps at this point their opponent is not messing around armstrong endless knee strikes and the momentum is clearly against gulag now gulag has to start trusting his instincts at this point stop it ouch with that one and that might be the start of the momentum's reign needed yeah able to stop that search dead in its tracks [Applause] zero me i know you and i have mostly been doing our own thing on smackdown but i think it's time for that to change why is that because we have a special bond from training together at the pc even though we weren't always on the same page that bond is still there it means something just tell me what you want what i want is the intercontinental championship and i want you to help me get it i already have my old buddy nakamura here and there's power in numbers if you'll join us okay i'm willing to give this a shot what's your plan i've already had a couple matches but he's always found a way to escape for his championship so with our help you're going to beat him then give me a title match deal so how about tonight i get his attention he has a match schedule but i'll make sure he never makes it to the ring i like it see i have a feeling this is gonna work out just fine what's happening here he's ambushing big e that's what's happening he's not even scheduled to face big e tonight somebody needs to get out here and put an end to this [Applause] [Applause] we're talking about a bombshell biggie's mystery partner's been revealed to be none other than wwe legend shawn michaels big e promise the big surprise is his tag team partner here tonight and he's certainly delivered wow paragon jay pierce and his kearney's we're expecting an advantage tonight but they can kiss that goodbye now oh god that looked devastating producing a trampoline carefully placed stomp to the arm able to parry that one oh sharp kick he's taking some good hits looks like the heightened action of this handicap matches caught up with him a little connected on that both wrists captured vicious knee to the face biggie has lost any momentum here yeah big game needs to find that spark and kick lands oh kick connects emphatically [Applause] down to the wire who's going to give in first big ease completely out of it oh my god yeah no he doesn't get the three how will that be the deciding factor michael's with the awareness [Applause] it's finally over with the win here are your winners oh yeah i like this guy after an explosive handicap match last week intercontinental champion piggy defends his title against the hungry superstar looking for his first ic championship biggie's opponent is stepping into the spotlight but you have to wonder how much of an impact paragon jay pierce and shinsuke nakamura right now on this match whether they get involved or not i think the odds are against biggie walking away with this championship as expected shinsuke nakamura is here to help the challenger take down big e how much more one-sided can this match get oh no i think we're going to see the electric chair you know rolling elbow right on the mark both wrists captured the champ now absorbing a little damage he planned for this and can still rally just like that biggie finds a counter each superstar trying to stay a step ahead really just laying it in the reversal he deflects it right back big e able to avoid impact both wrists captured and that was nasty he manages to escape it he's been placed in the corner now good timing with that reversal i am in shock what's it gonna take to keep this guy down here it comes to go see a new champ [Applause] with the help of his running mates paragon jay pearson shinsuke nakamura we have a new intercontinental champion i think biggie might have gotten in over his head taking on this new group he was able to fend off paragon for a while but this was just too much tonight i'd like to see how big he does in a fair one-on-one match with no outside involvement then we'll talk [Applause] [Music] you can call the new intercontinental champion all kinds of names but you can't say he's not a man of his word after granting paragon j pierce a shot at his title tonight what a heartwarming display of friendship and decency especially after the champions totally honorable win against big e i'm detecting a hint of sarcasm byron justin liftoff talking about rocking the jar [Applause] the stomp in every single part of his body ducking out of trouble great reversal hit the ropes [Applause] it's the former intercontinental champion big e big e said this wasn't over and i guess he meant it the champion into the cover kick out at one for the challenger showing his determination there with that kickout great counter impressive ring iq on display there connects oh man oh harsh kick yeah cool but at this point the match you still haven't lost the edge evades the attack sequence of reversals there both wrists captured looking for the victory there's two oh somehow managed to keep this match going how does anyone kick out at this point [Music] [Applause] here is your winner and still the wwe the intercontinental championship one of the most prestigious titles in all of sports entertainment here we go is the intercontinental champion defends his controversial title and a fatal forward against paragon jay pierce schinsky nakamura and a very agitated big eight feels more like a three-on-one handicap match to me you can't vote the champ for taking our gm up on his offer can you that's just being smart saxton looking up oh jarring back elbow [Applause] of the match like this release oh down [Applause] i understand the sentiment but now is not the time to bask in disbelief [Applause] on [Music] [Applause] oh man the challenger is not in a great place [Applause] oh man the rep needs to get out of the way the kick drops them to their knees and now kick after kick after kick brown ass kicks keep [Applause] it common this fight is pumping him up i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because and the champion finally ready to put this one away and there's the breakup just in the nick of time assad connie i don't have an answer michael if you can put them away you should put them away he gets back into the ring but that's not all [Applause] he breaks the pin [Applause] man the title might change [Applause] vicki on the move kicker's down the line [Applause] here's the pin to retain and you can debate whether or not that would have been the end interesting decision there being carrying around with ease just big drop for the win two three here is your winner we the road to the king of the ring crown begins tonight with dominic mysterio facing off against a hungry smackdown superstar looking to make a serious run at the throw dominic has been called one of wwe's most promising young princes but his opponent will be looking to make sure that's as royal as ray's son gets fails he's returning fire climbing up top he's got big plans up high and now there's an opening quick side step by dominant kick right to the back of the leg he got whipped into that corner he catches dominic with a counter here is your winner this guy is the real deal the king of the ring tournament kicks off with two remarkable superstars looking to officially begin the long climb to the wwe throne it might only be a first round match but both of these superstars know just how much a king of the ring crown could change their careers forever and one loss could derail that entire quest no pressure oh harsh kick he's been taken hold of basebuster wow springboard attack oh foot just stopping down he bends off the attack someone follows in for it dentist [Applause] that gets reversed on apollo [Applause] here is your winner sub zero me here he comes welcome to the semifinals of one of the most iconic tournaments in all of sports entertainment the king of the ring we have taken out a superstar who's starting to pick up some real momentum that's right michael and momentum's the name of the game in a tournament like this especially when the semi-finals and finals are scheduled to happen it's anyone's crown at this point and that one misses the mark oh what a roundhouse kick both wrists captured saw it coming indian riddle scouted nice evasion by riddle check this out just dead lifted up into a powerbomb and the exclamation point he was elusive there hits the drop kick and riddle in a state of low and needs to fight back oh man a little extra luster behind that kick that's gotta be [Applause] here is your winner sub zero [Applause] [Music] i know you just won your match so i'm not sure if you've heard the latest on biggie and paragon what's going on well after big e beat paragon they got into a fight backstage and he was injured he can't compete tonight or anytime soon okay so just make me king that's not an option i do have another plan though but you're not gonna like it are you giving the spot to paragon no that wouldn't be fair i have someone else in mind someone who's a future hall of famer but has never been king of the ring the viper randy orton what i've been competing in this tournament since the beginning and already wrestled tonight and orton gets to just step in fresh and face me and you wanna talk about fair hey i said you weren't gonna like it but my job is to make sure this tournament ends in the ring if i were you i'd go get all the rest you can and here comes one of my favorites the apex predator has arrived one of the all-time greats has seen and done everything there is to do in this business and his opponent representing rk bro from st louis missouri weighing in at 250 pounds the viper randy [Applause] think of all the legendary factions that randy orton has been a part of all steps in his career greatness oh he learned from the best but at a very early age randy proved he can go it alone yeah we learned very quickly that randy orton was the student who was able to surpass the masters and in the process randy orton has become a master in his own right one of the most vindictive one of the most vengeful and one of the most dangerous superstars you will ever see that's why i love everything about this guy saxton [Applause] randy orton's methodical pursuit of self-serving goals is synonymous with his personality a superstar who always gets what he wants my sources tell me that randy orton wants you to go home saxton now randy's ready to consume more prey here tonight you might want to take corey's advice sax man what a dramatic turn of events so fresh randy orton is in the king of the ring finals facing the superstar coming off a brutal semifinal match earlier tied against i think it's fair to say nobody saw this coming i'll tell you who definitely didn't see it coming randy orton's opponent now he can't like it either orton's one of the most decorated superstars in wwe history but he's never been king of the ring i think that changes tonight stopping down the viper shows his instinct back and forth from these competitors if this lands it might be all over [Applause] driver able to avoid there whoa not quite yet gdt plants then good night what a stunner just sending a message there despite having to compete twice in one night and then face a completely rested randy orton he overcame the odds and is now the new king of the ring [Applause] yeah randy orton thought this was his golden opportunity to capture the one accolade that's invaded him throughout his career but it just wasn't his night without a doubt this is a career defining moment for this superstar all hail the new king [Applause] hey did you hear about jimmy uso's injury yeah i did i feel bad for the guy now his wife naomi needs a new partner in the mix match challenge tournament as a reminder the winners get to be co-gm's of smackdown for one night so are you interested in taking his place gm for the night yeah i'm in all right i'll make it official and you should probably go talk to your new partner when you get a chance what's up new partner so you heard huh yep i was pretty bummed when jimmy went down but we can still make the best out of a bad situation where are we at in the standings i haven't been following the mix match challenge too closely seriously come on man there's no time to play catch-up the playoffs are about to start and we gotta face miz and maurice okay okay i got it you better not screw this up for me i have big plans for when i'm gm for the night i want to be gm2 so don't worry i'll hold up my end of the deal now this [Applause] welcome to the playoff round of the mix match challenge is naomi and her replacement partner take on the hit couple miz and maurice difficult task to step in and team together for the first time at this stage against opponents who know each other so well uh yeah miz and maurice are married saxton so i'd say they know each other very well it's gonna be an uphill battle to defeat them [Applause] we'll find out soon enough if he's even a good tag hanging back with their own count hooked up he's stalking his opponent from the top turnbuckle from the top so now the women are going to go one on one get back here leglerian and that holds maurice back she tags out so now it's the men one on one target in the arm this has got to hurt hits him with the counter style he's going for the big [Applause] wow i thought this was over tossed into the corner oh it's coming the miz just got destroyed cover obviously still has some fight left [Applause] [Music] legs in the corner needs to recover [Applause] finally got him i can't believe here are your winners i hope she's taken yes as this semi final match gets underway i'm still somewhat surprised to see naomi and a replacement partner have advanced this far they've won one match cole i think their luck ends tonight against josie jane and paragon j pierce well i know jimmy is home pulling for the underdogs and hey so am i a cinderella run like this is what makes tournaments so great targeting the arm to great effect headed to the top now taking flight [Applause] he's absorbed some damage already right now he's thinking one of two things cole i need to get out of here or i'm gonna answer this call and pay him back and the explanation saw that coming oh my god oh it might be all over [Applause] women have been adversity at the bit and now they're about to throw down into the corner now one two series of kicks in the corner oh kick right to the spine measured kick to the vertebrae making that shoulder a priority here showcasing his strength pierce is determined right now [Music] can impressive reversal there places are right in the corner oh look at this incredible together [Applause] look at the look on his opponent's face cole he can't believe it and you know what's next guys [Applause] this is going to come down to who wants it more oh man forget the couch nice job getting to the ropes and when you're in that position you have no other choice oh short shot to the guts ah what a counter placed into the corner oh look at this incredible together nicely done and that's some late match offense from pierce [Applause] the final match of the mix match challenge is a ride where naomi and her partner face a formidable challenge against oscar and shinsuke nakamura they've been underdogs the entire playoffs and managed to advance this fall i wouldn't count them out here tonight either i will no disrespect to the teams they beat to get to the finals but oscar and nakamura on a whole different level when this is over the empress of tomorrow and the king of strong style will be walking away as co-general managers of smackdown and now there's an opening oh look at the impact here boom boom pummeling the chest to their opponent this is brutal oh my goodness oh boy he's stalking him watching for an opening he's trying to intimidate his opponent one more time but he's got to strike soon [Applause] scouting pays off against nakamura man a little extra luster behind that kick that was the best one i've ever seen [Applause] in stereo suplex oh look at this so accurate oscar turns it around she tagged out but if you ask me i think her opponent wanted a break too drop kick beautiful treating the torso to yet another attack [Applause] in the corner [Applause] you're looking at the winners of the mix match challenge tournament they were a patchwork team after jimmy uso was injured but gelled enough to cruise through the playoffs and take tonight's final let's not forget what's really important here the winners of the mix match challenge get to beat gm's at smackdown for one night that's quite the reward assuming it's put to good use i have no doubt they'll do just that congrats again to the winning pair we did it well technically i did it seriously relax i'm kidding we did this as a team yeah we may have been a last-minute thrown together pairing but it worked out okay so as gm of smackdown i know i'm gonna give myself a universal title match against roman reigns but what are you gonna do have a glow-in-the-dark match or something funny no i'm gonna get my smackdown women's title back it's been too long since i've held gold so thanks for helping me make it possible and good luck against roman he's family but i won't be mad if you're able to beat him so this is it then huh nah i'll be seeing you around thanks again i'm gonna go call jimmy the following one of the best superstars the head of the table the tribal chief protecting his samoan family legacy on top of the food chain a main eventer since day one but now the tribal chief is tougher than ever [Applause] here we go with this universal championship match as the champion roman reigns defends against the smackdown gm for the night making this match was a given for the victor of the mix match challenge but winning it will be a whole different situation yeah i'm sure the head of the table wasn't too thrilled to have to defend his championship under these circumstances a frustration he's likely to take out on the challenger back and forth from these there competitors champ getting put on the back foot here yeah but he's not breathing heavy yet great job refocusing to reverse that each competitor showing they've done their hard work and now the challenger looks to take control of roman reigns in this universal championship match yeah a match he made himself really earned it wait a second that's jimmy uso he's been out for weeks with an injury i'm guessing he's not here to congratulate his wife's replacement partner on winning the mixed match challenge if things had gone differently this could have been uso's championship opportunity tonight look out roman reigns superman punch [Applause] it's all over roman reigns has managed to hold on to his universal championship yeah with a major assist from his cousin smackdown's gm for the night had everything lined up perfectly but it all changed in an instant due to the returning jimmy uso no matter what kind of temporary authority he has it wasn't enough to survive a distraction and a superman punch i'm sure both of these men are gonna have a lot to discuss with each other and naomi and here comes one of them this match is underway as jimmy uso looks to get even with his wife naomi's [Applause] what was his wife naomi supposed to do just drop out of the tournament she and her replacement partner made the best out of a bad situation nonetheless jimmy didn't see it that way and cost his opponent a universal championship match now they look to settle their differences here tonight strikes with a kick now trampling the opposition perfect kick up the turnbuckles what's he gonna do liftoff [Applause] jimmy's looking helpless to every attack yeah jimmy keeps getting cut down at every move reversal on top of reversal on the right shoulders [Applause] down she wrote here is your winner me music welcome to the road to money in the bank baron corbin will be looking to take out his anger management problems on a superstar that's come a long way in wwe but still has a lot to prove if he wants to stand tall over the rest of the roster it's my favorite time of year cole briefcase season a battle-tested superstar that knows how to win when it counts so his opponent's gonna have his work cut out for him if he wants to qualify tonight but really just laying it in he's living a little off balance no need to panic he's still swinging double axe handle and corbin can't find a way off the blocks corbin needs to better assess the situation to turn this around he turns it around on corbin prime opportunity now for him to get some separation and gather himself victory here is your winner and if you want to see who can play well with others put them in a tag match it's true teamwork needs to be on point to win one of these you know i always think of us as a three-man team oh shut up saxton i'd switch sides just to pin you stomping down getting set up for something in the corner oh man he's in a little bit of trouble now yeah things are starting to really get out of hand that switch up the strategy impact reversal on lastly looks absolutely out of it right there [Applause] here are your winners [Applause] we are about [Applause] waiting for is of the most iconic tests in all of sports entertainment the money and the bank ladder match and what a remarkable group of superstars we have in the match this year so many different skill sets and so many different alliances inside the ring tonight especially after that six-man tag team masterpiece on smackdown for once saxton you're right because i have absolutely no clue as to who's helping who everybody's a legitimate threat to grab the briefcase or nothing at this point he's outside the ring now all the way to the floor but if it works it works to the outside this could get wild oh carefully measured lined up perfectly squatting too much reach reach [Applause] gets reversed and he has free reign to the outside with no count outs to worry about ah and took too long setting up for that one aggressive work on that shoulder able to taking advantage getting the ladder set up right in the center of the ring a picture-perfect location perfectly for the victory he's got it in his grass okay he's re-entering the rank oh my gosh the pro mission has locked it he's got it locked in it's locked in now would be a wise time to submit into the ring now [Applause] hey watch this letting him free i don't know where he wanted him but maybe he has something incredible pressure but he's still gonna climb the ladder that's the only one to say the least that shoulder targeted there tap in the arm cross face submission pierce is just about to finish this [Applause] just has to finish the job great reversal oh man he's heading back to the ring pierce is stumbling into the line of fire he's ejected from the ring [Music] walking away with that briefcase is never an easy task especially considering some of the men he had to outlast tonight to get it now the real questions start how and when will he decide to cash it in i'm sure our universal champion roman reigns will be eager to find out if that match does occur i can't wait to see it it's only been a couple of hours since i won this briefcase and i've already gotten a lot of questions when are you gonna cash it in what championship are you gonna go for will it be a surprise so i'm going to cut to the chase and give you all the answers since day one i wanted a shot of roman reigns in his universal championship and now that i have this i can make that a reality so roman i'm not gonna hold on to this for a long time or try to cash in when you're not expecting it i'm challenging you to face me in the ring on smackdown for your universal championship i'll be waiting for your answer [Applause] it it simply doesn't get any bigger than this the money in the bank briefcase is being cashed in right here right now and the universal championship is hanging in the balance it is a dream match up michael norman reigns is defending his title against an extremely confident challenger that's hitting his stride at exactly the right time i absolutely love this superstar's moxie right now no tricks no surprises just a man that's ready to step up and rip the universal title from the biggest name in the game roman reigns oh stop it away [Music] [Applause] the big dog had that scouted counter after counter my goodness did you hear that job jumping knee strike i like that some hard offense landing on the champ yeah but at this point in the match you still haven't lost the edge had that scouted is going to lift the press on the advantage yeah roman was able to momentarily stop the bleeding but can he take control of his match reigns is getting dismantled here romans being picked apart he's turning the tables and another we can have a new universal champion is that kevin owens music we haven't seen him in months he's got his money in the bank briefcase from last year's event owens nails the current briefcase holder with this briefcase what the heck is happening i think he's cashing in we're gonna have a triple threat match but two money in the bank briefcases how is this legal [Applause] stunner one two three kevin owens has shot the wwe universe and stolen the universal championship he didn't steal anything he just outsmarted everyone in the arena well it certainly looks like roman reigns feels like his championship was stolen yeah the challenger probably feels the same way he had hit his finisher on reigns and was moments away from becoming champion himself none of that matters now what's important is we have a new universal champion in that man's name is kevin owens [Music] you wanna explain what the hell you're gonna do about all this look i get you're upset but unfortunately what ko did was technically legal i thought you only had a year to cash in i had the new briefcase clearly it was over a year i know and normally that is true but ko was injured for a while and was able to use that time to extend his cash in window past the one year mark we're going to tie up that loophole for the future but it's too late to change what ko did so you're not going to do anything to fix this my universal title shot is just gone not necessarily to make this up to you i'm putting you in a rematch against roman reigns whoever wins will face kevin owens for the universal championship that work sounds like i don't have a choice so i guess it will have to here he come buckle up because we're about to witness one of the most controversial rematches in wwe history a showdown to find out who will face kevin owens for his universal championship between former universal champion roman reigns and the man that came within inches of romans title neither man is happy about this outcome ko should be ashamed of himself for his disgraceful cash in with last year's briefcase oh sparrow saxton ko was well look out stop to the chest oh my what elevation took a gamble once took a gamble again and hit the jackpot twice just putting their body in danger time and time again what a counter referee in position two count he kicks out before three letting it get down to the wire a little early what a reversal by reigns [Applause] that's how you dominate your opponent [Applause] folks here is your winner gentlemen i think this superstar is coming in with a lot of enthusiasm and energy right now but what's going to happen when the excitement wears off and he comes to realize he's in the fight against someone who's going to take his head off all i can say is we've seen adrenaline take this superstar very far in the past here we go ko is apparently going to do some advanced scouting of his opponent where is he is owen just playing mind games no doubt sammy just ended this [Applause] oh my god unbelievable kick out at one unbelievable more like inhuman listen that should have ended things and look at his face at this point you have to believe he's losing some faith in himself this is what you call high risk sami zayn retaliates [Applause] [Music] roundhouse [Applause] hurry that's smart taking the one to catch your breath all over their opponent oh zane anticipated that hasn't wrangled [Applause] [Music] good oh zero the universal title challenger is taking it to kevin owens i know ko interrupted his match earlier but this is ridiculous owens was out here to face paragon not get ambushed [Applause] oh wwe universe the wait is over kevin owens is about to defend his controversial universal championship against a gritty challenger that's been climbing toward this moment since the money in the bank ladder match no more briefcases no more mind games just two toughest sales superstars who are willing to do anything to be the top dog in wwe yeah the wonder does owens have any more tricks up his sleeve and if he does does his opponent finally have an answer a flurry of brutality both wrists captured clearly waiting for that hold on it's roman reigns of course we can't get through this match without controversy it's par for the course with these three [Applause] it's nothing he hasn't been through before [Applause] stopping down kick great escape violence just a step ahead of owen's just sending a message there uh oh oh oh the wrong way up longer way down last ride [Applause] it was a difficult path to get here but certainly worth the reward let's not overlook the fact that roman reigns played a role in all this and was still never pinned for that title i have a feeling this is far from settled and this tag team match is sure to be filled with exciting action these teams want the win bad tonight and they'll fight hard to get it yeah these superstars look like they're all business not a weak link among them this is surprising byron yeah i think he was just looking to soften him up a little here oh just turn that around reversal after reversal these two are ready for each other looks like he has other plans here producing a trampoline get a kick he may be in a bad way here and yeah it's about time to heavily consider tagging in that partner and there's the tag roman reigns into the ring looking for a little bit of high risk here it seems snapping the neck stiff kick and sammy dodges that one driver wow shot to the back of the neck and sammy is that looked countered there's a tag he deflects it right back kick to the gun oh brutal four from the middle ropes the tables there firing on all cylinders he's been placed in the corner him now right there [Applause] i can't wait to see them finally settle their issues over the universal championship alongside ko in that huge triple threat match looks like they might get started early right now and the tribal chief just brushed aside the universal champion we'll see if that lack of respect serves to motivate the champ oh oh yeah i liked it this is always a match with enormous implications for the landscape for the entire wwe this capacity crowd is waiting with faded breath the universal championship it doesn't get this after months of shocking twists and turns the universal championship will finally be decided once and for all and a triple threat championship match that will have reverberations throughout the wwe universe the defending universal champion comes into this match fueled by what he saw as an act of disrespect by the tribal chief roman reigns roman was trying to get into the champs head before one of the biggest matches of his career and it clearly worked will it be enough to have an impact on who walks away champion we're about to find out able to evade it let him have this moment he's earned it [Applause] ripcord the challenger eating up some damage double the opponents means double the danger he better have a plan getting tossed oh look at that torch of their opponents oh this isn't gonna be good oh man [Applause] oh man harsh kick devastating kick samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian oh jump kick finds the spot wow both wrists captured at the mercy of his opponent owens just can't find any breeding oh my god what a shocker able to somehow power out it too the title's going nowhere kiss your dreams good night and look at the disbelief on the face of the champ they both know what's at stake neither competitor is going to lose easy here the next big move might end this question is who has the stamina left [Applause] left by the turnbuckles [Applause] [Applause] [Music] punches gotta find a way to get out of this [Applause] and back in the ring we go with the torture [Applause] look at him totally fighting with the wwe universe right now and the match continues that's teamwork with a championship on the line [Applause] now a pen for the championship [Applause] our universal champion has successfully defended his title against ko and roman reigns in this triple threat match there were a lot of questions about our champion but he just answered every one of them i know i was one of those who had doubts but this performance was truly impressive me [Music] saw your little back and forth with edge on social media and it gave me an idea i think the two of you would have an amazing match so if you can defeat sheamus tonight then your next universal championship defense will be against edge so your buddy just posts that he wants a universal title match and boom he gets one i know you helped train edge for his comeback and in return he got you the gm job but i didn't realize that meant you had to do whatever he wanted whenever he asked funny i had it all wrong i guess he's your daddy look as far as edge goes it's no secret that we've helped each other out but this has nothing to do with that he's earned this opportunity and like i said i think it'd be a great match okay keep telling yourself all that to justify what you're doing if i were you i'd focus on taking care of sheamus first or none of this will even matter don't worry i'll handle my business with sheamus and you'll get your little dream match then i'll beat your bff too introducing the universal champion has his hands full tonight with a title defense against the hungry sheamus who's looking to prove himself against wwe's top dog it's a heck of a match-up between two superstars at the peak of their game but it feels like there's been more talk about our gm's meddling than the actual match too much talk if you ask me and i think the celtic warrior would agree that's why it's time for everyone to strap on their big boy boots and settle this thing in the ring the is looking shaken taking on some offense do you expect it as much headed to the top row just in time and a kick [Applause] close so close sheamus left an opening a championship level move taps out got it and the champ adds to their legacy here is your winner i took care of sheamus like i said i would and now your boy has his title match happy actually i am like i said i think it's gonna be a great match and something the smackdown audience will really enjoy yeah definitely this has nothing to do with the fact that you wouldn't have your job if it wasn't for edge i mean what else would you do if he asked you might as well just cut out the middleman and make edge gm he's already calling all the shots i'll say it one more time this is about giving the wwe universe the best available match nothing else don't push me on this okay if that's what it's all about then why make the wwe universe wait to see me face edge we should just give it to them tonight right because that would be yet another totally fair and unbiased decision for you to make you know what finally i agree with you go get some rest because you're going to defend your universal title again tonight against edge are you serious i was just trying to make a point and i just made mine i told you not to push me on this but you didn't listen now go get ready for your match [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's time for our second universal championship match of the night the universal champion will defend his title again against edge this superstar picking up speed wrecking ball drop kick through the ropes just a devil may care attitude on full display going for bro the champ looking worn out the hits have come fast and hard tonight you can tell some real damage has been done already [Applause] reversal can he take advantage now that'll do some serious damage oh foot just stomping down edge gets out of the way just one step ahead the universal champion and edge are going back and forth here in this huge title match the referee goes down and now edge is taking out two the universal champions known for bending the rules will he take advantage there's your answer he's competed twice tonight he's just evening up the odds and it's our gm adam pierce of course he's out here to help his friend edge that's the only reason edge got this opportunity in the first place he's just trying to restore some order to the match wait a second spear edge nails the champion with the spear the referee is still down adam pierce is going to cut the pin he did it overcoming adversity yet again edge is the new universal champion unbelievable let's not gloss over the real story here the general manager of smackdown just abused his power to help his friends steal the universal championship i'm not so sure about that but i will admit this victory did occur with some level of controversy if i know our now former champion like i think i do he's not gonna sit back and accept this without putting up a fight [Applause] look i could just approach this like some kind of farewell tour a chance to show my girls what their dad looks like with a championship around his waist a chance to stroke my own ego one more time and a chance to remind all of you of a different era when this sort of thing was typical almost expected but i'm here to say that's exactly not what i'm gonna do i've heard all the critics like the former champion himself that i was handed this universal championship that somehow because of my friendship with the gm that i got special treatment and this was basically gifted to me so with that in mind i'm gonna do everything in my power even if it ends up costing me this very title to prove the critics wrong i'm gonna be a fighting champion and earn everything i get i'm gonna do that by issuing an open challenge to anyone in that locker room to face me for this championship and the open challenge begins right now so who's ready to come out and face me come on let's see what this locker room is made of what's going on here that's what's going on the former universal champion appears to have cut to the front of the line [Applause] not what you were expecting huh edge well i wasn't expecting to lose my universal championship after your bff here conspired to have me compete twice in one night interfered in the match and then pretended to be a referee and illegally counted the pin basically handing you the title himself but special treatment is the only kind of treatment you've received since you came back to wwe isn't it i don't know what you're doing but leave adam out of this no you don't get to talk now this is my time like i was saying the special treatment started when you just waltzed into the royal rumble after being gone for eight years no qualifying match needed then there were the wrestlemania matches the wwe network specials all the tv time you took from superstars like myself but worst of all you were so insecure that you couldn't hang with today's generation that you had adam pierce hired as gm to give you the easiest possible path to success and it worked what do you want i want to put an end to all of this and i want my title back so give me a rematch on my terms or i'll take out your buddy here well worse than i already have fine i'll take you on whenever and however you want just let him go smart decision now run back to your bff at least it looks like this is over with for now [Applause] this is crossing the line here comes edge that just showed you exactly the type of person the former universal champion is as soon as edge was going to confront him face to face he ran away as fast as he could that might be true but the damage was done he got what he wanted here tonight the following contest is an extreme rules match and is for the wwe universal championship gentlemen i think a fight buckle up folks because you are about to witness universal champion edge face off against a man that will stop at nothing to get his title back the challenger made it clear that he wants to send edge back into retirement if i remain in my focus on just winning the match otherwise he'll be gone from smackdown if the challenger can win and hang on to his roster spot he'll deliver a powerful message to our general manager and the entire wwe universe titles are won not gifted and he's able to reverse it's reverse pain for that mistake i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the longer way last ride [Applause] the champ looking out of sorts part of the territory when you're in an extreme rules match cole driving the face down and edge is coming under duress edge's defenses are being mowed down that's gonna be it got the shoulder up just at the last minute at two and a half he kicked out the champion he has defeated edge and regain the universal title his victory also means he's not going anywhere in fact i have a feeling he'll be dominating smackdown for a very long time as scary as that sounds i think you're right cory the smackdown roster has officially been put on notice this guy is the real deal the following and here we have a superstar with a big chip on his shoulder he has certainly felt overlooked recently well he has a chance to change that perception in this matchup and he's facing off against ray mysterio a competitor who is known for the fight with a lot of heart you find out real quick that ray is tough to keep down the stereo shows no fear and has a larger shadow than his stature would determine but there are a lot of people in the locker room who wanted to be the one to say i brought down the biggest little man in wwe uncorks a thunderous chop oh producing [Applause] scouted looking for a high-risk move mysterio with great evasion [Applause] i think we know what's coming next two three [Applause] holy moly how oh you can tell he's feeling it now this fight is pumping him up samoan drop byron oh no that's gotta be it two-count and this one is over here is your winner wait a second you got to be kidding me is this what i think it is we saw him invoke eddie guerrero's name on social media and ray mysterio was not pleased but this is way worse yeah this must be what he meant when he said he was going to visit the wwe archives what a disgrace him coming out here and eddie's low rider wasn't enough now he's copying his mannerisms this is pathetic i know we're supposed to be impartial but i hope rey mysterio or anyone for that matter makes him pay for this well he's certainly going to get under the skin of mysterio even further than he already has we'll have to see how that plays out this could motivate ray and completely backfire on him hey i'm with byron i hope that's exactly what happens i can't watch any more of this gentlemen you were looking at a man who was sick of the doubters sick of being questioned about his potential and i can't disagree with him i expect tonight to be a night where he could silence the skeptics and prove to be the future of this company it will be a tall order but the confidence he possesses could take him very far but let's not overlook his competition chad gaber this is a former olympic athlete we're talking about gable devastates his opponents with his unmatched athletic ability in his cunning in-ring tactics in fact i've heard rumors that the guy can dribble a bowling ball he's that talented i have to respect what gable can do in the ring those tactics you and the former olympian gable took a big hit there he planned for this it could still he rally clear of contact flipped upside down there unable to counter look at this going counter for counter both superstars showing great awareness of their opponent's repertoire did you hear that impact on the second row out of the corner oh good night what a stunner cover one two [Applause] perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this win an absolute statement by the victor here tonight what a steamrolling this man has done some vile things but stealing eddie guerrero's low rider to taunt rey mysterio might just be the worst mysterio from behind he's not going to let him disrespect eddie any further this is a no disqualification match anything someone can dream up to do to their opponent is legal take the rules and throw them out the window well this allows a superstar to pursue victory by any means necessary and some experience a state of twisted ecstasy while punishing their adversary we are witnessing an environment where competitors can embrace their anger and aggressive instincts because it's all legal i'm glad you're done believing in fairy tales saxton the hero doesn't always win sometimes you have to embrace the darkness oh my gosh what impact oh man saw it coming and got out of there and he had ray's number there race all that coming [Applause] well-executed suplex oh [Music] mysterio with the sunset flip powerbomb go right to the kidneys golly he knows how to avoid contact dropkick scouted each superstar trying to stay a step ahead and landing with the double axe handle mysterio ducks hit right into the low rider that'll hurt ray's setting up for something big bulldog off eddie's car he just hit hard on the pavement we might need some help [Music] eddie guerrero latino heat gonna make him pay for everything he's done what's going on here it looks like we have a communication breakdown backstage and oh my god there they go good contact oh no it's the hawaiian drop oh now trampling the opposition oh look at this oh kicks oh man good grief turn your lights out an agile escape oh not to the belly he eludes the contact oh what a knee lift somebody better check his nose turning the tables saw that one coming down down by the ddt kick able to give him the slip yes he didn't come here to watch him boast in taunt i don't know how much more he could take guys what's eddie doing he's on top of the ambulance guerrero with the frog splash what a convincing statement made here tonight [Music] yeah it was almost as if he was channeling his friend eddie guerrero in this fight there was no way ray was gonna let this level of disrespect fly hopefully that's the last time we see eddie or his load rider dragged into this here we go rey mysterio's coming into this best two out of three falls match tonight as fired up as i've ever seen him byron of course he is ray's opponent has been trying to low ride eddie guerrero's memory into the ground and there is no way ray would stand for that meanwhile ray's challenger looks like he's having trouble standing at all must have been that tough dose of reality he got from mysterio last week well he better get it together fast before it's too late good defense [Applause] yeah this is not good you don't save saxton he reverses it really just laying it in kick lands the next one's at the kick ball kick connects ooh [Applause] getting that shoulder up now is huge [Applause] mysterio defends us here mysterio felt that and i think he's done and there he goes he's tapping late in the match he scores a fall great athleticism the longer this match goes [Applause] here is your winner so so so [Applause] look out from behind sheamus just blindsided king corbin's scheduled opponent this is broken out into a battle of kings and only one king is going to bend the knee [Applause] this match is underway as king booker and smackdown's reigning king of the ring take on king quarterback sheamus in a battle to determine smackdown's one true king it's a full house of kings here on smackdown the full house is actually when you know what never mind saxon you want to play poker after the show hey that sounds great thanks corey solid contact there my goodness he's got the answer for that one baron corbin gets the tag [Applause] gets the tag good golly what a need now he's been put on the defensive yeah even though he's still got a lot of fight in him you might want to make a tag now and not risk taking off from the ropes attempting high-risk move after high-risk move at a breakneck pace vegas anticipated that one return fire on the celtic warrior right to the ribs or targeting the stomach punch connects you're stomping down oh oh [Applause] he's tagging out oh the hard impact in the corner oh torturous knee [Applause] this is [Applause] here he goes [Applause] [Music] this could [Applause] here are you no disqualification no count outs we're guaranteed to see a train load of carnage before this one is through yeah this is the type of match where grudges get even uglier you never know who or what will come out of the woodwork in a battle like this that's when some outside interference becomes a factor we all know that wwe superstars never forget a grudge and bypasses the pinfall we'll need to get a little more to put this one away [Applause] the damage he's taken is starting to pile up it's nothing he hasn't been through before big kick devastating kick big knee to the midsection boom and all momentum has been taken from corbin corbin might just be waiting for an opportune time pierson strike really just laying it in strikes with a kick sliding elbow looking for the victory and that's all she wrote here is your winner so this match is underway as the intercontinental champion defends his title against an always confident superstar in riddle confident on social media sure but let's see if you can back it up in the ring tonight uh believe it or not i actually approve corey if we don't think social media is the path to an intercontinental championship he still has a long way to grow in wwe oh solid contact there situation for riddle driven face first he takes control a series of reversals wow springboard attack stopping down getting sucked well-placed kick riddle reverses throw to sleep and now riddle with a german suplex wait is that goldberg spear spear what the hell is happening i have no idea [Applause] with the jackhammer i'm trying to process what happened here riddle looked to be on his way to potentially winning the intercontinental championship and then goldberg came out of nowhere leading to a no contest i'm with you byron this was completely unexpected it doesn't look like it was a surprise to the champion goldberg and riddle do have some history with each other maybe that led to the champion giving goldberg the opportunity to finally get some payback here tonight we'll have to wait to find out how and why this all transpired but in the meantime the intercontinental champion will be leaving here tonight with his gold intact plenty of battles waged over the intercontinental championship over the years between legends and absolute titans of this business this match could easily be history in the making following wow producing a trampoline [Music] making that shoulder vulnerable [Applause] the challenger's looking shaken and triple threats the damage comes twice as fast he knew that coming in that kick will stop you in your tracks he's staring his opponent down getting into that zone oh big height on that move nice takedown oh look at this oh kicks [Applause] it's okay they weren't that pretty anyway he steps foot in the ring again painful attack focused on the chest the celtic warriors chances are waning yeah shane this is getting beaten down catching a dropkick challenger here's the pen tunnel on the line here we go that could have been it right there riddle turns that around excellent opportunity for riddle to shift the momentum if riley was looking for an opportunity to pull the 180 that could be is makes a here is your winner and still the wwe intercontinental champion sub zero scorpion smoke what a tremendous separate from all three superstars involved in this hard-hitting triple threat we knew these three would put on a show but i do not think anyone predicted just how intense this match would be i think one man did and it's the one currently celebrating his win uh there's been a lot of outside noise surrounding the bitter rivalry between riddle and the intercontinental champion but that all ends tonight in an empty arena steel cage match for the championship no more sheamus no more orton no more goldberg just the two superstars who started this mess riddle versus the champ and no more brutal media saxton it's time to settle this in the ring that was good corey can't quite get him there first one second one didn't effective launching himself from the ropes well measured able to avoid any harm there these two showing how well scouted they each are ah that'll fillet your chest riddle is waning a bit now i think this riddle is almost solved nice evasion by riddle back and forth from these competitors double axe handle hit the mark with that one tick yeah he manages to escape it riddle looking vulnerable the stf the stf is locked in but champions need to finish the job [Applause] and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner get ready for the world premiere of elias's brand new song [Applause] [Music] hello i am elias and i am the man who where did he come from i don't know but thank you these two had an issue on social media about this song that must be what this is all about you're one of my stupid songs about me huh this is what happens no one's ever gonna hear it now i'm setting you up for good you're never going to sing again it's one thing to take issue with a song lyric but that crossed the line i agree michael maybe you're right but hey at least we didn't have to hear elias sing yeah we might not again for quite some time [Applause] the voice of smackdown may have been temporarily silenced but elias won't go down quietly as he takes on the superstar responsible for the ruthless attack oh the voice of smackdown i thought that was you michael very observant myron is anybody actually upset that elias can't sing right now elias's opponent should be considered a hero he's feeling the effects of that last hit oh what measured strike uh stopping away oh kick finds it boom stinging you kick that propelled through the air and elias is on the downside of things right now elias needs to figure things out quick he must have had that scouted it's the drop kick and elias reverses it good timing with that reversal and another counter oh right to the kidneys stops the kick knee right in the face going for the home run allows eliza's eyes look grazed over it's over a nice work here is your winner ever since elias was first attacked on smackdown the war of words with his assailant has only intensified all leading to tonight's no disqualification climax i believe the musical term is a crescendo pole and the volume will be turned up all the way as both superstars look to have their last work if you ask me eliza's opponent will be the one singing the blues after this encounter he turns it around ouch that's a chop that'll wake you up [Music] springboard roundhouse good night [Applause] oh my inflicting pain at will [Applause] oh costly error there he's absorbed some damage already he planned for this it could still rally with reckless abandon stomping out elias spends that off and responds with a counter of their own unpacks a well-placed punch elias with the retaliation look at this going counterfeit oh man a little extra leicester behind that kick a sharp kick answering back gets him with the counter [Applause] here is your winner [Music] the wwe tag team division is more competitive than ever as these two teams get into it i can almost guarantee this match will be one to remember the standards for tag team action just keep getting higher and higher around here what a roundhouse king oh [Applause] teammate in right now not that he can't fend for himself right now oh my god jimmy's looking helpless to every attack yeah jimmy keeps getting cut down at every move he's praising for it i can't prepare your face for that he may get the three count right here i think so two three four [Applause] here [Music] hmm i don't think i've had the chance to tell you this but i actually see a lot of potential in you in fact you kind of remind me of myself highly athletic super likable intercontinental champion former in my case you just need that extra push to get you to the next level thanks no problem and in fact since we're so compatible i think i could actually help you make that leap so what do you say i wasn't really looking for help but i guess i'm willing to give it a shot great from now on i'll be at ringside for all your matches to assist you as needed okay but i really just want you out there in a coach type role nothing hands-on if you know what i mean of course say no more totally understand i really feel like this is the start of something special see you out there tonight the wwe universe gets its first glimpse of what could be a powerful new alliance on smackdown between the intercontinental champion and his new mentor of sorts sami zayn with sammy watching at ringside the intercontinental champion defends his title against the always dangerous chad david the intercontinental champ clearly has his eyes set on the future but he'll be in serious trouble if he overlooks gable here tonight now trampling the opposition he knew that was coming yeah great job refocusing to reverse that able to get [Applause] he avoids the damage able to get the advantage here slips out of the way nailed the midsection uh oh ankle pick beautiful takedown knee crusher that's gonna hurt [Applause] just punched him right in the mouth relentless enough already finds its mark [Applause] and he's going for the pin here wraps the arm reference hey he just put his foot on the bottom row and the official never saw it [Music] [Applause] finds a counter for gable [Applause] here is your winner that was amazing i mean i thought you were talented before but seeing you up close made me realize just how special you really are yeah that was a nice win but what was up with you breaking up that pin i thought we had an agreement that you were just out there to observe nothing hands on that was blatant cheating whoa whoa no need to throw around the seaward like that look i only did what i did as a last resort you were going to lose your intercontinental championship and besides you would have done the exact same thing we're pretty much the same person remember i'm starting to have my doubts about that and what you did wasn't necessary i was going to kick out we can go back and watch a tape i'm not so sure you had things under control yeah well i'm not so sure i can trust you where is this coming from you won the match and you're still champion we have a good thing going don't ruin it and i promise i have nothing but the best intentions for you i don't know look i have an idea how we can erase your doubts and help strengthen our bond a bit next week we're gonna team up together okay sound good yeah sounds good taking it old school tonight with a little two on two tag team action doesn't get any more classic than this you truly get the best of both worlds and sometimes pairings you really didn't see coming hey kind of like you and me corey i would very much like to be excluded from this narrative sexton able to interrupt the attack and misses on the springboard great wherewithal on the counter he's lost some of his win now right now he's thinking one of two things i need to get out of here or i'm gonna answer this call and pick it back oh caterpillar on the opponent connects taking a chance one more time and landing with incredible impact is that what it takes to beat gable oh sweet sweet victory another huge win see what did i tell you from the beginning when we're working together no one can stop us that was definitely a nice win but there was one thing that bothered me here we go again now what well it just seemed like you're insisting on getting the win out there it just made me think like maybe this isn't so much about helping me as it is about advancing your own career maybe i got caught up in the moment but it's a tag team match emphasis on team it doesn't matter who wins as long as we win right yeah no you're right i guess anyway enough about that i've got something super cool lined up for you next week part of you reaching the next level is being able to beat opponents you're not familiar with so that's why i got this mass guy el ordinario coming in to face you he can really go from what i've heard so make sure you bring your a game okay sounds interesting oh and there's one other thing i can't believe i almost forgot to tell you this i'm actually getting my wisdom teeth out next week so i won't be out there in your corner you'll have to face ordinario on your own but don't worry you'll be fine sure right this isn't weird at all weird it's a totally normal sequence of events you got this oh i me hot off two wins with his new mentor sami zayn by his side the intercontinental champion will go it alone tonight against a fresh face on smackdown or at least a fresh mask michael because there are rumors buzzing throughout the wwe universe that the face under the mask might not be so fresh at all it does seem like an odd time for sami to get his wisdom teeth out but who are we to question the wisdom of a veteran superstar like sami zayn evading offense oh the challenger eating up some damage taking on some offense but he expected as much producing a trampoline and he said he did not get me with that this time oh that'll turn your skin red this snap suplex [Applause] look at this wait a minute is that sami zayn well now i'm very confused who's under the mask it's el ordinario i told you not to question sami zayn's honesty saxton [Applause] for the win to retain the championship one breaks the count getting dangerously close to ending it all there just sending a message there saw that one coming took advantage reciprocated [Applause] he reverses it and that one's scouted ddt just [Applause] here is your winner [Music] hey big win over el ordinario you really stepped up and answered the challenge thanks but i thought you weren't going to be here this week what happened with your wisdom teeth oh i actually recovered much quicker than i thought i would and decided last minute to come support you i barely made it in time which is why i came out in the middle of the match i know you haven't approved of all my methods so i hope that was okay no it was and if we're being honest i actually have something to tell you i kind of thought maybe this whole thing with the unknown opponent and your wisdom teeth seemed a little shady and this is crazy but i thought you were going to be under the mask oh really it just got me thinking that this was all some big scheme to try to take my intercontinental title and now i feel terrible i never really gave you a fair chance no no it's okay and don't feel bad i've definitely done some shady things before so i can see why you'd think all that sorry stop it's okay let's just get past this all right i'll be back in your corner next week and we'll pretend like nothing ever happened you've got enough to worry about with defending your title and you don't need any other distractions okay thanks you're right sounds good the intercontinental championship held by over a dozen wwe hall of famers the likes of stone cold steve austin shawn michaels well that title symbolizes the workhorse of wwe we'll certainly have the history of being the largest stepping stone any individual can climb knowing to put superstars on the map all facts that these men know very well saw that one coming looking worse for where in the corner now oh really just laying it in he's able to fend off the attack oh man right across the chest shifts [Applause] he'll be in a good position [Music] elias is being carefully measured now [Applause] yet another successful title defense for the intercontinental champion you have to give credit to sami zayn it's no coincidence the ic champ has been on a roll since he aligned with sammy [Applause] what was that all about i have no idea [Applause] why should i be a good person and try to help you if you won't even give me a chance huh answer me there's no point to any of this from now on i'll just be what you and everyone else thinks i am a shady liar a chief and the man who is going to take your title wow in a matter of seconds everything just changed for the intercontinental champion did i say the champion was on a roll with sammy yeah i meant collision course how quickly the tables have turned here on smackdown as the intercontinental champion defends his title against his former mentor sami zayn i hate to say i told you so but sami zayn has proven time and time again that he's only looking out for one superstar and that's sami zayn the ic champ should have just trusted his mentor am i the only one who thinks sammy's right here yes yes you are oh man the challenger is looking shaky he had to be prepared to take some damage tonight he foiled that attempt yeah good contact here is your winner intercontinental champion may be a week older but he doesn't appear to be a week wiser after giving sami zayn yet another opportunity to compete for his ic title wisdom has certainly become a part of his story after sami zayn claimed his slow healing wisdom teeth coming back last week his loss all i'll say is this it's nice to see both of these superstars finally at full strength and ready to compete for the intercontinental championship on an even playing field consecutive high risk maneuvers and the pace of this match has certainly picked up and a kick stopping down ah perfect kick oh wow that kick will stop me in your tracks strikes with a kick he must have seen that coming placing them right where they want them into the corner counters this could be an opportunity is it enough there's two breaks to count it too he's still in the fight but for how much longer [Applause] and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner we i have an interesting offer for you if you'll just hear me out okay i'm intrigued as you know bobby lashley and i are wwe's top power couple and after careful consideration we've decided to expand our influence by becoming a power trio a power trio huh and you're considering me yes and don't get any ideas about the two of us your role would be strictly business my relationship with bobby outside the ring is rock solid it's simply a way for the three of us to team up and use our combined talents to get ahead in wwe and you want to answer right now yes there's no room for indecisiveness in this situation we want someone on our side who knows what they want you know what i've been looking for a change of pace so what the hell why not all right our power trio is complete okay the plan is to ease into things by working on our chemistry together so you're going to team up with bobby with me in your corner and we'll see how that goes sure let's do this here we get our first look at a new alliance looking to make waves on smackdown it's bobby lashley dana brooke and the newest member of their so-called power trio or in action you know why consider us a power trio too no way in absolutely no way yeah i'm gonna pass on that too anyway let's find out how the new group fares against lindsay dorado and grandma delete he's getting a little badder now if he's smarter like attack soon a break on the apron could help him mitigate this damage [Applause] connects great counter slam with authority tombstone and route right now i just don't know what it's going to take that's a pretty big win here are you tag team action underway truly one of the hallmarks of sports entertainment that's right as a former tag team champion myself i have to say these matches hold a special place in my heart that was disastrous launching himself from the ropes shredding all over their opponent he saw it coming taking advantage a big splash what are we going to see here one neckbreaker that one fails to land here he comes off the tag he goes a perfectly placed target using the ropes kick a series of reversals heading up top thinking big this is no time to hesitate you can feel the end coming [Applause] kofi needs to stay positive oh god he could pin his opponent right here the victory tonight here are your winners sub-zero oh tonight the object of dana brooks affections has decided to go his own way in a single switch perhaps to let things cool off with an out former allied bobby lashley funny story accidentally posted what was supposed to be a dm once too no one cares saxton let's go with the match tied up between the ropes it's about to get worse look at these knee strikes [Applause] it's bobby lashley lashley said his now former ally was going to pay for breaking up their power trio and he's delivering on his promise [Applause] ah that got turned around on metal league really just laying it in strong goodness solid connection he's starting to struggle here and hanging tough but beginning to show some wear and tear this match is getting pushed beyond the normal limits that's a good way to make this is it i understand the sentiment but now is not the time to bask in disbelief [Applause] really had less than a second to stay alive there mentally game on the counter big oh my lord kick to the midsection and this match will head back to the right spring [Applause] he's doing a whole lot of gesturing and it could cost him [Applause] he's certainly lining him up but he's wasting too much time [Applause] just mounted with punches oh a nasty stop to finish it off he takes control [Applause] kick here is your winner what started his strictly business has turned into anything but his bobby lashley will take on a smackdown superstar that's being accused of breaking dana brooks heart whether he broke dana brooks hard or broke his power trio contract it's clear that this relationship is broken beyond repair and with this much strength in the ring tonight those might not be the only things that end up getting broken tonight big kick dana brooke is here but whose side is she on considering one of these superstars pretty much just dumped her on social media i think it's safe to say she's siding with lashley [Applause] trying to catch him off guard with that attempt and out of the ring he goes [Applause] taking a trip outside but he's got to be mindful of the count oh and that buys some time catches the kick oh and now he's giving you all another chance to simply take it all in great reversal that'll rearrange the spines impact [Applause] knew what was coming there quick exchange of counters there he's returning fire connecting on the ddt lassie is unable to stop any attack bob is being taken away well placed kick devastating kick his opponent is just overwhelming him here at this point here is your winner me me [Music] don't know if you heard but there's a superstar shakeup coming up how do you think that's going to turn out for me that's up to you since you're a main inventor here on smackdown you have the option to be protected from switching brands or you could choose to be eligible anything else i should know there's a stipulation saying that any champions who go to another brand will be forced to vacate their titles that pretty much covers it i think a potential change of scenery sounds good put me in the shake up all right all superstars participating in the shake up must compete this week so the other gm's can see them in action so what do you have lined up for me william regal from nxt has mentioned he'd like to see you in a singles match while mandy rose said she'd like to see how you work as part of a team so basically which gm do you want to cater i'd rather impress mandy rose to better my chances of going to raw so put me in the tag match done and if this is it well it's been quite the ride a short hat what a night here on smackdown you can almost feel the balance of power shifting with the superstar shake up right around the corner that's right this could be the final match on smackdown for some very high profile superstars and nobody knows that better than all of our general managers who are watching the action very closely driver no he lets him out curious decision there michael oh foot just stomping down orton needs to return to his instincts oh bruising attack to the body and that one misses yeah he's gotta dig deep and find another win if he wants to stay in this randy orton is slipping but he still might have it oh somehow orton is down and he's just picking him apart now he picks up the win here [Music] you
