should see the other guy never killed nobody before what you did back there you really are all gray said you'd be 47. he didn't suffer did he he made it count [Music] bruce but not broken i'm glad it's time we start afresh you and me get to the point you and your friends pulled off the impossible you stormed the heavens took down the untouchables and yet here we are status quo it just goes to show you can't fight power miss burnwood power never dies it only changes hands the best you can do is claim it i never cared about power power is a tool miss burnwood it's the thing that gets you to the thing as the next constant you can be the agent of change transform the system from the inside will be transformed by it no risk no reward i'll need to think about it no you won't the real question is what will you bring to the table [Music] look closer i'm telling you the file is trash the constant doesn't so much burn his bridges as blow them up arthur edwards whoever he was don't exist anymore his personal data somehow deletes itself from any system that records him way beyond advanced the partners spared no expense to make sure their controller would be untraceable how untraceable look i did what you asked but gray's gone and i know diana i'm not who you need right now you gotta be kidding me ica i used every encryption known to men who are these guys the best it's only a matter of time before they get lucky we need to take them down you and which army i know where the agency stores its files mission reports client data if we leak it to the public you want to whistle blow the ica it's the path of least resistance turns out you are who i need right now olivia i do this and i'm out so what are we breaking into data facility in chunking china run by a man called hush of course the ica site in chongqing houses the agency's data storage and analyst division needless to say security is daunting the state-of-the-art server vault is biometrically wired to the facilities to overseers image and royce behavioral analysis pioneer and hush a data security guru with a taste for fringe transhuman experimentation tell me about hush a former cyber terrorist for the ministry of state security in kedan yang who fled his country after one of the po regime's periodic purges he made a career doing cyber security for dark web deplorables human traffickers organ harvesters scum like him with no code or conscience ica sure can pick him no offense can you disable security a dual authentication protocol ensures that any handling of data must be directly authorized by hush and royce the proverbial human factor device make the system impenetrable luckily i found a loophole if both overseers should unexpectedly die within a short space of time the system reverts to a temporary felsafe protocol which i can bypass take them off the board and you'll have free access to the data core and i'll handle the rest and you're sure it'll work look i know hush if i'm wrong we won't live long enough to regret it all right i will leave you to prepare [Music] you
