compete I'll tell you sad this psycho is a complete whack job you know when he came out of the womb this guy literally choked out the doctor with his own umbilical cord is that [ __ ] sick I'll be ringside keeping Luchadors off your ass while you finish Kilbane good luck man well there it is Bobby the Saints receiving no love here not at all it is raining hate down where they are and of course

bar contenders seem to be out for blood Cuba isn't bowing down in the puss or anytime soon but the celebrity of the streets isn't making it easy on Kilrain there seems to be something more going on
