helping me out back there i thought my time was up it's not anything you wouldn't do for me i know but when you come that close to biting it christ it's something don't need to tell me about that just don't think about it best lesson i could ever teach you don't think about anything jesus christ tommy you're confessing to a shootout in a church and i ain't even do the hard stuff yet you know i could take you in right now put your buying bars until you're old and gray maybe if you think you could make any of it stick but then you'd never know about marilla hey fellas thought i'd keep you waiting my shift just started what you having two lunch vessels please and more coffee you know what let's bring the whole pot all right we've come this far together what kind of heat did you get from the church that's a strange thing nothing really came of it all always figured salieri paid off someone somewhere because it wasn't even in the papers we just had to lay low for seven eight months the cops kept showing up at the bar just to remind us they were watching and frank caught wind that morello was helping golotti get reelected hoping he'd go after the done where i covered some account books from royale's offices 33 was pretty good year for him bastard no we will believe not before we did while we were busy keeping our heads down he started moving in on our rackets quiet at first a few trucks go missing uh top burner has one too many high balls drives off a bridge one of a regular pickup suddenly closes up shop moves upstate and he didn't catch on not me i think maybe paulie smelled something but even with the cops looking over our shoulders and morello's circling we were still making good money and with the dom worried about keeping the heat off we didn't have much to do except drink have a few laughs every time i went into sailiery's there was sarah so it was a good year until frank clary uh dan's consequence yeah that's right he set me straight he set us all straight there's a lot of buzz around town about you guys yeah we got into a little scrap last night it's no big deal i don't care about the bar fight tom i care how it looks when you walk into a club and buy everyone around uh we gotta do something though though then blow it at the track on sunday or take a dame to a show or invest it for christ's sake you want me to become one of those wall street boys don't sass me tommy i'm trying to teach you the ropes so you don't get strangled by them you ever have a dog tom sure a little mud when i was a kid when i was age of nine before i came
