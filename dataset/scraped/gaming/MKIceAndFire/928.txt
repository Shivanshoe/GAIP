hit a rough patch of ocean our boat trembled like a frozen skeleton we nearly broke to pieces but i was not afraid i was transfixed by the ship itself watching it bulge and he as men screamed around me i devised improvements to keep the hole solid and shapely i ever tell you all the story of how i killed an entire clan single-handedly with the broken hilt of a sword too often dog more times than any man can count have you heard me tell the tale of the six christian missionaries i lured away from their faith into the worship of almighty thor you showed them how to turn the crosses into hammers simply by flipping them over and they fainted with joy that tail yes yes indeed some years ago i took the sea with a sword dancer called alien a brooding warrior with a face of stone and oakhart arms
