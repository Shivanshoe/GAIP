you go sounds attracting them patroller let's clear them out there you go see a few more gotcha to left that's all of them usually more over this way if you want to keep [ __ ] okay where are they coming from hordes like to move through this area in winter they always end up leaving behind a few stragglers they do the same routes every year like a migration for something huh what's that about well when the barometric pressure reaches a certain temperature [ __ ] note check out this looks like they're moving downhill why hmm look up by the truck they're munching on that deer there guess they're hungry looks clear but there's some this way that's something by the ski lifts look way out there under those gondolas by that Tower you see your natural [ __ ] make sure to compensate for the bullet drop what you think you cut more out there just take your time you're really getting it I'm not seeing anymore yeah me neither all right let's head in see if Joel's back sure and her over hey thanks for that it's just what I needed sure ladies first I'm not supposed to say anything but Joel's worried about you there's there's nothing to worry about ma sure there isn't but if you don't talk

waiting okay let's go all right oh and me kiddo so you and Tommy across anything when yous out just a few we saw from the ridge you oh you know found two runners in the house Jesse tells me you're handling your own quite well on the group patrols he's even recommending you for paired patrol no I think you're still a bit young for it I'm a better shot than almost all of them and I have more experience than most of the new recruits do you think you're ready dad trust you okay thanks you just do me a favor and start with the shorter routes for now you know see how you handle them all right you remember those uh Savage starlight comic books a year into yeah Tommy and I found some when we were moving through that school the other day did you like him oh you know what it's not really my cup of tea but dr. daniela star means she's pretty she's a savage well when she does the captain Ryan and that death match yeah I mean he definitely deserved it but that was a nice twist how they escaped that way leave the horses here don't get into trouble there's that music store yeah I see it need a boost I got it uh I don't think we can go this way what damn used to be able to swim across this okay so now what well if you're up for it we can try cutting through that hotel I'm up for it damnit oh that might be something you think you can fit in there well that's worth a shot careful yep hold on looking well hello daddy you impressed no you're just too skinny you need to eat more you're welcome this place is giving me the creeps I think I see a way through but we got spores but you mask off do I have to it's just us what if we run into someone okay fine you gotta be smart about this you stopped wearing that mask kiddo and eventually you're gonna sleep up in front of someone you shouldn't I've never slipped you ain't told nobody do have you but Jesse Deena of course not okay good you ever been in here before no you just patrolling the streets feeling like a bit of an oversized baby I give a shout out a while back I did the last patrol go through here I'm sure listen Jackson them teenagers last year this was too old I just roamed in this way [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I think we did it gives you a few though yeah you too so what do you say we give up on those strings for today good I said it better myself I think our only route is food now it looks like you might be something [Music] [Music] ain't nothing so not asleep Oh shake off I want to get out of here what are you doing there's like tube loaders back there hey be fine spores are clear Oh quite the fight back there huh that often we get a bloater around these parts yeah Jesse and Deena are gonna lose their [ __ ] when they hear about this let's deal with them too anyway it ain't right on and off why no Jesse and I are just friends that's so keen with this one don't hold your breath you think you can squeeze through there see what it is yeah okay he's yeah he'd roll I think it's um a couple I ran away last year I think you're right Jackson is a wonderful place but we got tired of hearing the stories of people suffering everywhere else wanted to save lives we had good intentions we didn't make it an hour before running into a horde now we're bitten we've decided we're gonna end our lives instead of turning please tell our family and friends that were sorry with Adam in Sydney I shot her I can't take my own life I'm a [ __ ] coward Adam only they were immune right well it's let's go get Tommy and we can get these bodies back to Jackson after you took me out of the Firefly Hospital you said there were dozens of people like me yeah yeah that's what they told me I've never met another immune person before have you I could be hiding it you do do you believe that he's now really the time for this we traveled across the entire country to bring me to the fireflies I had so many questions for them why did you pull me out of there while I was still unconscious because I let them run their tests and when I saw that they were useless I got a semi how do you know they were useless maybe if he you just would have given them more time they could've figured something out there was no cure there's nothing that could help these people are anybody else I know you wish things were different I wish things were different but they ain't and we need get these kids back their families is there something less he like to rehash yeah to come on [Music] [Music] [Music] come on there's gotta be something why'd you all leave [Music] what is this Sammy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these people have left already I don't know which I was one of the ones that wanted to go after the smuggler and the girl they said even if we found her by some miracle found someone else that's immune and make no difference cuz the only person who could develop a vaccine is dead immune are you thinking hard enough in the middle of the night like that you talked to me you don't just leave me a goddamn mouth tell me what happened here if you lie to me one more time I'm gone you will never see me again but if you tell me the truth I'll go back to Jackson no matter what it is just say it Joel making a vaccine would have killed you so I stopped them [Music] don't you [ __ ] touch me [Music] I'll go back but we're done [Music] [Music] hands off

don't know but you do like her so stupid I have no idea what that girl's intentions are but but I do know that she would be lucky to have you you're such an [ __ ] I'm not trying to I was supposed to die in that hospital my life would have [ __ ] mattered but you took that from me if somehow the Lord gave me a second chance at that moment I would do it all over again yeah I just I don't think I can ever forgive you for that but I would like to try [Music] okay I'll see you around yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
