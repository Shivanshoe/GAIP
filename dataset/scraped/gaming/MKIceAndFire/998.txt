genius don't tell pim i said that or banner secret's safe with me you called me to your office yes though i am not an inhuman i am a purveyor of goodies gear and gadgets if you need anything to make you faster stronger or stretchier i'm your gal what do you get out of it being smarter than everybody else bring me the right materials and i'll build you gear to make aim weep i've already got some prototypes take a look cool cool look all you like i'm in awe i might be drooling can i help you with any of this stuff not right this minute but you could help pimsie with a little zinger check out the war table he'll fill you in more table it is maybe next time i think it's time to show aim what i can really do what do you think jarvis i think you can accomplish anything you set your mind to miss khan okay now that we've got some muscle on our side i think we should hit one of ames testing labs we know they've been experimenting on inhumans in small rural communities i'd like to get my hands on whatever research they've been collecting sounds good we crashed one of their big labs in the pacific northwest olympia archive impressive we wondered who was responsible for taking that place down thanks we didn't get out with a lot of information but now maybe we can find out more [Music] [Music] aim has been setting up bases in small towns throughout the rural west we suspect they've been using these as testing labs and capturing the local inhuman populace for their experiments i can't believe all this has been happening right under the government's nose well they have a lot of power in washington and financial connections to every major corporation amos had five years to set down their roots taking them down is not gonna be easy well we gotta start somewhere it's up to us to do the right thing spoken like another avenger i once knew welcome to venture ridge wyoming this was one of ames go-to holding sites for inhumans before the prison was built after they moved in most of the residents were evacuated got it keep an eye out for aim patrols it won't take kindly to your presence any luck will be able to capture intel that could shed some light on what they've been doing to your people i've marked the facility on your hud thank you for doing this least i can do you guys kept me going when things seemed hopeless just knowing the resistance was out there meant we had a chance the odds finally seemed to be tipping in our favor here we go inhuman spotted do you think we'll find something to prove aim is hurting in humans fame keeps their data well guarded we haven't been able to get anything solid just have the word of the inhumans and i'm afraid that's not enough one of our resistance allies is close by and could use some help do this on thank you avengers you're safe now so you've been building the resistance in secret all these years not intentionally at least not in the beginning a lot of us were captured by aim early on after we realized nobody was coming for us we broke out and started making our own plans watch your back let's get serious one of ames equipment storage units worth opening if you can activate the unlock sequence careful might be a trap there is a chest with gear close by huh you want to see all my weapons okay [Music] not hot [Music] okay uh there is an elite aim unit near you defeat them and you may gain something useful trouble ugh sweetheart hmm my huh uh look for a chest with gear nearby [Music] let's do this aim has initiated emergency procedures [Music] this place does not look like they welcome visitors i'm giving them a bad review you'll need to take out the security node [Music] if you destroy the two transformers on the other level yours should open um [Music] yes the flesh won't one down one to go [Music] that did it let's get in there so you were a prisoner too why'd they capture you if you aren't inhuman according to thompson anyone with powers is a threat they made sure i'll never use mine again although my physiology so if i change size i'll die i'm so sorry bad guys where to records show a secure lab at the end of this hallway let's get this party started [Music] hmm hmm oh better wow so i can do this [Music] whatever's in there is yours now [Music] huh where's the lab you sure this is the right place i've nearly breached ames network they're hiding something stand by and see to the aim forces oh they'll get seen too please work fast jarvis as fast as my processor allows sir one of their agents is down has been neutralized [Music] it seems to physically remove some kind of research samples from their experiments an automated transport ship is preparing for takeoff whatever's on that transport i want it captured get to it before it leaves i'm bypassing their security now stand by looks like we made it just in time get close to those terminals so i can infiltrate their network we must control all three to override the transports navigation systems be on guard aim will try to regain control of the terminals an aim unit took back control of an access point look out got some bad guys [Music] we just lost an access point return it to our control uh uh [Music] aim has regained control of a terminal please deal with this [Music] the transport should be arriving at the anthill within the hour excellent work everyone head back here and we'll begin digging through those aim research samples well that didn't go quite according to plan we've got some valuable research samples but aim is far more powerful than i had anticipated and they've got so many of my people we have to stop them agreed kamala but we need some time to regroup when tony gets here with the chimera we'll be in a much better position to go on the offensive okay but we can't wait too much longer okay head back to the anthill and we'll talk about next steps um it's mads can you swing by the lab real quick sure you were in san francisco bingo me and my sister both sister where is she rolling around here somewhere you'll know her when you see her need some help over here i need a favor okay here's what i need seriously you're the best you are a lifesaver hey you what's going on i heard what happened with the drop ship i just wanted to give you something maybe next time uh that does not sound good doctor has provided me with pertinent data from his official experiments fire powers that's intense hey are you okay fine cool powers i mean they look awesome um i'm a polymorph i think it's cool it's like like stretchy arms and stuff uh still working on making it not look goofy but you're inhuman yeah so what's your name dante come on hey what happened i broke my leg during the escape well at least you made it out right my mom came back for me yeah i made it out and she was captured well the avengers are on the way here in a couple days okay they're gonna take back the prison and your mom's gonna be [ __ ] a couple days why isn't anyone listening to me i overheard dr pim they're moving all the prisoners to a new location well ah they'll find that too no no they won't your avengers will be too late here let me help you no don't you get it we're inhuman no one cares about us not true i've got to tell bruce we could do something i've got to convince bruce and dr pim to go back to the prison roy i need you to send one of your disposable chassis to the camaro with a few supplies and roy stealth will be key right away doctor i'm gonna say it it's it's just genius hey got a sec yeah yeah yeah what's up ames moving the inhumans to a more secure location soon okay you've been talking to dante i'm sorry who who's dante one of our inhuman survivors we were able to get him out but his mother is still inside and our escape caused aim to shore up security gotcha look we have to help them that's not a good idea what there's inhumans in there i don't understand dante's mom we can't just sit around and do nothing we're not gonna sit around do nothing okay roy just left with the energy cores it means tony's gonna be here in less than a day we need to wait i don't understand we have the hulk the resistance has been trying to infiltrate that facility for months getting out was far easier than getting in and we we had help from the ground its walls are nearly impenetrable you saw what we did back there i could help but it's too risky you want to help you stand you're not inhuman you're not ready i'm sorry we wait you
