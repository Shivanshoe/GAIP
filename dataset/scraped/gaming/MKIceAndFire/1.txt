just do what you haven't done i always do sam i always do the thing you have to understand is this the sam fisher you knew is dead america killed him asked him to make one sacrifice too many cross one line too far a drunk driver killed him some anonymous [ __ ] who ran down his daughter and vanished she was the one thing in his life that humanized him and his agency killed him set him up turned him loose and told him to pull the trigger on his best friend in a dirty new york city basement irving lambert died by sam's hand that day and so did sam so he left left third echelon left the life he knew left america and mom and apple pie left it all behind he hopped off the grid and went walkabout looking for a reason to go on living eventually he found it he caught a whisper in the wind that maybe his daughter's death hadn't been an accident he heard a name and he found somewhere to go looking a city called valletta it's in malta excuse me sir yes phone call for you please accept these compliments of your call sam who is this how'd you find me give me a little credit sam don't tell me you don't recognize my voice even after all this time graham what do you want to save your life we

the light for me please come on sweetie there's nothing to be afraid of in the dark sometimes darkness is a good thing like when you want to go to sleep i could go to sleep with a light on when it's light you can't see into a place that's dark but when it's dark you can see what's around you much better really so if there's monsters or bad people around you can see them and if you're in the dark they can't see you i can't see you either can you please turn the light back on okay then how about this there's one really cool thing i didn't show you yet there is shawnee okay here it is when you're in the dark and your eyes get used to it you can see all sorts of things around you really well and then you can do stuff with them like what take a look at your mobile you can see it really well right if there were monsters standing underneath it because i can see it maybe i could make it fall on them and they'd go away it would fall on their heads and they wouldn't be bad anymore that's

through that mansion covens whole operation was based there and he turned the place into a fortress which to be fair it pretty much was to start with and that was before he filled the place with jumpy guys toting automatic weapons but sam knew cobin was in there and then he might know something about what happened to his daughter so sam was going in no matter what thank you [Music] do what this of course this place is dead [Music] inspiring confidence these days that's [ __ ] we've handled six of these already you heard the client they're very serious so what are we supposed to do with these

ready to return to base all right you get this one but if it's a setup i'll be happy when we drop off sleeping beauty so we'll breathe i saw his people up by his chopper ready to go he's probably impatient look colonel prentice i got us here as fast as i could yes you did oscar tom reed's just not a patient man colonel i don't mean to be pushy on this one but i do need to talk about my pay i was told cobra was handling that well yes sir but since there were these changes you see extra passengers with extra gear and a longer flight plan take it up with colonel reed he'll take care of you it was clear someone wanted to talk to sam that's why they went to all the trouble of setting them up with cobins that's why they drank them and flew him back home they needed him docile when they offloaded him at their private airstrip up in the blue ridge because if they hadn't he would have taken that place upon with his bare hands he's awake fuel isn't free man colonel prentice major robertson we don't have time to chat our timetable says your men need to move everything's operational director reid we started deployment at 900 hours this morning good keep things going on your end

we're getting out of here thanks for coming back for me nick you don't need a brother behind sam you don't need family that op started a change in sam one that would take years to really show itself years of figuring out what that change meant but sam's deal with grim meant he needed intel on emp's black arrow right now sam never asked for the little things which meant this was big the other question was where to meet we picked the national mall public space lots of crowds for cover open approaches it made life tricky for the spotters i could dodge them sam he could find them and he did hey sam i'm being tailed here black arrow wants to crash our party it's not a secret that we know each other vic they're watching you hoping to catch me i think i'm insulted you better take them out

give me one more why are you following victor cost was just bait the home associate we were waiting for you told the car all day when we saw you you don't want to brag i'm taking care of your admirers then we got a window before they handle this healthy makeup if we're gonna do the face-to-face thing we gotta do it now you know the area around the monument yeah there's a standalone booth right in front meet me there i'll let you in hey watch where you're going excuse me there you go here put this on we don't have a lot of time those spotters had to have backup so we'll go over the basics here cover the rest by phone sounds good look in the bag you'll find your favorite pistol i didn't get you anything shut up sam there's no time you'll also find something i borrowed from a buddy over at darpa it's a portable emp generator low intensity short range the bag's shielded so you can stash your gear in there but uh hit the trigger you'll fry everything around you to use his juice nice what else do you have for me uh there's a file in the bag but here's the short version there's an r d house called white box a dod contractor that does work on emp technology so so six months ago they suddenly contract out all their security to those [ __ ] over at black arrow now that's a breaking pattern for them they don't do corporate security and based on what you told me about them there might be a connection bingo it's slim but you've gone fifth freedom based on less all right time for you to go and you ping me when you reach safe distance and we'll talk more about white box before you go in will do stay safe by order of the department of public works this fair and the museum are now closed we have detected a gas leak on site everybody is to leave the fairgrounds in an orderly fashion here attention attention there's a gas leak on the site for your safety we need you to proceed to your cars in an orderly passion immediately i repeat this for your safety oh man it's not too shabby [Music] keep your eyes open look alive show me how you did it back at the airfield fisher come get me uh [Music] what something's not right i'm gonna take a look around [ __ ] me jesus christ [ __ ] nice dry [ __ ] but it ain't gonna work it must have come from over there it's no gas leak fisher it's bullets contact with the intruder i need backup to sweep the area you left us at the airfield to come to the fair come on fisher it can be all those years you were lying to me it was for the greater good sam and i would do it again in a heartbeat for the same reasons i guess i never did know you no you didn't and you still don't when sam came to me for help i wasn't gonna say no he'd always been more the lone wolf type and he needed a little reminder on the value of sticking your neck out after the fun and games at the monument sam headed to whitebox the goons who bought the place had already gotten what they wanted out of it and we're moving it off-site but he didn't care what they were taking out he wanted to get in not that a double-walled emp containment structure has a lot of back doors he just needed one [Music] oh uh so vic how do i get in this box look for an industrial air exchanger on the side of the building breach it then go for their security monitoring setup downstairs your next objective should be easy to pick out once you've accessed the camera feeds famous last words so so holy [ __ ] on the bright side coffee's gotten better i'm telling you we're not getting the amplification effect that we're looking for what about the readings on run 1994 robertson seemed keen on those robertson isn't qualified to interpret the data even if he is collecting all of it i'm thinking those were statistical noise i think you're being too quick to dismiss the results i think i've been working here 18-hour days for the last month and a half and i'm not going to wish cast results because i want to wrap up and go home whatever you're leaving half our results on the table we're meeting our deadline deal with it come on people you said you'd be done two hours ago what we're not working fast enough for you you think you can tell me how to do my job i'm going to tell lucious gallier that you are interfering in our work what do you think about that you're here then i did but what he doesn't realize he said we were for gallaudet too you can't you just i just did now you got a choice get back to work were you next not this one it hurt the bravo site you could have the other as long as he's useful finish and start final phase and the rest of the building roll it all back what you can't this is unacceptable you keep poindexter here working i gotta clean up to supervise yes what's your location ugh don't kill me answer my questions we'll see what are you working on that requires this kind of lockdown electromagnetic pulse countermeasure stuff for darpa mostly or we were since robertson got here it's been all project driven robertson what's his deal you mean besides letting black arrow take over the lab he collects all the experimental data and wipes it off the rest of the systems it's bad for workflow and only he can see the big picture of what we're working on what about lucius gallard where does he fit in he's my boss the owner of the company and the guy who hired black arrow and robertson to do security i'm thinking it might be a good idea to relieve robertson of that data can you get me in i could get you into the elevator good do it then get out i think i'd rather stay some of my friends they might need my help maybe i can good luck oh like a man huh here we might have a hospital in the lab let's give his head to colonel prentice come on whoever you are the final face isn't that bad believe me nothing to worry about foreign okay oh next yet oh what was [Music] so oh sam i know you're inside white box i can help just let me know when you reach robertson's system so you heard everything what a surprise but now you're supposed to have good news about sarah she's on the line that's why i called make it quick dad sarah said you are you okay they told me you were dead dad they told me that you'd been killed they told me the same thing about you i i sorry sam time's up graham later you've got work to do yes [Music] [Music] stay here [Music] uh hey close in and finish them off [Music] go go i can see robertson's system from here talk to me graham good now think about making this room a hostile environment for uninvited guests i might need you to be on that system for a while and i don't want you interrupted remote detonation mine should do the trick sam here i'm looking at robertson's system perfect can you get me a back door just like old times you've got root access and a socket address thanks i'm setting up a capture so i can download everything he's got all of the emp data is on there a couple of analysts i trust are looking forward to seeing it okay sam the link is active and the pipe is full i'm done here not quite i need you to babysit this from your end if the connection goes i can't re-establish it from here so nobody else gets their hands on this box from what i'm seeing that system could be used to shut down the site's connectivity i'd be locked out and we'd be out of luck and i'd better get ready companies coming you got nowhere to run show yourself oh that's enough fisher jesus time to die [ __ ] come on show me what you got holy [ __ ] now you want to watch your angles go go 40 done move it go you'll die like the rest of it the son of a [ __ ] [Music] thanks for giving movement we just hit 60 percent me what you got let's go get em 80 almost home [Music] all clear on this end i can't say the same someone's locked a trace onto my download i can't cut it and if they find me my cover's blown and so is sarah's where's it coming from looks like inside white box first floor blueprints show a large space probably a test lab right i went through it they store their test emp there you might have to use it do whatever it takes but cut that trace vic i'm inside white box and i need a hand this should be good it is i may need to set off an emp inside the site in order to kill a trace how tight is this place's exterior shield everything electronic [Music] that's what i thought oh foreign was interesting [Music] [Music] get in there go jesus i got a possible fish over there area is not secure i say again [Music] i think i'm done here grim maybe i'll go look for this galley that everyone's talking about lucious gallard you know him not directly but let me get back to you on this don't go after him until i do in the meantime we'll have an analyst working on robertson's data [Music] how did sam get on site at the lincoln memorial easy secret service acting on orders from the president got him there why'd they do that that's a little trickier you see the name lucious gallagher got grimm's attention she knew he was a businessman reid was working with reed kept things compartmentalized and that was one of the aspects of his operation grimm had no access to it pissed her off what grim did know was that reid was meeting gallard at the memorial in the morning right after some [ __ ] photo op speech the vp was given gallard's people were handling event logistics which was why he'd be there grim took it to the president who didn't like the coincidence she wanted to know what they were talking about and that meant getting sam on site for audio surveillance and more if necessary i'm inside what now the president's on the line sam we need to eavesdrop on the conversation reed's about to have with gallard so bug the memorial we thought of that mr fisher galiot's people scrubbed the site in preparation for my vice president's charming little speech and there was no time to get new equipment in place and what's plan b you are this morning's camera equipment is still in place get to the control booth hack the camera controls to record the conversation and uplink the feed to us just like that all right i'm on it yes what did you think of what speech all right grim i'm in the camera booth now what you need to sync the feed from the console to me so that i can see what we're getting it should be easy to hack hang on that's it now i need you to get comfortable with those camera controls we're dealing with directional mics here high-end but they're integrated with the camera focus get reed and gallard in the shot and we'll get the audio miss them and we get nothing and here they come now so lucious i'm glad you can make it we've got some last-minute logistic issues to discuss we're 24 hours out and you want to talk paper clip requisitions here now the site's clean and i knew you'd be here since your company did the setup on the samson speech one of my companies yes i have several which includes black arrow which i assume is what you want to talk about we can talk about black arrow shortcomings later i want to talk about what i need to make this go off smoothly do you now this is what your people want the people i represent want you to deal with fissure stop wasting time stop wasting their money if megiddo's getting cold feet let me make this clear reed megiddo planned this operation megiddo paid for this operation and megiddo would be very upset if anyone were allowed to interfere with it he's not going to interfere because my men will deal with them since black arrow wasn't able to i'll worry about black arrow you stick to the plan thank you which would explain why you're still here executive oversight i hate leaving things to chance or third party you're supposed to be in paris all hell's about to break loose my men will be very busy so i cannot guarantee your safety i'm not asking you to are you sure this is to protect you and the operation some things require a personal touch now if that's everything we're done here i'll see you when it's over goodbye lucius let's go after reed no the smart play is to talk to gallard we can find reed later i concur i want to know more about megiddo and lucius galliard is the only source we have okay go i'll freeze galliard in place galliard mr galliard my name is anna grimm's daughter i'm calling on behalf of tom reed at third echelon i know who you are i just finished talking with your boss what does reid want now director reed felt that the resolution that you two came to probably wasn't satisfactory for all sides and was wondering if you'd be open to further discussion on the matter oh how very thoughtful of him the answer is still no he'd like to know if there's anything else that could be put on the table to get you to reconsider i pry mr galliard i think you're misunderstanding the purpose of my call no i don't think i am let me explain something miss grimm's daughter all i want from tom reed is for him to do his damn job why don't you tell him that for me if you'll hold for one second i'll put director reed on the line and you can tell him yourself sir you know what you do that you really shouldn't talk to grimm like that where the hell are my guards it's just you and me lucious let's talk what's your connection with reid if you ask nicely i tell you he's just hired help god you're thick this is bigger than reed bigger than third echelon they're just convenient why does reid want you out of town ugh your enhanced interrogation techniques need work he wants to run the show when the emps are triggered there's three of them scattered around the city in a few hours they go off and he gets to play commando there are people he wants to impress the emps where do i find them say please i don't know that's part of the plan you see you can't stop it fisher it's too big it's too late and the people i work for this is just part of what they've got going on megiddo who are they try harder fisher who are they they're the ones who run this town in moscow and beijing and any other places it matters they're the ones who are going to get me out of this one piece and once reid is finished at the white house what's happening galliard's dead the shooter's running we need him alive he may be our only link between third echelon and megiddo i've got a visual he's on the stage he just ducked into the vip tent move itself [Applause] come on there fisher waiting for you over the fence we have an officer in trouble at the lincoln this guy's a cop killer nobody hides from the police he's waiting for you again sam i'm here you jump down keep going dead ahead the large tent in front ugh let's just come on he's outside and on the move again sam officer in trouble police officer come out now police world fight i see heads up sam the police are pulling back from your location any idea why i'll tap into their como to find out everybody out now [Music] i've seen him exit the cafe he's headed for the parkway sam [Music] he's headed for that car put it into practice there are multiple third echelon squads converging on your position right now what about the cops third echelon called them off the shooter but until he gets there you're on your own area looks clear are we sure fish are still in the lincoln memorial zone no movement anybody have a line on the target no fissure around here we better hurry before the cops come back he's gotta be here somewhere sector's clear area seems clear let's get back to work but stay frosty really close sam a second wave of operatives is on its way nothing unusual to searching no report of the hostile stay alert can't see fisher anywhere he can't have disappeared on a terrorist god damn it no final movement stay sharp no visual on sam fisher let's find him reid wants him dead there's another batch coming at you same i don't see fisher he must be close to the cafe watch out for that second floor search the area find the hostile and eliminate him no contacts yet i'm continuing my sweep here somewhere man i can feel it no movement no sign of the hostile time to go sam your ride is here where on the bridge behind the cafe go still no visual on fisher continue to sweep the cafe your ride is waiting for you [Music] [Music] it shows you how much sam changed that he would even think about going after third echelon he'd been a company man loyal to the bone but now here he was ready to rip the guts out of the beast the building's weakness was in the power supply the main feed and primary backup ran through the basement parking garage with a little c4 in the right places sam could cut the power to the building long enough to slip inside that echelon that was good enough for sam he was going in and he wanted them to know he was coming sam are you in the garage i smell like a spare tire it was the best way now i need you to use the c4 you packed to take out the building's primary and secondary transformers do it simultaneously when you reach the front desk and you'll have a short window before the emergency power puts security back online they're both on the parking level right right but in two separate rooms and don't be seen or they're gonna seal the security doors and you're done and don't give those surveillance cameras a show i still think we should have gone with palm trees that works capacity for 12 hours that should be plenty of time to give me power back online yeah get a move on sam my contact on the inside just sent me a text security's looking for him he's a techie named charlie fryman and before you ask yes i trust him well that's good enough for me where is he near the server room get to him before security does or he won't be able to help you oh uh thank you all units [Music] attention all personnel please remember to keep your key card with you at all times without your key card you will not be able to access the building and may be detained until proof of your identity can be provided thank you for sam the one thing third echelon had always been about was the truth even after everything that happened he'd held on to that but now he was coming back as the hunter as the enemy as the one thing he'd never thought he'd be and the truth it was waiting for him [Applause] i'm sorry we're closing the office early for some routine maintenance please try again tomorrow thank you i'm sorry sir but i'm afraid the office is closed for the evening i'm here to see tom reed mr reed is currently unavailable but if you'd like to make an appointment mr fisher i used to work here security alert main power is offline emergency power will be online in five four three two one zero security doors are closing [Music] sam fryman just sent me his location he's waiting for you in the office off the server room got it everything's clear on my end no fissure no employees left nothing not under can't find fisher or anything else around here that works i got no targets [Music] no sign of movement i have nothing you better find fisher not bad holy [ __ ] off the alarm oh [Music] damn it no contact looks clear anything on a security feed i'm sure fisher wants to see our new layout area's clear no sign of fisher could have been anyone scared by the power outages whoever did this couldn't have gone far no targets at this time i got no contact with fisher i do not want him alive in our building get everybody out everybody but one one of the geeks a guy named fryman oh are you fisher over here [Music] are you frying yeah yeah your fish are right anna told me that you were coming i i was a big fan of yours back when you worked i was a big fan i'm touched what do you have for me i've got those ultra high frequency sonar goggles better than the stuff the new splinter cells are getting try them on voila with these babies you can see in the dark you can see through walls you name it it's not bad plus i tweak them so that you can see the security system laser grid trip the beam and a turret targets the brake nasty stuff i programmed the algorithm sorry oh just one thing um the top of the line guys are are packing similar gears so if you can see them they they might be able to see you thanks now you better get moving i'll be fine i'll just tell the security guards that i was reading and they can you know they'll walk me right back to my office and you on the other hand is good luck fisher could be in the server room i want everybody there asap [Music] i need backup i say again i need backup no contact on fischer man's still on our turfs [Music] check them out [Music] that was fisher find the target and take them out everybody keep your eyes open i don't have a fix on the target no sign of movement stay sharp no contact on fishing man still in our [Music] oh holy uh so foreign goben look reed this was part of the deal protection well-protected he's here you need to do something about it raise the security level do something he's gonna kill me no no that's not enough nice to see you again look fisher i can explain nobody's coming to save you this time audrey oh now tell me what the hell is read up to reid's working with makito he's using third echelon to get emps into the country and cited in dc i i helped set it up it's what i do why what does reid get out of this the president they're gonna take out the president after the emps go off to paralyze the city use it as cover for the hit tonight why go after the president i can't tell you oh she won't play ball but the vp is already in makito's pocket reed gets a medal and a big fat promotion after it all goes down that son of a [ __ ] last question this is the important one what do you know about my daughter if i tell you you're gonna kill me i don't know anything about her fisher like i said they gave me a picture told me to provide a body that matched i did a lot of jobs like that for third echelon anything they needed asked your friend graham's daughter i worked with her a bunch of times she knows more about this than i do oh shut up still alive good i think so uh first floor targets grim i just had an interesting discussion with your friend kobe reid's in bed with megiddo they're going after the president and playing kingmaker with a vp the emps are for cover of course aide won't be able to get there in the aftermath and they'll have a convenient terrorist attack as cover for everything cobin had a few other things to say i'm headed to your office griffin what am i gonna find there something long overdue patch me through in telepresence when you get there we'll talk then payback time stand down we got a hostile in the building probably so [Music] still no visual oh [Music] [Music] fish are still in our building and he's on the loose i repeat fisher it's on the loose by still no visual on the contact can anyone advise look here somewhere man i can feel it [Music] no contact on fischer man's still on our turf your career nothing yet can anyone see the target no sign of fisher we better hurry our offices need to be empty for i don't tonight a visual on the target can anyone advise [Music] round all clear right here [Music] [Music] so tell me about sarah graham tell me why you lied to me it was lambert's call sam he thought he was protecting you he had a recording system set up in his office everything that went on in there he saved before new york he gave me the access codes the files can only be triggered on site and only by me this is what he had to say about sarah sarah fisher i'd received reliable intelligence of a credible threat against one coming from a mole inside third echelon the threat against sorrow would be used in an attempt to leverage sam sam would then be compromised and i couldn't allow that so i made the hard choice i faked sarah's death taking her off the playing board without her sam would be free to act as he needed to he'd suffer and she'd be safe the rest was detailed preparing a new identity sarah securing her excellent work there then keeping her hidden then used that despicable creature coven to provide a body that could stand in for the girl and then i lied to my best friend told him his daughter was dead took advantage of his grief and used it for third echelon purposes and the saddest part of this i never uncovered them all the danger to her and the sam is still out there which means this has to stay hidden you and i that's all perhaps [Music] sam sam sam listen to me sam you have to listen to me what's done is done but right now i need you i need the sam fisher i worked with haven't you heard he's dead just ask my daughter sam please my analysts have worked through the rest of the data that you got from white box we know what they're doing and we can't stop it then what do you need me for they've got three directional emp generators in place when they go off the pulses will blanket the entire metro area optimal coverage pattern predictions place one of those three at the old city reservoir site you need to go there and disable it why should i because that's the one that will hit sarah's apartment and if you stop it you can save her from what's coming after and the other two there's only time to go after one so go save your daughter i was never holding her that was just a bluff to get you in the game and for whatever it's worth i'm sorry what about you i'm going to the white house with tom reed and i'm going to try to save the president maybe i'll see you there [Music] ah attention all personnel protocol 2319 is now in effect site cleanup and data sterilization has begun all personnel must reach minimum safe distance of 100 yards from the building immediately launch protocol 2319. get out of there now warning protocol 2319 is now in effect [Music] is now in effect [Music] warning protocol 2319 is now in effect so now sam knew everything knew that the best friend he'd murdered and betrayed him for the best reason in the world knew that the thing he'd helped lambert build needed to be utterly destroyed he was his own man now and all his ties to his old life were gone except for grim she called me calling a favor it was too late to go for the other emps but she did want me to go get sarah sam deserved that much at least meanwhile she'd be at the white house doing whatever the hell she thought she could do there so i said yes no way i was gonna leave sarah down there for when the [ __ ] hit the fan and i wasn't gonna abandon her father not even when he just waded in and started beating answers out of people then again that was pure sam pure sam when he got mad hmm i whatever where's this stuff going anyways one of the checkpoints downtown not sure which one you don't need this stuff for a checkpoint you just take a truck you park it sideways to block the street you put a couple guys with guns there sure if you want the back end of your truck taken off when someone tries to run it there's this one op you didn't build oh for [ __ ] sake tell me what i need to know and i might not snap your neck [ __ ] you i'm not afraid of you fisher wrong answer [Music] that's a weaponized emp over there how do i shut it down i don't know i mean if i did i wouldn't tell you [ __ ] funny now tell me what i need to know i don't know anything else i swear stop wasting my time if you don't know who does scientists brought over by apprentice inside the warehouse could it be disposed of after the emp goes off she knows you don't say yes test is a success any word on how it's going down here says thanks for making my job easier hostile can't be too far i don't have a fix on the target oh no please don't how goddamn stupid are you did you really think i wouldn't notice you sabotaging those systems please i wasn't doing anything oh you weren't doing your job and your job is the only reason you're still alive i'm sorry i didn't mean to i'm sorry too because you're out of chances please don't kill me please don't kill me one more mistake one more reason and you're dead you think he's gonna come through here makes the most stop slowing sense you might as well just give up and die just like your little girl did this but don't worry i'm gonna send you right to her i'm not finding it [ __ ] looks like trouble not a chance in hell what have we got where's the contact looks like an ambush nobody moves from here hold position no sign of movement from here semi you're gonna wait for him right here i don't like the looks of this hold position i got signs of impossible ambush get ahead holding position area is a no-go show yourself or she dies you want her dad is that what you want nothing here let's go come here fisher she's waiting for you i do not have a picture i don't know who you are or what you're doing here but thank you they were going to shave it there's a weaponized emp slung up 100 yards from here it's going to be activated tonight tell me how to stop it you can't there's two generators on site when they're activated they'll juice the emp and then it'll discharge the catch if you take out one generator the other one automatically flashes each of them alone is enough to trigger the pulse so i need to hit both at the same time yes or else it goes off are you with a friend otherwise there's no way there's always a way now you better go things are going to get ugly around here it's going to get ugly everywhere right about then things started getting complicated for some reason sarah was suspicious but i'd managed to talk her into climbing into the chopper and had gone airborne to rendezvous with sam but there were too many moving parts for things to go smoothly and sam didn't know what he was really up against tagging the generators that fed the emp so i could take them out from the air that was the least of it so see you downstairs hey sister come here they'll sign a fisher or any other hostile activity keep apprentice informed there's too much cover for them too many places to eyes hide that's over fisher not this time no contact repeat no contact it's quiet let's keep moving we got him surrounded no contact it won't end like at the airfield at the airfield [Music] count on it [ __ ] you're over it won't end like at the airfield vic i've got bad news and water remains wet what do you got there are two generators powering the emp i need to take both out simultaneously and i'm all out of c4 mark the gps coordinates for me i'll see what i can do when i get there roger that ah ah so time to move coming over all this is right simple some of you may have heard that sam fisher is somewhere around here as far as we're concerned that doesn't matter we have a job to do with that big beautiful device up there goes off you hear any shooting i don't hear any shooting what the hell is that supposed to mean if our guys were down there and fisher was still alive they'd be shooting him right right but since there's no shooting that means either fisher could go [ __ ] uh [Music] damn right grim had me pick up sarah to get her out of danger she's on board and we're in bound dad what's going on mr coss explained some of it but i don't understand just sit tight sweetheart it's gonna be all right but i need the second generator coordinates if i'm gonna help you i can patch you into apprentice calm now avoid getting your ass shut before i get to start there sir permission granted there he is yes sir sam what about the second generation a good time vic i'm taking fire from that chopper you'll think of something but i need those coordinates we're [ __ ] hang on careful with your fire we don't want to risk hitting the generator vic you got it i'm clear hey sam outside your time this is gonna get messy dad sarah sarah sarah i thought you were dead they told me you were dead term i'm sorry but if i hear that black arrow radio chatter right we are out of time i'll let you sit next to it but we gotta go no everybody strapped in next stop 1600 pennsylvania avenue is grim there last contact i had with her she told me where to find sarah then she said she was going in to stop reid haven't heard from her since we are going to help her right dad she looked out for me when you were gone she could have just dumped me with a new name and walked away and she didn't and we are not going to walk away from her not now no worries kid we're on our way just going to take a while got to make sure our flight path is in the emp clear zone until the pulse hits oh my god jesus those things are supposed to be clean all those people down there who don't know what happened reid what the hell did you just do missile inbound sarah hang up i didn't think they'd have air defenses set up around the white house i was worn vic you okay yeah thank god you had me worried there for a minute i'm fine lucky vic got us down in one piece here [Music] not much useless now anyway i think you'll need that more than we will where'd you get the best it was in the chopper the crash wrecked everything else rpg's are thorough i get that impression ma'am what the hell are you still doing here get your bony ass over to the white house i'm not leaving my daughter here vic sarah can you work your way around dad it's all right she'll be fine sam with six blocks from my office my people are coming to meet us grim needs your help now grim can wait i'm not taking any chances with sarah dad he's right go do what you have to do trust me we'll be fine i'll see you again soon i promise somebody get eyes in the lobby you might come through there we know he's in there nobody's a hero let him come to us it's almost sure come on jesus right now christ go target is concealed i gotta call the army to deal with this [ __ ] they gotta call the national guard they already did man i saw this whole line of humvees heading into the city guys in black body armor were getting out setting up checkpoints that ain't the guard man that's the black arrow or something some private merc company that the government hired because they ran out of nationals that might help a car battery anything at all i'm sorry nothing's working anywhere i wish there was something coming in real low please there's gotta be suckers just right out as soon as they get the phones working again we'll call your parents and make sure they're all right we don't even know what's happening here i've got to get her out there's nothing you can do for okay she's dead you're gonna get yourself killed no i've gotta get her out teddy it's too late there's nothing you can do for her no i've gotta get her out listen to me there's nothing to get out she's dead man if you go in there after her you're gonna die too i don't care let me go get it [Music] i'm sorry sir it's a national security emergency no one is allowed near the white house i have to ask you to go back to your home and wait it out it's not safe but i'm not going anywhere this area isn't safe either that's why we're here i don't even know who the hell you are i'm jack-booted thugs with guns sir we're that is all do you think he's still alive [ __ ] [Music] trick fisher's alive at the streets of dc but we don't know where [ __ ] we all know what he's capable of parkinson's why didn't you tell us about maybe they tried to tell us about it but all the radios and tvs were bad and probably just trying to keep everyone from panicking well they're not doing a very good job of that i'm panicking they're panicking everyone's panicking [Music] now get off the streets go home [Music] get away from immediately get away from the barricade there is a no go we'll wait here this looks bad looks like an airport area i got signs of suspicious activity dead ahead holding positions sometimes you just have to do things [Music] it was a bad day to work at the white house black arrow's out of perimeter was there to prevent accidental witnesses then it was the inner cordon around the white house to make sure nobody bothered reed while he did his dirty work after all the army was eventually gonna get its ass in gear and start airlifting people into the city then there was gonna be some explaining to do reed's solution was brilliant if the cavalry showed up after he'd taken out the president then black arrow was there to help secure the white house and our new president if not black arrow would be the scapegoat and their resistance would buy enough time for him to finish the job hey locate the target and eliminate them we got a man down [ __ ] i don't have a fix on the target can anyone see him looks clear everybody stay alert for suspicious activity uh fish is still on the street come on guys movement target may be kia don't try to the target no contact repeat nope show yourself fisher let's have a gun fight the streets of d.c [ __ ] me okay cup guy let's do this [Music] oh [Music] i don't have a pitch on the target [Music] sam where are you coming through the front door i'll have the negative door open got it on my way [Music] backups [Music] this is what was going on inside the white house made the stuff in the streets look like a party reed's people were in there not black arrow and they were clearing it room by room rita disabled most of the security from third echelon the emp had taken care of the rest all the president had left with secret service and they weren't enough sam was in trying to make his way through the white house while the people he trained tried to kill him as for grim well she had the hard part [Music] help oh damn it somebody this doesn't make sense please what does the operation these orders oh what are we doing here when we should be part of the team bagging the primary objective well if i know but the orders came from ice queen grim and she sits on the right hand of god so when she says something you know it's coming from the top bet i could thaw her a little bit yeah if you threw under a volcano now shut up and keep your eyes peeled still sam we have an opportunity here reed stashed vice president samson in the ballroom with personal bodyguards he's waiting to be introduced as the next president that's on my road to the west wing pay him a visit then meet me in the press room we'll figure out how to tackle read there just don't shoot no survivors [Applause] no sign of them i got movement possible contact [Music] advancing on the target now move it go can't engage in contact no visual come on sam i need backup asap no contact repeat no contact i'm gonna stand guard here [Music] you guys keep going i'll stay here no contact yet i'm continuing my sweep oh [Music] looks like an ambush we're holding position here keep alert for hostile contact the area head is not secure i'm holding position here sometimes you just have to do things the hard way damn it what the hell was reid thinking what happens to his special plan if i catch a stray bullet mr vice president i can assure you everything is under control you're perfectly safe here don't piss in my mouth something talk about doing that sir you really do need to stay calm target has to be nearby ah you don't get it do you you can't touch me i got protection i'm teflon so whatever you think you're gonna do to me mister has been mr wrong agent it's your washed up spy we can forget about it right now cause i'm bulletproof goddamn bulletproof here oh really oh you shot me you know you need to work on that [Music] jesus freedom anybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] no sign of movement everybody stay alert and report anything suspicious nothing unusual right [Music] this is [Music] let's see by the time grimm got a hold of sam reed's men were kicking in the oval office door she was there and she could see that the president's protective detail was going down the plan was for sam to meet with grimm in the press room where they'd figure out what the hell to do next of course grimm already had a plan when she hadn't bothered to tell sam about but that shouldn't have surprised him some things and some people just don't change [Music] one guy is all we need to worry about when fischer comes through here he's gonna get [ __ ] ugh uh go go uh through here [Music] we're out of time sam where are you i'm close get closer reed's knocking on the door to the oval office right now [Music] [Music] [Music] uh contact wait for my signal uh damn it ugh for whatever it's worth sam i am so sorry for everything i thought we were in a hurry right we need to get you close to reed and we need to do it in a way that doesn't make him double tap the president immediately got any ideas one but it's gonna hurt just do what you have to do i always do sam i always do tom i've got fisher i'm bringing him in don't do anything drastic until i get there sorry sam you're going to the oval office you've got to dress properly for the occasion hands oh you're comfortable ah [ __ ] get up you got an appointment with the president all those years you were lying to me it was for the greater good sam and i would do it again in a heartbeat for the same reasons i guess i never did know you no you didn't and you still don't i was wondering when you were gonna get here nice work anna i see you got some payback in for the stun he pulled at the airfield well he put up a little bit of a fight of course he did and now he's here the famous sam fisher just in time to be useful so how does it feel sam knowing you're gonna go down in history as the man who assassinated president caldwell [ __ ] you reed of course we'll be just a little too late to rescue her and you'll be shot multiple times trying to escape it's classic but it's clean you don't honestly believe that this is gonna work the surveillance cameras footage is gonna show your cameras we own them your security measures we made sure the pulse fried them we're third echelon madam president we own every bit of information that goes through this town and if i want to i can make it look like you were assassinated by two circus clowns and a golden retriever so shut up and you might live a few seconds longer that's not third echelon it's not lambert's third echelon last time i checked he was dead and guess what third echelon nearly died tom you see the president decided the agency wasn't justifying its funding anymore she was gonna shut us down leave america vulnerable to the sort of attacks you spent so many years stopping sam madam president are you all right yes i'm fine thank you ah that was a cool you've got maybe two minutes before the army takes back the white house make them useful how did megiddo get to you you don't want to know about megiddo you want to know about your daughter you don't get to talk about my daughter you still don't get it do you sara didn't matter threatening her was just a way to get to you and leveraging you was a way to get to third echelon and third echelon that was a way to get what they wanted out of the white house you're the mole you're the one lambert was worried about very good sam you finally see you're son of a [ __ ] you cost me three years of my life three years when i thought my daughter was dead move move drop your weapon on the floor now captain thank you for rescuing me now i don't see anyone else here but us and i'm sure you don't either oh man let's get you out here thank you oval office is secure we have the president potus is safe and secure i've talked to sam once since he left he told me that he and sarah were going to take some time to catch up he talked about learning who was really important to you why you always had to come back for him he talked about family and you know what the last thing he said to me was just before he hung up vicky said thanks for everything i love you like a brother brother that's family right i thought so [Music] you
