private Allen here is gonna do a quick Levin's demonstration to show you locals how it's done no offense but I see a lot of you guys firing from the hip and Springs bullets all over the range you don't end up hitting the damn thing and it makes you look like an ass private Allen show what I'm talking about grab that weapon off the table and fire the targets behind you turn around and fire at the target I'm trying to make the point just here you see what I mean he sprayed bullets all over the damn place you've got to pick your targets by aiming deliberately down your sights from a stable stance private our show our friends see how the ranges take down the target crouch first then aim down your sights at the target that's all there is to it you want to talk us to go down you gotta aim down your sight aiming down your sights also works for switching quickly between targets aim down your sights then pop in and out to acquire new targets throw on private if your target is close to where you're aiming you can snap to it quickly by aiming down your sights now that's how you do you want to take down your talk as quickly and with control now if your target is behind light couple remember that certain weapons can penetrate and hit guitar the private here will demonstrate last but not least you need to know how to toss a frag grenade private Allen pick up some frag grenades from the table toss the grenade down the range to take out several targets at once note the frags tend to roll on sloped surfaces so think twice before tossing one uphill all right thanks for the help private Allen now get over to the pit general Shepherd wants to see you run the course show me what you've learned so far hey private welcome back to the pit her general Shepherd wants to pull the
