this is all gonna be worth it when we empty that boat it is unknown if we will even be able to access its contents the only if you gotta worry about is if you're gonna be able to carry all we got company [Music] you will compensate our loss rodent let's just worry about getting out of we're here the right way maybe yeah you don't have the faintest clue where we're going this one has become monster food oh man you made get a load of those helmets make their faces are all messed up under there i ain't taking orders from that skull suit anyway not if i find her first perhaps novacore will accept the rodent as a downpayment oh george just sell me up the river i always headed their way is this is beyond question ladies hey at least i'm pulling my weight there's not much weight to pull joke all you want but without me you wouldn't be able to get through this door without you we wouldn't be in front of this door we should keep moving we are moving well we should be doing it faster sure it could have gone smoother could have gone worse too remember the arrango job we managed to shoot our way out of that one too and we and swipe that bio weapon along the you see vault's right there we smash and grab then like will said out the way 5 000 units to the hellraiser who kills these so-called guardians of the galaxy okay people let's do this one catastrophe at a time careful what you wish for okay so we gotta shoot them big guys [Music] [Music] like you'd have done any different if she patted your head nice work peter find them and kill them [Music] but this is nobody stop [Music] uh follow them i'm telling you we can still come out on top of this thing we'll be lucky if we don't end up on top of a spike it is more likely that lady hellbender would feed us to one of her monsters thanks trax something to look forward to ah fight cowards uh guys i think we walked right into a trap no she said trap everyone look for a way out quickly they collide it'll blow a nice hole in the wall the floor's weaker here and it looks like there's a tunnel or something below us you carve us a whole gamora flattered but no chance this has got destroyer written all over it i shall reduce it you expect us to crawl through a sewer i ain't getting wet again i don't want to hear one word out of you you all got a real funny way of saying thanks gratitude is not my current sentiment more like murderous rage keep talking you it greats i'm happy to cut you out of your take from the vault just admit it rocket we had a plan and you blew it the plan was blown the minute it crawled out of your brain i saved the plan you do not get credit for salvaging your own plunder the blunder was putting our lives in his grubby little hands i knew we should have gone with fruit brood ain't some piece of lumber you can hawk though i'm sure you got plenty experience traffic and live watch your tongue where i'll cut it out oh i'm shaking lady you bring a knife to a gunfight brute says you can all go sit on a hot poker it does not seem perfect it means we're headed the right way straight into an ambush oh it's coming it ain't an ambush is it just another by the numbers plan for the guardians of the galaxy what we should have done is sold drax hellbender was practically begging to buy a night with the fake loot my gift is not for sale the house pass still owes us 12 000 units 12. how'd you get 12. it was a measurement of my growing frustration [Music] all we got to do is grab the goods we'll take a deep breath cause we're here one vault as promised and a giant locked door leave that to me heads up i am adding 50 units to your debts you'll get it back as soon [Music] i knew what i was doing we knew what we were doing you blew it up russian tracks heads up [Music] this is exactly why i can't believe we actually made it around here you're clearly make it fast of course there ain't a lock this side of xandar i can't walk i am adding to your debt for every extra minute this takes you keep your mannies on you can't rush genius all hell raisers to the main vault or i could try rushing and hope for the best any last words we've let stressing me guys huddle up [Applause] i've got this one peter let me end it my blade will not be silent progress call me that again and i'll murder you i am not the enemy traitor you know what i see when i look at that battlefield i see all of you i mesmerized mesmerized what seriously you make me want to fight 24 hours a day so what do you say we run these guys to the ground huh who's with me way to read the team peter take your time i'm trying to focus [Music] feel my rock lady hellbender's forces grow more persistent yeah i think the honeymoon's over any time a glorious challenge hill racers keep coming i can do it just need another duster wearing freaking yeah i think the honeymoon's over hold on yeah tell him quail what is next come on you signorfian piece of scot the rodent does not inspire much confidence i will enjoy this and pop and close enough move your asses while you still got them [Music] oh see nothing gamora no killing teammates that's who it's literally in your contract i made no such commitment he's a liability peter ha coming from the most wanted woman in the galaxy same thing how about a thank you rocket for nearly getting us killed for getting us into the crappiest fault in the greater magellanic cloud you said there'd be treasure a gilleran skull is priceless worthless is not the same guys we need a plan agreed my arms are growing moderately fatigued dig deep tracks gamora cover them rock and i will try to find something of value group [Music] don't break anything it's got gotta be more than just chunk in the skeg pretty ain't priceless they're just lights and they look heavy as scott well this is not nothing but nowhere near what we owe units are like fur mites if she keeps any in here there's got to be more [Music] yeah it's from the ventilation there's probably a major duck maybe lady hellblunder likes to sit in here and look at all her crap here we go not quite enough but we're getting there that's what i'm talking about not such a bad plan after all not exactly good either all right this will cover our fine at least why stop there after all she put us through i say we clean her out what she put us through enough [Music] in a quill grown quiet quiet like peace and quiet or like the graves sort of quiet definitely the grave one drax please tell me you didn't just lock us in i did not do anything i'm almost impressed the woodland creature has more bite than i originally perceived enjoy the contents of my vault guardians they will be the do try not to melt all over my collar and skull we need to find a way out now it is both priceless and hard to clean deep breath people anyone else feel burning like all over clintarian gas breaks down organic material leaving just a pile of sludge covered bones so let's bust our way out of here while we still have the organs to do it we've gotta stand those fence hey i found some there's a way out behind this wall allow me you're not getting through this with your bare hands we need something heavy don't mind if i do do what root's right one of the lights has got to be plenty heavy huh gamora i think you can cut loose one of those lights heads up now that was priceless drax pull it right through that wall with all my might metal doer let's move people i hope you know what you're doing that makes two of us you gotta get out of this freaking dome well ain't gonna be much difference once it's littered with our corpses nice an assassin's ring gamora would get a kick out of this here goes nothing [Music] is everyone okay gamora drax i'll live my epithelial layer is intact rocky crew where are you does anyone see a way out i see a bright light well don't go towards it guardians of the galaxy how many times do i have to kill you stuller peter the audacity that you thought you could rob me for the wrecker we weren't all on board with the plan thanks quilt why not sell the clothes right off my back do you know what i did to the last people who thought i was easy prey you let him go i got nothing we're trapped lady hellbender let us settle this honorably i will face you in combat honorably your offer is worthless destroyer there is no escaping my wrath i can work with that dweller feast upon them [Music] okay that's a true monster well let's make it truly dead this thing could do with a few less arms go get them [Music] let's see those branches put their lights let's give this squid everything we've got that now we will need to fill this for one appendage at a time a little late for that i am trying to destroy cut to the chain perish do not cower behind your pet lady hellbender just focus on the thing trying to kill us it's a little late no not again enough toying with them all right don't have to tell me twice [Music] oh man why do they have blades in them i am not sure i am sure did not get enough from that one not going to chop you down that easy [Music] what no tie them down i can freeze it you can slice it i don't think he cares anymore [Music] now overwhelm them warm go up them why would this take even excess [Music] all right we're making progress i'm almost starting to enjoy this [Music] now is the time to strike time to shred him like a hot night no mercy the creature does not have eight done to limbs this ends now rain fires heavy well what's next peter what is next peter quill come on we got this [Music] that seems unlikely what player do you think that one was i don't know but cutting into that right [Music] shake it up [Music] huh [Applause] guys we did it they live [Applause] bring me nasha everybody grab a bike [Music] now that was a ride this is no time to celebrate we have made an awful mistake and an awful amount of cash there is no escaping lady hellbent we'll see about that guys hold on [Music] your bones are mine guardians of the galaxy [Music] she will hunt us to the end of the universe who gives us skutt we got off that mudball with the money didn't we money that you forced us into stealing yeah well what about that smashing grab on zootopia i didn't hear you complaining then lady hellbender is not a bank yeah that's right because if she was we'd have way more loot whoa whoa whoa whoa one problem at a time lady hellbender will seek her revenge mark my words then she'll have to get in line first i gotta call corel the sooner we get this fine paid better yeah so we can go back to focusing on being broke that's weird is money all that you think of rodent no i also think about bombs and booze bombs made out of booze nikki there's something wrong with the connection did you twist the thingy yeah no dice nicki is your mom around i really need to talk to her she's with me inside me after you left you went to the point did you try narrowing the band first thing i tried it's got to be something else i'm losing in it can you put your mom on you know i think something has happened to the girl yeah it's called she's novacorp can you fix it i'll go check the array [Applause] uh [Music] [Laughter] look at what it did it killed everything that scott rocket relax it's just an array just an array look at it quilt where am i going to get the parts to fix that it's flarked i told you it was a mistake to keep that thing but did you listen to me oh no no no we don't listen to rocket he just has to fix the freaking ship i promise we'll get it fixed soon yeah just like you promised to get your girlfriend to go easy on us yeah okay hey that's not fair you know what isn't fairquill being the only one who actually seems to give a scout about the milano look guys we need doc to fix the array luckily i know a guy on nowhere has got the parts we need and he can get rid of that over track cheap we cannot abandon the child her behavior was erratic the llama thing you chewed the wires drugs it was probably just a bad connection and if we remove the tracker corel will make sure the entire nova core fleet is on alert for us gamora is right we made a promise i made a promise see if we can pinpoint where corel is we pay the fine quill you're freaking kidding me that way we don't have to keep looking over our shoulders for nova on the next job if there is a next job sounds like roots got that toothy bastard under control better not come back here and try to finish chewing through my ship or else i wonder what the future has in store for us more fighting perhaps next time we should get a contract with no fighting involved what would you be good for then dispatching enemies is not my only skill make it fast quill i still got that array to repair can we talk for a second yeah sure let's talk what you said before secondary about me giving a lot to the team and you making it up to me you mean it every word then how come when i tell you how to get out of this easy you ditch my advice and you roll over for novacore rocket please just because i don't always take your advice doesn't mean i don't listen to you we're a team everybody's got an opinion so you'd rather listen to gamora gamora gamora knows her stuff man she's the navigator she navigates the stars and and planets and uh comets she navigates comets sometimes and groot is our special vegetation specialist his opinion's valid too and drax what makes him so great he's uh the tactical tactics the man is such a tactician and then there's me the guy who gets mad and starts shooting up the place instead of following the plan come on you're a valued member of this team we started this together now we need to make something profitable of it something lasting we could go to nowhere like you suggested but if we don't pay that fine novacore will come for us how do we make money then maybe paying our fine makes some sense exactly so let's just get it over with and move on right we'll see there happy now we done be right there you impatient flark snuffle all right it's now that was some quality crafting if i might say so myself rocket any chance you can check out the fridge while you're at it i ain't got time to refill it i got other priorities right now uh penny for your thoughts what is a penny uh it's money like units the saying means i'd pay to know what you're thinking we must use our currency to pay the nova corps fine or we risk drax just tell me what's up i am realizing that i do not know as much as i thought i did our visit to secnorf9 was not what i expected because lady hellbender isn't a giant she is definitely not that is only part of it peter quill on our way to her fortress i realized that many of my assumptions about this team have been incorrect as well really the assassin and the rodent without them and the tree fighting nobly beside us we would not be alive right now i told you they're not bad people just because they have a bad past life is complicated drax things are never simple on cataph it was i had a family that i cherished and a certainty about life that i no longer possess i'm sure you'll find it again just give it some time rodent will you have time to repair the broken refrigerator door what like now in the near future i got a whole conserrator fix okay then drex name three skills you have besides fighting i am a great cook nope don't believe it you have never tasted my cooking i don't need to i prefer to eat the hearts of my enemies raw and bloody now i'm hungry can i help hey hey gamora i was just admiring this super cool assassin ring i got from my favorite super cool assassin as a token of my you know token of what of my everlasting commitment to not being murdered by you it's gonna take more than a ring it is really nice though how do you know what kind of ring it is oh let's just say you're not the first assassin to cross my path though i guess i should be glad no one ever sent the deadliest woman in the galaxy after me you know that name is actually a misnomer everyone thinks like god of doing thanos's dirty work before you know i betrayed him in truth i got it after i joined the resistance on a mission where nobody died what did cause you to betray thanos i mean he adopted you when you were like five he basically raised us taught us everything we know so what finally did it what snapped you out of it i found the resistance what thanos was obsessed he had me and nebula combing the galaxy for their location for cycles each of us determined to be the first to find them and report back so when i found them first i was so excited to tell him i got home and i found him talking to an empty room to someone called lady death that's not ominous i truly thought he loved us and his own twisted way but thanos didn't want to restore balance to the galaxy he was just in love with death literally in love and he would kill all of us including me including nebula to prove it but you couldn't let him no so instead of telling him where to find the resistance i joined them you have to tell me about this resistance mission especially if no one died i don't think it's a story you're gonna like why not because it doesn't make carell look very good okay the thing you have to understand is that it was the end of the war the resistance was losing bad the shatari knew it thanos knew it we all knew it but then thanos died at first people thought it was a false report misinformation spread to lure the resistance out into the open but when it became clear that it might be true carell saw an opportunity an all-or-nothing mission that could win the war once and for all the final attack on chautauri prime you're talking about the resistance stealth mission that kidnapped their infant queen except kidnapping the queen wasn't part of carell's original plan the only reason she had me tag along was so that i would kill the queen what there's no way is it so hard to believe she was grieving you know that the shitari had killed her husband her little boy she wanted revenge and i was her chance to finally get it bro would never put out a hit on a baby she would never kill a kid believe what you want but she's not who she was back then none of us are something changed maybe it was having nicki either way i refused and we won the war without killing anyone else and for reasons i don't fully understand i became known as the deadliest woman in the galaxy afterward i uh kind of don't know what to say there's nothing to say after the galactic war ended i moved on and now i'm here doing all this fun stuff with you guys and i wouldn't have it any other way but seriously thank you for sharing that with me sure are those chitauri handcuffs what oh uh yeah strange thing to collect when i collect some pretty weird stuff oh it's it's not like that i found him in the quarantine zone and i just kept them why i don't know as a reminder of who i used to be how i got here it's it's stupid not necessarily you want to talk about it i don't know if you know this but my dad is kind of the king of spar tax i know you do i mean you do of course you do you're you yeah and it's not exactly a secret it's what i would have done kidnapped the progeny of a powerful leader to control them i mean hala knows how long they kept you except that it was for the express purpose of keeping the spartoy empire from joining the resistance four years what four years that's how long they had me four earth years and a few days i'm sorry don't be for a long time i thought my dad would come get me raise an army sending spies to break me out something but he didn't because it wasn't politically advantageous fathers suck sometimes trust me at least your dad wanted you even after the war my wouldn't see me one want is a nice way of saying kidnapped make no mistake peter you're not the only one who was stolen from their home and two you went to spartax even that a speech worked out and everything hey dad it's me your son you left a rotten chautauri prison it was that or punch him i was undecided still am getting into the white house would have been easier white house basically my dad loves bureaucratic bull crap i thought being his only son would be enough to get me an audience turns out i needed an appointment the spartoy empire was in political shambles after the galactic war he was too busy to see his kid yeah i got the message loud and clear i lost everything i ever loved because of him and he wouldn't even look me in the eye i'm so sorry peter don't be i just really want to punch him ever been to shatari prime more times than i care to admit then you know what it's like how they're like scratching scratching hissing reptilian stuff of nightmares oh yeah hard to forget i've seen some pretty messed up movies but nothing came close to what it was like living on shitari prime i was just a kid i didn't even know aliens were real until they showed up in my backyard and now and now you're surrounded by aliens there aren't a lot of humans out here sure there's a few of us kicking around richard ryder right that guy might as well be an alien point is i'm pretty much alone all because the shitari saw me as a valuable asset not just the shitari thanos of course your dad was pulling the strings i think i'd almost rather thanos over those lizards i can promise you that thanos would not have been the better option maybe i mean do you know what the shitari do to their prisoners the unvaluable ones they throw them into an arena and make them fight monsters they take bets sabotage favored prisoners by breaking a leg or an arm all of it for their messed up insect entertainment you survived peter men stronger than drax have been slaughtered in those arenas you lived yeah i survived all right as a bargaining chip would you have preferred death i don't know back then maybe now not so much then be glad you made it out at all helen knows i'm glad you did anyway it doesn't matter now yeah i guess those scaly bastards didn't stand a chance get out of my tail quill i'm busy you want that array fixed then give me some space i can't believe we're actually gonna pay the bucket heads hey group is the true devil trying to chew on anything down there good keep it that way starting to think maybe it's just what it eats you know yeah the qz would have been an open buffet for something that eats wires whoa nice you made a cute little pen yeah it better stay out of my fur [Applause] [Music] you didn't mean to chew up the calms did you [Music] looks dirty enough you sure it'll be okay in there i bet our comms already wouldn't be all chewed up if we'd kept the llama in here i wonder what the future has in store for us more fighting perhaps next time we should get a contract with no fighting involved what would you be good for then dispatching enemies is not my only skill gamora did you find are those dolls yes no that doesn't matter the halos hopes in the taiyo system coordinates are in your console so why'd you close the view screen none of your business isn't it though sounds like you're trying to hide something from us yes i am hate to disappoint but i saw everything didn't really beg you as a doll collector and yes i value my life peter i'm not gonna kill you for asking about my collection that's good because last time so what if i collect them a lot of people have hobbies groot collects plants rockets obsessed with bombs yeah yeah and drax has a lot of really scary looking knives see nothing out of the ordinary i guess you know as a kid i collected stuff too baseball cards action figures you think collections are childish no no no that's not what i meant i'm messing with you peter i don't care what you think i just rather keep my hobbies to myself time's ticking away peter okay corel get ready to be impressed well it's probably moderating this ship waiting to see if we make the right choice [Music] looks like your girlfriend held up friend of the bargain quill we know for sure it's her checking [Music] same designation as before it's definitely so [Music] oh what are they doing to my relax standard nova port proceed my ship's fine which part ask quill he's the one who keeps crashing all right let's pay that fine hey want to take bets on if quills gonna get back with cop lately no in corral that would be surprising really quill's got lots going for him like um the hair you were being facetious you've been quite vocal about your dislike for peter quill's hairstyle rock it'll come around just try not to eat anything else okay i know there's some reason we're doing this but i still want to go on record that i don't want to be here and that being here is a mistake ready to pay our fine [Music] even groot can see you're here for some blueberry pie this reminds me of when i surrendered to the authorities what was it like liberating [Music] you ever been to the rock before yeah looks like every other nova corps station want to bet on who can flip off the most officers before they catch us not in the mood okay i thought you'd like that it ain't a station shaped like a rock it's a rock shaped like a station something tells me we'll be out of here faster than your prison sentence depends if you still plan on mating with centurion ko rel any chance you know how to get around this place you don't get around you're either brought in or you stick to the reception desk okay here we go if they so much as scratched her paints we get novacor to reduce our fire good luck with that it's gross negligent negligence that's what i said where is everybody most nova stations are heavily automated all synchronized by the world mind it is unsettling not like they had much choice after the war m designation milano move to holding space awesome present validated ticket to kiosk take it how the clark are we supposed to get off this block relax rocket it's standard procedure you keep saying that this isn't exactly my first nova core fine yours either first time i'm paying one larkin knew i should have stayed on board what coming rocket yeah yeah [Music] you know it does seem kind of extra empty around here good the fewer cops we gotta talk to the better your suspicion of law enforcement is itself suspicious forgive me if i don't like taking orders from a giant space computer okay it's not supposed to be this empty is it a holiday space cops don't take holidays hello [Music] we're here to pay a fine looking for centurion corral doors locked well we tried come on let's go we're not leaving we'll go to them if we have to look the door controls are on the other side if we can get you there [Music] so what now i'm supposed to hack nova core security i mean if you don't think you can cheap shot quill we are discussing breaking into a nova corps facility it ain't breaking in if no one's here that is precisely when one would break in any chance they're all just on break [Music] groot says the kiosk still says open i say it ain't our problem odd what is i mean besides all of this there's nothing not even a welcome screen it is on right they're always on constant connection to the world mind that's the point this one's been severed thirsty big guy this machine appears to be inoperable maybe they're just all out of your flavor yep it's locked thanks for taking my work yeah nova stack ain't that fancy don't expect me to hijack the world mind or anything i don't like this we really do need to get that door open hey i can crack it but the panel's over there and we're stuck here have you checked the other rooms peter hey drax get me a can of power star would you all right there's an air duct in here could be a way in rocket i think you can squeeze through this vent there one open air duct now we have damaged nova core property yeah just a little all right rocket see if this vent leads into that other room and be careful you know i still don't love this whole plan there's something screwy with the power grid it's like they're on backup only you could do this the whole time follow the circus and let me know which junction to switch prepare to be amazed oops nothing it's fine maybe uh just don't touch there fix there you go buddy free soda i will not add theft to our list of charges what's going on ain't this the way never a space top when you need it all right hey that sort of worked [Music] [Music] what are they doing scanning each other  if i know why though they're acting [Music] are here only bonkers pay our fine what are you doing i'm announcing our lawful intentions we trespassed only once discovering the entry abandoned there you hear that poor little guy a thing the sympathies are redundant someone out there i'm happy remember i did not there it is again hey uh hey there you go i'll stay out of your hair just let me out of here [Music] perhaps a deadly assassin infiltrated the facility hey i feel the same for you hey jumpsuit you got to get me out of here i don't belong in the cage nova corps begs to differ well no one asked you scary eyes we should not be aiding and abetting a criminal weren't you a nova corps prisoner indeed and i served my time what are you in for what nothing a case of mistaken identity they mistook me for someone who gave a crap i like him back at you weasel so how about helping a guy out see if there's a door release or something perhaps the sentient space computer summoned all november back to zander frank what did you do wonder where it took him congrats quilt you just executed your first prisoner that seems improbable maybe the station got hit i hear there's still shitari remnants who like to attack under protected nova spot there are no signs of a struggle it's like everyone just think of weird that's not possible maybe we just sent him back to his cell like that was the visitors area in my experience nova corps do not permit visitations you were in the kiln of course you weren't allowed visitors this isn't a super max hey buddy now this place brings back memories what no but i had to stand in a lineup once maybe twice anyway it's good to be on this side of the glass there's something bothering me screw it i ain't making any progress here it ain't spooky whoa that guy was serious business well now he's seriously someone else's business assuming that's the last we see him the whole station can be uninhabited it is not uninhabited it is inhabited by robots i like it better this way i'm getting a real haunted mansion vibe from this place and none of that screams run away to you elevators out but the shaft above looks open we can use it to climb up there you expect us to walk on that thing it'll hold more than the five of us please don't fall please don't fall okay piece of cake [Music] oh spooky were too are these centurion armor yup feel free to try one on quilt a true warrior requires no armor you wouldn't fit in one anyway you wear armors to expect failure for real can i try one if you want to get fried to a puddle of goat each one is gene coded by the world mind are you saying the world mind has the genetic code of every nova centurion yup word is the bugs tried to use that against them in the war but that's one super computer you can have believe me i try [Music] this looks like the only way forward are you blind i didn't sign up ah no wonder the door is all short now all right let's hope that holds how come this one gets its own room looks like a workshop you know i hear the anodized these things with some kind of zendarian smart metal metal cannot be smart smarter than some what do you think one of these suits would go for on the black market don't even think about it i'm not gonna i'm just asking you don't pay me enough quilt [Music] [Music] more nothing there's got to be an explanation the house hope is a capital ship maybe they're all there for some reason or maybe this whole place is contaminated with four marion pox i am experiencing a mild itching sensation yeah and i got a real pain in my ass [Music] rocket do your magic no what i said no when are you gonna come to your census quilt and then what he's gonna drag us halfway through this station if we let him okay we try one more room and if we still haven't found anything we leave deal fine one more room not two one [Music] [Music] door's flarped we ain't going back that way i thought the nova corps had more shifts i heard they got a staffing shoes from who people and places with other people peter quill i found this [Music] vector one check in sector 1 sweep complete 75 acceptance rate it is as she promised have faith the promise will be made real proceed to sector 7 with faith well the good news is we're not alone there's lots of chatter tell them i want my back my ship i sense there's a bet but it sounds like they're searching for something or someone could explain why no one's around who gives a flark tell them to get there has been to some promise permission to initiate cleansing procedure cleansing procedure authorized faith be with you keep looking or we could focus on getting off this protect the space station the door is floored remember there's ways to inflate things gamora believe me bombs don't count what about that where do you think that goes down good enough for me [Music] hey what happened to one more room you said the door's busted i'm sure it's just a little further you ain't sure a stunt i'm mostly sure we found something didn't we so why the flock can you speak up it was weird there was something funky about the voices on that comm channel this is a mutiny it was an execution i've never seen cops kill each other we've got to play this smart until we know what's going on and which side survived [Music] you
