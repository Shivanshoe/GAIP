first that karja huntress now this outlander i'll keep some extra on hand from one hunter to another [Music] another outlander what do you want is there some sort of problem the problem is foreigners you're the second one i've seen today sooner you all go the better this soil will be less chance of bad seeds taking root i would have thought easing your land god's pain would have earned some good will around here but rey is going to die anyway just like all of us meanwhile outlanders come taking what little we have left just like that karja huntress i saw earlier all dressed up like a bird dragging an ataru girl behind her like a slave called the girl a thrush never heard that before must be some old karja curse wait a karja huntress with an utaru thrush what am i talking to myself here yes saw them just today running southwest likely to their deaths can't harvest the stinger fruit there too many machines poor girl whoever she is may her seeds find fertile soil i know you didn't mean to but you may have just helped me find an old friend thanks don't need your thanks don't want it i need to meet laurel and zoe in plain song ask the chorus if we can go into their sacred cave none of this should be inside if i can get it i can reboot gaia and then maybe we can figure out who those strangers in the proving lab were but first i might want to head southwest to find an old friend see what she's doing out here and maybe explore a little is that the savior of meridian well i've got some news for you better gear up if you're going into otaru territory red the tanakhs have been raiding villages all over the plains writing machines no less though i hear the village of river him up north's been putting up a fight thanks for the advice uh uh [Music] so ah huh back crazy i know something's up oh [Music] made it uh so so a cauldron if i can reach its core i should get enough data to override some new machines [Music] [Music] is you see that milo you have to wait for an opening [Music] care to join the hunt shake it off keep fighting oh [Music] cute much better nicely done likewise come over here [Music] despite the nora you're the slayer of redma the savior of meridian milo is my new thrush she joined the hunter's lodge shortly after the battle of the spire she's heard a few stories about our hunts together stay and rest make sure you take some medicinal plants for that wound so what brings you all the way out here are the machines back east to tame for you not quite i'm looking for someone a karja hunter about my age name's amadeus he came out here on his own a while back and now he's missing this man you're looking for is he another hunter from the launch he'd hate to hear you say that it's a long story but he's a former noble we met out in the wilds after i was wounded on a hunt he healed me then helped put a stop to machines that were threatening a nearby village after that we uh parted ways sounds like there's more to the story ah another time so me lose your new thrush guess that means a hawk can sponsor more than one now things have changed at the hunter's lodge now all who seek to become the best hunters are welcomed as members no matter their tribe don't worry you're still my favorite thrush you're really shaking things up as i promised when i became sunhawk and as for milo she believes learning to hunt will help her ailing tribe who am i to say no to that the last time we met you had left meridian on a contract to hunt a deadly new machine several klost riders it turned out the hunter killer too you said you were feeling restless his life is sunhawk that boring well i had just left the city i couldn't stand being cooped up with bureaucratic regulations and formalities but my time out in the wilds helped me realize the lodge needs to be more than a glorified trophy hall our hunters should be the spears that safeguard our civilians like my father and brother were sounds like a big challenge i don't remember others in the lodge being so open-minded some are the rest will get a boot out the door and i'll get back to it as soon as i find a modest i can help you find your friend i know you must have your own reasons for being out this way but i'd be glad to have your help what was he doing out here he lost someone close to him during the red raids he was heading to the side of the battle to finally lay them to rest milo and i were on our way there now the battlefield's near i can still come with you no go to stone's echo heal wait for me there and think on today's lesson but you're no good distracted by pain go all hunters need to recover from time to time yes sunhawk it's been an honor will she be okay on her own of course she's my thrash come the battle feels this way huh i was wondering when you'd be back should we move on like i was saying so this battlefield you said it was part of the red raids the battle of burning blooms amadeus was part of the karja army that pushed into the west his division attacked the tanakh but they underestimated the enemy's forces it was a massacre i never thought you'd be friends with someone who participated in the red raids oh don't worry he was one of the good ones he tried to stop the attack but it was too late between you and he's been on the run ever since and you think something went wrong for him out here don't worry we'll track him down he promised he would get a message back to me i waited but in a this is the field where the tanakh slaughtered the karja looks like time in while we're overloaded signs of battle there are a lot of footprints it must be recent let's take a look couch is full but my pack has room heavy footprints maybe awesome it's too many to tell if a modest is with them i better look around my focus might show me more a modest was supposed to be alone why were us around here light prince not awesome maybe karjai looks like there's a trail i can follow with my focus talana i think i got something tracks that head away from the battlefield lead the way i don't get it why would a modest keep going west maybe there's something else around here looks pretty abandoned to me what's he doing out here maybe he saw a modest let's ask him let me get do not worry i am not the cardia hitting kind just an old scavenger grateful for a little company name's lel you two must be lost actually we're looking for someone a karja hunter he would have been traveling alone clothes would have been well worn yes he was here poking around the old battlefield wanted to know what happened lucky for him odlel hears all the stories karja army charged straight into the waiting tonight most burned but others the tanakh marched back west your man wanted to know where told him i've heard rumors of a place called the rot what is it ita knocked prison or a karzai graveyard depending on how you look at it where is this place further west in tanaka territory but that did not stop him and asaram caravan was camping out at the battlefield about to head the same way he joined them they all went west towards the ridge thanks well we have to get going good hunting out there let's head west to the ridge then if we find this caravan maybe we'll find a modest lead on you mentioned a modest lost someone close to him at the battle do you think the tanakh took them prisoner instead i don't know maybe here i come a shell snapper who hasn't seen us yet we can use that hawk and thrush just like old times [Music] my so now the fun starts [Music] here celebrated [Music] uh hmm gotta say feels good to hunt by your side again come on let's head into the tunnel it's a dead end looks like a cave-in so what happened to the caravan let's look around maybe your second site can help but i still need some kind of code to open that doesn't look like there's anything i can do now a bunch of awesome supplies a dead end to lana i think i found something in the rubble what is it [Applause] what does it say he was part of the caravan that went through here the note ends abruptly when that tunnel started to collapse i guess oh but there's nothing here about a karja hunter and an earlier caravan made it through before the collapse sounds like they went to a watering hole on the other side so he could have made it is there another way through i don't know these mountains are pretty steep then i'll have to find a way thank you eloy for coming with me this far but i've taken up enough of your time here take this may it help you on your own hunt hold on how do i get in contact with you if i find a way across the mountains i'll check in with milo with stones echo whenever i can if you find a way leave wood with her i will good luck you too talana seems really worried about her friend i wish there was more i could do but i don't think there's a way past these mountains right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it what you need is a beer a bath and a bed [Music] tell your friends where you bought it last time i'll tell you i'm not getting paid enough for this first bristle backs now to knocks attacking baron light should have never messed with a tanakh in the first place best get all the supplies you need my friend these parts just got a whole lot more dangerous javad said the bristlebacks were first spotted west of the quarry i should see if there's anything in the back of the valley [Music] better shake off this wet oh dead machines a trap looks like someone's been trying to keep this trail clear [Music] those people are under attack hey you up there aren't you gonna help not my job i'm just here to keep an eye on things oh [Music] oh i'll help the norah that's the last of them better check on the refugees yes the show's over [Music] is it bad lucasia shh now everything will be fine is everyone okay bruised but not buried our order will live to see another day are you sure about that we're no strangers to hardship nora we've crossed half the sundom with no more than the clothes on our backs and as soon as our sun priest returns our path will be clear for now we wait well you're better off waiting somewhere else your people need shelter there's a town east a chain scrape yes we know of it sabohar says it's not suitable for us who our sun priest our order has made it this far thanks to his guiding light okay and where is this he went up to the tower to meditate three days ago and he won't come down until the sun shows him the way to our new home the fallen storm bird is an omen he said and of course it must be i see and how long do you plan on waiting for him until he returns he will return he must your shadow karja aren't you we are the order of twilight the difference being when the usurper avod killed his father we fled with the karja in shadow to sunfal our lives there were difficult sabbahar saw our misery lifted us up protected us from the corrupt priests and heartless kestrels when their rule ended savohar led us from the shadowlands the long night ends and the setting sun will lead us to salvation he said and so he named us the order of twilight we journeyed west in search of a better life why didn't you go back to meridian avad is a patricide we will not kneel to the likes of him we must walk in twilight to our new home sabohar will lead us there uh-huh there's an asaram and chain scrape talland he wants the storm bird up there yes he was here just yesterday a very unpleasant man even by asaram standards he made all manner of threats but we will not be intimidated that's all well and good but he's got friends sooner or later his whole gang will show up sabohar will come through he always does we just need to give him more time you're out of time lakasha you need to consider packing up and we won't leave him and we won't let others disrupt his meditation well they're going to try your priest sabohar you said he's been up there three days his meditation can't be rushed so he does this often meditating for days on end well it doesn't usually take this long but he will guide us through he always has we have faith sure but shelter looks like a more pressing concern look at yourselves those machines nearly wiped you out and osram thugs are watching you just waiting to strike you're in danger here you need to grab savohar and get out [Music] our situation this is the worst we've endured i know we cannot stay here but without sabohar to guide us i i don't let me up there and i'll convince him it's time to move on but his meditation if he hasn't received his vision he won't follow at least let me check on him if he's been up there for days yes yes that is sensible i suppose please be careful the trail up to the tower is falling apart sabohar is strong but it could not have been an easy climb it rarely is let the nora pass pack's full but my stash has room looks like i should head up huh uh part of the ladder akasha was right the trail's in bad shape this looks recent must have broken off when savohar climbed up here huh oh okay now how to climb higher ladder must have broken off after salvajar passed through i need to find another way up you make an interesting color for my armor broken bridge i might be able to make the jump to the other side that's a lot of blood savage he must have hurt himself pretty bad getting over the bridge it's not looking good looks like he left a trail i can follow with my [Music] focus there's the storm bird getting closer [Applause] i can grab this from my stash later machines sabor must have snuck past them i could probably slip past them or take them out okay [Applause] you can get data to override machines from cauldrons just what oh huh oh oh about that that's all of them i'll gather these while i can uh [Music] some are in pretty bad shape the true sun above me the true sun before me show me the way this even tight show me the way this event no no the vessel must be empty for the coming vision you don't need a vision you need medical attention on the way up i saw parts of the trail had given way is that how you hurt yourself my pain all part of a ritual you're hurt bad and your people are running out of time staring at the stormbird isn't solving anything you don't understand the omen it fell here at the beacon i just need to see the twilight planet and my people will find their home listen makasha is doing the best she can down there but machine attacks angry asaram the order is scared so far the last race of even times will burn away their fear i don't think so what do you think's gonna happen here if you sit long enough the sun will show you something a path to a new home a fallen machine can only mean it the storm has passed salvation is that or some awesome shot it and it hit an old tower [Music] look i think you punctured a lung you can't heal it with prayer the sun will provide and i will not lose faith i'd be more concerned about losing blood your people are worried about you they need shelter security the truth i love me the true sign before show me the way [Music] i think you've been staring at your salvation this whole time gotta get over to that storm bird grab its heart [Music] huh heart is valuable enough to feed all the refugees waiting below and his answer is sunstroke in a prayer why does every priest i meet think blind faith is the answer to everything this pigment would work well on armor that was watching the refugees probably went to get tall and i gotta get them out of here before he comes back guess i'll figure out what to do with it later there the order should be able to afford shelter with this heart some food and a change of clothes wouldn't hurt either how you holding up i need to get back over there so far [Music] i guess you did the best you could rest easy now i'll make sure your people are safe i should let lukasha know and give her the stormbird heart come on don't make this difficult get out of the way now i'm a generous gent so i'll give you one more chance to make it easy on yourselves and clear out we won't let you pass asaram if you choose bloodshed that's on your conscience ain't it just like the cards are to make things harder than they have to be okay boys you heard her get your consciences ready hold on now talland you again listen i'm all out of patience here i clip that storm bird's wings the salvage is mine i don't care who gets in my way nor savages or shadow cars or fleabags i'm taking it [Music] well from what i hear the law says that whoever gets the salvage first keeps it which in this case is me am i right you took the heart i shot that storm bird me am i right she's right buzz blasted love shut up okay you win hey i'm doing fine i don't need that salvage anyhow but these people need all the help they can get come on boys back to chain scrape i need a drink hey again we thank you you're welcome now take this heart use it to buy food clothes shelter for your people maybe even land to build a new home hey this is salvatore must make these decisions no i'm i'm sorry lakasha zavahar isn't coming back he's gone i know it's hard but your people need a leader now go to chainscrape talk to the forage woman there petra give her the stormbird heart she'll look after you and your people until you can get back on your feet find your path i'll do my best eloy what choice do i have here please accept this it is modest but i hope it helps in some small way to chain scrape then yes get this from my stash when i need it i think i have enough bitter leaf [Music] dead brussel back for the falls check it out it's strange parts of it have been tampered with almost like an override i have charged off the cliff above i should keep going up the trail i know it's mine a lot of broken trees it's like a stampede went through is this where the bristlebacks came from unless this cave leads out of the daunt okay let's see where this leads what the old car tracks collapsed it looks recent guess i'm not going that way there's smoke from deeper in the mine respects so they did come through here [Music] they must have gotten trapped i'm gonna have to take them out before i can look around [Music] ah [Applause] come on come on [Music] uh okay better take a look at where the smoke's coming from room on me i can send it to my stash [Music] there's a lot of smoke looks like mine runs pretty far back [Music] there's enough blaze here to blast a mountain open and there's a load on one of the barrels smells addressed to oven looks like this mine was supposed to be shut down everyone must have gotten greedy kept blasting deeper into the mountain i should let javad know what i found until bristleback stampeded through maybe the explosions blew away open but from where the charger herb lauren's contract mentioned should be close by i want to go for the contract one more time make sure i didn't miss anything here are the chargers if i can take a few of them down it should lure in the scrappers i'm looking for so exploring cauldrons might teach me how to override these things huh what [Music] subscribers uh that should bright circus a bit that's one [Music] that should do it time to take these parts back to learned oh perfect timing huntress i got you the scrapper jaws you needed ah some fine components here your payment i hope you'll consider taking the other contract it'll be worth it i'm positive good call i could feel the pressure building to it what news do you bring picked up the bristleback trail by the quarry looks like they stampeded out of a mine at the back of the valley the mine how could a herd of bristle backs come from there i'm not sure but alvin's workers were using explosives to tap the tunnels inside for the love of dawn i told him it wasn't worth the risk those tunnels they run for miles underground even beyond the daunt no you don't think that alvin's blasting opened up a passage from the other side perhaps yes perhaps if this is true we need confirmation an inquiry so thorough so irrefutable endorsed by the savior all right i'll keep looking i need to go of course if they attack from the north they might have a camp up that way [Music] uh shut that machine down quick with shotgun away from the main camp that might be where regal is keeping our machines uh [Music] so one fight avoided [Music] all right now to see what the rebels were up to here better check in that cave [Music] oh foreign i can grab this from my stash leader what [Music] a drawbridge maybe that's one half of the bridge i had to drop the other side there bridge is down [Music] [Music] [Music] it looks like it fell into a tunnel so the rebels were keeping bristlebacks here the machines fell into the tunnel which must have collapsed as they ran further in what if alvin's explosives created the sinkhole i should head back to chainscrape to let javad now [Music] and the tunnel's blocked yep not going that way [Music] so you've returned from the west any luck the bristlebacks were being penned by tanakh rebels on the other side of the mountains alvin's explosives opened up a sinkhole dropping them into the tunnels which they followed to the mine and out into the daunt right aside from the rebels if anyone is to blame for the bristlebacks it's olphant radiant beams of the sun and all this time he was pointing the finger at us bring ovent here petra too [Music] [Music] summoned like a blasted ale winch you best be meaning to put pen to parch patch why what she here i live here too lug nut so what's this about um thanks to the savior the sun has shown the truth on the bristleback incursion tanakh rebels were keeping pens of machines on the other side of the mountains a sinkhole swallowed them releasing them into the underground tunnels that led east and out into the daunt so it was an accident but let us not forget that it was the karja i'm not done the sinkhole only formed due to your unauthorized blasting in the southern mine you are responsible for the machine rampage the workers we lost the destruction the bristlebacks caused all of it my dear magistrate has your precious son baked your senses i would never give such an order without first consulting you evidence says otherwise eloy found the shipping manifest in the mine you skirted the laws of the sundom elephant all for a few extra shards not to mention you sent that oversized tool over there to intimidate refugees over some salvage should have been mine oh that steel is already struck get over it uh i i demand an official investigation i won't be the victim of some car just schemes certainly we'll conduct a thorough inquest into everything the bristlebacks the refugees every business deal you ever put your name to well that that's not necessary is it what if i just returned to the cling oh well that would save the crown the cost of course i'll be on my way as soon as i wrap up some previous commitments tie up some loose ends after all the welfare of chain scrapes people in a transition like this you're leaving right now chain scrape will be just fine you think she can run this scorched out forged dump knock yourself out get out oh don't want you don't need to go first mud looks good on you alvin as the sun burns away shadow thank you for that eloy oh he got it coming here please accept this token of gratitude you've done the sundom and my sanity a great service and i believe we have some matters to discuss guess we do not the most pleasant boots to fill but i'll wear them all thanks to you flame hair okay chain scraper would be better off with petra in charge about time he went crawling back to whatever [Music] [Music] the blight is worse here if i don't get gaia up and running it'll be like this everywhere [Music] even though it's killing everything who are you there's laurel [Music] i'm here as promised but singing does it mean the chorus is ready it is assembled i couldn't have done it without varrell but i don't know what good it will do the chorus is in disharmony the subject of the cave is bad enough land god fought still hasn't emerged and every day more deadly machines try to force their way out throwing themselves against the defensive cordon we set up around the entrance that is only the first of many false notes your request has exposed deep divisions within the chorus itself and the tribe i get that the cave is sacred but how did asking to go inside caused such a fuss the fuss was already there many in the tribe and most in the chorus want to keep doing what we have for generations which often is nothing but there are others who call for change or extreme measures [Music] your request has given fresh life to the debate right tradition i've run into that before but each tribe has to be dealt with in their own way if you say so you said you couldn't have assembled the chorus without him what did you do some in the chorus refuse to meet to consider your request they believe that the cave belongs to the land gods alone but varl saw that what you did with ray could be used to our advantage sometimes it isn't enough to ask the people in charge you need others to ask for you as many as possible we spread the word about how you soothe dre there may even have been a little exaggeration growing interest put pressure on the chorus until they finally agreed to meet i saw it work a few times with the matriarchs and even with my mother once or twice nice job you can handle the politics from now on oh no i'm sure we'll still need you to cut through them from time to time [Music] so what happened to the land gods after the derangement they faltered year by year once they were peaceful and now they turn on us when we approach even attack us they had always enriched the soil but for several seasons they've glutted it endlessly with mulch the fields have turned fettered a blight that that keeps spreading even beyond our lands we used to have food for all now we barely have enough to feed our children must be over fertilization spread by spores i don't know that's not even the end of it each land god used to visit the sacred cave once a year but no longer without the rituals of renewal they're falling apart like rey they're dying in my tribe with them so the chorus is assembled what now they're considering your request then shouldn't we go talk to them when you're ready but don't worry their debate won't end any time soon meetings like these can go on for days all right then maybe i should resupply first who knows how many machines are in that cave assuming the chorus agree to allow you inside aloy can be pretty convincing in these situations we'll see do what you need to prepare we'll wait for you above where the chorus has gathered [Music] may you always which so the rumors are true you must be the soldier who took down regal as champion and the one who's got this place in an uproar what's a tanakh doing in plainsong resupplying for a trip to the hunting grounds you should come by it's just northwest of here that a sturdy soldier like yourself could handle the trials there but i could maybe i'll see you there i prefer the sound of machines to singing as soon as i get my supplies so says [Music] nervous bringing an outlander before the chorus i hope this works it'll be worth it so you'll see so the singing just keeps going i guess that means the chorus is still in session the people sing to soothe the chorus to help them break their impasse it wouldn't be necessary if they were in harmony [Music] i'm not gonna have to sing back am i of course not the singing will stop when we present ourselves are you ready all right let's go talk to them [Music] me [Music] oh speak [Music] your sacred cave there's something inside i need and if i can get it joe and the nora have spread word of your story and what you want we know of no spirit in the cave only far our land god who entered the cave and did not return the power of the land gods is broken we are diminished tales of spirits will not help us nothing will we weaken we die and become fertile ground for new life this is the natural order wait you're all just going to sit around until you become food for worms literally so says the outlander ignorant of our beliefs please remember how she brought peace to rey listen to her we've heard such temerity from you before zou let us not forget that you agitated for reckless war against the karja at least she's trying to help how by inviting you to break our traditions should we change our ways to suit every impudent outsider who wanders into plain song no you should change your ways because your own lands are killing you [Music] we have stood by and watched as our land gods waste away you would have us do the same with our neighbors our children and this lone outlander can save us [Music] nonsense [Music] a single seed matters little in the infinite cycle of growth and decay [Music] an alarm it's coming from the mountains it's an alarm machines must have broken through the cordon i thought we need to get down there what about the chorus if the cordon has fallen there is nothing left to prevent us from going in the cave the time for permission is over then off we go [Music] this way aloy fighting in the fields ahead is not gonna hurt that thing much [Applause] i've seen these machines before machines are everywhere everyone do you really think we can do something about all of this all right [Music] more machines fire on metal now's my chance can you use this dark attack these machines are stronger deadlier than normal there's more than just in that cave now we must press on this trail is the path of the landcards it'll lead us to the cordon more machines we can take them out on your lead machines down they don't stand against this is a find [Applause] let's go right behind you [Music] i'll save this for a diary we're almost there so many machines broke through what happened to the gordon's defenders you better be ready for anything knocking down [Music] [Music] [Music] recording oh what's left of it so many of them they will be mourned when the time is right from now we must keep going into the cave this will be in my stash when i need it we shouldn't linger here aloy we should head into the cave a kind of wall made of light we'll have to find a way around we'll follow your lead eloy up here i'll pick these up what's that ahead like a cauldron door to understand what's going on in there you're gonna need one of these [Music] on the temple just like this [Music] there's blue light on the door yeah it takes some getting used to don't worry i'll help now listen the machines we've been fighting they're different more dangerous that means there's something very powerful somewhere beyond that door and it wants us dead follow my lead and be ready for anything [Music] let's go we have to find the core of this place there's so much metal who built this place machines not like any you've seen before we'll have to take them out right behind me wow huh so this is a cauldron where machines are born it looks like one but if the land gods come and go then they aren't just made here they're being repaired too and the spirit is in here i have a feeling that's not all those cables are glowing i've seen them before they're like an infection that thing i sent and wants is dead it takes over places like these and makes killer machines it's called a festus looks like those cables are blocking the way up you two wait here i'll find another path activated something looks like parts of those pillars are rotating maybe if i shoot the gears i can lock them into place make a path up that worked how are you doing this place but i had to right to help you and ailoy to find far you did the right thing so might be a way across if i can get them into the right position another floor panel but i can't shoot the gears on the pillars from here maybe if i can find something to weigh this down i i think i can get the crate for that shield so i'll have to go around okay getting there the gears on the pillars should be exposed now looks like there are only two pillars this time there should be able to get across now she's so high up don't fall aloy how's it going up there eloy i think i'm getting close one more set of pillars there should be a floor panel nearby to activate them stuff for the stash is nothing like this okay [Music] as fast as his cables are all over that note maybe i can override it the cables are moving they're drawing back we can climb up that vent [Music] how do we cross cables are twisted around that node on the other side i'll see if i can get to it we'll wait here whoa that was quite a jump okay now how to get up to the node all this metal cold winter in here huh all right let's see what we can do come on over youtube who is that hephaestus it's taken over this whole place secondly matrix fine looks like there's another node on the other side near that door go do your thing how to get to that node on the other side okay there's a platform down there i think i can reach it if i glide i think i can hit your ride on one of those metal carriers yep wasn't planning on it okay now what she'll be able to glide cycles assessment complete who is hephaestus what does it want with this place it's taken over facilities before to build deadly machines but it wasn't always hostile i used to be part of something good something called gaia more of those cables covering that door i think we're almost at the core be ready you've got your back oh no what is the fastest done to her turn it into a weapon which sooner or later will be unleashed and then plain song if my people see what it has become if one of our gods attacks you know what we have to do laurel are you ready we have to get down there that dome of light is it protecting the machine yeah there should be a node i can override nearby to shut it down [Music] here we go more machines are coming she's i can use them against it ugh oh it's done morning a machine that nearly killed us it's still her god i do not grieve for a god or a machine but because i no longer know what to believe look so if you want you can go back home do i still have one and if so for how long can you really heal our lands save my people one step at a time but it starts now retreat [Music] um [Music] not bad up we go there's more like eloy said this is only the beginning [Music] you
