there i thought all your stuff was at the fisheye but i guess that's not where we're going just shut up and follow me [Music] [Music] hmm so is frank happy i gave him control of the tower i didn't

today i was pulling civilians out of that dark zone i told you about with killian it was my first dark zone ever it wasn't that bad except for just this one thing we saved a mother and her children who got trapped in there and i have no idea what got into me but i wanted to go deeper i wanted to keep going find one more family one more child make sure no one was left behind i had to make sure killian tried to tell me would clear the dark zone for some reason i didn't believe him we argued middle of it all a [ __ ] viral jumped on my back i thought it was i'm alive only because of killian i wish i could talk to you about this [Music] [Music] here i got your sneakers you should also have this [Music] i didn't realize you and hackon had been together why do you think he's so high on my hit list yeah that makes sense just cause someone reads poetry doesn't mean they don't deserve to die did you guys break up because he abandoned frank or did he abandon frank because you broke up there's really no point in analyzing that now aiden whatever happened it was a mistake okay i should have never been so naive that's why i didn't want you snooping around for [ __ ] sake you could have just respected that i'm sorry forget we went there just leave me alone [Music] the one what's going on you just don't give up do you you should know that by now you should know i [ __ ] hate whimpering saying how you feel isn't whimpering fine stick around if you have to but don't interrupt me i'm busy getting drunk no you dork looking at the stars hey i can see the big dipper hmm aren't you brilliant except that's not the big dipper oh whoops it was worth a try though you know any other constellations yeah frank taught me a lot about the night sky back in the day we were building the fisheye and i'd climb the scaffolding all the way up to the roof frank would come up to tell me it's too cold too late and whatnot but i always ended up telling stories for hours and hours and i love to listen the stars are so clear seem close enough you could grab them by the balls frank's way of putting it nice huh what about you aiden and what about me do pilgrims get their hearts broken uh well i'm we tend to just forget it wow the shy type [Music] looks like your constellation is sickness see whatness bear look the swan when i stargaze i always find the swan first you're making all this up to impress me maybe maybe not are you impressed [Music] pretty much in that poem it's just words aiden words mean things love's not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks just words huh yeah just words [Music] so did you meet hack on when you were building the fisheye with frank he and frank used to hang out with each other a lot they were friends it's a simple story really i was a young girl looking for attention he didn't mind having his fun [Music] the good thing is lesson learned for life [Music] you still care don't you otherwise why make me go into the apartment yeah i care aidan about the person i am now that's why i didn't want to go back there so the weak little girl that lived there doesn't get the better of me anymore i used to hate her no i'm so over her [Music] um let's uh let's get some sleep aiden if i see hakkon i'm gonna kill him simple as that don't try to stop me that's fine but you know revenge doesn't make you feel better this isn't for me that's for frank i will avenge everyone who died that night a lot of stars winked out forever hakkon talks big but when it came down to it he bailed on his friends and they died he showed his real face [ __ ] coward you can't turn back the clock true but i can stop his [ __ ] clock and i [ __ ] will now good night eden good morning villadore it's a brand new day a brand new world this is your friend frank broadcasting yes that's right broadcasting from the fisheye from now on i'll be bringing you all the good news from around philadelphia helping transform this city back into the community it once was lawan lawan you there right folks let's start this new chapter with some inspirational music for you aidan you're there come to the canteen no offense frank but i really don't have any more time for you matt was going to help me find my sister but i gave the tower to you instead and now i'm i'm [ __ ] calm down come to the fisheye and we'll talk i might have an idea i want to help you aiden [Music] fine be there soon oh [Music] yep um [Music] three two [Music] [Music] inhibitor container nearby uh [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] ah [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] hmm [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the one it's aidan come in hello one come on luan answer me you there great i fixed the transmitter and now you go radio silent [Music] this is frank on radio free velador your neighbor your city once more and forevermore signing off talk to me frank look we started off on the wrong foot [Music] i'd like to correct that mistake have a drink yeah for me frank i really don't have time for this i have to find another way to find my just listen [Music] you get it that's why we have to find that pilgrim he's offering a lot of [ __ ] crystals for what he's got and a lot of boosters do i have your attention now with those renegades yes but how did you the tv station used to be controlled by the military they did more than just broadcast from there [Music] thanks to you we can now listen in on the enemy it appears that waltz is looking for the same database you're after but the observatory is completely soaked with chemicals i have no idea how this gre crap works but waltz sure seems to know maybe the observatory is not the only place to access the database is this conversation all you have for now but if we got close to their position and hacked into their frequency we could collect more intel on what's his plans how the transmission you heard was intercepted near an old military antenna in the wharf just south of martian lane if we activate that antenna it'll boost the signal and we'll be able to hear everything they say every syllable and you'd know exactly what waltz is up to [Music] it'd be quicker if i could just find him you're impatient i understand i know what it feels like to have wasted too much time but you have to tread carefully remember you said waltz turn the power back on then the renegades invaded the central loop there's something going on so best to collect as much intel as we can before you confront him so you think waltz ordered the renegades into the central loop well until now the colonel kept him on a short leash in his stronghold but the savages we've been seeing lately what the [ __ ] something must have changed one of the pks told me that walt is after something called uh x-13 doesn't ring any balls tell me more about these antennas the military installed them on the tallest buildings to blanket the entire city they're extremely hard to access but all we need is the one nearest to where those renegades were based when the signal's stronger we'll be able to hear everything they say now the good thing is it's the closest antenna to the canteen you shouldn't have trouble finding it anything else before i get going oh one more thing look at that poster aiden night runners used to abide by that creed live by it i used to think we were as torn apart as that piece of paper but the creed still means something and if you increase the range i can contact the remnants of the old night runners some must still be alive i see it now this means a lot to you doesn't it not just me to everyone here but there's one piece missing do you know why i haven't thrown this poster away in all this time because of luann when i saw her for the first time she was maybe what eight nine years old she was barely alive she looked like she hadn't eaten in a year and she was trying to help some kids get a crystal back from the thief the guy was threatening them with a knife he was twice their size stronger and she jumped on him bitty's hands so deep that he screams were heard as far away as old villador after that she gave the crystal to one of the boys and left she didn't get anything out of it she didn't have to risk it i looked at her and thought this is all we have left as humans we can fight one another everybody just for themselves or no matter what we can stand up for each other then i wrote down his credo that little girl helped the night runners become who they were for years and if we are to be reborn we cannot do it without her why not without her you see she's a tough one maybe too tough but i trained her helped heal her wounds but never healed the biggest one revenge she's built a mighty thick wall around herself can't seem to let go of her anger if she doesn't it could destroy her i know i know drunk calling the kettle black right i'm in no position to judge frank thanks noah's so [ __ ] obsessed with her kill list she needs to throw that damn thing away otherwise it'll kill her let's hope she's better fighting them than i am what are lawan's demons almost too many to count but satan himself is at the top you mean hakkon you know him yeah we've met it all came down to the tv station mission hakkon was against that from the start got kilian on his side he said it was suicide but i know the truth the [ __ ] chickened out plain and simple till then he wasn't just a night runner to me i thought he was leader material but he didn't have our backs tore the creed in half before he bought it and with it tore apart the night runners themselves [ __ ] coward didn't deserve to lick lawns boots [Music] look i'm starting to get pissed off and we should focus what about hack on killing lucas that took some balls sure but they weren't his balls they were waltzes hakan's just the guy's lap dog now sit roll over assassinate that's true neutered dogs are even more obedient than they were before exactly [Music] okay i'm on my way then go get them i'll be on the radio you remind me of lawan before she became obsessed with that goddamn hit list of hers i'll get ears on the renegades for you i'll find out what waltz is up to i promise [Music] good day villadore frank is back and i've got some more exciting news for you blankets food and drinking water are being collected at the canteen all those in need can report to nicolas stay tuned and i'll be back soon with another message of hope meanwhile enjoy the music god how rich do you have to be to eat crystals the worst thing is [Music] uh [Music] ugh hey frank that's uh that's way up there yeah gre made them hard to reach for a reason keeps him away from the bad guys but for a guy like you aiden piece of cage is hmm yes uh two [Music] [Music] [Music] who does frank think he is one minute he talked about my potential the next he accuses me of reckless behavior says that i put others in danger back at the dark zone after we pulled that mother and her kids out [ __ ] we pulled it off didn't we what's so reckless about success he spewed some line at me about how he's worried my metabolism isn't handling the shots as well as he thought it would can you believe this crap pops my test results were always perfect if you ask me it says more about him than about me he just can't bear someone standing up to him especially not a young kid oh and check this out i was put on notice he'd be watching me he said [ __ ] him i'll give him something to watch [Music] [Music] huh [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] okay [Music] uh frank i got the antenna going okay let's see what these bastards are talking about [Applause] they said they're going to meet waltz heading east there's another antenna on top of a condominium at the intersection of saint paul boulevard in peach street just by the entrance of the main canal get it working and we can keep up with them got it [Music] uh aidan the colonel seems to be evacuating renegade camps first the electricity then central loop rates now this it seems that williams doesn't want to fight any more than we do or he really intends to close the sluice gates and back the chemicals up into the city but his stronghold will be destroyed as well so this evacuation wouldn't make sense we need to expand the range to find out more yes oh [Music] [Music] you can't [Music] hey frank i activated the second antenna the renegades were here on the roof speaking of renegades hearing more chatter meetings waltz will be there to give us orders anything new about that pilgrim no but he found someone who'll help him access the database if you know something new about that [ __ ] pilgrim let me know keep walking over and out frank i need to get to where they are you heard the maiden waltz is looking for you he's got a way to access the database i found someone he's too strong for you and you'll be playing straight into his hand if that's the only way to find out the truth and so be it you're stopping kiddo stubborn like the one i'll be in touch [Music] wow just let me go it's easy see what was right these [ __ ] worries dropping on us first him then we'll get that gre employee from the old philadelphia and the boss will be over the moon where's waltz we don't need waltz to deal with you oh good old frank so naive warning people talking way too much got him great night [Music] yes aidan aidan you're right i think so yeah waltz wasn't here and they know we're eavesdropping on them i know you know someone tried to tip me off but the warning came too late are you sure you're okay yeah i my infection just flared up the renegades were talking about some gre doctor from the bazaar waltz is looking for him too former green old velador i'll look into it who tried to tip you off well that's the strangest part it was hack on he wants to meet with you i thought he left the city well he's still kicking and he'll be waiting for you at the church on simple island he's got the goods on waltz and hell and maybe he knows something about lawan too what do you mean something more i'm afraid she's found a lead on hakkon and she means to hunt him again which means she could get herself into trouble do you know what really made the night run a special aiden i mean true heroes it wasn't the inhibitors not the strength or speed they granted us for the night runners it was balance that set us apart self-control that's why lawan couldn't become a night runner not because she was too young she was the fastest braver than a lot of my men but she couldn't achieve balance i'm self-control this should be good don't laugh we used inhibitors but they didn't use us we had a focus on mental and emotional strength not just physical abilities balance physical strength is important but it's what you do with it that determines what kind of human being you are that's why hackon's betrayal hurt us so much why do you think he knows anything about lawn first of all because she was after him but also because it's much more complicated than that you see the last time she went off radar like this was when this [ __ ] dumped her so if she's not answering now i'm getting really worried this is something more and hack on could be involved i'll go meet with hackhead frank you try and find out what happened to luann just remember they're listening to you two will do aiden be careful who knows what hakkon is up to i'm going back to the fisheye good luck [Music] you have one so uh [Music] [Music] um frank the church is empty what are you talking about well hackon's not here but it looks like the renegades were camped here their fire's still smoldering hey then why did you want to meet hackon why not it's been a while looks like you've made some new friends how is lawan by the way wait don't you know where she is no but what i do know is that someone's been killing williams top officers each with a single crossbow boat sounds like lawan's ammo doesn't it okay pilgrim time to get down to business [Music] he's still on walt's leash i see enough chitchat aiden give me the key what the gre key aiden give it to me i don't want to fight with you petey i don't care what you want i saved your life at the bazaar oh you saved my life i saved yours we're even whatever you might think we're not friends never were now give me the key you know i won't do that get that [ __ ] key from him [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] you've made quite a name for yourself in this [ __ ] though is that what you wanted are you really ready to kill me for that key hakkon with so many people have died already you can't stop the wheel from turning now but you had a chance to kill me and to take it from me at the bazaar what changed well what do you think kid you promised to get me out of the city we had a deal but then you ratted me out do you think waltz will just let you go just like that you know what he did to dylan to to all the others yeah but they all stood in his way dylan betrayed him lucas wouldn't give up the key so so you murdered him the key is my pass out of the city real [ __ ] shame i have to kill you [Music] i am [ __ ] i didn't realize how tough you got [Music] hack on you can't get away maybe but you don't want to see me i ain't as pretty as before we've both seen your biomarker you're not gonna find me in time [Music] huh [Music] [Music] how many people have you betrayed icon killian frank lawan why did you betray her frank told you about the tv station told you i chickened out right well he's wrong about that it was a suicide mission hello why did you leave her what how do you know about that just answer the question i made a deal with the devil and she had her own hell to deal with what are you talking about i left to protect her if i'd stayed walt would have had her killed so why did you work with him why did you betray frank i didn't i didn't betray frank i was trying to fix things after the tv station i was planning to spy on waltz and but he got suspicious threatened to kill lawn and now it's too late [Music] i'm sorry i can't i didn't want this frank it's aidan hackard's dead oh [ __ ] no i knew this would happen well come back to the fisheye i overheard something more about waltz he's heading to old villadoraden the person he tracked down is a gre doctor is that related to the database yes and i think i know the person he's after i'll try to use the radio to reach her first i'm taking that hack on you're in no condition to fight yeah we shouldn't find out won't we i can't talk to me this doesn't make sense [Music] do the night runners mean nothing to you don't you want to make things right hack on [Music] nothing to make right anymore the night runners are long gone no matter what frank says he ain't gonna raise the dead although it's a nice dream what's really going on here frank told me how you broke with the night runners every day since i've wondered would things have ended differently if i'd been there would my friends be alive i know i can't bring anyone back but i did make a vow i'd prove myself to frank and lawan [Music] i don't want to fight you anymore icon neither do i kid neither do i [Music] i mean i'm so tired so [ __ ] tired it's quite a trip huh i was worried that i'd have to learn surfing on my own [Music] thanks for stopping them up for me ah it's my ray of sunshine with a lethal crossbow shut the [ __ ] up good thing you didn't finish me off eden or she would have been pissed who won how did you have my own connections try to stop me and we're no longer friends aiden [Music] won't help you lawn what the [ __ ] do you know i know about the night runners frank told me he spoke about balance and letting go he's one to talk but he has and you could too can't you luan he said he wanted to protect you is he talking about [ __ ] he said he joined waltz because he wanted to spy on him hey then shut up but he had to stop because walt's threatened to hurt you [ __ ] i know stop bullshitting me the one [Music] this is [ __ ] [Music] get the [ __ ] out of here you sure go before i change my mind you [ __ ] [Music] i'm sorry [Music] how you feel i don't know i i feel relieved some peace finally but but i should have killed him he was on my list he's still on my list and throw your list away that list is my only purpose it helped me keep going throw it away the one you think you know me [ __ ] you you know what wait [Music] butcher wants bravo the one you made frank where you been kid waiting for you at the fisheye get over here yeah look a lot went down since we last spoke [ __ ] what happened you okay yeah i'm fine and you won't believe this but luann was there and she let her go she what yeah she destroyed her kill list save your shock for later frank what about that doctor come to the fisheye ayden i'll tell you everything [Music] [Music] you
