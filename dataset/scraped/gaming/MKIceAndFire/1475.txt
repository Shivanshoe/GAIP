Esalen system picked up another cellphone transmission near a construction site in downtown Istanbul using the keywords researcher via weapons and password it might be a trap a set up any chance that it's the researcher himself hang of conscience second thoughts about selling out the UK that's why the helicopter is landing outside your hotel a jet waiting at the airport and when you arrive in Istanbul do whatever you have to by any means necessary to find out who's behind this and make sure that research doesn't fall into the wrong hands good morning double-oh-seven we located the cell phone that the Echelon system fountain and tracked it to the opening of an ancient catacombs beneath this construction site we lost the signal when it went to below ground but he may be able to pick it up again once you get into the catacombs q-branch and transmission you stop where do you think you're going dr. bond British Museum architectural heritage foundation here to study your preservation efforts nah you can call the Turkish Ministry of Culture I don't care nobody goes down there without a hard hat of course safety first this construction site marks the point we lost Ted Werth signal we need to find out if he's still friendly or working with our enemies use your smartphone to search for evidence we've cloned that computer's hard drive I'll pass it on to our analysts continue searching the area we've got enough work to do without you bothering us dr. bond the foreman is ready to meet you please wait for him in the park having come this way this way dr. Vaughn now [Music] [Applause] [Applause] what was that [Music] [Applause] [Music] Tanna I'm headed for the catacombs topside said there was someone in that cabin you can do him instead right we'll

be much left of him copy that come on let's work on your feet wasting your time I'm not gonna tell him anything we'll see about that now move who are you who did this to you Vernon his name is Vernon he wanted my research my formulas for bio weapon we've got to get you out of here I'll never make it the only ways to climb out but it's not too late maybe you can still save Ted where you Oh come in brother still nothing from topside yeah it looks like the cells are come quiet might just be the rock disrupting comms maybe but I don't think so well if anyone is still down here they're not getting out through here is everyone in position everywhere at least we've got the high ground if we need it down I need to port [Music] Tanna what do we have on a man named burden hold on I'm doing the search here it is burn-in low-level gangster the middle man if he's got Ted Worth's research he probably won't be holding on to it for long what is the password for the USB Drive tell me the key to crack the code stop stop I'll tell you [Music] thank you tell him let's get out of here let's go I'm late for the handoff he's here let's move [Music] [Applause] [Music] on to mi6 Ted was dead burning on the move you have him on satellite confirm w7 we're tracking him let us know if you lose visual contact will do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's fully u-turn in the tunnel

of course how do you know him sweetie there are only six people worth dating in the world and I'd probably gone out with half of them turn here okay the truth is he supplies the chemicals used to alloy the gold and silver in my line of jewelry and he's been after me to open a boutique in the casino he just bought in Monaco he bought the casino mm-hmm another trinket on the must-have list for oligarchs after a supermodel wife so I got him to delay his flight back to Siberia that's why he keeps the wife at his headquarters so she can't spend all his money and we're going to meet in the boardroom which should give you enough time to get into his office and break into his safe well done so how did you end up in bed with mi6 that's one way of putting it darling it's the perfect cover fashion shows photoshoots store openings I get to travel the whole world and nobody pays any attention Emma approached you not exactly how not exactly well there was this little tax problem a few years ago a little tax problem and a small customs problem involving some diamonds but that's how a girl from the society pages ends up working for mi6 yes James but believe me when necessary I can be very discreet you can drop me off in front of the casino I'm gonna put on my war paint before the meeting I'll text you on the cell phone to let you know when we're almost finished [Music] have you

tourists to try to sneak in here yes sir finish your cigarette and stop two petrols sir Komarov they will get to be former off by Taking Chances it has something to do with that Chinese guy met that's not your problem your job is to keep your eye on the gardens James James Palmer up still not here what should I do if he doesn't show up stick to the plan the cold stay calm you may just be late it's critical that you make this work okay I'll do my best I've got to go right I'm gonna finish my smoke then I'm gonna don't work too hard you get eyes on the boss's business associate yeah guess being a Russian billionaire has its upside back up now [Music] [Music] alright I'm in the casino keep Pama rough distracted while I find you okay James but wait he's coming family said they'd never said it's on loan double-oh-seven you're going to need a key code to get past this door it appears the code has been divided between three different guards in the casino each one has only a small piece of it I'm marking their locations on your smartphone now scan their access cards to compile the full code and access the lift [Music] [Music] right they are said to watch the song it was a fan Godley I have Palmero off himself is playing and you know what kill him one down double-oh-seven [Music] that's another one bond that's it double-oh-seven you've got all the data necessary to access Tom Roth's lift [Music] [Music] how much Nicole you of all people should know you can't what's this that is your goal [Music] what was the nature of this research I told you we were investigating anthrax and smallpox to come up with antidotes that could be used in the field in the case of a biological attack and there was no way to militarize them to turn them into weapons instead of cures no no so why are these documents in code I told you I was working at home what is the password for the USB Drive tell me the key to crack the code stop stop I'll tell you thank you [Music] secur [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Nicole where are you I'm outside what happened they've closed the casino get to the car bring it around to the front what are you going to do see if I can tip the odds in our favor [Music]

girly drinks bond are you there yes em right here Nicole do you mind if double-oh-seven and I speak privately for a moment this is a need-to-know of course no problem we can talk what did you find out we've translated all the documents you photographed in Palma ROVs office this afternoon it appears that most of them were invoices for highly sophisticated chemical manufacturing equipment they were to be delivered to a defunct chemical refinery he's recently brought back online in Siberia makes perfect sense they tortured Ted Werth the researcher for the Cota his bio research formulas he was working on anthrax and smallpox antidotes for troops in the field but they could just as easily be weaponized that's what we're afraid of no that's what the whole world is afraid of you've got to get there confirm what we think he's up to and stop him perhaps miss hunter can help you facilitate this yes I'll talk to her good good luck double is him you finished I have to take a look at Palmer Rob's refinery in Siberia and thought you might be able to help facilitate things I'm gonna need a flight ground transportation and local contact wait wait not so fast I told Palmer off I get back to him about his business proposal so it's the perfect cover to get the two of us into the refinery the two of us mm said facility not the company well how do you think I'm going to get you to Siberia oh let me guess friend of yours owns a plane may I speak with Rudolph please why am I not surprised you're going to love it it's got a shower a wine cellar and the most unbelievable circular bed yes well what what's that look for you'll be enjoying all that stuff alone I'll be in the cockpit flying the plane [Music] kind of your friend Rudolph the lenders his car you sure he won't mind he's got six of them he won't miss it what else are you gonna spend your money on up here aside from diamonds and wristwatches are you sure you want to go through with this I just can't believe pom Roth would be involved with something evil he's always been like an uncle to me the entrance to the refinery is up ahead just do as I told you all of the plan and will be all right this isn't all fun and games you really think they're going to believe that you're my bodyguard I think there'd be more suspicious if you didn't have a bodyguard yeah it's Russia you're nobody without one good but on your best attitude and sell it that's the religion I'm here to see Stefan pomerode is he expecting you do you think I just dropped in to Siberia I also need somewhere for my bodyguard to wait where he can be fed and watered but the car over there and he can wait in the shed spasiba alright I'm gonna give you five minutes to get into pomerode office before I start causing trouble I can live with that that's the idea yes sorry to interrupt double-o seven we hacked into Palma Roth's mainframe at the refinery and found Ted Worth's research but we were shut out before we could read it you'll need to get to the server room and access it through the main terminal I think we can be there can you send me directions I'm marking the location on your phone now Siberia room all quieting of time running patrols down here what you mean you didn't hear what happened someone hit it shut the place up way I heard he was after Palmer of staff some files or something oh great so now Palmer off spool come with us all doing patrols on the research isn't here you'll have to go to the main computer Center it's protected by biometric security measures though the only individual with security clearance currently in the building is power-off himself you may be able to get through if you can find power-ups fingerprints and the voice sample [Music] you didn't fly halfway across the world to thank bodka tell me this new proposal I want to hear all about it that's Palmer offs fingerprints now you just need to find a clear sample of Palmer offs voice think they want to make a good impression it's been - for some reason gives us time to brush I'm Stephan pomerode president and CEO of pomerode industries that's komarov's voiceover you should be able to access the computer center now parking location on your sponsoring inside Beria's leading independent crude oil refining facility built in 1974 this site was decommissioned 20 years I'm on my way welcome today alert men I want regular patrols something's going on today we've got to keep the computer centers are the HD stats at safe levels seem to be holding for the moment means we'll be able to build up to the final what are you doing they want to try mixing right stop thinking real move they say that damn it we thought we could get in without setting off the alarm we need time to access the files you've got to keep the phone in range do you think you can hold out you'll be the first to know if I can't [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] 40% double-oh-seven [Applause] 18% nearly there all themes did engage more closer to the main terminal [Applause] [Music] [Music] the encryptions down double-oh-seven scan the central terminal to access the refineries network [Music] born here where are you w7 Hammurabi's refinery it's worse than we suspected he's built an entire bio weapons factory he's churning out toxins by the tongue can you destroy it let me get back to you on that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

team stationed all over the place well stay on your guard sounds like he was only a few feet from Palmer oh yes yeah keep your safeties off I'm going to meet with the other squads yes sir double-oh-seven this control room coordinates the refineries core systems access the central control panel and I'll run a diagnostic from the looks of things it seems that if you override the coolant and exhaust systems you'll be able to trigger a catastrophic chain reaction find the override valves double-oh-seven you need to destroy those bio weapons Jesus it's freezing telling me how long do we have to keep watching over this stuff I don't know suppose as long as it takes for them to find it shouldn't be too long never seen the place on this kind of alert before Tommy Rob seems nervous that's for sure but you're heading towards the coolant system taking it down [Applause] I now need support No I need backup now [Music] the coolant pipes abrupt anomaly [Music] [Music] [Music] that's it bond well done now head to the exhaust override and disable the heat dispersal systems double-oh-seven the schematics show this route leads to the exhaust override lock the valve and [ __ ] the refineries heat extraction network got an ID on this intruder here nothing but the suspicion is that is the same guy who worked over at Romanovs casino but no one's been able to come up with a positive ID it doesn't matter he'll be dead soon enough just enough hey you got anything okay keep your eyes open whatever took off tweed report Oh God gleeful forum is authorized the wrong time we have a man you've done it bot activate the central control panel it'll launch the chain reaction and trigger the meltdown [Music] [Music] [Music] access the central control panel font initiate the meltdown Nicolle James where are you what's taking so long meet me outside with a car running as quickly as possible I'm on my way Oh Nicole where are you I'm on my way quickly hold on hurry come on move oh I'll Drive are you alright yeah I think so what happened to Palmer oh he ran off I saw him get on the train that delivers the chemicals to the port his men were loading them on which way over there we've got to stop him before he gets those bio weapons out of the country hang on are you mad like I said this is an old fun and games he's trying to get away fasten your seatbelt we've got a train to catch [Music] [Music] [Music] what are you doing you're fighting for the rhythm [Music] the Train you can still catch it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] not necessarily Nicole Nicole are you alright I think I broke my wrist yeah let me see this should work until we can get you to adopt it you really did turn out to be my bodyguard the train stopping there must be at

set your heading for two to zero but there are boats in the way I don't care what's in the way plow through them there the hovercraft when we get on board do you think you can pilot it yes but you've got to be careful James if you puncture one of those chemical Jun's with a bullet the bioweapons will escape and kill everyone I'll keep that in mind we've picked up bond signal it looks like they're on Palmer offs tail acquiring visual now bond and Nicole are on an assault hovercraft with what appear to be multiple hostiles on board picking up audio now I'll patch it in [Applause] [Music] [Music] James we're speeding up but he's still getting away you have to dump all cargo James are you there what still too heavy we're losing James that's great you've done it with gaining on it I'm heading

steady that's it with it going after bummer keep us steady change of plans tell me captain are you sure your men can handle this the safe destruction of all those bio weapons bio weapons what bio weapons there are no bio weapons in Russia I see and those men on the boat in a hazmat suit that's the problem with you people in the West you always think there are WMDs then you go to war over it and then there are not you know what kind of paperwork I would have to fill out if they were WMDs here clearly my mistake yes and in the meantime you can expect my government to be calling your government to register a protest for your actions here I wouldn't have expected anything less James are you all right better than you ah this it's given me an entirely new idea for a line of bracelet indeed the COS will be off in a week it's nothing that a few days at a private beach in Bermuda won't take care of care to join me I've got a plane waiting I wish I could but I've still got some mopping up to do here hmm you sure we might be able to get into all sorts of interesting trouble together well the offers tempting by the way what about your friend isn't he going to be upset about destroying his car he probably expected it he already thinks I'm a terrible driver I wreck everyone I get into back in London they say the same thing about me anyway congratulations on stuffing Cameron thank you and thank you for helping me facilitate things you sure I can't convince you to come with me positive well I hope I get to see you again I'm sure I possible cross take care I can't believe you let her go she wanted you I need a room a private room you should have asked for that while she was still here don't you have some cleaning up to do some non-existent Meyer weapons second floor of the police station third door on your right and make sure you say hello to mi6 for me I'll give them your best bond here yes I've been waiting to hear from your w7m Rob's dead the factory is destroyed the remaining bioweapons have been turned over to the Russians I know the Prime Minister has already heard from their government it's threatening to become a diplomatic nightmare I want you out of there back in London for a full debriefing no this isn't over the anonymous tip we received about the bioweapons couldn't have been from the researcher he was being tortured at a time somebody wanted us to get to Palmer off and the question is who and why so how do you want to proceed when I took the courier's cell phone in Istanbul all the phone calls on it were local except for one that he didn't answer have Tanner and q-branch find that phone I want to know who the courier was avoiding and why wait good morning colonel pink good morning commander bond to what do I owe the pleasure of this phone call I'd like to know why a top Chinese agent was trying to contact a courier in Istanbul perhaps is the same reason a British agent was following him he's suggesting an alliance you'll find me at the aquarium in Bangkok tomorrow night come alone it's the only way I can guarantee your safety funny I was just going to wish you the same warning to you bond here good evening mr. bond where are you ping we'll meet soon enough but first I need you to perform a small task in order to ensure our security and what might that be it's come to my attention there is recording equipment hidden in the aquarium and we can't take the chance of anyone listening in on it let me know after you found them and disabled [Music] [Music] wait we hope it's done we're clear good meet me on the ground floor by the whale tank Bing that you tell me commander bond how much do you know about whales not much enough to know they shouldn't be kept in aquariums but from that I wouldn't like to end up in one then maybe you can understand what it's like to live inside the world's biggest country there are 1.3 billion people living in China today Mr Bond 1.3 billion Chinese who need to be fed and housed and clothed every day every week year in year out I am aware of the numbers but perhaps not the implications go on it's not that we're not as smart or as technologically savvy as the West we invented gunpowder and currency while you were still living in caves but in every society there are those who would cheat those who would steal to gain any advantage the researcher industrial espionage someone in China was behind this one of your people kidnapped and killed him no something worse an economic mercenary someone who would steal the most dangerous technological secrets and sell them to the highest bidder not out of ideology or politics but for money and power to turn us against each other but who where how do we find him and stop him my team was in Geneva following up on a link to this man do you recognize him no his name is rock he was born in northern Mongolia on the contested border between Russia and China and has no love for either he keeps his money and his mistress in Switzerland he operates out of Bangkok if it's illegal he's got a piece of it at first we thought he was a middleman in all this but [Music] he's heading for the bridge [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] stop take one more step and you're dead throw down the gun no just by talking to you rock is going to kill both of us [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you get that body to the morgue and find me the uber driver warmed good to see you're alive w7 we tracked your cellphone to Bangkok but the GPS coordinates haven't moved in six hours I may be closing in on the people behind the researchers kidnapping I need to have Q bronze her on a data check on a man named rec banking business associates have them contact me with names and addresses will do but I should warn you we've been following news reports that the Thai police are looking for an Englishman who destroyed half of Bangkok last night in a car chase and what makes you think it with me do you really want me to answer that question can I call you back there's still no sign of the second driver go check the buildings along the riverbank and see if anybody saw anything bond we've located a potential lead to Rack from an old friend of yours called silk he owns a club not far from you I'm marking the location on your smartphone now got men setting the reverse if he died in the crash we'll find a body we'll be well paid if we find this guy [Music] okay we've got CCTV stills of the suspect this guy needs to be found involved now search the area yeah good evening sir can I show you to a table no but you can show me to the boss he's behind there my good man is it some way I can be of service I'm looking for a man what kind of man your kind of man someone who preys on the helpless sees the world is corrupt and wants a piece of it you know me too well James how on earth did you find me if you turn over enough rocks and enough stickies you're bound to be under one of them you know they ran me out of Saigon with that after or before they were only out of Athens what was it I beat her I lost track after Johannesburg can I interest you in a girl I'll settle for some information same old James but what makes you think I'm gonna give up rack without some kind of compensation because I know you silky and I know that you don't care where the rack lives or dies but you wouldn't mind having the 20% back that he probably skimmed from this place every week wreck has a secret boathouse on the chow Pryor river but I'll bet he won't make it there alive I'll take the bet add it to what you owe me from last time and good day to you too sir there's an Englishman on his way to see Rach my money says he won't make it and you know how much I hate to lose my money don't let me down Black's got the police are looking for looking for the British agent but we've been told you'll be heading this way stay on your guard and be ready [Music] [Music] squat seat didn't hold him he's gone through the market we'll be heading this way keep your eyes open security breach [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] fools you're all worthless it's over Rach you're finished I know about the kidnappings the bio weapons the missing researchers I'll give you one last chance Rach you should have quit while you
