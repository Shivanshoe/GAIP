[Music] hey there new york friendly neighborhood spider-man here wanted to give a bit of a life update since i'm sure you're wondering where i've been the past couple of weeks [Music] come on guys i'm talking to my fans right now sorry about that but yeah i've been a little busy and i've sort of not really kind of been working with the avengers it's like a side hustle it's hard taking down a multi-national corporation especially when your team has been deemed outlaws in the public eye but we still find time to enjoy ourselves outside of work i've actually been able to do a lot more recreational stuff since i joined them here's a secret from yours truly the avengers surprisingly normal outside of bad guy butt kicking they're like this big family of heroes all working together and helping out but still finding the time to have fun not that i've been goofing off it's still serious work fighting alongside the avengers but you know how it is saving the city all the time all by yourself it gets kind of lonely i've met so many cool people now i've been to so many wonderful places and you know i'd never leave new york you guys are always my number one but the avengers are like no other friends i've ever had it's been kind of great sorry i'm totally getting ahead of myself let me back up a little bit start from the beginning this is safe right yeah totally safe what could possibly go wrong okay i did not think this one through hill should be in contact soon to fill us in hey guys we have a visitor hey you know you guys should really consider getting a doorbell or a front door can i come in now [Music] okay spider-man let's talk you two know each other spider-man's been fighting baddies in new york for like ever sorry i spent the last five years frozen and in space i was living in a trailer with internet well i'd say i'm insulted but 50 recognition ain't bad aim had a pretty extensive file on him no id though you cover your tracks well wow coming from you you can't see it behind the mask but i'm totally blushing right now still doesn't explain why you were hanging off our helicarry or mid-flight yeah i need tiny dancer she helped my friend slip some aim intel to the resistance a while ago i was hoping i'm listening right so i think ames working on something big like chemical weapons big i'm having trouble getting specifics because every file i've pulled off their servers is super redacted the number of black bars on these things put some modern art to shame and and i'm trying to track down their supplier but i i need tiny dancer to break ames encryption so i can get into one of their facilities i can handle the rest myself let us take a look first if you're right about what ames got planned we'll help you get into that facility hang out until we're ready to go tony that it's really not a big deal it's just to get in you're still walking okay don't worry i'm an expert in hanging out get it hanging well i thought it was funny you know you guys don't have to come with me right we know and still gotta help though it's what we do and uh you don't have to wear that mask around us if you don't want to it's not really about me there are people back home that i need to protect and the mask helps me do that hey i get it no one back home knows i'm miss marvel either except my abu of course but um mask or no mask we all need people who have our backs and really get us even the weird parts especially the weird parts in any case you should check out the place thor and the hulk are competing in the home room but i'm sure you could kick them out the harm room is that name literal or ironic you'll see welcome to the chimera spider-man thanks let's hope this was the right call pete hey liz you there okay you're either underground without service or you hate me hoping for the former can you call me can we meet up no okay fair let me at least apologize i don't know what aim told you in your exit interview but i told them you had nothing to do with it they didn't believe me liz i am so sorry i know how much that internship meant to you no you don't otherwise you wouldn't have skimmed information from ames servers what were you thinking liz i wasn't just goofing off this time i don't want to get you into any more trouble but i was poking around for a good reason i swear i don't think aim is being honest about a lot of things i'm not sure if it's safe to put in a text meet me for coffee just leave me alone peter please excellently done here we go [Music] i would say that is worthy of the avenger name wouldn't you training begins now [Music] oh [Music] huh that will do i think well done stay now [Music] that was splendid let's begin [Music] [Music] should we start [Music] [Music] one [Music] [Music] hill here we found a facility where aim is preparing to spin up another fake ark reactor we all know how well that went last time we have to put a stop to it the ark reactors nearby jarvis are you picking up anything locked on and ready commander hill good luck out there an elite aim team is close by and on alert updating your hud we've reached the fight scene portion of our program i think we're pretty evenly matched i can't believe that works [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] every member of the elite team must be defeated [Music] go one of the regions is down [Music] another agent down [Music] god [Music] [Music] uh get me to the location on your hud bypassing that security will take some time keep the area clear but stay in range of the control point yes [Music] the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow [Music] must destroy them all or they will keep coming back i need more time keep the area free [Music] oh [Music] i'm working as quickly as possible the corrupted vibranium has exploded you must leave the area to avoid harmful contamination nice work [Music] we got company oh if you can gain control of aims network temporarily i can infiltrate their security system [Music] head to the terminal so i can get you inside the lab good i prefer a challenge aims network is equipped with a multi-point authentication system i need access to multiple terminals the more the better aim will attempt to initiate a shutdown protocol if they gain access to the terminal [Music] beginning infiltration that helps thank you [Music] three [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] aim has initiated their that shutdown thank you [Music] that helps thank you beginning infiltration sorry [Music] i've reached a security network i've marked our next destination on your heart [Music] there up ahead wild guess those are the bad guys you made it [Music] perfect aim has an arc reactor close by destroyed let's have some fun yeah you know you can still run nope [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] we've had word that aim has sent bounty hunters into urban areas to search for inhumans some have been sent to jersey city it's imperative that you stop them i will scan the area for aim signatures and update your hud be on your guard hmm there are inhumans caught in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans cool i needed to test out my new webs anyway [Music] i can't believe that works you must keep them safe yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] they're safe the team of watchdogs is in the vicinity i've sent their location to your heart wild guess those are the bad guys neutralize the watchdogs still united the earth let's get this one [Music] a watchdog agent is down another watchdog has been neutral [Music] they have lost another agent another bounty hunter is down [Music] me i've detected another pocket of corrected vibranium there they are you'll need to destroy the locking mechanisms to open the cells [Music] [Music] [Music] this one is open theo work your magic [Music] hey where did this thing come from [Music] anyone get some oh i think we can take these guys [Music] the cells are all open nice work thanks avengers [Music] [Music] excellent the bounty hunters have been purged from jersey city all right avengers we got word

they will keep coming back these enemies must be defeated [Music] [Music] watch your eyes everyone [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] the enemies have been defeated all i do is aim has caged a group of inhumans for experimentation rescue them time to show them what we've got i think we're pretty evenly matched okay [Music] your coach the four cells have a security system controlled by a separate terminal in the command center the security must be disabled to destroy a cell can only go down is [Music] [Music] my turn [Music] [Music] security on a sale is down you can destroy [Music] thank you

interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow a cluster has regrown you must destroy them all or they will keep coming back [Music] hey guys [Music] come here i need a favor hi i'm liz liz allen peter's friend sort of it's complicated your dad's company is alan chemicals right yeah i um i track down the person who's been funneling their resources to aim it's it's mark raxton should i know who that is he's my step-brother been working as a junior executive since he graduated college and now well now i guess he's selling out our family to aim can't wait for that conversation over thanksgiving dinner we have to stop him any idea what he might have planned not a clue i'll look into what he's been doing at alchem but let me know if you find anything on your end we're going to fix this don't worry [Music] i will scan the area for aim signatures and update your hud be on your guard there are inhumans caught in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans hey look new friends [Music] [Music] inhuman down you must keep them safe they were no match for us not on your feet we go they're safe the team of watchdogs is in the vicinity i've sent their location to your hud the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow a cluster has regrown you must destroy them all or they will keep coming back uh the casters have been destroyed i will use this data to attempt to identify their component molecules i've detected another pocket of corrupted vibranium way better than having to do it myself [Music] that's gonna hurt the morning thank you [Music] anyway humans shall inherit the heart ass kicking neutralize the watchdogs united another watchdog [Music] they have lost another agent another bounty hunter is down [Music] the watchdogs team has been defeated excellently done i've located captive and humans they're being kept in portable you'll need to destroy the locking mechanisms to open the cells you can't see it under the mask totally smiling hey where did this thing come from [Music] [Applause] you're good now the cells are all open nice work [Music] [Music] excellent the bounty hunters have been purged from jersey city so [Music] [Music] there are inhumans caught in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans ah no all right who's next there are inhumans caught in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans we've reached the fight scene portion of our program [Music] good i can't believe that worked cardiac arrest mission report miss allen very funny so i looked into my brother's network and i think i got a hit a former mentor spencer smythe four years ago he started working with aim as one of their lead tech engineers so he could have recruited your brother that's what i'm thinking here's the good news i know mark's work if they're collaborating i should be able to reverse engineer something to give you an edge against whatever smite's cooking up sounds good i'll take all the edges we can get thanks so [Music] intel provided by our friends at shield has revealed the location of an elite aim squad we have an opportunity to take them out before aim can deploy the squad against the resistance this is a quick hit and run operation take out the targets and return to us unharmed if possible [Music] an elite aim team is close by and on alert updating your heart ah every member of the elite team must be defeated yeah [Music] one of their agents is down all things considered [Applause] another agent down well done that squad member has been neutralized your knight in high-tech armor is here the team are no longer a threat [Music] [Applause] [Music] good job avengers with this victory you've weakened aim and given the resistance a leg up keep it up so [Music] avengers our agents in the field have identified the location of an aim data vault the vault contains research on new combat synthoids and needs to be destroyed get in there take out the server vaults and get out before aim reinforces the facility [Music] aim has a set of turbines powering one of their emergency generators disable them you know destroy the turbines aim has sent forces to stop you god disabled kicking excellent turbine destroyed i'm in trouble here thanks for the assist [Music] nicely done avengers you wreaked some impressive havoc and now aim is scrambling to recover their lost research more attacks like this and aim won't stay in power long there are many battlefields in the future wastelands with the remains of fallen cree giants i'm positive we'll find something useful [Music] [Music] yourself oh [Music] yes [Music] analyzing records these fallen giants appear to be labeled as pre-centuries interesting i'll gather more data on our way home i have located the three battle records marking the location now oh our area of interest is nearby all right who's next [Music] right ah that's fun [Music] [Music] any more likely than expected i'm receiving a pre-signal source should be close to your location time to show him what he's got don't suppose you'd rather settle this over coffee or the shot you are not alone be on your guard avengers good you're maneuvering uh how many more hits i can take [Music] that's not good three three oh that's inconvenient [Music] oh i'm gonna need a minute for six weeks okay quit now we're made up [Music] be careful avengers i prefer a challenge i'm detecting a large quantity of enemy signatures [Music] to the store these giants were constructed over 10 000 years ago this diet is extremely valuable great work avengers [Music] we must learn more from the future if we wish to stop decree in our past i'll continue searching for more free dial sites thank you for your continued support so [Music] greetings avengers i have located an area rich in cree data you and your shield allies will no doubt find interesting the area is unsafe but i believe you will find the rewards outweigh the risks there are many battlefields in the future wastelands with the remains of fallen cree giants i'm positive we'll find something useful [Music] have been transmitted i think we're pretty evenly matched shelter beneath the truck [Music] you're just ugh yourself wind blow lightning [Music] oh you got a sec you are definitely not supposed to be here does it help if i say i come in peace marginally look i know i'm probably not your favorite person right now but i am here to help smythe i mean he's gone off the deep end why the sudden change of heart last i saw you didn't have a problem making robots specifically designed to kill me i know i know but you have to understand it was the only way i could make sure liz was safe from aim they would have ruined her career or worse and now they know that liz and her friend at the butler are helping you guys destroy those chemical caches they're making moves so let me help give you an edge against them it doesn't make up for everything but maybe it's a start okay cards on the table liz trusts you but i'm going against my gut by letting you be here you're on shaky ground raxton i'm keeping my eye on you good that means you're not an idiot they're inhumane [Music] sorry did that hurt [Music] portion of our program [Music] you're good now nice light workout [Music] hey it's those aim people you keep talking about they're safe a team of watchdogs is in the vicinity i've sent their location to your hud the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow i've detected another pocket of corrupted vibranium the cluster has regrown you must destroy them all or they will keep coming back match neutralize the watchdogs come unite come on guys you're just embarrassing yourselves oh hmm oh you got a sec a present for me you shouldn't have mark and i reverse engineered some of the circuits really whoa this is amazing while i've got you i talked to peter but did you now he offered to hack into the bugle's website and broadcast incriminating footage from ames internal database worldwide we just need to get him access to aim surfer from the inside sounds like a job for me and mark you can use his login to get administrator access into aim server send the data to pete and we're in business there are inhumans caught in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans that is so bad let's say hello [Music] uh this is [Music] inhuman down you must keep them safe oh [Music] they're safe a team of watchdogs is in the vicinity i've sent their location to your heart the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow coming back excuse me while i refer to him as anthony masters for the rest of this mission that skull for brains was on my undercover team when he decided to go mercenary a lot of good people died that day i plan on reminding him he has blood on his hands jarvis we got any bogies in the area small patrol ahead likely a preliminary guard for the clones base let's give them a hello so they don't ruin our surprise let's have some fun family there they are morning [Music] bad about this [Music] though i have the after action report i'd be curious to hear what happened between you and mr masters from your point of view we were doing recon on this arms dealer somewhere in nigeria shield heard they might have gotten access to alien weaponry [Music] the intel good turned out it was too good don't let them stand in your way uh [Music] that's one um wow and three i thought i'd feel better by now perhaps your feelings will alleviate when the mission is complete yeah maybe head inside i don't mean to pry agent morales right of course i didn't finish um my team walked into a trap the arms dealer only wanted our weapons and armor not the people holding them so they just started picking us off i don't know how many masters took out himself but it doesn't really matter does it okay you're headed for the base's two main hangars we're trying to cut off masters only means of escape first up the containers he uses to deploy troops and supplies all troops to the east hangar you have got to be kidding me patch me in jarvis i want to talk to him connected hey masters remember me morales still not dead avengers you need to find him good night [Music] oh is it over new friends not so fast that went pretty well uh [Music] here's an energy boost ah yes avengers there's an elevator ahead of you it should take you to taskmaster [Music] agent morale is i'm fine are you certain no but i can finish this i am here to assist you in any way that i can thank you and i am sorry avengers i i didn't expect it to hit me this hard turn comes back on jarvis i want to be able to hear this understood i do love when shield sends the avengers to clean up their messes as if you could love anything you're broken avengers take him down [Music] that's gonna hurt the morning you can't see it underneath this is ah right yes huh yes [Music] oh these guys isn't this supposed to be the part where i feel better nervous i'm afraid any knowledge of grief i possess is clinical i know they're gone for good but maybe now he is too nice work avengers [Music] come here this will only take a sec mark raxton a junior executive at allen chemicals turned himself in to authorities today claiming that he was solely responsible for the company's involvement with aim scientist dr spencer smythe smythe and advanced idea mechanics are both under investigation after raw footage of advanced synthoid testing was leaked to the daily bugle's website raising questions as to whether ames practices are not just unethical but illegal the bugle's internal investigation into who uploaded the live stream is still underway hey liz are you okay sort of still processing i think mark always had a bit of a protective streak i guess i never expected him to do all this just to save my career i mean working with aim even knowing what they were really doing just and you wouldn't have lost that internship in the first place if it wasn't for peter parker peter peter had the right idea this whole time aim is dangerous we should have exposed them a lot sooner so you don't hate him i mean i did it first nobody likes losing their job but this is bigger than both of us and now i have something to offer the resistance what's that maybe alan chemicals can't officially work with the resistance but they can at least spare one of their top biochemists me parker said you were as tough as you are smart he was right so what about you huh what's next for spider-man well first i'm gonna go back to new york and get a decent slice of pizza after that i guess it's back to the old grind speaking of i have work to do so it's cool if you want to go like have some superhero bonding time or whatever oh that's okay i'm still not used to having people around i've always flown solo or swung i guess so working with the avengers has been kind of terrifying but also nice i don't know it's strange having people want to be around me and wanting to be around them too that's called having friends spidey you should try it sometime i think you'll like it you did good out there yeah and you know if you wanted to stick around on a more permanent basis i don't think anyone would mind uh bruce only requested that you limit your lab time to once a day and during work hours i i'm really flattered but i've still got my own message to clean up back home new york isn't gonna save itself still if you need anything from me give me a call and i'll be there oh yeah you're not gonna go all i work alone on us i guess it's not the worst thing in the world to have a couple of super hero friends on speed dial uh actually if people mind get a lift back to new york kind of far for a rideshare [Music] hey aunt may sorry i'm late i was hanging out with some new friends hey don't sound so surprised you know what i did have a nice time but you know you're always my preferred company sure i'll grab some tamales on the way home yeah i'm glad i had a good day too love you [Music] you
