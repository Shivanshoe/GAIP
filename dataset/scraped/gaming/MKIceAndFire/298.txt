hundred sold out every day you guys killed like hundreds old adults or whatever the point is we came here to celebrate everybody's throwing meat on the grill and i asked them to make room for my veggies and everyone starts making fun of my vegan-ness i'm a fun drunk okay but if i hear eat some [ __ ] compulco hon wrong one too many times i kind of lose my [ __ ] just a bit i will remember

it into the ocean everybody was gonna kill me here are those steps up the way a good big brother does he always had my back when no one else did he died like a week after that i [ __ ] miss him i'm sorry home run but i'm sure he's happy we took down benitez here are the wishes he was at this party for sure he'd always say we're not here to feel like [ __ ] we're here to erase the past and drink

than i remembered come i'll show you where to find some good hunting you just need to point me in the right direction this island reminds me so much of gerardo oh on ron's brother yeah what happened to me in the early days of la morale jonron and gerardo were so reckless the two of them did this stupid smash and grab on a checkpoint and got arrested i tried to bribe the guards to free them but they could only get one out i had to choose my heart said piccarado but conron is the best guerrilla we have you picked honron over your boyfriend i did i had a plan for the next day we were going to break him out but benitez executed all the prisoners as punishment for honron being freed she doesn't know get out was thrown up at the phone i think about that choice every day and the truth is i had to do it over again i'd still pick on ron it's the right call there's only one person responsible for gerardo's death castillo but i was born with an eye for [ __ ] we are all gay so i think liberta might have a bit more faith in humanity and that's why i'll never join look there's crocodiles and fish on the side of the island and grab a couple of carrots for our [ __ ] rabbit on ron you got it yelena i'm just going to take a minute alone it's been a long time since i've been here watch wait [ __ ] better be careful [Music] i just need two more [Music] hunting on this island shouldn't be too

you could use a little luck oh so i don't want to hear a word about how libertarian clara [ __ ] garcia could have helped us not that you would just ron and altigrey are gone let's save our tears for after the war compartmentalize move on that yankee [ __ ] mckay and his business are now our main focus i need to learn more about his operation so i can plan our attacks i need you to take out signal

poisons there's a lot of it nearby you feel the burn in your chest when you breathe that's the smell from one of mckay's biggest acid plants i hear the soldados there throw outcasts into the vats appreciate it lots of intel you could use [Music] who's that huh [Music] i took out a jammer weigh in but if you move in now my download speed is going to be really slow and i bend my case building will be swarming with solvalos see so i highly recommend taking out more jammers or gearing up for a fight the place is filled with castillo loyalists how you handle those people is up to you you might be able to do this and not be noticed hey sometimes it's good to be noticed gilberto says part of the building is being renovated so if you see construction chances are there'll be less people thanks for the tip ugly building or an ugly business dog [Music] ice [Music] huh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] better watch myself here [Music] [Applause] helena i'm connected to a computer already downloading what would you do if you did i'm looking through some of the files find anything let's just say no one told me danny i have the obviously schedule says mckay might be meeting people there

ears and the nose no no you know what no spoilers i'll check the footage once i put my little idiot to bed hey primo job and benitez by the way you did me a solid there i was having this meeting with castillo and i saw the video of you animals hanging her it's right here it's on my phone it was it's really ticked off good you're next well let's look at the facts your country's seven years behind the rest of us if you just let castillo and me do our thing you people would go from third world to first like that you people i can feel the love jesus murphy don't you get it you're not my first gorilla yara's not my first [ __ ] this isn't personal it's just your turn so you just hang tight because i've got some real fun hombres heading your way sounds fun what is this what i need to destroy

clouds the cloud [Music] oh look backpack i have another call go out like a hero will ya [Music] [Music] um [Music] so operation what's our next move according to his files the pipe network and the plan are a big deal mckay put most of his security on them let's [ __ ] them up which one first get out of here now that's what i like faster download means more tv shows you can stream no a faster download any operations means hacking is needed okay and i can three more tv shows i know it i'll see what i can do about taking out the rest of the jammers they call their support [Music] where did they go [Music] huh [Music] [Music] huh [Music] huh is uh uh [Music] [Music] huh i just found the exact location of all the remaining jammers mark them on your map damn i kinda liked walking around la jolla looking for those things you're a weird one danny hey what are you doing here [Music] [Music] oh okay careful danny [Music] officer rank won't protect you put it down those careers could use some backup [Music] yes oh oh huh huh [Music] uh i took out all of the jammers nice work danny every little thing we do to [ __ ] with me and castillo's network counts think this will make the history books oh yeah years from now the great attack on the jammers is probably going to be a national holiday laugh now you'll see [Music] hey stay strong it's terrible what happened to el tire hon ron too talk with me what is according to my case files one of the old refineries has engineers working overtime on something called pg-240x pg-240 is the poison they spray on tobacco leaves in the west to make viviro my guess is that pg240x is what they dropped on us at the hotel so we are going to [ __ ] up my case operation by destroying that old refinery from the inside i sent lucky mama and a small team to secure the perimeter they are waiting for you once you get inside the place talk me through what you see we'll figure out how to get it offline out of the team you're on your way [Music] how's it going this [ __ ] keeps getting worse hey host the cheese oh [ __ ] stinks here looks like you guys don't need me the people inside don't know we took out everyone outside i told them to go machetes only and then to wait for you they did these kids are fast learners you're not wrong about that the door is prepped with explosives let's get this party started hola what evil and hong kong can die yeah they're all marked as easy two of electrical work forces there [Music] you were right it looks like this is where mccain's people are making the chemical weapons the bombs we have to [ __ ] this [ __ ] up now connect me to any computer you see i'll overload it on it [Music] i feed you [Music] [Music] it connected give me a minute [Music] [ __ ] [Music] switch and pull it blinking green light then i go [Music] is find a way out [Music] i'm [Music] [Music] oh oh man i thought you were dead this [ __ ] has been really entertaining to watch seriously now if you don't mind i'm gonna call out my boy anton for more soul daddos because you gorijas are really starting to piss in my lemonade [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] they're gone [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm out danny i want you to know i had no idea the factory would blow up and i couldn't risk that many of my gedias you did what you had to if it ever comes down to sacrificing one versus business if it makes you feel any better that i would have done the same thing more alike than you think how about the fact that we just completely destroyed castillo's ability to make chemical weapons this is a huge blow to the regime so they can't make any more of the bombs they dropped on us at the hotel all that's left is what was made before always another target if you don't mind i'm gonna just enjoy breathing for a minute huh hey when i was a girl the air here used to smell like the ocean but the foreign corporations came poisoned everything back in 67 we kicked them out for decades you could breathe the air then espinosa started to sell off our industries then anton to kofa he opened the door for that yankee mckay his operation produces the poison needed to make viviro and the pipeline here is a vital part of that cancer treatment lorenzo showed me the photographs you took of their research disgusting so elena and i came up with a plan to [ __ ] production of castillo's wonder drug think of that yankee's main chemical plant like a heart and all these pipes are like arteries cut the arteries and the heart goes into a catastrophic state so follow the pipes danny destroy the substations and you'll create a pressure overload at the plant that's when yelena will access their computers and will be able to kill mckay's poison operation for good this is a big mission and you're not alone [Music] you
