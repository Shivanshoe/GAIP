insane paranoid fixated with numbers a nerve toxin dragovich's second in command krebchenko tested in vietnam on them on us on his own he doesn't care [Music] but he told me what they did what kind of men they were why they all must die my father was a musician in stalingrad during the german occupation the sound of israeli filthy air of magnificent music corsico stars of many of the great nationalist composers to my countrymen it was a symbol of hope to the germans it was a symbol of devise even now his music still haunts me the nazis slit his throat while he sleeps collaborating with any nazis of a trail of a trail against all of mother russia dragofish krishna they look only to advance their own interests everything is loaded they are waiting victor it is time yes the meeting time to hunt down the last remnants of the fascist ride grab the gear we are moving out the men and i have fought through the most bitter of winters on the eastern front we were known strangers to call even now the blood in my veins chills when i think back to the events of that day ah the hero of berlin graces us with his presence have you not tired of battle rising as long as mother russia has enemies i will answer her call put aside your petty rivalry crafts jenko captain reznoff will do as he is tall we are here for one german and one german only dr friedrich steiner this man has offered his cooperation to our cause is not to be harmed disobey this order and you will be shot what happened in stalingrad between you and the college when the german occupation began he and his lapdog trajenko left my men and i hopelessly outnumbered promises of reinforcements were made may but not care dragovich and krachenko are opportunists manipulators they are not to be trusted immediately the tree patrenco was one of the bravest men i have ever known he fought by my side from the siege of stalingrad to the fall of berlin the wounds he sustained ensuring our victory should have earned him a hero's welcome to russia but stalin had little need for heroes the german must not be harmed we need steiner alive now move both of you let's go it is good to fight by your side once more yes my friend one final vic search every corner of this camp only stand to be spared okay they are trying to surrender they have tried before do not let them foreign please in our way [Music]

looked into the german's eyes i saw the flashy strike still blurring strong [Music] at that moment every fiber of my being learned to put an end to his wretched life but i was a soldier then i still believed in others [Music] bring your man what is here that is so important general dragovich wishes to make a name for himself he believes this outpost houses something of great value to the motherland dragovich and steiner are talking like old friends i do not like this reznov no idea you assured me there will be no problems i cannot control the actions of the ss general they are sworn to defend the right till their last breath noble but futile gravchenko finish up here you and your men will lead the way yes sir patrenco vicodin we are moving out steiner tell me more about your association with the gift eager stone project in 43 the fuel realized the allies could not be held back for much longer we begin to look for more unconventional solutions throughout the war my own research was focused on chemical weapons it was meticulous and frustrating work however what we finally developed was a weapon more effective than we had ever dared to imagine the weapon now housed within this vessel nova 6. [Music] however affected your nervous 6 chemical may be you still have to find a way to unleash it long-range v2 rockets to be launched from this outpost the targets were command and control centers washington dc was our first target then moscow ambitious and commendable but we were too late the british were upon us and their bombers crippled the ship locked in the ice we tried to salvage what we could but it was too late germany had surrendered and a russian flag flew over berlin the ss had orders to destroy the ship if we were attacked clearly they failed the explosives were never activated this is it fresno open the door [Music] we have found what we were looking for mother six the german weapon of mass destruction now belonged to mother russia also it seemed our victory was to be short-lived [Music] dragovich wanted to see the effects of the poison first hand it was also an opportunity to remove a thorn in his side i have long long loved their distrust what kind of men they were it was a betrayal i should have foreseen [Music] the new true country was a hero he deserved the hero's death [Music] instead of giving his life for the glory of the motherland he died for nothing like an animal [Music] he should have died in berlin as i watched my closest friend die it became clear we were not the only ones seeking the german weapons the western allies circled like vultures of course dragovich krashenko and steiner scattered like rats leaving me to contend with the british british commandos assaulting our positions up here i will have the explosives we will plunge this vessel into the depths of hell we cannot let either side possess this terrible weapons [Music] [Music] move we have to get off the sheep now the door's sealed shoot the support beams we can break down the gatherings yes go my flames go keep moving this is not ours everyone we stand alone we have only two minutes left the novices shipment and prevented it from falling into the hands of the british but that's a fool to think that the threat was over it was only after i was captured that sent vocus but i learned of dragovich's true intentions he will die before he gives up on nova 6. [Music] nice listen to me we are running out of time my friend can you trust your leaders to destroy or do you think they will use it the flag may be different but the methods are the same they will use you as their used me you must decide decide what you think is worth fighting for dragovich kravchenko these men must die hudson's mission at calhoun he had discovered dragon bitch's end game nova

to kill steiner here in the [ __ ] let them rest when he regains consciousness double the voltage i remember yeah the subject has been successfully implanted with the knowledge to translate the number sequence so what is the problem his responses to our orders have been sporadic unpredictable he shows a remarkable resilience why he is unusual atypical few men possess such will our other test subjects have been far more successful he can run take it back to himself oh my gosh [Music] lose your life [Music] [Applause] danger from the communists your very way of life is at risk satisfied what is [Music] but pain is difficult isn't it we are brothers we are the savior brainwashed you but reznov had plans of his own he was never in vietnam the real defector with the nova 6 dossier died during the attack on the mack v it was never in the rat tunnels [Music] he was never at rebirth island oh my son my name is died at vorkuta during the escape all the years you thought he was with you that was just in your mind i trusted him that's why it worked it was their attempt at mk ultra dragovich programmed you to kill kennedy but reznoff sabotaged you he wanted revenge for all the dragon that's done too djakovic krachenko steiner three new victims there are gaps in your memory periods where you went m.i.a and we couldn't account for you but now that the brainwashing's been broken all that lost time will come back we need to leave the nova 6 strike is imminent hundreds of sleeper agents hidden in every state capital are about to unleash this poison on your own countrymen when steiner died we lost our key to unlocking the location of number broadcasts you were programmed at borkuda to translate the number codes only you can tell us what the codes mean nova 6 was just one of the sleeker operations but i'm sure there were others ones we didn't even know about we have the broadcasts we played them to you over and over again for hours but we haven't been able to break through your programming yet mason this is our last shot listen for god's sake listen again 21 7 21 4 2 14 3 14 7 18 13 6 22 [Music] the subject has been successfully implanted with the knowledge to translate the number have sequences permitted the construction of a new and permanent broadcast station within their portals from now until project nova's initiation all instructions will be brought just from the result our plan to strike at the very heart of the west is now in motion await further instructions all instructions will be broadcast from the result the result i know where the number station is it's a ship i saw it a long time ago the rasalka where cuba [Music] we are in grave danger from the communists our freedom our very way of life is at risk our plan to strike at the very heart of the west is now in motion he must be stopped mason he has no fear no conscience and weakness i'm told that you are the very best that we have anywhere you will need to be these men must die
