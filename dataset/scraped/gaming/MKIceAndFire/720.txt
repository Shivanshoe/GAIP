the sun it is good to see you be seems pretty uh secluded here it is appropriate for such a secret meeting what the hell happened look close to awful you see a man rubbed over his implants money and dignity look well it is not all bad i am mostly unnoticed in the streets friend you mentioned here oda he should be here any moment now willing finally to give me the spec on him he bodyguard hanukko arasakas from the carrier at anchor in the bay saburo's daughter yes and if he believes you will next meet with her and what's to stop her little errand boy from selling us out he will not do that he's a man of honor right because our soccer's ranks are chock-full of those do not confuse the true ana with the petty morals by which you live by god huh a good sign he is usually camouflaged considering he's my witness can speak for myself you know so speak i have been told you know things not gonna like what i'm about to say i need to guarantee i'm safe here you are you have it be you can trust oda all right then kenpecky plaza i was there the night it happened looked like your typical family quarrel until you're a nobody lunged at saburo and started silence not one word more you will bring death to your door but it is my one concern is to keep her safe in this city forgotten by the gods is she in danger now no yet during the parade to honor arasaka most certainly i bring you this witness to his murder and you dare to worry about the silly parade fool correct unlike you i have not yet failed to keep my oath but you can't ignore the truth you will regret those words the only thing i regret is that i came here to meet you there is a price on your head i do you a favor now by not cutting it off and taking it straight to jar but this gonna take much longer what would you do now were you in my place i do no favors i would deliver you a head to yorinobusama consider yourself rocky that i am not older we're talking about a guy who killed his father to seize control of arasaka gonna take an interest in this or not i will not but i will let you leave this place this city unharmed if i see either of you again i will not be so lenient be very careful my friend we are also far from home good [ __ ] riddance one hour soccer whack job is already plenty fine friend there got any more alas only him no way this is gonna work yet we walk away with a small measure of success hmm how do you figure that what oda said they returned to tokyo after the parade do you not see the parade it is our chance perhaps if somehow we can get to hanakosama we must do a proper reconnaissance first we'll need a precise map of japan town hold on it is your turn to call on friends do you know a fixer who could help uh hang on not so fast because sound is easy as hacking to schism you said yourself hanako's got the tightest security in all night city correct that is why i wish for you to contact us with the local fixture just to fix it runs a pachinko parlor on jig street we must pay this woman a visit will you join me sure why not now gg street what is this name just a night city name bewear you mock me too often any idea what's going on at arasaka only what i can surmise from what i see on tv your innova and his puppets going at the cameras and insist that everything is under control but the wider the smile the bigger the lies you all right guro yes why the sudden concern have shared interests you and i where have you forgotten certainly not good because catching lead in night city is easier than catching a cold and i need you alive i am alive and well as you can see you should worry about yourself oh hmm how i miss the sun rogue my sweet this has got to be a misunderstanding i have no idea who jumped your team but the claws no never my boys know their place i i'm sorry got to go i have guests we so nice to see you and your charming friend is happen to be you working together that's all a true gentleman oh shame only that he's being hunted by all our osaka's tin soldiers and uv bring him to my door give me one reason why i shouldn't notify the proper authorities right away eddie's is why always about eddie's wakako you want to make them we got biz it doesn't get any simpler so tell me and mark well i still have my phone at hand need intel on the parade that's scheduled to come through japan town so it's arasaka again what i fail to understand is why come to me did mr deshawn not come to the phone our socket tiger claws kind of like the family dog screwing the cat huh can't possibly be fond of the people who killed your grandkid that was very long ago time's the best healer wound like that though a won't like that no everything's on the shards how much does this cost my pockets are empty clearly my gift to you it's free okada what is free often proves most costly gonna take them or not for free you sure got my reasons but patience i got none japan town whole district is to be sealed off for the parade dashi platforms the main attraction the fly this way high above street level along the parade route balconies footbridges and vantage points affording good views hanako arasaka the guest of honor will deliver her speech from the largest float she'll do this exactly here got no idea about security but given recent events expect it to be tight our last parade arasaka undercovers infiltrated the crowd not to mention a smattering of sharp shooters drones and if that's not enough fun for one day a net runner one at least they use the city cctv to observe everything main access point here it's an old automated control center if you ask me most useful by far at the end the floats afloat out of japan town and we'll be left with trash up to our elbows that no one will collect that's it it's all i have it must be enough then go be on your way not at all curious what we're going all this trouble for blissful ignorance has served me well in any case i'll find out soon won't i thanks mokako we appreciate this a delightful much of our woman this information it could be just what we need but i will try to investigate further i will stay here sometime and cause some the moment i learn something new i will let you know oh [ __ ] not good just low profile okay don't start handing out autographs in faith i could not overtake you if i tried be safe be you
