hereford las barrancas i'll explain on the way [Music] [Applause] so what are we looking for my favorite book is called el camino the sydney wolverson about an explorer who traveled mexico 200 years ago in her book she describes these as landfishing found giant statues but there aren't supposed to be any of those near here giant statues from an old book that aren't supposed to exist yes i've been piecing together clues from the book do you think you can get this car right into the river at the bottom of the copper canyon you really don't know me very well um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Music] that is incredible how has no one ever found this before according to the book there is a statue at el arco de cabo san lucas wolverstone said she found it at sunset but i thought we could try an experiment i've worked out where the book says the statue should be we can set out and reach the area around mid-morning and see what we can find or the other option is we get to alarco just as the sun sets if you believe the story that's when we'll find the statue right we've got another stunt drop by when you have a moment [Applause] [Music] in 400 meters turn left turn left [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] i see bmw too old to be made in mexico though we should take it to the diet so i can get a better look call you soon all right bmw let's see what we've got here [Applause] [Music] in 400 meters turn right [Applause] [Applause] you have arrived at your destination well well well if it isn't the two masterminds caught in the act can't believe i didn't recognize your driving sooner kid mike glad you're here how do you like this uh this dummy the art department made it's um it's very realistic save it frankie this is a brilliant idea but if you're gonna keep victor in the dark you'll need my help it's nice to be working with you again mike you can talk i never expected that look get in the car we've got a big jump to do scene 43 time travel volcano jump action uh mike did you just say volcano jump come on now kid i saw the opening ceremony hammer it up the hill kid that stunt vehicle is a mic steel special custom engine and suspension [Music] why it's nice to have a real driver at the wheel i heard that [Music] uh [Music] there we go well done frankie brilliant well done but we keep this between us yeah no need for victor to know hey superstar we're showing off and come collect this renault before i take it for a spin hey there kid we've got a new stunt set up drop by when you can [Music] turn right [Music] [Applause] hey there frankie no no don't talk we have to protect that nice bankable accent of yours get in the car i'll explain the stunt as we go scene 68 dr strange guard action castle up ahead watch the turn hang on there i'm in here too corner ahead through here and keep the speedo oh blindly victor's on the phone keep it tight kid victor said you're still frankie's driving is exceptional as always but uh why did i just catch a glimpse of another frankie relaxing in his trailer with a mug of lemon tea oh that was a dummy this is a stunned dummy gotta go victor bye hey i always have a role in the movies i make i was pursuing beast number two in the one we made in the uk the one that ran into the walls i love that very funny captain silent protagonist now drive so nicely done it's good to be working with you again frankie oh too close by half let's get this done kid we have a small problem on vanguard meet me and frankie when you can [Music] turn right you have arrived at your destination the director was asking why i'm not doing my lines in the stunt sequences don't worry about it frankie i'll cover for you hey kid you're ready for the next set sure what's the stunt scene 95 highway escape action talk me through this what's my motivation so it's a race basically i'm gonna outrun the pursue car i can explain mike and that is an excellent accent frankie uh you have hidden dabs this is an escape of course the self-replicating control system is intent on stopping you it has commandeered a pursuit vehicle you must escape it if it helps imagine the pursuit vehicle has a number of hilarious lines of dialogue that's even emerging as the true star of this movie you voice a little bit uh [Music] [Music] well done this is gonna look great and there we go that's done only one more stunt to do i'll call you when we're set up [Music] hey kid next scene set up maybe with the stunt unit [Applause] it's time to expand what are we doing next [Music] couldn't agree more i'll tell alex the title [Applause] [Music] you have arrived at your destination right this is the last shot we need to get should be easy what could go wrong scene 107 takes it offload stunt sequence action right we've got other stunt drivers in traffic vehicles dodge and weave and get to the destination as quick as you can [Music] i [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] and this is where we bring the pieces together past present future messages and themes come across the franchise coming together not resolved never resolved don't worry about all that past present themed stuff let's just get this done before he rumbles us [Music] [Music] turn right in 100 meters turn right [Music] turn around [Music] turn around when it is safe to do so [Music] coming up on the destination now just get there there we go cut and print it there stunt units are wrapped on vanguard force 10. it's up to victor in the editing booth now he's not the type of director to change his mind or ask for re-suits or anything like that right mike's going off the deep end something about product placement can you drop by easy frankie i'm on my way [Music] there's a new scene apparently we need to take advantage of the presence of a major cultural event to root the story in the zeitgeist uh zai what now get in the car kid i'll explain scene one or three um something at the festival glory kid straight through the festival hear the jumps apparently the scene's got to go right through the middle of a race or something tell scott tyler not to flop his lines this time wait wait we've got the festival in the movie and scott tyler's got lines that's right kid up through here head for the ramp cue the drivers you scott no stop duck duck there are cars on the track going the wrong way this is dramatic and unexpected got tired by the way we let him write his own lines here we go there's cars coming the other way so watch it that was close what now this is very improvised [Music] you're doing good now out the far side keep the speed up victor wanted frankie to drive this [Music] [Applause] [Music] so there we go that has to be enough for him right right kid we're back in it get here when you can another stuff i'll be right there turn around in 400 meters you will arrive at your destination hi there so i just got off the phone with the director and he wants one more stunt and not just any stunt he wants me to jump across the bay being chased by a cargo plane and there's dialogue all over it so no driver swapping i think it's time we fessed up to victor hang on if we can't swap drivers why don't we swap cars with one waiting in the motorway tunnel right i need props and another hero car do we even have another hero car yes we do the one that was too fast for anyone to drive i'll get it ready over at the bridge i'll do the first section and you take over at the tunnel we can do this frankie just drive casual now frankie it is time we must close the loop combine the dimensions and transform this conflict into art got a bad feeling about this cc you are being torn apart from the inside it's almost as if there is another alex cobalt straining fighting to take control understand and find go go quick i can't act and drive at the same time the plane's spinning up get to the airfield go go go the car's a bit of a handful this is the high power what victor asked for but we've never used so uh enjoy whoa this thing can move [Applause] uh we need a line here i think uh frankie would you provide something for me please i have to return to the future cc you capture the conflict perfectly [Applause] i love my life [Applause] not bad i mean i have a few notes what frankie said just hit that jump but not the plane i love my life [Applause] and cut you did it we did it we actually bleeding did it amazing both of you i couldn't tell from watching the feeds amazing work great driving and i mean reasonable acting too that bmw is a 2002 turbo very rare get down here [Music] hi no storms in the horizon just yet lo siento while we're waiting how would you like to throw a desert flyer around some sand dunes might as well now let's demonstrate some physics no i should say i've also set up some important scientific equipment for you great more things for me to smash well if you must i'm sure we could use the data perfecto the loss of traction can cause a phenomenon you call oversteer an effective demonstration of newton's third law this is excellent practice for driving in poor visibility you mean if there's a sandstorm when there is a sandstorm my friend i have seen the satellite pictures trust me clearly this is a lesson on the shape of a pharah hola [Music] [Music] commonly known as the kangaroo skill [Music] ah the numbers are looking good show me more andale excellente i'll get the numbers to the university and the video to my friends at horizon pienecho be ready for the call according to the weather service it's going to be a big one ah count me in oh i will call you soon the dry conditions in the baja region wind increasing this is it my friend this is it get down here i'm coming i'm coming [Music] [Applause] you have arrived at your destination [Music] one i got here as fast as i could i'm not fast enough they get in those vamonos this storm is forming over there winds up to 110 kilometers per hour and can't you go any faster sure what do we do when we get there you know science let's just get there there it is the sandstorm full speed ahead straight into the middle okay are you sure cc did the university equipped us with sensors we'll be gathering data the whole way are you lost or are you smashing things on purpose going this fast what we can see making superstars proud okay if our data is correct we have to take it off road so [Music] um [Music] [Music] you can't get much closer to a sandstorm that we just got my friend with our data the university will be able to track weather patterns much more accurately so drivers can avoid sandstorms in the future why would you avoid them they're awesome so [Music] you have arrived at your destination okay we'll check out el arco de cabo san lucas and see if it matches the book let's get there fast you've read my mind so there they're there down onto the beach but the book says we found the statue by the ark looking out across the pacific in the warm light of the setting sun hmm i don't see it huh well let's get some lunch and try back later in the day [Music] oh boy i told you that was the best place to eat around here was i wrong aye okay we need to get going can you get us to the beach before the sun sets you may not run the sun yep i think i can do that even with the extra helping of tres leches [Music] [Music] my definitely out running the sun now down to an article before we lose the light and get your camera ready there it is right in the sun where the book said grab a picture of it right that is freaking me out it's right there how did we miss it the shadows were really deep just here earlier maybe we just didn't see it but now i really want to see if we can find any more of these mysterious statues [Music] whatever you all i've been reading the diary over and over i think lady sydney's exposition came inland but i say no it's hard to find the evidence hey champion sorry to interrupt your hall of fame chase but we need to pick an adventure you wait till you see this showcase i have the train and conductor on standby all i need now is driver in 200 meters the expedition must have traveled upriver i still can't believe this i used to take the book to me escuela and my teachers told me lady wolverstone's adventures were as fictional as pedro paramo or sherlock holmes so she never got any credit never asked for any she said she was writing stories for her grandchildren but if they're true our story deserves to be told and you and i can prove it let's go we can start in the center of town and move outwards [Music] [Music] lady sydney writes at a local bruja a wise woman said the statues were only visible on certain days in the rain because they are statues of zlaloc i still think it's the trees hiding it but call me when you work out the next location okay hey emilo haley called to ask about the promo shots but when i told her about the diary she said they could wait come pick me up we need to go to awasul i'll be right over [Music] in 100 meters turn right [Music] recalculating route 100 meters turn left have arrived at your destination ready to head for aguasur we might get a little wet i'll keep the windows closed okay okay okay uh let me translate this part [Music] cool waters of aguas quenched our thirst and inspired our hearts in the heart of the blue water is where we found them are we looking for more than one statue and in the heart of the blue water what does that mean so the question is why was the diary of lady sydney wolverstone published as fiction she was really here she she really had aventuras all over mexico maybe she didn't want to be famous or maybe she didn't think anybody would believe her [Music] it will turn off the road near the waterfalls [Music] so [Applause] hmm [Music] [Music] oh the pictures are good and you know having pictures means no one can doubt us if we can find the statues again hey champion festival setup is looking pretty good right i don't know i think we have a few more adventures in us and you want to put a bow on your hall of fame run right [Music] this is big i have our next lead meet me as soon as you can [Music] you've arrived at your destination i found more of lady sydney's papers or regional drafts of el camino she made pencil sketches of formations that i recognized in the valle de la ranas and she sketched one of the statues lead the way okay okay so uh fantastic creatures carved in rock and she found the statue early one morning and get this it was after a rainstorm and this is another statue of slalom that is interesting let's see if we can find it valley of the frog so i always thought the stones looked more like fantastical creatures and ladies it needs to do she got sketches in her book explorers like lady sydney came all this way with nothing but ghanas for the wilds of mexico she sounds like someone i know i shoot cars for the festival you do all the work and my ride is a lot faster than her wagons no we have slightly more than one horsepower oh my suppose reading el diario is one of the reasons i became una photographer i wanted to capture the same vegeta she did [Music] is one of the most visited natural wonders in mexico lady sydney definitely knew a marvel when she saw one but the guy books don't say anything about talks that you hear [Music] turn right [Music] i cross-referenced the final pages of the book with all the other papers i could find and it's egg balaam it has to be lady sydney wolverstone's expedition headed south to egg malam i've been to ekbalan i know the way it was only properly studied in the 90s but we know very little about it actually in fact researchers are divided on exactly how much of what we know about the tortex is historical and how much is aztec legend so why are we going to egg balance and not tiller wolverstone's book doesn't call it igbala of course but she describes a large group of buildings perhaps 20 or more and a large oval palace and listen to this three large statues of the sort i have found in other places three i'm pretty sure i only got two no that's not all she also wrote the third largest of them in the same stone i have come to recognize laid to the south of the complex only fairly visible in the driving rain let's get there before the rain stops then [Music] [Applause] [Music] so me [Music] [Music] [Applause] it's been fun though i do feel like there should have been treasure at the end of it when maybe the treasure was the friends so that's that there's one more thing according to the book woolverson took a jade statue from the site but lost it in the flash flood i'll try and work out where that was i'll call you as soon as i know now i'm intrigued cool mia hey champion you know what time it is where to next [Music] one juggernaut coming right up i'll tell jade to make it a good one hola amigo i went to a drag race meetup last night and i talked to some mechanicals about the latest rumors i think you're gonna like this one yes you did it horizon rush is complete now if you'll excuse me i have a date with several drips [Music] [Applause] i am gonna set the ultimate trailblazer room actually i'm gonna stick down two gates and you're gonna set the ultimate room it'll be wicked [Music] you have arrived at your destination all right let's get going the sun's setting but we have enough time to get there along the beach i'm excited do you think we'll find it to be honest i don't know but i'm getting the sense that there's more to mexico than meets the eye hmm [Music] did you know sydney wolverstone was also a um a natural historian and a pretty decent artist you want to talk about las mara villas de mexico just read about your life [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] the book describes several sites for sydney wolverstone found statues she believed they weren't aspect though which is interesting because they look tall deck to me but even that isn't really clear we know so little about the doltech about the whole pre-conquest era in fact there are so many undiscovered sites so much forgotten history in mexico so many things we don't know about the people who've lived here for thousands of years so [Applause] [Music] there it is ah interesting the design doesn't seem entirely acidic but it does remind me of flallock the rain god this is amazing i'll work out where the next one should be and give you a call where does the trail lead from here south and england i'm sure of it i'll be in touch [Music] you
