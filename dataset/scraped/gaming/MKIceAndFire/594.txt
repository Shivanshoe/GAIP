[Music] [Applause] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] a robot someone must have created it to stop godzilla i know it's a robot but i can feel a strong positive energy from it [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] oh no there can't be another godzilla [Music] we're picking up a strong signal it's heading to the surface what is this godzilla [Music] we cannot determine whether it is the same godzilla as in our records what does godzilla want oh no not the generator [Music] it must be the g energy generator it's the only explanation as to why he chose to come ashore in this area we discovered g energy because of him but it turns out the stuff is his favorite meal maybe godzilla holds a grudge after all the reason he was born in the first place was oh forgive me i spoke out of turn it's fine we need to consider all lines of thinking here [Music] we are going to disaster level one we must protect our country moving to commence level one response ma'am [Music] something's happening to godzilla something's happening to godzilla what is it [Music] godzilla's body temperature is rising fast the only explanation is that his internal organs are experiencing mass instability due to consuming too much g energy in a short span of time if this continues a g-energy explosion is inevitable [Music] the explosion is likely to reach the upper atmosphere and cause a cataclysmic event of global proportions the released highly concentrated g energy will disperse over the entire planet damaging nature and people to an immeasurable degree we must do everything in our power to prevent this occurrence but what can we actually do to stop it we could freeze him freeze him yes g-force possesses freeze missiles firing them all at godzilla would freeze him and lower his body temperature momentarily and thus largely suppressing the damage it's our best shot what are the chances it'll work it's worth a try at least the problem is our weaponry has been largely destroyed in battle we're unsure if we can perform at optimum levels and then there's the question of what to do after we freeze godzilla knowing our limits is half the battle we must concentrate on stopping that explosion we are unanimous take us to maximum disaster level we're on the verge of extinction [Music] understood contacting all g-force units as we speak ma'am we've used every damn trick we've got it's out of our hands now fire freeze missiles at will these should freeze godzilla and deplete his atomic energy so [Music] [Music] you
