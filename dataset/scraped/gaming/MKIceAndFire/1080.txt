[Music] [Music] yep [Music] i've never seen a samurai fight like that it was nothing you are more than a samurai he is a vengeful spirit back from the grave to slaughter the mongols where do we hide now [Music] you don't fire up a forge and get back to making strong komatsu weapons that's how we fight back that's how we'll save lord shimra [Music] vengeful spirit i think they liked it [Music] i read that samurai follow a path of honor which is one of the many differences between us hmm then why have my men found their brothers stabbed in the back lord zakai would never resort to such tactics war brings out who we truly are it has made you a dog unleashed by your cousin kublai to rape and pillage at his command your nephew strays from the warriors path you will become what you hate unless you join my empire's fight for peace you don't want allies you want soldiers to overthrow the shogun consider my offer help your nephew regain his honor before his cowardice goes too far and before i bring you his head i can't free my uncle until tucker finishes what he's working on i should see if yuna has any news you
