the same frost both written off and underestimated together we'll surprise them all cronica has offered me a body like yours don't be a fool take it show me it's worth how did you become khan i was my father's rightful heir but too weak to hold the throne is your tribe missing something you know what you stole and that you will never retrieve it you are feared among them so my visit did not go unnoticed you shed so much blood how could it the noble token warrior make no mistake you are a monster you despise me for being half targarten for being a remorseless killer molina did baraka and katana get busy such a coupling is impossible earthrealmer where there's a will there's a way your flesh looks tempting yeah you're not the first to want a piece of me i'll have more than one cage no way hot lips no dice no you reject me cage i like leading ladies not femmes fatale we both despise devorah that doesn't mean we're making a buddy picture just think of the possibilities your army plans to invade outworld that's none of your goddamn business i will have answers played pledge fealty to shel khan's daughter whatever you do nothing [ __ ] on your knees earthrealmer your empire picked the wrong fight you could choose to negotiate your surrender do i look like i came to bargain shao khan can't be far behind you and there's nothing in your arsenal that can stop him two words [ __ ] nuclear weapons so technically you're katana's sister at least until i end her life thank god i'm an only child who the hell thought you were a good idea i was born from the mind of shane that [ __ ] is not right in the head for that i will devour your flesh remember me cassandra seriously your death still gives me nightmares yours were not trouble me at all tell me how to defeat liu kang

have shanks soon to thank for you who else but the great sorcerer reason number 5000 that man is on my [ __ ] list now there's a face i didn't need to see no you don't appreciate me jax woman you scared the crap out of me you've changed since we last met i have regained my soul and my humanity neither is an improvement scorpion you choose enemies poorly you're right this will be too easy earning hellfire molina clones are worse than cyberlink quay why so vehement scorpion you are perversion of nature you have no claim on the linque your clan swore itself to my father years ago that was before i became grand master when did you become an earth realm champion when i returned the lin quay to the righteous path it will be a short journey sub-zero oh you're so cold to me sub-zero because you are utterly devoid of honor who needs honor when you have power how did you escape scorpion the fool ninja was all smoke and no fire you do not dare besmirch him we have met before in the nether realm where i consumed your soul i'll have back what is my race my father has already taught tains me it makes me the perfect warrior the perfect savage perhaps death calls for you again this time it leaves disappointed you will succumb to the inevitable didn't lose a wink after watching you die nor will i after eviscerating your corpse and that right there is why come play with me briggs are you talking combat or something else either way i'll be satisfied does katana know you're back not yet i will visit her soon that's not happening molina where are your friends jacqueline if they followed orders at a minimum safe distance nowhere is safe from me [Music] where is your loyalty with kitana empress of outworld she will relinquish my throne join us against the emperor and forever courtesy to my sister better kitana's partner than shao khan slave you reek with desire submit to the [ __ ] rakatan your blood is ours not his this is you who will need saving thunder god accept my mercy or face my wrath i will kill you to glorify shao khan your father is a false god molina blasphemer i'll carve out your tongue liu kang believes that i am katana you will cease your cruel deception only after i've broken his heart you betray katana i will take her place raiden not in this timeline or the next you want someone to blind look in the mirror my only mistake was trusting you

once sought my affection i thought you were katana my mistake oh who says we can't share a few thrills now what's got you all ripped snorting back when i gained the throne you abandoned it was no pay

shao khan why should i genuflect to a clone because my father wills it where is tonya's body that knowledge is not for sale at any price then you are useless to me collector what is your point i whisper in father's ear and your people die you'll pay a high price for threatening the coastal's theft of your throne was ruined this you didn't lift a finger to help me regain it i have not want to squander assets you would have me make peace there is no virtue in sibling rivalry katana's my enemy not my rival i see the fire in your eyes molina cronica altered our deal pray she does not alter it further cronica has a plan for me obey her and she will provide no one comes before my father your dual nature is cronica's gift but it was shang who created me whom do you think inspired him why do you protect katana because one day she may come to her senses she is lost to us and must die daughter welcome you accept me as katana's sister as her replacement should you pass this test you disappoint me malina how have i offended you mother the shaolin monk still lives you
