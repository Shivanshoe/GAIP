you remember nothing i taught you what are you even going on the suicide mission for anyway because i believe there's a better world out there somewhere doesn't matter where we go we'll still be there to [ __ ] it up yeah well with that attitude we got one shot at this let's be honest anyone who follows me out there today is probably gonna die and we'll all be home for christmas how do i keep getting myself into this [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh need to fix the purifier what's the point huh the truck is [ __ ] worry about that later let's reseal the door don't go out there just wait for me you picked a great time to show up so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] yes doesn't end this way it can't is that what your magic [ __ ] fairy vision said because it sure as hell doesn't look like we're getting out of here and what no no no it's okay something happens who the hell are you hey where are you taking us who the hell are you people all your questions will be answered when we reach dr scurlock it's too late we're not making it to any doctor stand down or your people will die you [ __ ] die with them i'm not threatening them [ __ ] i'm trying to save them the hell what exactly is in this please please uh do not fear my name is nathan skurlock xenobiologist dr abraham zahidi oh my what an unexpected honor i was a follower of your father's work um at least um as long as possible i haven't uh so much claim to fame as you can see there is one breakthrough of mine that served us rather well just tell us how it works yes yes of course i apologize the fungus wasn't always like this its dna was altered my formula merely tells the fungus against itself here all who are brave enough to reach us are free to live in peace my antidote must be injected daily i us dare stray far away from camp without it we have a small ceremony each month not just in time for one no alternates i'm afraid i hope that the rest of your convoy will attend this evening we're not planning on staying long oh beyond here there's only death until the truck is repaired we're stuck here anyway good thank you look what i found in the forest this was cuthbert's we've been here before well [ __ ] i thought things looked familiar but i thought it was skerlock's drugs but unless you can pull a spare oil pump from your ass we're not going very far we left a truck here before that day the first storm hit maybe i can find it find it that was 30 years ago not for me what the [ __ ] do you want i got a proposition for you might keep you all alive for another day i like to tinker and refurbish my gear exactly how i like it and i'm gonna have a lot of time on my hands while you're out there pretending you're saving the world anything i fix up i'm willing to sell for a fair you want me to pay you to play around with guns hey it's skilled labor and it ain't free if you don't like it don't buy it but i intend to make the most out of this suicide run this has got to be the dumbest idea corrigan's ever had i've been seeing shadow you seen my wife what can i get you the calendar with the knife in it what's the story bad [ __ ] luck is what i'm in trouble this [ __ ] guy i'm in debt too he said i gotta pay by that date or play his game what kind of game if i win he wipes my deck clean i lose bang but no one ever [ __ ] wins this game what the [ __ ] am i gonna do i'm dead either way say maybe you could have a war with him i'll take your place in the game hey outrider just so you get it if you don't have a chat with that gambler someone's gonna come looking for me i'll look around for the guy mercero's in debt to curious to see what his game's about hey shut up just when you think this rotten planet can't get any worse the freaking creatures out there hey you remember my tunes i used to play like it was yesterday i can still remember some of them um please stop please i'm serious um oh ryder you wouldn't believe how much i've learned from dr scurlock here don't get distracted that's not what we're here for but part of the reason we're here in the first place is to find a way out of the trenches for everyone what if we brought the antidote back to shira we'd also bring the summary execution of everyone who makes the they're deserters remember oh yes i haven't considered that so ah hey you got a plan what we're gonna do about all these deserters we're not doing anything with them bailey are you kidding me these people abandoned the eca they're traitors we're sticking with the mission you can go back to corrigan empty-handed or you can fall in line so alright this is dr scurlock i must profess it has been a delight to have met yourself as your companion we're grateful for the help doctor but i have to ask your antidote to the fungus why do you keep it to yourselves out here our people are trapped in the valley if they knew that yes if they knew think about it what's the first thing they would do they would be so afraid of the other side getting it they'd have to be locked up war is all they know how to think about those narrow-minded tribal idiots out here it's different we are all free we don't live in fear of our neighbors stood in our throats men and women allies and enemies here nature the elements are our only enemy sounds too good to be true well it's we do what we can do resources are scarce but you and your companions may stay as long as you need the one who dragged your friend from the underworld i will be handling your induction induction as i told scurlock we're just passing through scurlock has no say in who stays or leaves i'm in command of the camp security sure but this camp wouldn't exist without scurlock in his vaccine and squirrel wouldn't exist without my soldiers so so [Music] [Music] ah [Applause] so ah so um so jacob i found the truck what's it look like exactly as we left it there's something in common get that oil pop will you okay i've got the pump for the truck good now hurry back this meathead kang hasn't stopped giving me the side eye screw till they push back then loosen a little hey you forget everything i taught you taught me you think you taught me anything old man unbelievable feisty she definitely got her temper from you looks like we're taking a break i guess you've earned the right to hear the full story so uh a long time ago before this shitty planet before we even left earth i was flying workers to the caravel orbit station and the flames started to surround me and i tried to find an exit and that's when i tripped and i saw this damn pregnant woman lying under the [Music] rubble i was able to save both of us well siri hold on you were there during the careful disaster all the survivors of the caraval were given a free ticket aboard the brand new flores and i met her again right here in trench town her child was born it was a girl and she named her chanda then that little brand was only six when she saw her mother killed right in front of her so you raised her go on the truck isn't going to fix itself [Music] hey yakum that was a sweet story back there but it still doesn't explain why chana hates your guts why do you think i didn't ask to be a father in a [ __ ] like this you know what the survival rate is for kids but turned out i was wrong little girl managed to grow up after all who knows maybe you did her a favor if you hadn't been such a bastard she wouldn't have gotten tough enough to survive yeah you go and tell her that she'll love you for it this isn't gonna take the win i told you last night you keep your distance i look around for the guy mercero's in debt to curious to see what his game's about jenna jacob told me what happened between you did he tell you how my mother died i'm sorry no kid should have to see that even better i saw it twice the first time in a vision you know i tracked down jacob begged him to come back cause he wasn't there in the vision when she died i thought if he was there maybe it wouldn't come true but jacob doesn't listen to anything i say almost got eaten in the forest yesterday outrider if i may as an altered you are not allowed to join our ceremony due to scientific complexity but rest assured your presence in our humble camp is appreciated i personally oversaw preparations for your private hat there's a place to rest food even a bottle of something special you'll find it by the stairs to the ceremony few make it out this far alive even less mean to keep going what is it you're looking for friend i'm not your friend you don't know what's out there there are things i could tell you things i could warn you about but you would not believe these things and what makes you so sure because the things i've seen even i do not believe them [Music] that was skurlock's little ceremony how was it it was weird a bunch of rambling speeches about brotherhood we all pick stones from a basket and hey there is music and free drugs so not all bad where zahidi went off with scurlock talking some science mumbo jumbo well he'll be back no he won't your friend picked the black stone what are you talking about you're taking him to the facility get me out of here i'll lead you tahiti where are you tahiti do you copy [ __ ] you know i would scurlock makes his antidote here very few know what goes on inside and how do you i used to help him make it until he took a friend of mine prisoner skurlock has his laboratory here but it's kang and his soldiers who run this stronghold they will not welcome you kindly just tell me what they want with the heat nothing good you need to hurry before it's too late stop hey how you doing i'd like to see dr zahidi please this facility is off limits you will not get a second warning sound the alarm [Music] what's up i mean so all things have been considered so so you'll be holding your friend there people that's what they injected us with he needed bone marrow for the antidote to work all those people who escaped the war came here to die instead and i was next you think that was easy for me doctor it's random it has to be ah except for you safe from your own lottery i suppose how convenient i create the antidote i'll keep us alive how many exactly have you sacrificed for your little utopia i am not a monster i carry the burden a few must be sacrificed so many can live what are you going to choose who lives and dies i don't hide behind a basket of stones when i kill a man he knows it was me take as much as you can carry you didn't have to kill him he was a man of science there's so few of us left he was a self-righteous murderer what does that make me then his antidote god help me we're still gonna use it you haven't yet seen anything oh august oh my god is that a native of enoch i found august out there lost and alone i tried to give shelter but skurlock only saw a specimen to experiment on this this changes everything no more it can august it's all right they're not like the others they're friends okay you're free now go home [Music] get dr zahidi back to my truck your alien friend just disappeared august does not disappear so much as moving ways we cannot perceive we need to get out of here i know a back exit through the caves i can lead us out to safety get zahidi out safe i'm going back out the front door to deal with kang's new [Applause] arrivals i won't have to worry about [Music] this crowd outrider we made it out to the convoy your new friend knows this area very well i think he can be trusted we are ready to go or should we see if anyone else out there wants to kidnap tahiti first funny i'm on my way outrider take it you're here for a reason our cam's beginning to panic nobody will be mourning scurlock but without the antidote we're not going to be able to last long there's a large stash in the lab we only took what we needed i know it's there i assisted dr scurlock in his work what's there won't last long there may be something we can do that the doctor would have never been willing to risk for so long our only contact with those beyond the forest was deceit and death you understand that the antidote requires a steady supply of human flesh but there's one thing that they haven't said he's fly beyond the forest it's the dead you're proposing a trade bodies of dead soldiers we harvest their spinal fluid and in return we share the antidote there are those who will never forgive what you've been a part of i know but if we share what we make maybe we can start to make amends there is still one problem the sap of the toka tree it's the hardest ingredient to obtain thiago used to be the only one capable of it but now that he's part of your party well this should be interesting how many exactly have attempted this little run at the forest before us seven seven expeditions some long ago before we even knew what we were dealing with the most recent about five years ago and they knew they knew exactly what was waiting for them out there and they still went you remember anything about earth i remember a road runner in this uh coyote i remember laughing so much and couldn't stop it's amazing to think they kept playing cartoons right to the end i mean my whole generation we went to school we played games online we hung out with our friends knowing we wouldn't grow up well you did yeah i grew up to see most people i know die grew up a refugee with bombs falling every night and yet i still feel guilty chana's visions are they real her and her [ __ ] visions you know i have visions all the time too i have visions of [ __ ] sucking my long john silver but it never happens shun what the hell did you see in there a real alien my god we'll have to report this to gootman believe we've been next to an alien civilization all these years in this case aren't we the aliens these ruins are ancient if beings like the ones we saw sent the signal it wasn't from here are you sure we're still heading in the right direction honestly outright or i don't know but if you can get a receiver above this tree line we should be close enough to pick up the trail again i know of a structure give me a radio i can guide you [Music] [Music] you
