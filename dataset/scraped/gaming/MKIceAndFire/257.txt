[Music] ritual must be starting soon good question bud how do we know we could even stop something this powerful [Music] probably a question for the bug lady too bad she ditched us to save her people she knows what she's doing or when he was in his promise drax said magus was eating my soul and anything that eats can die right that don't sound too scientific wish to poison his food supply yeah we're the food supply so no we'll kill it the old-fashioned way [Music] is [Music] this won't hurt [Music] on this craze might want to dodge those next times really starting to take me off [Music] [Music] do your this poor goons got brain security detail that's a lot of brain powder yeah that stuff will turn your airway to sludge gray lung they call it good thing i've got my mask oh that won't help them particles are so fine they're already seeping right in you probably already got the gray ones lungs are already gray and you know that i have seen them many times [Music] tracks little help people readily uh i have brain chunks stuck between the ridges and my boots set her down bud what are you doing that's the way we came i'll be quick i've been thinking yeah the nobodies look out for themselves but they're also paranoid that's an understatement so maybe at the first sight of trouble some of them jumped in their ships and got out you underestimate their greed they could promise us power and eternal life over here hurry i move as swiftly as is necessary well you know i was just messing with you what's that there ain't no such thing as grey lung oh yeah i know oh you so fell for it grey long did you guys know careful this place is practically falling apart could be all of nowhere looks like this soon it'll get back on its feet the giant head does not have heat it used to so they just up and left all this once they discovered the cortex it group think you can get me up there right about there this seems important i want to get a look from up high this place smells weird it's the brains go sour if it sits too long it smells like metal and i don't know something else korea what's that a waste product of a large mexican slug i'm not sure slug piss is exactly what i was thinking of it's unmistakable one shiny upgrade nice and crafted no got a crick in my back because of that intensified that's one way of putting it it is an accurate statement well it don't help none oh what have they done to you what my baby you uh okay rocket no i ain't okay the cortex nowhere what's gonna happen to this place this filthy dump of cheap booze and shady units is the closest thing i got to a home yeah the millennial's great but a ship ain't the same this isn't the first time someone's tried to take over nowhere and it won't be the last we've still got cosmo on our side once we give the church the boot he'll whip this place back into shape hopefully not too good a shape thanks quilt birds to see all my investments go up in smoke what investments couple seed fundings into illegal weapons research funneled some units into goon training couple of bats you had units this whole time no they were invested minor hiccup we need to consider how do we even shut down the cortex now that it's all supercharged yeah there ain't going to be an easy off button on that thing any chance you can hack it we ain't talking about some junky appliance this is the flark and continuum cortex one of the most powerful artifacts in the known universe the cortex isn't the problem here it's the flark nerds who've hijacked it we take them down and the cortex is just a machine with nobody at the wheel you know there is a wheel i saw no wheel there ain't no wheel but i don't like the idea of just leaving that thing powered up with cursed we should focus on them faith conduits i'm betting they all route through the same junction that's gonna be the weakness oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh guys huddle up [Music] what a blast i haven't felt this excited since the galactic war better watcher out there quill she fought on both sides remember whereas me i don't need to take sides to mow anybody down i just love making scumbusters go boom [Music] okay okay i get it those creeps out there fight them gets the blood pumping oh yeah but if you listen to that pumping too hard your heart takes a dive and the losing starts stay on target and we'll make them all go boo who's with me i can't wait to take him down time [Music] poster we can't keep getting pulled into skirmishes like we have any choice they shoot we shoot all right group let's make a bridge of our own watch out for quakes man i really hope warlock makes it to the finish line no goldie ain't counting on us to him we're just a bunch of scut soil in his seen what fancy can do all right easy now so once we get nikki we wait for warlock to catch up and the bug lady our plan requires a great many people you said saving the galaxy would be easy i do not recall anyone making that claim let's just take it one thing at a time get nikki and stop this fulfillment thing how pragmatic of you try not to count my chickens before they hatch that would be counting eggs careful catch a little whoa peter do you want to do the honors totally watch this surprise do not know should be divided between here stick it to a group we need to bring him in for an emergency landing i am trying to [Music] need to destroy what the guardians of the galaxy are all about [Music] feels like i could aim in any direction and hit something [Music] don't be mad if i accidentally put a couple of rounds [Music] the servant i got all these toys i'm just dying to use [Music] i will denounce feels like i've been shooting that big butt for hours we need to focus on taking it down [Music] put him down now the true battle begins everyone ready game face is on i have only one face we'll put it in meme mode done what's everybody thinking i'm thinking if goldie didn't finish him off already i got a grenade with raker's name on it engraving an explosive is imprudent keep an eye out for nikki we get her away from these wackos then worry about finding warlock mantis and whoever else i have faith your spawn will be saved peter quill let's not use the f word we're not going to lose her again [Music] everyone quiet what did they do to the cortex nikki they strapped her to their flark and machine and they're making the hand direct all the galaxy's faith energy right into it fulfillment has begun we gotta get her out of there but how free of the hand and they lose power i count four cables let's pull them out turn them off we need to get vicki out of here feel this is i mean ready [Music] what's next peter on these fools why do you have to be so high [Music] and let's get to it [Music] [Music] roof man [Music] i might need some help um [Music] [Music] nikki it's okay i got you [Music] why do you insist on ruining everything if you won't join me then just stay away this is why i don't have kids nikki this isn't gonna end how you think says who you i saw what you did you shouldn't want to take it back i can feel the light inside me the promise will be fulfilled she not realize her plan has been thwarted a minor setback isn't that right grand unifier [Music] the cortex was meant merely to ease the burden on you matriarch we shall retreat please give me an excuse to kill is this him the first divine vessel a pale shadow to your magnificence matriarch let him watch me do what he could not i'll draw faith across the entire galaxy myself if i have to if you think you can handle i'll handle whatever it takes nick damn it they ain't getting far i got a tracker on golden boy's butt you what yeah i tagged him back on the bridge in case he ditched us again we just got to get back to the milano rocket don't ever change tracker's online confirming goldie's on the dashed and sacroscope seatbelts everyone we're going in hot crap hold on hold on got him alpha hercules system inside the keystone asterism got it coordinates are in not getting away this time power down power down yeah nova core the world mine must [Music] [Music] well can't say we didn't try nikki's in there somewhere there's got to be a way yes we overpower them with our own vastly superior fleet regrettably we do not have one guys we do our best work when we're out of options somebody's got to have something rocket anything what about the ravagers you could ask for temporary troops yondu's rotting away in the kiln thanks to me you could bust them out jail break the kiln i'd rather take my chances with the church fleet i'll bust him out yeah i'd bet on gamora so would i but it doesn't matter the rest of the ravage are scattered during the war any survivors are laying low or serving time in one of a dozen backwater planets besides what's a pirate without a ship drax [Music] you have royal blood perhaps it is time for the prince of spartax to return and rally his people you've been to spartax lately i have not but sparta technology is well beyond spar tax was sacked during the war because of its tech you can't even land there anymore [Music] groot and no bad ideas yeah that's a bad idea we're not going to the shatari that is the kind of wild card we're looking for just not that one the snakes would shoot us in the back i'm assuming they don't shoot us in the front gamora thoughts maybe earth has heroes that can help us those guys in the pajamas mighty pajamas trust me earth hasn't caught up to everybody just yet we need somebody with a fleet [Music] hold on what if the answer's been slobbering right in front of us this entire time peter this beast cannot operate a ship that's that's not what i'm saying think about it cami's pretty much useless to us but she's also useless to the church they want people to brainwash i bet animals aren't even on their radar they went after cosmo cosmo's mind is way more advanced than ours his intelligence makes him weak to the promise just like rocket thanks but not an animal what i'm saying is we know someone with an entire beast army and i bet raker hasn't even looked twice at her how can you be certain she is not one of them [Music] no she's good you do realize she still wants to flay us and feed us to her babies guys this is it okay our one last long shot we've got to find a way to apologize and make things right okay we'll we'll get her a gift a peace offering i ain't going back in a cage no think bigger way bigger the one beast that you want more than any other drax knows what i'm talking about oh yes oh no no no no you know where we're going to battle the legendary fin fang boom yeah we're totally going to fly into that aren't they say that the rings of machu 4 perpetually rain fire down upon the godless abominations that dwell below how fun i'm sure it's worse than it looks too it is any of my people braved this same treacherous pilgrimage before me never to return show off hey if you got it [Music] stabilizers are shocked repair systems are overloaded if we are destined to crash try at least to crash into finfeit boom nobody's crashing oh we're crashing these peaks are treacherous peter quill i know i know i'm doing my best are you dear fears i'm yelling watch out for the thing peter wait hey pretty sure she needs all the things watch out for the thing yeah i got it glorious how are you enjoying this uh okay oh a little bumpy but we're all okay [Music] right and we're laughing that's good it's just it's perfect this is us this is how we push well this is not quote parks anyways oh [Laughter] oh this is insane this is how we park yeah whoa that definitely shouldn't be sparking we can worry about that after we catch our dragon and convince lady hellbender to help us bust the church a new one before setting out on our quest let us rouse our spirits with a cataption battle anthem what like now you know what flark it let's do it listen closely ancient cataption is a powerful tongue with words that hold great meaning follow as i lead the melody soul really we're doing this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] mark [Music] [Music] oh [Music] what does that last line mean drax sold out flander garth it means we will be victorious what'll it be this time confetti jet boots hey star-scud i hope you appreciate me more after all that finally found a way out of this mess cammy all thanks to you milano isn't going to self-destruct or anything while we're gone right how many times do i gotta tell you the ship probably ain't equipped with self-destruct systems all set to take on film rocket they say that a single one of his claws is bigger than a fully grown man considering how those legends about hellbender turned out that dragon's probably as tall as groot oh good buddy ready for our biggest battle yet he was more worried about us killing each other over the past few cycles i knew this day would come i was destined to battle the dragon lord of kakaran bet you didn't think he'd be fighting him with this team of a-holes i did not i'm thankful fate has granted me this honor [Music] we're gonna pull this off i know it of course we have to for nikki ever fought a dragon before sounds fun actually not only in the arcade that's good enough right despite your best efforts you are an honorable man peter quill thanks drax all right let's do this shivering tit which is cold that's not really how that saying goes you want to correct me or you want to find thing fang boom and save the galaxy i want finn fan food and the galaxy saving thing i guess assuming hellbender even goes for this maybe hellbender will go for it okay well i ain't seeing no phone poop we should look for katathian hunt markers testaments to the bravery legends of glorious death well as long as it's glorious rocks there is only one noble way to die on markle iv and so many of my people before us someone remind tracks we ain't come here to die no one's dying we're taking fume alive we're handing them over to lady hellbender alive and we're getting here to help us take on the church's armada on this planet of ours the armada part is where we die maybe but definitely not before that go team oh these cliffs grow increasingly unstable with every impact perfect the sky is literally falling here looks like a dead end glorious dead end gotta admit i kind of love how excited you are about all this all right drax let's channel some of that excitement toward this rock great drags just shattered the skull of the thing we're supposed to capture bye bye galaxy you have nothing to fear they say that his bones cannot be crushed see nothing to fear brute says he wants to take it all in take your time buddy might be your last chance to take anything in think fumes in there if fantasy books taught me anything it's that dragons love to hang out inside mountains groot wants to know if those books said anything about catching dragons i'm sure it had something to do with teamwork and trust you can't remember the details because you didn't read the whole thing i read a lot of different dragon books okay and there was always a mountain and the good guys always win ain't no one writing a book about us i think i see something up ahead does it have big scary claws look my people were here didn't we see these in drax's memories when mantis linked us all together [Music] that's a lot of brave katathians after thanos raised catath my people were left broken physically and mentally their exodus led many of them here in great numbers uh so how many of these hunters came back none they were all victims of thing food not victims they came for the ultimate battle a truly glorious death they came here wanting to die didn't they most cataptions believe that in order to reach paradise you must live a life filled with purpose failure to achieve this results in banishment to sardoth the bad place that is not a place is non-existence kind of like what's going to happen to the whole galaxy if the church gets its way indeed okay we can't make quick work of this thing and we got no right going after [Music] make them hurt guys huddle up [Music] yes celebrate this moment my friends victory shall soon be ours shall carve our name in the history books peter quill and it will not be spelled incorrectly [Music] look i know we want to celebrate because we're maybe two steps away from winning this fight but we start dancing before we actually win these scud holes will send us to our graves so let's keep our focus and show these losers exactly how we rock who's with me fields what is a pimple [Music] that one's tapping out [Music] can you stop with the ice pack puns already yes now bring on finn fight boom okay so on a scale of one to ten how much bigger and stronger and scarier is phone gonna be than the thing we just fought ten thousand that's what i think no one said this was gonna be easy rocket right right but ten thousand times quilt drags is the literal one remember obviously your chances of pulling this off suck a lot but what chance does the galaxy have if we don't pull it off exactly we all saw what the church is capable of no matter what this planet throws at us we're not stopping until we catch boom and lady hellbender is fighting by our side legends say that will himself from one dimension to another gamora i'm thinking i can get a pretty good vantage point from the top of this thing okay just be careful peter i can see the whole crater from up here maybe food's not in the mountain after all maybe he's down there somewhere you tell us i mean if i were a dragon i'd definitely want to stop around down there legends do tell the finn fang foom stalking makuu's greatest caldera good enough for me we can probably work our way around the edge and find a way down perhaps the endless magma ocean of corber is six or the perpetual razor glass storms of celestial prime all right all right could have been worse i need your help drax i whoa get a load of them claw marks got to be fooms right he's even bigger than his legend so yeah when we find him let's avoid the claws [Music] okay i'm thinking this is step one of a multi-step solution to get across this chasm all right what are the next steps still working on that part go ahead gamora hey d lob it certainly where shall i move it that thing drax easily where shall i put it i could clear the rubble from that ledge peter quill i just need something to throw how about quill come on it's not so bad this fleshy frame would make a poor instrument of demolition final step drax if we can topple some of those rocks we got ourselves a pack glorious i swear i've never seen you in such a good mood because you have never seen me on the great hunt before what about our quarantine's own mission you mean our quarantined zone bust that was not the great hunt it was a regular hunt drax i know you've been waiting for this a long time enjoy it man thank you peter quill i must admit that with everything that has happened i need this yeah well maybe if we listen to you from the start and just gone after foom then we'd probably be dead we so weren't ready before i was born ready so are we sure that milano's gonna be okay because if we end up stranded here the milano should be fine i wouldn't worry about it and even if we do end up stranded we shall live like kings off the meat of finn fang foom everyone get ready there's something up ahead i'm pretty sure it's jesus whatever it is [Music] all right more boom food to deal with do not underestimate anything that survives advice [Music] i for one am ready for your videos [Music] [Music] reminds me of you when you eat [Music] uh [Music] so then let's speed things up [Music] though [Music] [Music] okay let's just think things through a moment since when is that a thing we do what if we're too late what if raker finishes what he started in the ritual then we're doing all of this for nothing not for nothing if our final act is to challenge finn fang foom it will be an honorable final act i don't do final acts i'm a survivor let us hope we are not too late all right let's figure out a way to get through we're in a rush apparently [Music] there see more ominous peaks this planet's starting to give me the creeps i keep thinking boom's gonna close from behind finn fang fume is a legendary beast legendary beasts do not claw from behind maybe not but smart ones do mind helping us across my sister used to paint places like this hell worlds frozen landscapes you expect me to believe that nebula scourge of a hundred worlds like the paint pretty pictures they weren't pretty they were sad uses the planet's treacherous surface to test would be adversaries lady hellbender legends all over again well played checkered careful of deadly gas so here's an idea why don't we lure boom into one of these gas caves knock them out i want full credit for the kid for the last time drax we're not killing finn fangbo we're catching him to get the lady hellbender so she forgives us and hopefully helps us [Music] wow i'm impressed you really conquered your fears time for a feat of strength tracks i shall enjoy this [Music] let's see that sword [Music] maybe we can run [Music] loving the initiative [Music] [Laughter] [Music] any ideas gamora i can probably get you up there [Music] this is definitely in drax's wheelhouse i'm not being mean i'm serious i think we can topple it it shall fall nice who will know what hit him will be more resilient than a boulder i know i'm just trying to be positive i think it's a team building thing we require no further team building we are the perfect team yeah we're okay that's high praise coming from murder mom guys there's so much at stake right now i mean if we don't get lady hellbender on our side if we don't find a way to take down raker and his flirt up church we know peter staying positive making the most of this adventure it helps take the edge off by lessening the sense of crushing responsibility we've all taken on here i will miss your terrible speeches peter quill when finn fang fume devours us all you must be fair [Music] this is nothing compared to the legendary teeth and claws you know i'm gonna be really disappointed if he doesn't live up to all the hype assuming we live that long [Music] think it's film more likely it's people great maybe they'll know where he is or they'll attack us on site i could probably infiltrate the camp look for weak links make an example of the right person bleed them out in front of their crew the shock of it will cause confusion or maybe even surrender and we carve through the rest hey uh is everything okay we didn't really talk after your um the killing my sister thing yeah and other tangential topics fine ish okay peter there's a good chance nicki's already lost no i don't accept that and if she is i know i'll be the one expected to make the hard call she's my daughter but i'm the killer we both know that it's not gonna come to that and if it does if it's a choice between her and literally everything else peter you'd do anything for someone you care about and we both know that i we both know that you would as well which is why you're exactly who i need to bring my girl home alive i hope you're right yeah ominous is right here goes kind of amazing also really terrifying hello we're looking for finn fang foom you seen him big wings nasty teeth purple shorts what do you mean purple shorts what i heard he wears purple shorts ancient legends do tell such a thing see [Music] that's gonna hit us [Music] trust me [Music] oh yeah i like this one [Music] let's see those things in action i'm on it [Music] [Music] you
